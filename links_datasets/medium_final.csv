ast week, Tesla held an event focused on their advances in autopilot and what they call ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù. There, nearly three hours into the event, they made the announcement: not only will they have fully autonomous vehicles ready years ahead of the industry‚Äôs best estimates, Tesla expects to have a fleet of one million robotaxis on the road in 2020.This time, there wasn‚Äôt the usual whooping and hollering from the Tesla loyalists. Instead, this was an event for investors. It was a more steadied and almost scholarly affair, with dizzyingly deep dives into the technology powering Tesla‚Äôs self-driving ambitions.And the announcements‚Äîcarrying world-changing ramifications, if the numbers are right‚Äîwere delivered aloud into otherwise pindrop silence. It seemed the collective reaction of those in the room was a furrowed brow. Could Elon be believed? Still, onward he pressed, proclaiming a grand vision as though he‚Äôd only just returned from the future to share what he had seen. Maybe the claims seemed too far-fetched, maybe the event was too long, or perhaps it‚Äôs because the investors at the event were, for the most part, non-technical.As someone in the tech industry myself, I had a hard time keeping up with the swirling Acronym Soup shared by presenters like Pete Bannon, esteemed former-Apple chip designer. But the overall message resonated: Tesla is ahead, they argued, because Tesla has the data. Whereas nearly every competitor is relying on Lidar, Tesla has placed their self-driving bets almost entirely on computer vision. Choosing to rely on cameras and cheap radar + ultrasonics has allowed them to deploy these sensors on every car they‚Äôve sold for the past several years. Having sensors on every vehicle means they‚Äôve been able to collect data from every mile driven from every Tesla produced in the past several years. That‚Äôs a huge number, and it‚Äôs increasing rapidly.Lidar, meanwhile, is power hungry and expensive, adding anywhere from around $7K to $70K to the cost of the vehicle. The upshot is that the major Lidar-based competitors have several hundred cars on the road each, while Tesla has nearly half a million. And machine learning, which is needed for object recognition in any self-driving system, depends on access to mountains of data. In fact, it thrives on it ‚Äî there‚Äôs a direct correlation between how much data you throw at a neural network and the quality of the results. Because they make their own cars, and because they‚Äôve bet on cheaper sensors, Tesla is now sitting on an unmatched (and possibly unmatchable) pile of data, and that pile grows with each mile driven, with the rate of growth multiplying with each new vehicle sold.In that light, Elon emphatically assures us their self-driving capabilities are improving ‚Äúexponentially‚Äù, which would make the advent of full autonomy arrive much sooner than expected (and, frustratingly, will also make estimating its exact arrival date even more difficult). To demonstrate these advances, they gave investors fully-autonomous rides in standard off-the-shelf Teslas with remarkable capability improvements over the previous generation of software. In other words, given their advances in chip hardware and their substantial lead in real-world data, the final piece of their self-driving puzzle is software. Software which, once ready, can be deployed at the push of a button.W
ith the facts and figures out of the way, they delivered the real shocker of the event: robotaxis. As early as next year, your Tesla will be able to drive you home as you read a book, they say, as well as go off to make money for you as an autonomous robotaxi whenever you like. You can make money while you sleep, or earn a second paycheck while at your day job. The car can pay for itself, and then some.Now, even taking that with the massive tablet of salt called ‚Äúregulatory approval‚Äù combined with a healthy schedule adjustment to pad for Elon Time‚Ñ¢, that‚Äôs still a staggeringly audacious proposal. Especially when you consider their back-of-the-napkin math:A $38K car bringing in $200K of income on its own? That‚Äôs insane. That‚Äôs impossible. And that‚Äôs being spearheaded by a team famous for achieving the impossibly insane.W
hether or not they accomplish this latest feat, it‚Äôs a fascinating thought experiment. Assuming the tech works, what would happen next? Let‚Äôs assume this back of the napkin math is right, and that every car is worth more than what you‚Äôll pay for it:As with the current ubiquity of ridesharing traffic today, the demand for robotaxis may be so high that entry-level Model 3s become the majority of cars on the street. The number of these robotaxis will increase unless and until we encounter one of several possible limiting factors:Or:Tesla may choose to limit the number of cars a single individual purchases to inhibit the creation of fleets. But as their goal is to ‚Äúaccelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy‚Äù, allowing intrepid entrepreneurs to flood the roads with fleets of cheaper, safer, and greener robotaxis would certainly help this mission.It doesn‚Äôt hurt that they‚Äôll also be stuffing Tesla‚Äôs pockets (and their own) while they do.W
hat‚Äôs your take? Will Tesla be the first out the door with full self driving? Will robotaxis be the money printing machines they‚Äôre purported to be? Or will this be one promise Elon & Co. fails to deliver on?Would love to hear your thoughts. And if you found this interesting and haven‚Äôt seen it yet, I‚Äôd encourage you to watch the announcement for yourself. Or, if you don‚Äôt have several hours to spare, check out this 15 minute cut below.Follow me on Twitter: @verbiateDisclosure: I own some Tesla stock.WRITTEN BY"
1,Zero to Grandmaster in a year | A winner‚Äôs interview with Limerobot,https://medium.com/kaggle-blog/zero-to-grandmaster-in-a-year-a-winners-interview-with-limerobot-18ddb3a1aae1?source=extreme_main_feed----4b0982ce16a3-----2-1--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"Join us in congratulating Sanghoon Kim aka Limerobot on his third place finish in Booz Allen Hamilton‚Äôs 2019 Data Science Bowl.The Data Science Bowl, presented by Booz Allen Hamilton and Kaggle, is the world‚Äôs largest data science competition focused on social good. Each year, this competition gives data scientists a chance to use their passion to change the world. Over the last four years, more than 50,000+ competitors have submitted over 114,000+ submissions, to improve everything from lung cancer and heart disease detection to ocean health. This year, competitors were challenged to identify the factors that matter most to predicting player capability in an educational kid‚Äôs game by PBS. For more information on the Data Science Bowl, please visit DataScienceBowl.comSanghoon: Well, I currently work as a data scientist at eBay Korea. I‚Äôm very interested in computer vision and natural language processing. My main interest these days has been to exceed the performance of LightGBM and XGBoost, with deep neural networks in most tabular data. In particular, I enjoys less focus on feature engineering and more focus on model architect design.Sanghoon: I‚Äôve been working in computer vision (especially face recognition) and natural language processing for about 10 years. I also majored in electronics, so I learned calculus, probability statistics, and linear algebra in my undergraduate course. Although I don‚Äôt really remember if I retained anything üòâ. In the past five years, I‚Äòve been dealing with e-commerce data that consists of images, text, and tabular data.On the Kaggle-front, I participated in my first competition in February 2019 and here I am!S: Yeah, I guess so!S: Two things really helped:First, my experience with feature engineering to use tabular data as input to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) was really helpful.Second, my experience of dealing with Transformer models in the Predicting Molecular Properties competition.S: Working in the e-commerce field, you‚Äôre exposed to a lot of tabular data. However, I was mostly working with computer vision and natural language processing and was not familiar with how to deal with tabular data. I decided to compete in Kaggle because there were a lot of competitions using tabular data, and I could learn how to work with it.S: To be quite frank, the prize money had the biggest impact on my participation. üòä(The Data Science Bowl offered a $160,000 total prize pool!)S: Transformer model is a model that is being used successfully in natural language processing. In particular, Transformer-based BERT is the latest technology in natural language processing.Recently, we were inspired by this and were trying to apply the Transformer in other fields. The top three teams of the recent Predicting Molecular Properties competition all used Transformer.S: The figure above shows the log of one user (installation_id) on the app. A total of 17,000 user log data are provided for training.The objective of this competition is to look at a user‚Äôs past records and predict the value of this user‚Äôs accuracy_group.Aggregation by game_session.
I treated the log data as sequence data because it was recorded in chronological order. Models for dealing with sequence data include LSTM and Transformer, which are being successfully used by NLP. However, you cannot use infinitely long sequences because of the model‚Äôs performance and resource problems.Therefore, in the case of user (installation_id), the log data at times had to be reduced since it was close to 58,000.The code below is an example of the code used for aggregation:As shown in the figure below, the length of game_sessions is reduced to 1, which dramatically reduces the length of one installation_id.S: The TRANSFORMER Model
For more information on the Transformer model, refer to the ‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù paper or a well-organized blog on the Internet.I only want to introduce the features of the Transformer model required in this competition.The Transformer model has been used successfully in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. One of its important features is being able to encode a continuous sequence like [A, B, C, ‚Ä¶, Z] into one vector.Note that in NLP, the whole [A, B, C, ‚Ä¶, Z] sequence can be considered to correspond to one sentence, and each alphabet corresponds to each word of a sentence.The Transformer (TR) can be stacked in multiple layers to encode more abstract information. The figure below shows an example of adding only one layer.Transformer applied at the 2019 DSB
The input of the Transformer in NLP is a sentence consisting of several words.Similarly, the input of TRANSFORMER for DSB can be considered as an installation_id consisting of multiple games_session.The figure below shows a block of a Transformer model that receives an installation_id, compresses the information, delivers it to the Regression Layer, and predicts the accuracy_group in the Regression Layer.Creating an embedding from game_session
There are two types of tabular data: categorical and continuous. The processing method varies depending on the type of column of the tabular data.If the column is a categorical type: Embed using the embedding layer and concatenate all of them to obtain a cate_emb vector. For the cate_emb vector, modules made with a linear layer can be used for dimension reduction as shown below, since the size of the dimension is large.If the column is a continuous type: The cont_emb vector is obtained by using the linear layer directly; the following modules are used.Creating a joint embedding
Concatenate the cate_emb vector and cont_emb.Predicting pred_y
Obtain the sequence_output by inputting seq_emb as obtained previously into self.encoder, an instance of the Transformer model as shown in the figure above. Then you can obtain pred_y, the prediction of accuracy_group, through self.reg_layer.For more information, please refer to this disclosed code.S: One-quarter of the time was invested in feature engineering, half of the time in model architecture design, and another quarter of the time in tuning model parameters.S: Most of the participants in the competition appeared to have used the tree-based model. Meanwhile demonstrated that just using neural networks alone could take me to the top.In particular, I was pleased with being able to refine my skills in embedding categorical and continuous data in this competition.S: I regret that I wasn‚Äôt able to use the game time interval, more specifically the time interval between each game_session, as a feature. It wasa feature used by another competitor, and it looks quite useful.S: Kaggle has a lot of quality resources. It‚Äôs always very useful to view the notebook that received the most votes on the notebook tab. Also, the methodology obtained from Kaggle is very practical, so it is applicable even at work!If you liked this interview, show Sanghoon someüëèüëèüëè!Take a look at most recent competitions at: kaggle.com/competitionsWRITTEN BY"

3,"Of the Six Ways Ned Might Be Right, This One Worries Me Most",https://medium.com/swlh/of-the-six-ways-ned-might-be-right-this-one-worries-me-most-41cef8c159f9?source=extreme_main_feed---------5-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"Ned Ludlam had enough of the criticisms from his father. ‚ÄúSquare the needles‚Äù was the latest complaint. He took a hammer to the knitting machine and ‚Äúbeat them into a heap.‚ÄùA few decades later, in the 1810s, Ned was a wanted man. The English Government suspected him of orchestrating a series of machine-breaking crimes. Ludd was his moniker by then. Ned himself never admitted to the deeds, but the quip ‚ÄúNed Ludd did it‚Äù was common. Captain or King Ludd was the taunting title for the police. Several times the authorities thought they had their man, only to see him pop up somewhere else. The rumor was he lived in Sherwood Forest, home of Robin Hood several centuries earlier.They never did find Ned, and we‚Äôre still talking about him today. Ned was either complete fiction or was distinct from the legend. His followers, the Luddites, were a clear threat to public order. It became a capital offense to destroy a textile machine.These days Luddite refers to technophobes as well as saboteurs. The ones who couldn‚Äôt work the VCR in the 1990s, the DVR in the 2000s, or the smartphone settings now. Luddites are afraid of technology and what it will bring. They‚Äôre especially worried about technology taking people‚Äôs jobs.Don‚Äôt think the machine sabotage has ended either. In the late ‚Äô80s, I had a part-time job maintaining a security robot in a large corporate warehouse. One service call was especially memorable. The robot‚Äôs R2D2-style head was decapitated. It was no accident! (And no Mensa candidate either; the robot head was a camera!) Many current cyber-threats re also aimed at destruction, payback, or protest.The original Luddites didn‚Äôt especially hate technology. They hated poverty and some business owners. Britain‚Äôs economy was struggling after the Napoleonic wars. Unemployment and hunger were common, and it hit the artisan class hard. Their skills had given them immunity to prior downturns.The textile machines weren‚Äôt new. They had been around for decades, and the artisans knew how to use them. The Luddites attacked the businesses that were using cheaper, inept labor. The craftsmen were losing their jobs. Plus, they felt the textile quality was suffering. Taking out the machines was metaphorical. Something like ‚Äòhey, let‚Äôs see if these dodos you hired can figure out how to make cloth without machines!‚ÄôMost economists argue against the ‚ÄúLuddite Fallacy.‚Äù That‚Äôs the notion that disruptive technology costs jobs. They say that technology improves production efficiency and increases consumption by lowering prices. Voila ‚Äî more job creation! New industries arise because of technology. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry about it‚Äô is the vibe the economists give, and they have a lot of previous examples to back it up.The Luddite reaction remains a natural one ‚Äî even sensible. More jobs emerge than disappear from technology, but new jobs don‚Äôt necessarily go to the people who lost theirs. The jobs created tend to require more skill. The reeducation can be daunting, especially for someone late in their career. Disruption creates an imbalance between system pieces. The economy can take decades to equilibrate, waiting for the next generation of workers.People still worry about technology, but they‚Äôre not sticks in the mud ‚Äî a Luddite. They‚Äôre hoping they and their children can have the relevant skills for the future workplace.Many economists say the Luddite Fallacy is still valid. People worry about Artificial Intelligence (AI) or biotechnology, for example. But more jobs will emerge than disappear, they say. They could be right ‚Äî again. Or maybe we‚Äôll go beyond the limits of the theory. It‚Äôs a signal to revisit the assumptions when a rule of thumb becomes gospel.I don‚Äôt know if the Luddites or the economists are right about Artificial Intelligence (AI). Will AI take all the work so we can sip Mai Tai‚Äôs by the pool? Perhaps someday, but there is a lot of improvement in the technology needed between now and then. And we stink at predicting the timing of inventions. Plus, we‚Äôll need major societal adjustments to ensure the wealth is available to all. Machines may become smarter than us at everything, and we should invest in preventing disastrous outcomes. However, I‚Äôd be surprised if it happens in the next thirty years.By definition, there won‚Äôt be enough jobs for everyone if world-dominating machines emerge. Then the Luddites will be right. That means economists should be less confident between now and then.What does the Luddite Fallacy assume?The jobs created could be fewer than jobs lost, at least for an extended period, for several reasons, such as:1. There are market restrictions on price or wage movements;2. Labor can‚Äôt access employers with open jobs;3. The new jobs take a while to form;4. People take a long time to retrain;5. Too many of the new jobs also go to machines;6. Not enough people are ever capable of doing the new work.The first four reasons are transient conditions that the Government could mitigate. No economist is saying the transition will be painless.What about reason 5? If machines can do 100% of what we can do, as well as we can, at a fraction of the cost, then, of course, there won‚Äôt be jobs for people. Production without labor.What about half of the work? Would it create more jobs than it takes away? That number isn‚Äôt random. More than one estimate has half of all work tasks automating in the next few decades, even if tech stops advancing.And yet, reason number 6 is my biggest worry.We may be fine as long as we churn out enough capable people. But that won‚Äôt be easy. New jobs will be harder than the old ones, on average. Plus, the way they‚Äôll be harder ‚Äî more abstract thinking ‚Äî isn‚Äôt what most schools create. And the latest AI feats make the problem a crisis.The Luddites could still be wrong, but only if us humans become more capable. I‚Äôm worried about that one. It‚Äôll take an educational revolution.WRITTEN BY"
4,10 Extraordinary GitHub Repos for All Developers,https://medium.com/better-programming/10-extraordinary-github-repos-for-all-developers-939cdeb28ad0?source=extreme_main_feed---------6-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"GitHub is the number one platform for sharing all kinds of technologies, frameworks, libraries, and collections of all sorts. But with the sheer mass also comes the problem to find the most useful repositories. So I have decided to curate this list of ten fantastic repositories that provide great value for all software engineers. All of them have a lot of GitHub stars, underlining their relevance, popularity, and usefulness.Some of them will help you learn new things, some will help you build cool things, and all of them will help you to become better software engineers.GitHub stars: 61,300This fantastic repository basically is a collection of tutorials on how to build your own technology. There are examples of how to build a command-line tool, an operating system, a search engine, a 3D renderer, and many, many more.Have you ever wanted to create your own programming language? Or your very own Docker or Git? Then this is the right repository for you.GitHub stars: 139,000Even though the name of this repository is Free Programming Books, it offers much more than that. It is available in many different languages and contains sections for free online courses, interactive programming resources, problem sets and competitive programming, and podcasts and programming playgrounds.But the majority deals with programming books. And that really is an awesome collection.GitHub stars: 106,000Oh My Zsh is a community-driven and open-source framework for managing Zsh configurations. Zsh is both an interactive shell and a powerful scripting language that many developers use.Oh My Zsh comes with powerful plugins and beautiful themes to customize your Zsh setup. It is a bit of work to get it up and running, but there are great tutorials on the web and examples of other developers that will help you find the right settings for you.GitHub stars: 104,000This repository is a multi-month study plan to become a software engineer for a large company like Amazon, Google, or Facebook. It is meant for people who are new to software engineering (where CS knowledge is needed) and also offers advice on how to study to become a reliability engineer or operations engineer.The author originally created this repo as a personal to-do list to keep track of his learning process. After studying eight to 12 hours a day for several months, he finally got his dream job at Amazon as a software development engineer.Coding Interview University will help you prepare for technical interviews at companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or similar. Make the best out of it.GitHub stars: 97,100This repository is exactly what the name suggests: a collection of useful .gitignore templates. For every new project you set up as a GitHub repository, it becomes mandatory to have a .gitignore file to filter what gets uploaded. The content of this file varies from project to project and language to language. The repo contains templates for almost any language or framework such as Rails, Python, Perl, Laravel, Java and many more. There even is a template for Fortran!GitHub stars: 86,200This is a great repository for software engineers that will help you learn how to design large-scale systems. That will then help you become a better engineer. The repo provides an organized collection of resources for this broad topic.Because system design often is a required component of the technical interview process at many companies, this repository can also help you to prepare for those interviews with a study guide, advice on how to approach an interview, interview questions with solutions, Anki flashcard sets for interactive learning, and interactive coding challenges.GitHub stars: 73,100Public APIs is a great list of free APIs that you can use for your projects and applications. It covers various topics such as business, anime, animals, news, finance, games, and more.There are APIs like cats or dogs APIs that give you pictures of‚Ä¶cats or dogs.But there are also more useful ones like the Gmail API or the Google Analytics API.This is really an extensive collection, so go check it out for yourself.GitHub stars: 70,100Knowing how to work with the command line is often neglected by developers, yet it helps to improve productivity and flexibility as an engineer. This repository contains useful notes and tips on using the command line when working on Linux. There are sections specifically for Windows or macOS, and in general tips, are applicable to other UNIX-based OSs. It is both for beginners and the more experienced.While the repository seems to not be maintained actively any longer, it still provides very good tips that can help you work with the command line. And you can always fork the repo and maintain it yourself.GitHub stars: 64,700This repository contains examples of many popular algorithms and data structures for JavaScript. Each example is either marked as beginner or advanced to indicate the difficulty. There are examples for hash table, heap, queue, stack, math, strings, sets, and many more.GitHub stars: 98,600The last repository contains a set of charts demonstrating different paths to take and technologies to adopt in order to become a front-end, back-end, or dev-ops engineer in 2020. While it seems a bit overwhelming in the beginning, it is a useful guide for what‚Äôs possible and needed in this fast-changing industry.The repo gets updated every year to reflect changes in the ecosystem.I hope you find these repositories as useful as I do and can use them to become better software engineers.

5,fastai and PyTorch Lightning are democratising AI,https://towardsdatascience.com/fastai-and-pytorch-lightning-are-democratising-ai-92318ff224b1?source=extreme_main_feed---------7-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"Deep learning frameworks are hugely responsible for the breakthrough research pushing the field forward. Megaprojects such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, language-specific endeavours like DL4J and experimental ventures like Swift for TensorFlow offer a wide variety of options to practitioners and researchers.Yet, deep learning is still too hard for software engineers with no math background, while frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are complicated for data science researchers with no solid engineering background.To this end, libraries like Keras, fastai and PyTorch Lightning offer higher abstractions on well-established codebases. Keras mostly uses TensorFlow for its backend, while fastai and PyTorch Lightning are built on PyTorch. In this story, we examine the latter two, what they offer and what we get with the new versions; fastai 2.0 and PyTorch Lightning 0.7.1.fastai is a deep learning library developed mainly by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger and maintained by hundreds of contributors. It enables practitioners to achieve state-of-the-art results effortlessly and facilitates deep experimentation for researchers. The framework was introduced in 2017 to support the associated course and the second version is expected in July 2020.In this story, we mostly talk about the upcoming, second version of the fastai library. With that in mind, fastai is designed in a layered approach. It provides practitioners with high-level components that deliver state-of-the-art results quickly and researchers with low-level blocks that can be composed in various ways, enabling experimentation with new deep learning approaches [1].The higher-level APIs are useful to beginners or AI practitioners who mainly want to apply pre-existing deep learning techniques. fastai supports four application domains by default: computer vision, natural language processing, tabular data or time-series and recommender systems via collaborative filtering. Furthermore, fastai is an opinionated framework offering customizable models with sensible defaults. Pre-defined hyper-parameters follow best practices and are informed by relevant state-of-the-art research where available. This design leads to clear, easy to follow code, tainted with fewer bugs if any.On the other hand, lower-level APIs support mid and high-level functionality with optimized primitives. Those primitives are mainly developed on top of popular Python libraries, such as PyTorch, numpy, pandas or PIL. However, in order to be hackable, fastai interoperates seamlessly with each of the underlying libraries. For instance, fastai makes it easy to inject its components into PyTorch modules or use original PyTorch functionality with fastai.In a nutshell, the goal of fastai is to have a flat learning curve for beginners but to be flexible enough for researchers.To better understand the design choices for each library we implement a state-of-the-art classifier for the MNIST dataset. After all, MNIST is arguably the ‚ÄúHello world‚Äù example for deep learning.The framework‚Äôs high-level APIs permits us to solve the MNIST challenge in more or less five lines of code. Despite this being a toy example, it highlights the possibilities of the layered architecture. Furthermore, several key elements of training deep learning models are hidden from us; the optimal learning rate, batch size and other hyper-parameters are set automatically, while the loss function is inferred by the data. Transfer learning is handled without sweat, with the ResNet architecture automatically adjusted to the problem at hand.It took five lines of code and less than five minutes of GPU training to achieve > 98% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. Practitioners facing challenges supported by default in fastai (e.g. vision, text, tabular data or collaborative filtering) may have similar experiences. In any other case, much can be achieved with just a few tweaks.fastai version 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the first version. There are many breaking changes in the codebase and you can walk through most of them in the associated YouTube series by Jeremy Howard.However, the most notable modifications are summarized below:You can get a small taste of the new APIs in the second part of the previous year‚Äôs course, while more examples are expected when the 2020‚Äôs course is available for streaming.PyTorch Lightning is a lightweight PyTorch wrapper for researchers, developed by William Falcon. However, its fast adoption by the research teams working for major organizations (e.g. FAIR) secured funding from venture capitalists and a full-time team is formed as we speak. PyTorch Lightning is more like a style-guide which helps you decouple the science code from the engineering.PyTorch Lightning is a flexible, light-weight wrapper on PyTorch, that sets a standard on how to structure your deep learning code. This way, it handles most of the engineering work, leaving you to focus on the science. This approach leads to less boilerplate code, thus, fewer worries and bugs.Being a thin wrapper means that researchers or production teams do not need to learn the perks of another framework. At the same time, it offers great flexibility to try out cutting edge ideas while abstracting the engineering details.The main modules of PyTorch Lightning are the LightningModule and the Trainer. All science logic goes into the LightningModule; data preparation, optimizer initialization, the training loop and the forward pass. On the other hand, all the engineering effort is hidden away into the Trainer module; fitting, automatic logging, checkpointing, early stopping and much more.As its creator states, the goals of PyTorch lightning is the promotion of best practices in the deep learning community and the facilitation of research reproducibility.Let us now see how to solve MNIST using PyTorch Lightning. We somehow need to use the same pre-trained model to avoid cheating. To this end, continuing from the previous example, we will grab the model from the learner (i.e. fastai learner) before training. We do that because the learner has already adjusted the model to the MNIST challenge. If we just grab a new ResNet-34 model it will be tailored to solve the ImageNet challenge, meaning different number of outputs for the last layer. One thing we need to change is to tell the first convolution to expect a one-channel input.We are now ready to implement an MNISTSolver.To fit the model we just instantiate the Trainer and we are ready to go.PyTorch Lightning offers logging to TensoBoard ‚Äî among others ‚Äî by default.

omputer Vision has always been a topic of fascination for me. In layman's terms, computer vision is all about replicating the complexity of the human vision and his understanding of his surroundings. It is emerging to be one of the most powerful fields of application of AI. Thanks to the amount of data that is being generated on an everyday basis.When we look at images or videos, we can easily locate and identify the objects of our interest within moments. Passing on of this intelligence to computers is nothing but object detection ‚Äî locating the object and identifying it. Object Detection has found its application in a wide variety of domains such as video surveillance, image retrieval systems, autonomous driving vehicles and many more. Various algorithms can be used for object detection but we will be focusing on YoloV3 algorithm.You Only Look Once or more popularly known as YOLO is one of the fastest real-time object detection algorithm (45 frames per seconds) as compared to R-CNN family (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, etc.)The R-CNN family of algorithms uses regions to localise the objects in images which means the model is applied to multiple regions and high scoring regions of the image are considered as object detected. But YOLO follows a completely different approach. Instead of selecting some regions, it applies a neural network to the entire image to predict bounding boxes and their probabilities.We have two options to get started with object detection:In this article, we will be looking at creating an object detector using the pre-trained model for images, videos and real-time webcam. Let us dive into the code.Let us start with importing the modules that are needed for this program.You will also need to download a couple of heavy files which includes the pre-trained weights of YoloV3, the configuration file and names file.Weights and cfg (or configuration) files can be downloaded from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo. You will see a couple of different options available. The model has been trained for different sizes of images: 320 x 320 (high speed, less accuracy), 416 x 416 (moderate speed, moderate accuracy) and 608 x 608 (less speed, high accuracy). We will download the weights and cfg files for YOLOv3‚Äì320 for now.Names file can be downloaded from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names.Now that we have all these files downloaded and ready with us, we can start writing the python script. Like I mentioned before as well, our input can be in three forms:To start with, we will create a function called load_yolo().In the above function, as you can see, I am loading the YoloV3 weights and configuration file with the help of dnn module of OpenCV. The coco.names file contains the names of the different objects that our model has been trained to identify. We store them in a list called classes. Now to run a forward pass using the cv2.dnn module, we need to pass in the names of layers for which the output is to be computed. net.getUnconnectedOutLayers() returns the indices of the output layers of the network.For accepting image files, we will need another function called load_image() which will accept an image path as a parameter, read the image, resize it and return it.To correctly predict the objects with deep neural networks, we need to preprocess our data and cv2.dnn module provides us with two functions for this purpose: blobFromImage and blobFromImages. These functions perform scaling, mean subtraction and channel swap which is optional. We will use blobFromImage in a function called detect_objects() that accepts image/frame from video or webcam stream, model and output layers as parameters.As you can see in the code snippet above, we have used the scalefactor of 0.00392 which can also be written as 1/255. Hence, we are scaling the image pixels to the range of 0 to 1. There is no need for mean subtraction and that‚Äôs why we set it to [0, 0, 0] value.The forward() function of cv2.dnn module returns a nested list containing information about all the detected objects which includes the x and y coordinates of the centre of the object detected, height and width of the bounding box, confidence and scores for all the classes of objects listed in coco.names. The class with the highest score is considered to be the predicted class.In get_box_dimensions() function, a list called scores is created which stores the confidence corresponding to each object. We then identify the index of class with highest confidence/score using np.argmax(). We can get the name of the class corresponding to the index from the classes list we created in load_yolo().I have selected all the predicted bounding boxes with the confidence of more than 30 %. You may play around with this value.Now that we have the vertices of the predicted bounding box and class_id (index of predicted object class), we need to draw the bounding box and add object label to it. We will do that with the help of draw_labels() function.Now, you must be wondering, what is cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes() is for? We were just supposed to add draw the bounding box and add a label to it, right?Although we removed the low confidence bounding boxes, there is a possibility that we will still have duplicate detections around an object. For example, look at the image shown below.You may observe that some objects have been detected multiple times and we have more than one bounding box for it. To fix this situation we‚Äôll need to apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), also called Non-Maxima Suppression. We pass in confidence threshold value and NMS threshold value as parameters to select one bounding box. From the range of 0 to 1, we should select an intermediate value like 0.4 or 0.5 to make sure that we detect the overlapping objects but do not end up getting multiple bounding boxes for the same object.So the final output looks like:All the functions that we looked at can be pipelined together in another function called image_detect() for detecting objects in an image file.Similarly, for video files and webcam input, we can create two different functions called start_video() and webcam_detect() respectively.The entire working script can be found at https://github.com/nandinib1999/object-detection-yolo-opencv.This is all for this article. I hope you find it useful. If yes, please give it a clap. For any questions and suggestions, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.Thanks for reading!~ NandiniWRITTEN BY"

The sun only shines during the day, and those solar panels are useless at night, or at least they are right now. Researchers from the University of California Davis suggest you could generate power at night using ‚Äú anti-solar panels.‚Äù Of course, it‚Äôs all so obvious when you think about it.Researchers around the world are working to improve the efficiency of solar panels, which currently only capture a fraction of the total solar energy falling on them. Even high-efficiency solar panels are at a disadvantage compared with non-renewable energy because you can‚Äôt generate solar power at night. So, you need to capture enough during the day to store for usage when the sun isn‚Äôt shining. However, battery technology has been similarly slow to improve. The anti-solar panels described in the journal ACS Photonicscould fill the gap to supplement power generation at night when solar panels and batteries aren‚Äôt good enough.Solar panels work because they‚Äôre cold compared with the sun, so they can absorb sunlight and convert it to energy. Space, and therefore the night sky, is cold. Therefore, you can point a warmer panel on Earth toward the sky to radiate energy outward as infrared light. That‚Äôs what the University of California team is proposing-it‚Äôs essentially a heat engine.These devices don‚Äôt use the same technology as solar panels, although they‚Äôd probably look similar. Solar panels rely on photovoltaic cells that absorb photons to create electron-hole pairs across the semiconductor, generating a working voltage. A nighttime panel would use a thermoradiative cell to emit infrared radiation from the Earth into space to create electron-hole pairs.The team estimates that thermoradiative cells would only be able to generate about a quarter as much power as a solar panel of the same area. That‚Äôs mainly a consequence of the lower energy of infrared light. Silicon is the current material of choice for solar panels as it‚Äôs good at capturing light in the visible wavelengths. It may be possible to boost the efficiency of thermoradiative cells by using materials that can better interact with longer wavelengths of light, for example, mercury alloys.The University of California study is just an initial proposal for nighttime energy generation. The next step is to start building the devices to see how well they perform.Now read:Originally published at https://www.extremetech.com on February 4, 2020.WRITTEN BY"
8,The Top 4 Misuses of Lambdas in Python,https://medium.com/better-programming/the-top-4-misuses-of-lambdas-in-python-e419f426b74f?source=extreme_main_feed---------10-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"Perceived as very Pythonic, lambdas are one of the favorite features in Python programming. So much so, that many Python programmers are tempted to use them whenever possible.Certainly, lambdas have the advantage of making our code concise, but their overuse in our projects can lead to misuses that reduce our code‚Äôs readability and maintainability.Before we start to explore what these misuses are, let‚Äôs first quickly review what lambdas are. If you know them pretty well, you can skip to the next section.Lambdas, also known as lambda functions, are anonymous functions that take any number of arguments, while only having a single expression. Their declarations are signaled by the lambda keyword. The basic syntax is below.Lambdas are best suitable for places where small functions are needed and they are used just one time. One common usage of lambdas is to set it as the key argument in the built-in sorted() function. Here‚Äôs an example.Many tutorials have done a good job explaining what lambdas are and where lambdas can be used, and thus, there are no good reasons to repeat them extensively here.Instead, the purpose of this article is to show you the most common misuses of lambdas so that when you use them in other scenarios other than those listed below, you‚Äôre probably using them properly.The first misuse of lambdas is ignoring the existing built-in functions.Let‚Äôs still use the sorted() function as an example. Suppose that we have a list of strings, and we want to sort them using their length.Certainly, the lambda function lambda x: len(x) works, but how about just using the built-in len() function directly?Here‚Äôs another example involving the use of the max() function instead.Best practice #1: Think about built-in functions first before writing your own lambdas.I have seen the assignment of lambdas to variables in some tutorials, including some of mine, but it is mostly intended to show beginners that lambdas essentially are functions.However, some beginners may have taken it as good practice and think that lambdas are just a convenient way to declare a short function. The following code snippet shows you this misuse.Why should this be avoided? If you recall what‚Äôs mentioned above, lambdas are supposed to be used for just once and thus there is no reason to assign a lambda to a variable.If we do need to use the related functionality, we should use the def keyword to declare a regular function like below.If you think that it‚Äôs not cool to have two lines of code for this simple function, we can rewrite it in one line: def divide_two_numbers_fun(x,y): return x / y, which works the same way.The major reason for avoiding assigning a lambda to a variable is for debugging/maintainability purposes, especially in a production/teamwork environment.Let‚Äôs see what can potentially happen using a simplified example. In a real situation, things can go a lot more complex.As you can see above, with the declaration of the regular function, we know exactly which function has caused the error. By contrast, using the lambdas, it only tells us that there is a lambda causing the error.Why is no function name shown?It‚Äôs because lambdas are anonymous functions, all of which share the same name ‚Äî <lambda>. Can you imagine how frustrating it can be if your co-workers find that tens of <lambda>s have errors?Best practice #2: Write a regular function instead of a lambda when the function is to be used multiple times.When we say higher-order functions, we mean functions that operate on other functions either by taking functions as arguments or by returning functions.Relevant functions to the current topic are map(), filter(), and reduce(), all of which have been used more or less in many tutorials on lambdas. But this has led to a certain misuse of lambdas together with higher-order functions.For demonstration purposes, I‚Äôll just use the map() function in this tutorial, but the same philosophy applies to other higher-order functions too.Suppose that we have a list of integers and we want to have a list that consists of their squares. Using a lambda with the map() function will be like below.We‚Äôll get an iterator ‚Äî the map object from the map() function, and then, to convert it to a list, we need to call the list() function on this iterator.Actually, the same functionality can be achieved conveniently with list comprehensions ‚Äî no higher-order functions or lambdas needed. Much more concise and readable, isn‚Äôt it?Certainly, mastering list comprehensions is another ‚ÄúPythonic feature‚Äù topic that requires another tutorial.Best practice #3: Consider replacing higher-order functions using lambdas with list comprehensions.This is less common than the previous ones. But some programmers are just trying their best to write the most Pythonic code by using lambdas whenever possible. It sometimes has a cost ‚Äî readability.Suppose that we have a list of strings and we need to sort them using a weird requirement: the number of distinct vowels in the word. Using a lambda in the sorted() function will look like below.It works as expected, but it‚Äôs definitely not the most readable code. How about the code below?Certainly, we need to write a few more lines of code but doesn‚Äôt the new code have better readability?Best practice #4: Write a regular function if the expression of a lambda is too cumbersome.Lambdas have always been one of the hard topics for Python beginners, and they avoid using them at all costs initially.After a while, when their fear is gone, they start to learn lambdas and find out that they‚Äôre not really hard at all. They then start to use lambdas, but unfortunately, some may use them way too much, leading to various misuses as discussed above.I hope that this article can help address some of these issues.By avoiding these misuses and following the best practice tips, I bet that your Python code with correct usage of lambdas will have better readability and maintainability.WRITTEN BY"

For more info about the coronavirus, see cdc.gov.Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that are transmitted between animals and people. Symptoms include fever, cough, and mild respiratory illness. In severe cases the infection can result in pneumonia and death. At the time of writing this post, the CDC reported 645 cases and 25 deaths in the US. In the space of infectious disease research, social media data has been shown to be useful as an indicator for predicting the onset and progression of cold and flu season. In this post, we will use the Google Trends API to measure state-level engagement with the Coronavirus.We will use the python google trends API, pytrends, to analyze google searches for ‚ÄòCoronavirus‚Äô at the state level.To install pytrends open up a command line and type:Next, open up an IDE (I use Spyder) and import pytrends:Next, we specify the host language, the timezone and the payload. We specify the host language as English (‚Äòen-US‚Äô), the timezone as Central Standard Timezone, which is ‚Äò360‚Äô, and we can leave the google property filter (gprop) as an empty string. We also set category = 0, which corresponds to all categories related to the key word.Let‚Äôs get data from February 2020 to March 2020 in New York for ‚ÄòCoronavirus‚Äô:We then define a data frame as the resulting pytrends object and print the first five rows:We can also use seaborn and matplotlib to plot the time series of searches for ‚ÄòCoronavirus‚Äô:Let‚Äôs do the same for ‚ÄòCoronavirus‚Äô in Massachusetts:We can define a function that would allow us to pull this data for any state:Let‚Äôs call this function for NY, MA, and CA:I‚Äôll stop here but feel free to pull data from other states. You can also play around with the key word input. Maybe you‚Äôll want to search for ‚ÄòCoronavirus symptoms‚Äô or ‚ÄòCoronavirus mortality rate‚Äô.To summarize, in this post we pulled state-level google trends data corresponding to the key word ‚ÄòCoronavirus‚Äô using the python library ‚Äòpytrends‚Äô. Social media data, like google trends data, may be useful for measuring social engagement with topics related to public health, like Coronavirus. This may help health institutes, like the CDC, quantitatively assess needs, allocate resources and communicate prevention measures. I hope you found this post useful/interesting.

We breath mathematics even though we might not be aware of how it influences our behaviours. Maths is behind all the technological products we use. No matter what‚Äôs your background, you need to know how mathematics work in order to understand the world around you. These books will help you with that.The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data is a book which explains the importance of statistics in our daily life on great examples:David Spiegelhalter guides the reader through the essential principles we need in order to derive knowledge from data. Drawing on real world problems to introduce conceptual issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether serial killer Harold Shipman could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial.Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy is a book about algorithms and how they affect our lives:Those decisions often are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated.But as Cathy O‚ÄôNeil reveals in this book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and incontestable, even when they‚Äôre wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: If a poor student can‚Äôt get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he‚Äôs then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a ‚Äútoxic cocktail for democracy.‚Äù Welcome to the dark side of Big Data.The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable is a book about black swan events and how they shape our world. A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe is a book about calculus.Without calculus, we wouldn‚Äôt have cell phones, TV, GPS, or ultrasound. We wouldn‚Äôt have unraveled DNA or discovered Neptune or figured out how to put 5,000 songs in your pocket.Steven Strogatz‚Äôs brilliantly creative, down-to-earth history shows that calculus is not about complexity; it‚Äôs about simplicity. It harnesses an unreal number ‚Äî infinity ‚Äî to tackle real-world problems, breaking them down into easier ones and then reassembling the answers into solutions that feel miraculous.Infinite Powers recounts how calculus tantalised and thrilled its inventors, starting with its first glimmers in ancient Greece and bringing us right up to the discovery of gravitational waves (a phenomenon predicted by calculus). Strogatz reveals how this form of math rose to the challenges of each age: how to determine the area of a circle with only sand and a stick; how to explain why Mars goes ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù sometimes; how to make electricity with magnets; how to ensure your rocket doesn‚Äôt miss the moon; how to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS.Humble Pi: When Math Goes Wrong in the Real World is a book about how mathematics influences our life at every level: from the code running a website to the equations enabling the design of skyscrapers and bridges. Most of the time this math works quietly behind the scenes‚Ä¶ until it doesn‚Äôt. All sorts of seemingly innocuous mathematical mistakes can have significant consequences.Math is easy to ignore until a misplaced decimal point upends the stock market, a unit conversion error causes a plane to crash, or someone divides by zero and stalls a battleship in the middle of the ocean.Exploring and explaining a litany of glitches, near misses, and mathematical mishaps involving the internet, big data, elections, street signs, lotteries, the Roman Empire, and an Olympic team, Matt Parker uncovers the bizarre ways math trips us up, and what this reveals about its essential place in our world. Getting it wrong has never been more fun.Do Dice Play God?: The Mathematics of Uncertainty is a book about uncertainty. Uncertainty is everywhere: the weather, the economy, the sex of an unborn child ‚Äî even quantities we think that we know such as populations or the transit of the planets contain the possibility of error. It‚Äôs no wonder that, throughout that history, we have attempted to produce rigidly defined areas of uncertainty ‚Äî we prefer the surprise party to the surprise asteroid.Ian Stewart explores the history and mathematics of uncertainty. Touching on gambling, probability, statistics, financial and weather forecasts, censuses, medical studies, chaos, quantum physics, and climate, he makes one thing clear: a reasonable probability is the only certainty.The Princeton Companion to Mathematics is the ultimate guide to modern mathematics. This book, edited by Timothy Gowers, a recipient of the Fields Medal, presents nearly two hundred entries, written by world‚Äôs leading mathematicians. You will be introduced to:Everyone should have it on a shelf to look up any math concept coming up in their work or life.This list will allow you to grasp how mathematics, statistics and algorithms shape the world we live in.

11,A complete NLP classification pipeline in scikit-learn,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-nlp-classification-pipeline-in-scikit-learn-bf1f2d5cdc0d?source=extreme_main_feed---------13-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"What we‚Äôll cover in this story:The most important take-outs of this story are scikit-learn/sklearn's Pipeline, FeatureUnion, TfidfVectorizer and a visualisation of the confusion_matrix using the seaborn package, but also more general bites such as ifmain, argparse, logging, zip and *args will be covered.We‚Äôll be using an dataset of Amazon reviews and the simple yet effective Naive Bayes for the classification task. trainset.txt contains a corpus of reviews taken from the Johns Hopkins Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset and converted to the following format in a space separated .csv file.As you can see the reviews are already tokenised with a whitespace tokeniser from the nltkpackage. Each review is on one line and preceded by two tags and the identifier of the review:This dataset enables us to perform a binary classification of sentiment or a multi-class classification of the genre of the review and create our script in such a way that the user can specify which classification task to tackle.We‚Äôre setting up our pipeline using argparse and function flags such as use_sentiment so that we‚Äôre able to do both the binary (pos|neg) classification task and the multi-class classification task (book|camera|dvd|health|music|software) from the command-line.For those of you who are not familiar, argparse is a super-useful package that enables user-friendly command-line interfaces. If required arguments are missing, it shows an error and it shows all of the different arguments that can be used. Arguments are preceded by the argument tag --input and a whitespace:$ python3 pipeline.py --input trainset.txt --binary.We‚Äôre also adding a verbosityflag --v and using the logging capabilities of Python to output warnings, errors or info. After the arguments are parsed with args = parser.parse_args() you can then use the input from these arguments with args.input and args.verbosity in your script.Note argparse does not have a type=bool, which means that everything get‚Äôs parsed as a str. In order to add boolean flags, you can set action=""store_true"", which takes the False boolean as default, and if the flag --binary is included, will automatically result in aTrue boolean.We‚Äôll be chaining all of the functions in this story in a main() function that will automatically be called by the if __name__ == '__main__' statement. When calling this file in the command line, the Python interpreter reads the source file and sets the __name__ variable as '__main__'. This way we can read the source file and execute the functions in it, but also make this file available as a module to import for other scripts, without automatically executing the statements in main().First we‚Äôll need to read our corpus trainset.txt. This function will make use of the --binary flag coming from our argparse function to determine whether we‚Äôre doing a binary or multi-class classification.Now that we have our reviews in documents and our classes in labels, we‚Äôre going to split them in a training-set and a test-set for our classifier. We‚Äôre going to use a split of 80% training and 20% testing, using the slice notation [:]. First we need to shuffle our data to ensure that this slice is not influencing the results: classes might be overrepresented in the train/test-set, since we don‚Äôt know how the documents in our corpus are ordered. They might for instance be ordered alphabetically, which could result in having the classes book|camera|dvd|health solely in our training set.Since we‚Äôre creating a list of tuples as such [(doc1, 'neg'), (doc2, 'pos')], we can use a neat python function, zip and * to iterate through this list and separate the tuples in a list of documents [doc1, doc2, doc3] and a list of labels ['pos', 'neg', 'pos'].Note: although this function may seem a bit verbose, I included it, because it is good to see what happens under the hood here. You can also use sklearn‚Äôs train_test_split function which does essentially the same, or use k-fold cross-validation: splitting the dataset in train and test k number of times and taking the average of each classification to ensure that the splits influence the scores as little as possible.For the classification task at hand we‚Äôll be using Naive Bayes classifier, which makes use of Bayes theorem: computing new probability distributions over the classes incorporating the features included in the classifiers such as tf-idf or counts, which should make the new probability distribution more representative of the data.To make sense of the posterior probabilities it is useful to compare them to the prior distributions. We will thus first calculate the prior probabilities of the classes over all documents in our corpus, or the other way around: the probability that one document in our corpus has a certain class. Posterior probabilities can be computed with classifier.predict_proba.To compare the evaluation metric (accuracy) and the confusion matrix of our Naive Bayes classifier, we‚Äôre going to create a very simple baseline: using the random package, we‚Äôre going to randomly assign a label to each document out of the set of possible labels. We could also create a baseline that takes the prior probabilities of each class into account.For this classification task we‚Äôre going to add three features that are included in the classifier:Now this code is a bit complex, but it is merely an example of how multiple features can be appended in one FeatureUnion pipeline, even including pipelines as done in (.3).I‚Äôve added a flag for each of the features in the function feature_union(), so that you‚Äôre able to turn features on and off accordingly.Now we‚Äôre also going to have to show our results. We can use sklearn‚Äôs classification_report, accuracy_score, and confusion_matrix and a bit of beauty with the seaborn package for that last one.tabular_results() creates a Pandas DataFrame with the tokenised sentences, actual labels, predicted labels and the prior/posterior probabilities. class_report() shows the accuracy scores for the classifier and has a flag show_matrix for showing the beautiful visualisation of the confusion matrix using the vis() function.We read our corpus > split the data in train/test > compute prior probabilities > create a FeatureUnion of our three features > fit the classifier to the data > make predictions > compute posterior probabilities > create a DataFrame > report results for baseline > report results for Naive Bayes.Accuracy scores for our baseline remain around 0.16/0.17 for our six-class classification and around 0.5 for our binary classification, which is logical since it‚Äôs the probability/number of classes. Naive Bayes accuracy scores are 0.685 for all three features combined and highest 0.901 when only using tf-idf vectors. This shows that feature-engineering does not always yield better results!The complete script and dataset can be found here. Remember that you can set the --binary flag for binary classification and the verbosity flag using --v to different levels (4 for debug) to see the classification_report for the classifiers. Furthermore, the feature_union() has flags to turn on/off different features and the class_report() a flag to show the confusion matrix.WRITTEN BY"

While there aren‚Äôt any videos yet, I‚Äôll be sharing lots of amazing content like this but in video form. Thanks for your support :)Cross-validation is essentially a technique used to assess how well a model performs on a new independent dataset. The simplest example of cross-validation is when you split your data into two groups: training data and testing data, where you use the training data to build the model and the testing data to test the model.There isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all metric. The metric(s) chosen to evaluate a machine learning model depends on various factors:There are a number of metrics that can be used, including adjusted r-squared, MAE, MSE, accuracy, recall, precision, f1 score, and the list goes on.If you would like to learn more about how you can evaluate your machine learning model, check out my article ‚ÄòHow to Evaluate Your Machine Learning Model with Python Code‚Äô!Recall attempts to answer ‚ÄúWhat proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?‚ÄùPrecision attempts to answer ‚ÄúWhat proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?‚ÄùA false positive is an incorrect identification of the presence of a condition when it‚Äôs absent.A false negative is an incorrect identification of the absence of a condition when it‚Äôs actually present.An example of when false negatives are more important than false positives is when screening for cancer. It‚Äôs much worse to say that someone doesn‚Äôt have cancer when they do, instead of saying that someone does and later realizing that they don‚Äôt.This is a subjective argument, but false positives can be worse than false negatives from a psychological point of view. For example, a false positive for winning the lottery could be a worse outcome than a false negative because people normally don‚Äôt expect to win the lottery anyways.Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs [1].For example, if I had a dataset with two variables, age (input) and height (output), I could implement a supervised learning model to predict the height of a person based on their age.Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning is used to draw inferences and find patterns from input data without references to labeled outcomes. A common use of unsupervised learning is grouping customers by purchasing behavior to find target markets.Check out my article ‚ÄòAll Machine Learning Models Explained in Six Minutes‚Äô if you‚Äôd like to learn more about this!There are two main ways that you can do this:A) Adjusted R-squared.R Squared is a measurement that tells you to what extent the proportion of variance in the dependent variable is explained by the variance in the independent variables. In simpler terms, while the coefficients estimate trends, R-squared represents the scatter around the line of best fit.However, every additional independent variable added to a model always increases the R-squared value ‚Äî therefore, a model with several independent variables may seem to be a better fit even if it isn‚Äôt. This is where adjusted R¬≤ comes in. The adjusted R¬≤ compensates for each additional independent variable and only increases if each given variable improves the model above what is possible by probability. This is important since we are creating a multiple regression model.B) Cross-ValidationA method common to most people is cross-validation, splitting the data into two sets: training and testing data. See the answer to the first question for more on this.NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is a branch of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to read and understand human languages.There are a couple of reasons why a random forest is a better choice of model than a support vector machine:In its simplest sense, PCA involves project higher dimensional data (eg. 3 dimensions) to a smaller space (eg. 2 dimensions). This results in a lower dimension of data, (2 dimensions instead of 3 dimensions) while keeping all original variables in the model.PCA is commonly used for compression purposes, to reduce required memory and to speed up the algorithm, as well as for visualization purposes, making it easier to summarize data.One major drawback of Naive Bayes is that it holds a strong assumption in that the features are assumed to be uncorrelated with one another, which typically is never the case.One way to improve such an algorithm that uses Naive Bayes is by decorrelating the features so that the assumption holds true.There are a couple of drawbacks of a linear model:Another way of asking this question is ‚ÄúIs a random forest a better model than a decision tree?‚Äù And the answer is yes because a random forest is an ensemble method that takes many weak decision trees to make a strong learner. Random forests are more accurate, more robust, and less prone to overfitting.Mean Squared Error (MSE) gives a relatively high weight to large errors ‚Äî therefore, MSE tends to put too much emphasis on large deviations. A more robust alternative is MAE (mean absolute deviation).The assumptions are as follows:Extreme violations of these assumptions will make the results redundant. Small violations of these assumptions will result in a greater bias or variance of the estimate.Multicollinearity exists when an independent variable is highly correlated with another independent variable in a multiple regression equation. This can be problematic because it undermines the statistical significance of an independent variable.You could use the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) to determine if there is any multicollinearity between independent variables ‚Äî a standard benchmark is that if the VIF is greater than 5 then multicollinearity exists.There are a couple of metrics that you can use:R-squared/Adjusted R-squared: Relative measure of fit. This was explained in a previous answerF1 Score: Evaluates the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients are equal to zero vs the alternative hypothesis that at least one doesn‚Äôt equal zeroRMSE: Absolute measure of fit.Decision trees are a popular model, used in operations research, strategic planning, and machine learning. Each square above is called a node, and the more nodes you have, the more accurate your decision tree will be (generally). The last nodes of the decision tree, where a decision is made, are called the leaves of the tree. Decision trees are intuitive and easy to build but fall short when it comes to accuracy.Random forests are an ensemble learning technique that builds off of decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree. By relying on a ‚Äúmajority wins‚Äù model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.For example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would predict 0. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the predicted value would be 1. This is the power of random forests.Random forests offer several other benefits including strong performance, can model non-linear boundaries, no cross-validation needed, and gives feature importance.A kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors ùê±x and ùê≤y in some (possibly very high dimensional) feature space, which is why kernel functions are sometimes called ‚Äúgeneralized dot product‚Äù [2]The kernel trick is a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear problem by transforming linearly inseparable data to linearly separable ones in a higher dimension.When the number of features is greater than the number of observations, then performing dimensionality reduction will generally improve the SVM.If you like my work and want to support me, sign up on my email list here! :)[1] Stuart J.

This so-called ‚Äúyellow vests movement‚Äù celebrated its first anniversary on November 16th 2019, but the French public opinion associated to these social protestations can no longer be described as it was one year ago.However, with an incoming reform on the pension system, French rail workers, air-traffic controllers, teachers and public sector staff are taking again to the streets to protest‚Ä¶Are French people still feeling hope wearing these yellow vests? Are they expressing anger through or against this movement? Are they tired of it ?Discover the NLP Analysis below ! (bonus at the end of the article !)It all started in October 2018, when the French Government suddenly rose fuel prices triggering massive protests, and therefore creating the ideal populist movement for social, fiscal, democratic and economic claims.Everything went viral on social media, and mobs started to take on the streets each Saturday. The movement reached its top participant rate on November, 17th 2018 with more than 1.3M yellow vests.However, people started to get annoyed by this yellow wave. Manifestions became too violent, yellow vest activists were not able to fix a common agreement on their revendications, and finally French Government took some (very light) actions to turn this movement into a deadlock. There were bearly 40,000 of them in May 2019.Participation rate plummeted every Saturday and the news dropped this topic‚Ä¶.until a new national meeting was scheduled by trade-unions on December 5th 2019. On September 2019, French Government announced a massive pension reform targeting every social class. Right away, the #YellowVests popped up on Twitter and activists re-fixed their weekly appointment on Saturday, until the nationwide strike on December 5th.Using the Plotly library on Python, we can visualize the yellow vests participation rate over the last year, according to ‚ÄúLe Nombre Jaune‚Äù estimations (French Facebook group trying to estimate number of participants) vs French Government estimations. Click on the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button !Why this particular date ? It was planned by all the biggest French trade-unions as a way to remember the same period when, 24 years ago, people took to the streets to protest again another reform of pensions (which aborted).On Thursday December 5th, many strikes are planned in public transportations, education, hospitals and electricity services. We will see through our Parts of Speech analysis a high correlation between the #5d√©cembre (#December5th) and the #GilletsJaunes (#YellowVests).We collected 4000 tweets between November 29th and December 2nd (1000 tweets a day) at strategic hours (peak activity hours) using Tweepy library and Twitter API on Python.‚Ä¶then we had to clean data in order to proceed it properly through the Convolutional Neural Network model (removing mentions, url, #..), and we were able to call that model thanks to Spacy library and its French package.We finally ended by visualizing the 20 most frequent words in 3 different P.O.S (Parts of Speech) categories : ‚ÄòNOUN‚Äô, ‚ÄòVERB‚Äô and ‚ÄòADJ‚Äô, using Plotly library.Given the NLP results we obtained, we decided to realise word cloud visualizations of the most frequent P.O.S, so we can better draw conclusions. (plots are interactive, so you can navigate through words if it does not display entirely on your screen)Well.. So what can we see ?Unexpectedly French people are expressing the will to take actions and install changes through verbs like ‚ÄòPartir‚Äô (=Leave), ‚ÄòVeut‚Äô (=Want), ‚ÄòMettre‚Äô (=Set), ‚ÄòPrendre‚Äô (=Take), ‚ÄòAgit‚Äô (=Act) and ‚Äòd√©fendre‚Äô (=Defend). But we can also notice words like ‚ÄúComprendre‚Äù (=Understand), ‚ÄúTravailler‚Äù (=Work), ‚ÄòLire‚Äô (=Read) or even ‚ÄúEviter‚Äù (=Avoid) which are quite important and demonstrate the need of French people to be heard from the Government, before taking actions.A quick overview of top frequent adjectives obviously demonstrate nationwide concerns and a nationscale movement call, thanks to ‚Äòfran√ßais‚Äô (=French), ‚Äògr√©viste‚Äô (=Striking), ‚Äòg√©n√©rale‚Äô (=Overall), ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô or even ‚ÄòGRAND‚Äô (=Big) in capital letters !Looking at the top Nouns, things become very correlated to the massive strike of december (we mentioned it above) : ‚Äòmouvement‚Äô (=movement), ‚Äòd√©cembre‚Äù(=december), ‚Äòretraite‚Äô (=pension) and ‚Äòreforme‚Äô (=reform) are one the most frequent words..French Twitter users are also directly targeting the Government and even the system itself when writing ‚Äògouvernement‚Äô (=Government), ‚ÄòR√©publique‚Äô (=French Republic) or ‚Äòpolice‚Äô (=Police forces). Last but not least, the top noun analysis also reveal the French nationalism trough nouns like ‚Äòpeuple‚Äô (=Nation) , ‚ÄòPays‚Äù‚Äô(=Country) or even ‚ÄòRue‚Äô (=Street).Finally, we have to mention the lexical field of the time through the following words: ‚ÄòJour‚Äô (=Day), ‚ÄòMois‚Äô (=Month), ‚Äò√®re‚Äô (=Era) and ‚Äòvie‚Äô (=Life), highlighting the will to persue this movement, and perhaps create a new era for French society ?Now let‚Äôs dive into Twitter Sentiment analysis and try to interpret people‚Äôs feeling regarding this massive social movement.Using Textblob library and its sentiment estimation model, we can estimate the ‚Äúpolarity‚Äù of each tweet in a Pandas DataFrame : that is to say a numerical value between -1 (very negative) and 1 (very postive).Given our sample of 4000 tweets, we chose to decrease our number to 2733 tweets by deleting non-relevant tweets for sentiments analysis (for instance, strings with too many ‚Äòstop words‚Äô aka not relevant words, or with a string length <4).Below is the distribution of tweets‚Äô length : it takes a wide range of values but Textblob but we can see length is usually between 30 and 230 characters.If you would have asked anyone to classify or describe #YellowVests tweets, it would have been ‚Äúanger, fury, hate, revolt‚Äù or any word relating to negative comments (so let‚Äôs say a value from -1 for high negative comments, to -0.01 for soft negative comments).But guess what, TextBlob model is showing us an opposite trend ! If you take a look at the polarity mean, it is postive and equal +0.05, when you could have expected a negative value !We choose to apply a simple and easy classifier after getting the polarity of each tweet :Therefore it was easy to plot an histogram to show sentiment distribution and present the main trends : majority of tweets were classified as ‚Äúneutral to positive‚Äù, minority were linked to the negative category.Unfortunately, 766 tweets were unclassified by the model, as TextBlob is not that clever for French language.Note: We could have used the NaiveBayesClassifier from Texblob models to cateogrize each tweet as ‚Äúpos‚Äù, ‚Äúneg‚Äù or ‚Äúneutral‚Äù, but again, it is not that performant on French languageThanks for making it to the end :) We hope you‚Äôve learned something or got surprised through this text mining ! To reward you, here are the top 3 negative and positive comments we found during the analysis :TOP 3 POSITIVE TWEET (polarity = 1.0)TOP 3 NEGATIVE TWEET (polarity = -1.0)WRITTEN BY"

If you are completely new to these concepts, you may not understand this blog. kindly, revisit after you learn basics of deep learning.In very simple terms, important task in training a neural network model is to find best weights (weight matrix), which helps in reducing the error and minimizing the loss to achieve the objective of the given problem (classification or regression).So, understanding the model summary in detail (output shapes, input shapes and number of parameters) is very important while training a neural network model, because these will help you to understand , what is happening within the model, which you defined.This is very short blog and will try to explain these topics using example with help of (toy dataset).Note : Everything discussed in this blog is only with respect to fully connected multi layered perceptron.The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper . Iris is a type of flower plant.The data set consists of 50 samples for each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Altogether this dataset consists of 150 samples.Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals (Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width) in centimeters.target column represents three values 0,1,2 , which represents ‚Äòsetosa‚Äô, ‚Äòversicolor‚Äô, ‚Äòvirginica‚Äô respectively.While training a neural network, we seperate target variable from the dataset and train the model with data and target variable separately. So,now our data appears as shown in Fig -2.Before discussing about these topics, I wanted to make clear about architecture I am using to explain these parameters.The simplest function for such models, can be defined as f(x) = W^t * X, where W is Weight matrix and X is data.The simplest function for such models, can be defined as f(x) = W^t * X + b , where W is Weight matrix and X is data and b is Bias term.‚Äòdense_input‚Äô is the input layer .‚Äòdense‚Äô , ‚Äòdense_1‚Äô are the hidden layers ‚Äî with 5 and 4 neurons respectively.dense_2 is the output layer (softmax layer)with 3 units, as we are solving multi class classification problem (3-classes).As said earlier, in training phase, data and target are passed separately, when data is passed through the network.As, each datapoint has 4 features (refer Fig-2),Input layer:input shape and output shape of input layer will be same (you can think of it as identity). It is the first step, when you pass your data to the network. So, it will output (which has output shape).As we are passing through the network with the data, which has 4 features (refer Fig-2). So, the output from input_layer would be (?,4).‚Äú ?‚Äù ‚Äî specifies batch size.batch size is nothing but, how many data points will be passed through the neural network (Fig-6) in one batch at a time.So, if you define batch size as 16, the output shape will be (16,4), which specifies 16 data points each with 4 dimension (or 4 features).Hidden layer-1 :This layer is receiving input from Input_layer. So, output_shape of Input_layer becomes input_shape of hidden layer-1. As per our example, output_shape of input_layer is (?,4), which became input_shape to hidden layer-1.So, intuitively speaking‚ÄúOutput_shape of preceding layer becomes Input_shape of next layer in Multi Layered Perceptron networks‚Äù.Hidden layer -1 has 5 neurons or units (Fig-6), which contains some activation functions to introduce non-linearity to the model, after the input is passed through these 5 neurons, all 5 neurons generates output. So, the output_shape of hidden layer -1 is (?,5) , where ‚Äú?‚Äù specifies batch size.Hidden layer-2 :As said above, where the output_shape of hidden layer-1 becomes input_shape of hidden layer-2. So, the input_shape of hidden layer-2 is (?,5) , in other terms (hidden layer-2 is receiving input from 5 neuron units).Hidden layer -2 has 4 neurons or units (Fig-6), which contains some activation functions to introduce non-linearity to the model, after the input is passed through these 4 neurons, all 4 neurons generates output. So, the output_shape of hidden layer -2 is (?,4) , where ‚Äú?‚Äù specifies batch size.Output layer :As said above, where the output_shape of hidden layer-2 becomes input_shape of output layer. So, the input_shape of output layer is (?,4) , in other terms (output layer is receiving input from 4 neuron units (from hidden layer-2 )).Output layer has 3 units (Fig-6), as we are dealing with 3-class classification problem (we need to predict whether the given data point belongs to any of these 3 types of flower classes). If we have 10 classes to classify (then output layer contains 10 units). It changes, according to the problem statement. So, in our example, the output_shape of output layer is (?,3) , where ‚Äú?‚Äù specifies batch size.Let‚Äôs not consider any layers (such as Dropouts or Batch Normalization, etc..) , which can be considered as both trainable and non-trainable parameters. To make it simple, considering only basic architecture which can be seen in above image.Trainable parameters, are nothing but parameters, which should be updated using backpropagation in order to reduce the error and minimize the loss (based on the defined loss function)Number of parameters between input layer and hidden layer-1 are 20 Weights and 5 bias terms(refer to right side Fig-8) i.e., it has Weight matrix of shape (4x5) ,as data has 4 features, which are connected to 5 neurons in hidden layer-1 and bias term is connected to each and every neuron in hidden layer-1, which is of size (1x5). So, 20 weights and 5 bias terms (20+5=25) are trainable parameters between this two layers.In the Similar way, we can compute the number of trainable parameters between hidden layer-1 and hidden layer-2 and also between hidden layer-2 and output layer.So, intuitively speakingthe number of parameters between the two layers without bias term= ‚Äúnumber of units(or neurons) in preceding layer * number of units(or neurons) in next layer‚Äù.with bias term,the number of parameters between the two layers with bias term = ‚Äúnumber of units(or neurons) in preceding layer * number of units(or neurons) in next layer+number of units(or neurons) in next layer(for bias term)‚Äù.So, according to thesenumber of parameters between hidden layer-1 and hidden layer-2 with bias term is = (5x4+4) = 24.number of parameters between hidden layer-2 and output layer with bias term is = (4x3+3) = 15.Please refer to Fig-8 (right side) and count the connections (to get more convinced and understand about the number of parameters practically).This is simple blog to understand about the number of parameters(trainable) in the multi layered neural network (which is very important to understand, to have some idea about what‚Äôs happening behind). Even though, this analysis is done on toy example, this can be generalized to any layered and any number of dimensional network (considering dropouts or batch normalization or any other layers as non-trainable parameters).WRITTEN BY"

Underpinning the next two sections is a clear ability to build conceptual maps. I know I am a fairly idea-centric lecturer, and these students don‚Äôt miss a beat. The raw compute power is impressive.I‚Äôll tell this story with a running multi-agent learning contest, where we wanted to optimally solve new Pac-man puzzles. This is designed to be a small amount of extra credit for above and beyond students, but it ended up giving great insight into what the top minds are doing. The scoring was as follows:I‚Äôve heard so many stories about how hard undergrads at UC Berkeley work, but it‚Äôs hard to know what that means or how it translates into practical productivity without examples.A student who got second place in the Pac-man contest ultimately ran a brute force bash script overnight to create a feedback loop over the random seeds and upload new solutions to the test case we were trying (poorly) to keep hidden. The reason the student wasn‚Äôt disqualified: he documented his approach and we had not created a rule against this. A new feature of the contests is averaging over multiple seeds (obvious to scientists, yes) so that the signal returned from the contest is not as direct.Below is a summary of the ‚Äòwow‚Äô contest submission, it seemed like the student may have used some shady practices to hard-code solutions (hard coding will remove the computation time penalty on score), but they set up a minor class competition as a serious engineering problem. Here‚Äôs how in some of his own words:There are some serious insights in this process, combined with the force of will and motivation to get it done. So what it takes to be a top student at a top CS university is the ability and the will the walk oneself through this kind of rigorous implementation. I would not say I have that level of fine tuning ‚Äî maybe that‚Äôs why I am a graduate student and not a software engineer.The brute force solution is all about building a better toolkit, but ultimately the student lost to a clever solution that is from one stroke of genius.The top scorer in a class of 900 students was the one that made a change to the problem setting that made their score so much higher (10% margin). In a game penalizing extra actions, this student made 3 of the agents take no actions, and solved the game with one search agent.Score ‚Äî 1327.This is the other half of the equation to brute force engineering. It‚Äôs the stroke of insight that seems simple post-hoc, but so few have.The best students find the ways to win, and often result in the rules of the future. As course staff, the detail is impressive. This is the kind of effort that gets products out the door, and I strongly stand by these students‚Äô scores. It‚Äôs not a requirement to be successful to have these types of effort and insights, but they can take you very far.I choose to define my own success on how I perform, so I don‚Äôt worry about trying to replicate any crazy win like this. You can have a great career through consistency and enjoyment, but it‚Äôs fun to see how some of the best minds break problems down.I completed my undergrad almost 3 years ago at Cornell University, and it was almost 6 years before I was really trying to make a name for myself in my first competitive engineering classes. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just a change of perspective, but I have been impressed by the students. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be rewarded for their hard work.More thoughts on lecturing can be found here.WRITTEN BY"

Also when performed properly, visualizing data can reduce or help mitigate bias in data interpretation.One of my favorite types of visualizations is animated choropleth maps. Given that there‚Äôs a pandemic going on right now, I thought that now would be a good time to demonstrate the power of animated choropleth maps.In this article, you‚Äôll learn the following:A choropleth map is a type of thematic map where areas or regions are shaded in proportion to a given data variable.Static choropleth maps are most useful when you want to compare a desired variable by region. For example, if you wanted to compare the crime rate of each state in the US at a given moment, you could visualize it with a static choropleth.An animated or dynamic choropleth map is similar to a static choropleth map, except that you can compare a variable by region, over time. This adds a third dimension of information and is what makes these visualizations so interesting and powerful.The data that I used to create the following visualizations is the Novel Corona Virus 2019 dataset from Kaggle, which can be found here. The dataset is a composite of multiple sources including the World Health Organization, National Health Commission of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, and the United States Centers for Disease Control.Note: If any one of these sources fails to provide accurate and timely data, the visualizations may be skewed or inaccurate.Below is a static choropleth of the total number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus by country as of March 28, 2020. You can see that the countries with the leading number of cases include the US, China, and Italy, along with a couple of other European countries.The code to create this is as follows:Notice that all you‚Äôre really doing is setting up a couple of parameters to refer to specific variables in your dataset, like locations, locationmode, and z. The rest of the code is used to change the appearance of the choropleth map.You can see how much more effective and engaging an animated choropleth map is compared to a static one. Here, we‚Äôre looking at the total number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus by country over time. You can see how China has had the most number of cases by far until very recently.The code to create this is as follows:If you like my work and want to support me‚Ä¶WRITTEN BY"

Without Pandas and NumPy, we would be left deserted in this huge world of data analytics and science. Today, I am going to share 12 amazing Pandas and NumPy functions that will make your life and analysis much easier than before. In the end, you can find a Jupyter Notebook for the code used in this article.Let‚Äôs start with NumPy:NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.NumPy has this amazing function which can find N largest values index. The output will be the N largest values index, and then we can sort the values if needed.2. allclose()Allclose() is used for matching two arrays and getting the output in terms of a boolean value. It will return False if items in two arrays are not equal within a tolerance. It is a great way to check if two arrays are similar, which can actually be difficult to implement manually.3. clip()Clip() is used to keep values in an array within an interval. Sometimes, we need to keep the values within an upper and lower limit. For the mentioned purpose, we can make use of NumPy‚Äôs clip(). Given an interval, values outside the interval are clipped to the interval edges.4. extract()Extract() as the name goes, is used to extract specific elements from an array based on a certain condition. With extract(), we can also use conditions like and and or.5. where()Where() is used to return elements from an array that satisfy a certain condition. It returns the index position of values that fall in a certain condition. This is almost similar to the where condition that we use in SQL, I‚Äôll demonstrate that in the examples below.6. percentile()Percentile() is used to compute the nth percentile of the array elements along the specified axis.Let me know if you‚Äôve used them earlier and how far did it help you. Let‚Äôs move on to the amazing Pandas.Pandas:pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time-series data both easy and intuitive.pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:You might already be aware of the use of read_csv function. But, most of us still make a mistake of reading the entire .csv file even when it is not required. Let‚Äôs consider a situation where we are unaware of the columns and the data present in a .csv file of 10gb, reading whole .csv file here would not be a smart decision because it would be the unnecessary use of our memory and would take a lot of time. We can just import a few rows from the .csv file and then proceed further as per our need.2. map()The map() function is used to map values of Series according to input correspondence. Used for substituting each value in a Series with another value, that may be derived from a function, a dict or a Series.3. apply()The apply() allows the users to pass a function and apply it on every single value of the Pandas series.4. isin()The isin() is used to filter data frames. isin() helps in selecting rows with having a particular(or Multiple) value in a particular column. It is the most useful function I‚Äôve come across.5. copy()The copy() is used to create a copy of a Pandas object. When you assign a data frame to another data frame, its value changes when you make changes in the other one. To prevent the mentioned issue, we can make use of copy().6. select_dtypes()The select_dtypes() function returns a subset of the data frame's columns based on the column dtypes. The parameters of this function can be set to include all the columns having some specific data type or it could be set to exclude all those columns which has some specific data types.Bonus:pivot_table()The most amazing and useful function of pandas is pivot_table. If you hesitate to use groupby and want to extend its functionalities then you can very well use the pivot_table. If you‚Äôre aware of how pivot table works in excel, then it‚Äôs might be a piece of cake for you. Levels in the pivot table will be stored in MultiIndex objects (hierarchical indexes) on the index and columns of the result DataFrame.Do let me know down below in the comments if you guys have come across or used any other amazing functions. I would love to know more about them.Jupyter Notebook (Code used) : https://github.com/kunaldhariwal/Medium-12-Amazing-Pandas-NumPy-FunctionsLinkedIn: https://bit.ly/2u4YPoFI hope that this has helped you to enhance your knowledge base :)Follow me for more!Thanks for your read and valuable time!WRITTEN BY"
19,Machine learning is still too hard to use,https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-is-still-too-hard-to-use-e344773725af?source=extreme_main_feed---------22-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"Disclaimer: The following is based on my observations of machine learning teams ‚Äî not an academic survey of the industry. For context, I‚Äôm a contributor to Cortex, an open source platform for deploying models in production.Take something ubiquitous in software, like a database. What does it mean to build one? To a Postgres contributor, ‚Äúcreating a database‚Äù looks like a million lines of C. To a Rails dev, it looks like rake db:create.Obviously, neither are wrong, they just represent different levels of abstraction, appropriate for the different focuses of each engineer.This is how software builds on itself. The basic software that powers modern applications‚Äîdatabases, web servers, request routers, hashing libraries, etc.‚Äîbecome widespread in no small part due to the layers of abstraction that make them accessible to non-specialists.Machine learning has historically lacked that layer of abstraction, limiting its adoption. Now, however, things are changing. There is a new wave of projects focused specifically making applied machine learning easier.In order to use machine learning in production, you need:Any project using ML, as a result, needs to be staffed by several specialists. This is a bottleneck that has to be removed.It should to be possible for a developer with little background in machine learning to use it in production, just as a developer with no background in cryptography can still apply hashing libraries to secure user data.Fortunately, this is finally happening.In order for applied ML to become widespread, a developer must be able to take a high level understanding of machine learning‚Äîwhat is a model, fine tuning, inference, etc.‚Äîand using available abstractions, build an app.Many of the necessary abstractions are already being worked on, and they fall into a few key areas of focus:The reality is that for many of applied machine learning‚Äôs use cases, there is no need to train a new model from scratch.For example, if you are developing a conversational agent, Google‚Äôs Meena is almost certainly going to outperform your model. If you‚Äôre developing a text generator, you should use OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-2 instead of building your own from scratch. For object detection, a model like YOLOv3 is probably your best bet.Thanks to transfer learning‚Äîa process in which the ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù of a neural network is fine tuned to a new domain‚Äîyou can take a relatively small amount of data and fine tune these open source, state-of-the-art models to your task.For example, with new libraries like gpt-2-simple, you can fine tune GPT-2 using a simple command line interface:With this layer of abstraction, developers don‚Äôt need deep ML expertise‚Äîthey just need to know what fine tuning is.And gpt-2-simple is far from the only training abstraction available. Google‚Äôs Cloud AutoML gives users a GUI that allows them to select their dataset and automatically train a new model, no code necessary:Writing about AutoML, Sundar Pichai said ‚ÄúWe hope AutoML will take an ability that a few PhDs have today and will make it possible in three to five years for hundreds of thousands of developers to design new neural nets for their particular needs.‚ÄùOkay, so it‚Äôs easier to get a trained model for your particular task. How do you generate predictions from that model?There are a ton of projects which offer model serving functionality, many of which are connected to popular ML frameworks. TensorFlow, for example, has TF Serving, and ONNX has ONNX Runtime.Outside of the tech giants, there are also a number of independent open source projects working on this problem. For example, Bert Extractive Summarizer is a project that makes it easy to extract summaries of text using Google‚Äôs BERT. Below is an example from the docs:Generating a prediction with the library is as simple as an import statement and a call to Summarizer().As more projects like these continue to launch and develop, it becomes easier for developers to generate predictions from models without having to dig into the model itself.The final bottleneck is infrastructure.Serving predictions for a toy application is straightforward, but when your application needs to scale, things get difficult. Using GPT-2 as an example:In order to handle even a small surge in users, your infrastructure would need to scale up many replicas of your application. This means containerizing your model with Docker, orchestrating your containers with Kubernetes, and configuring your autoscaling with whatever cloud platform you use.Building the infrastructure to handle machine learning deployments requires learning an entire stack of tools, many of which will not be familiar to most developers who don‚Äôt have devops backgrounds:In order for machine learning to become accessible to developers, machine learning infrastructure needs to also be abstracted. This is where projects like Cortex (full disclosure: I‚Äôm a contributor) come in.Cortex abstracts away the underlying devops of model deployment with a config file and a CLI:The goal of projects like Cortex is simple: Take a trained model, and turn it into a prediction API that any developer can use.Let me be clear, the underlying math behind machine learning will always be hard. No one is a machine learning expert just because they can call a predict() function. The point is that a developer shouldn‚Äôt have to be a machine learning expert (or devops expert, for that matter) to use ML in their application.The machine learning ecosystem is finally focusing on making applied ML easier. A developer with just a little knowledge can fine tune a state-of-the-art model, wrap it in an API, and deploy it on scalable infrastructure using open source, intuitive abstractions.As a result, applied machine learning is about to become easier‚Äîand by extension, accessible to virtually all developers.WRITTEN BY"

As a machine learning enthusiast, it is important to understand the sub-processes of NLP.Here I would like to share one of the buzz words used in NLP with (link to notebook attached at the bottom) code examples. ‚ÄúBAG OF WORDS!!!‚Äù.Bag of words is a method that is used to find out the important topics in a text (paragraph). What are the topics? let‚Äôs say you are reading the below paragraph,[Text Credits: https://www.atozessays.com/animals/essay-on-cat/]As a human when you are reading this, you know this paragraph is about the cat. Cat is an important topic in the above paragraph.

If you want to follow along in a notebook, you can get the notebook over here.This goal is not to give an exhaustive overview of text mining, but to quickstart your thinking and give ideas for further enhancements.Step 1: Data
For teaching purposes, we start with a very very small data set of 6 reviews.
Data often comes from web scraping review websites, because they are good sources of data with at the same time a raw text and a numeric evaluation.Step 2: Data preparation
The data will often have to be cleaned more than in this example, eg regex, or python string operations.The real challenge of text mining is converting text to numerical data. This is often done in two steps:Step 2a: LancasterStemmer to bring words back to their base formStep 2b: CountVecorizer to apply Bag Of Word (basically a word count) for vectorizing (that means converting text data into numerical data)Step 3: Machine Learning
Since the text has been converted to numeric data, just use any method that you could use on regular data!I hope this short example helps you on your journey. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask any questions in the comments. Thanks for reading!Link to the complete notebook: over here.WRITTEN BY"
23,How To Get Started with Deep Learning,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-started-with-deep-learning-1f4e9f9b221e?source=extreme_main_feed---------26-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"I recently sent out a poll to people who subscribe to my email list and asked what they were most interested in learning.About 86 percent said deep learning.That blew my mind. I knew deep learning was a hot topic, but I had no idea just how interested people were in learning more.So ‚Äî I thought I would write up how I would start learning deep learning if I were to start today.Unsurprisingly, in my opinion, the best place to start is with Andrew Ng‚Äôs deep learning specialization.Andrew Ng has an incredible gift for teaching and does a great job starting from the basics and working up to image and text processing using deep learning. The courses in this specialization are:What I love above his approach is he helps you understand how to improve and structure your projects before going into more advanced architectures. I find this bottom-up style approach to be very approachable for beginners. This course also does an excellent job introducing you to the concept of attention in networks which is an extremely important idea for state-of-the-art architectures.One of the downsides, in my opinion, is the course is in TensorFlow. That isn‚Äôt a huge downside as TensorFlow has improved, but I much prefer PyTorch. What I did, and would recommend you do, is do all the homework in PyTorch. Not only will this allow you to get exposure to both TensorFlow and PyTorch code, but it will also ensure you understand the concepts because you won‚Äôt be able to lean too heavily on any of the provided code.Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas have done a lot to make deep learning more approachable.They do what I would call a top-to-bottom approach where they start at a very high level and start filling in the details. I actually find this approach a bit confusing if you have no deep learning experience. That is why I recommend you start with Andrew Ng‚Äôs course.You might think this course isn‚Äôt worth taking in addition to Andrew Ng‚Äôs course since it is also an introductory course, but I find the style of teaching and the subject matter covered is actually fairly different. While you will definitely get subjects which are review from Andrew‚Äôs course, I think seeing those subjects in a different way is very valuable.This course will also discuss deep learning in a very applied sense putting a focus on topics that they have found valuable when applying deep learning to real-world problems without Google level compute.The course uses a mixture of PyTorch and their own library built on top of PyTorch called fastai. Fastai is a very high-level library that can allow you to use best practices and state-of-the-art models with only a few lines of code. While that is nice, I still prefer writing straight PyTorch code because it will increase your understanding of what is happening underneath and tends not to be too difficult.If you enjoy this course, you could also consider taking the second part of the course which is more advanced. The course basically walks you through how they built the fastai library, which requires you to dive more deeply into the code and fundamentals.At this point, you should have a really solid grasp of the fundamentals of deep learning.You‚Äôve been taught in two different styles by two of the best teachers in the world.I think where people usually get tripped up with deep learning is they don‚Äôt spend enough time really understanding the fundamentals. I‚Äôm not even referring to the mathematics behind the algorithms. I‚Äôm talking about the core concepts, building blocks, and issues. If you don‚Äôt feel like you fully grasped the concepts from the previous two courses, go back and review.If you‚Äôre feeling good, move forward with implementing a paper.This might sounds scary, but its almost certainly not as scary as you think. In fact, one of the reasons I love PyTorch so much, is I find I can almost take the architecture from a paper, type it into Python using PyTorch, and it works.One paper I would recommend is GoogLeNet. This paper is a bit older, so it won‚Äôt use any unknown building blocks, it is well written, and I don‚Äôt believe it is covered in any of the courses in much depth.Sit down with your paper of choice and just work through it so you understand it, convert it to code, and apply it to a standard dataset to make sure you implementation worked. Not only will this help you understand the paper, but it will build your confidence in order to tackle other papers without fear.The last step in this process is to just continue to find new papers and implement them. Deep learning is moving so quickly as a field that in order to stay on top of state-of-the-art architectures, you will need to be comfortable reading and implementing papers.Use the confidence you built from implementing your first paper and don‚Äôt fear to take the time to sit down and digest a paper. In my opinion, that is the best way to continue to learn. You‚Äôll find that for the most impactful papers, others will have written incredibly great blog posts helping you dissect the paper. Leverage those!If you don‚Äôt find one, then write one after you understand it!Then, slowly, over time, you will continue to build on your foundational deep learning knowledge until you find others consider you an expert and are impressed with your depth of knowledge.So while it is a process that takes time, it is a journey that I believe most can successfully undertake with dedication.Interested in learning more about Python data analysis and visualization?

24,"Why our machine learning platform supports Python, not R",https://towardsdatascience.com/why-our-machine-learning-platform-supports-python-not-r-b2e0c5c5d06d?source=extreme_main_feed---------27-59--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"Disclaimer: The following is based on my observations ‚Äî not an academic survey of the industry. For context, I‚Äôm a contributor to Cortex, an open source machine learning platform (the ‚Äúour‚Äù in this article‚Äôs title).There are dozens of articles written comparing the relative merits of Python and R for data science, and this isn‚Äôt one of them.Instead, this an article about the divergence of data analysts and machine learning engineers, and their differing needs in a programming language.The simple version is that machine learning engineers are, fundamentally, software engineers, and they use programming languages designed for software engineering‚Äînot statistics.This may sound fairly obvious, but it represents a change in the machine learning ecosystem, one that is worth diving into further.Comparisons of R and Python often highlight perceived advantages of either language that are, at best, marginal and subjective. While some believe R‚Äôs out-of-the-box statistical functions provide an advantage over Python, which requires the use of third party libraries like NumPy, those differences aren‚Äôt that impactful.The simple truth is that R and Python are both completely adequate for the analysis of data.For example, say you want to run a simple linear regression model on some data, like housing prices. In R, it would look something like this:Here it is in Python:The differences aren‚Äôt incredible. Some people may feel particularly attached to the syntax of one language, or may prefer R‚Äôs default plotting library (ggplot2) over Matplotlib or other Python options. Others will point out that Python is more performant than R.The reality is, if all you want to do is analyze data, either language will get the job done fine.The needs of a company that is analyzing data to learn about their business‚Äîbusiness intelligence, in other words‚Äîare different than those of a company for whom machine learning is an actual part of their product.As Adam Waksman, Head of Core Technology at Foursquare, explains:‚ÄúA lot of times when companies say they have a ‚Äúdata science team‚Äù, they mean they have an analytics support function. At Foursquare, where machine learning models are a big chunk of our product‚Ä¶. we think of data science as part of our product development team‚ÄùWaksman continues to explain that at Foursquare, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a data science department ‚Äî we have an engineering department that cuts across a lot of functions.‚ÄùThe needs of machine learning engineers are different. Let‚Äôs look at a real example.To build a customer service bot for your company, you‚Äôd probably deploy your model as a microservice, which would take customer input and return a response to be rendered within the bot‚Äôs frontend.In building this API, you‚Äôd need to:In other words, machine learning engineers have to deal with engineering concerns, where Python is the better choice.To understand the emergence of machine learning engineering, it is useful to look at what happened in a related field, web development.In 2000, there was only one product that relied on asynchronous communication between the client and server‚ÄîOutlook Web Access. The team at Microsoft working on Outlook Web Access was the same team that invented XMLHTTP, the technology that made background HTTP requests possible.In other words, the only people who could build asynchronous apps were the people who invented the technology that enabled them.Not long ago, the same was true of machine learning. The only companies building products with machine learning also had sizable machine learning research teams, like Google, Facebook, and Netflix.However, it didn‚Äôt take long for the web development field to split into researchers and practitioners. While researchers still work on new technologies and frameworks‚Äîtypically while employed by larger organizations‚Äîpractitioners mostly use these inventions to build products.A similar trend is happening in machine learning. Machine learning engineers are emerging as practitioners who build ML-powered products using state-of-the-art models and frameworks produced by large companies and research labs.For example, Nick Walton built AI Dungeon, an ML-driven choose your own adventure game, at a hackathon using a finetuned version of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-2:Similarly to how most web developers don‚Äôt design their own database or framework, Walton did not invent his own model architecture. Instead, he used the outputs of machine learning researchers to build a new product.Practitioners like Walton, who are focused on building software, need to work in a language that suits itself to building software‚Äînot dashboards.Business intelligence and data analysis will always exist, and within those communities, R will remain a popular choice. ML engineering, however, has moved on.More and more, we are seeing teams like Foursquare, for whom data science and machine learning are matters of product development and engineering. The people responsible for them aren‚Äôt data analysts, they‚Äôre engineers (in terms of responsibilities, not titles), and they use tools and languages familiar to software engineers‚Äîlike Python.R will always be a valid tool for generating dashboards and reports. Building a predictive ETA feature for your ridesharing app, a content recommendation engine for your streaming service, or a face recognizer for your photo app, however, is a job for machine learning engineers and Python.We built Cortex for machine learning engineers because we, originally, were software engineers who wanted to use machine learning. Our concerns had less to do with designing new models, and more to do with engineering problems, like:In other words, we built a platform for machine learning engineers, not data analysts, and that meant supporting Python over R.WRITTEN BY"
25,Google Believes Machine Learning Frameworks Need Five Key Things to Reach Mainstream Developers,https://towardsdatascience.com/google-believes-machine-learning-frameworks-need-five-key-things-to-reach-mainstream-developers-109698b46167?source=extreme_main_feed---------28-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"Machine learning(ML) could be the most important element of the next generation of software applications and, yet, its usage its constrained to high skilled developers. Differently from previous technology trends, machine learning is not showing a clear transition path into mainstream developer adoption. Part of that friction is due to the fact that most machine learning frameworks still require a very high entry point in terms of computer science knowledge. Recently, Google Research published a paper that outlined five key principles to break that friction point and design machine learning frameworks that can be adopted by a broader range of developers.In a famous article published in 1978, Dr. Pauline R. Clance described a phenomenon in which accomplished individuals experience of self-perceived intellectual phoniness or the feeling of being a fraud. Dr. Clance referred to this phenomenon as the ‚Äúimpostor syndrome‚Äù which has become a common term in modern psychology. The impostor syndrome is present across all sorts of areas of a modern society but its definitely prevalent in scenarios that require a highly intellectual skills. I believe a version of that phenomenon is negatively influencing the adoption of machine learning technologies as many developers believe they don‚Äôt have the necessary mathematical and computer science skills to jump into the space.The industry to software development technologies have been a constant quest to lover the entry point to increase adoption. From the early programming languages to recent movements such as mobile developments, software development technologies undergoes several simplification cycles to attract broader groups of developers. Since the early days of programming languages and graphical interfaces, most software development stacks have created layers upon layers of abstractions that hide the underlying computer science details. Part of the massive developer adoption experienced by mobile and web technologies relied on attracting developers many of which are ‚Äútinkers‚Äù and doers without a computer science background. That path towards simplification doesn‚Äôt seem very obvious in the case of machine learning.Google‚Äôs research correctly uncovered that many developers fear to get into machine learning technologies because they lack the mathematical skills required. Despite plenty of evidence of self-taught hackers tinkering with machine learning models, most developer see machine learning specialists as people with deep knowledge of linear algebra and statistics; a text-book definition of the impostor syndrome. In my opinion, there are several factors that are not helping to mitigate this challenge:1) Mathematical terminology in ML frameworks documentation: Today, the documentation of most machine learning frameworks reads like a math class rather than a developer framework.2) Acceleration of artificial intelligence(AI) research: The rapid growth of AI research is a fascinating thing. However, very regularly machine learning frameworks are forced to adapt new research techniques that lack a proper developer experience.3) Lack of ML lifecycle management tools: The process debugging or testing machine learning models feels like a never ending exercise of tuning hundreds of obscure parameters that are not understood by mainstream developers. The existing toolset is the machine learning space is still too limited for mainstream adoption.Designing better machine learning frameworks to streamline developer adoption is one of the pivotal challenges of the next decade of the AI space. Based on their research, Google identified five key aspects that machine learning framework designers should consider to lower the entry points for developers:Despite ongoing efforts to lower the barriers to machine learning, and despite a preponderance of ML-newcomers aspiring to learn, surprisingly many developers perceived current resources to be intended for more advanced audiences. New machine learning frameworks should abstract these mathematical models into digestible, practical concepts. For instance, most developer have no idea what a gradient-descent is, but they can certainly understand tuning the learning rate of a model.Today, most tutorials that highlight best practices in machine learning require substantial lines of code. Abstracting best practices into small code-blocks that can be used by beginner developers is essential to help developers who prefer a ‚Äúlearning by doing‚Äù approach to mater a new technology.Complementing the previous point, seems important to include canonical models that could help developers casually become aware of machine learning idiosyncrasies from within their existing programming workflow. In addition to lower the entry point for developers, it can also help to enforce the consistency across programs.Decisions such as which parameter to fine-tune first or how many layers to use in a model can require years of machine learning development experience. Building better visualization and interpretability tools that use strategic pointers can help developers overcome this challenge.The lifecycle of machine learning applications is different from previous technology trends. Specifically, machine learning applications require heavy experimentation and trial and error. Despite using the best model for a specific scenario, it is required to conduct dozens and dozens of experiments in order to ensure its optimal performance. Facilitating the experimentation process should be another key focus on future machine learning frameworks.These are some of the recommendations Google Research believes are required to streamline the adoption of machine learning frameworks. Ultimately, new developer stacks need to balance incorporating new research methods with a simple developer experience that facilitates the adoption by a broader range of developers.WRITTEN BY"

Gen. Jack Shanahan gives an insight into the near future of AI-based warfare in the United States. Shanahan is the head of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), which uses its AI expertise to support all branches of the U.S. military and review all AI defense projects that cost more than $15 million.The center is also expected to soon have branch offices in Silicon Valley and large university cities, where their own AI projects are being developed.Cooperation with AI researchers and the tech giants Google, IBM, Microsoft or Amazon is part of the big plan. ‚ÄúThere are some of the greatest talents in the world right now,‚Äù says Shanahan. ‚ÄúMost of the problems we have discovered in the past and will discover in the future have commercial applications.‚ÄùThese applications should be used for military scenarios . This is how the circle closes: The development of widespread AI applications has often been supported by grants from the military.A prominent example is the ‚ÄúGrand Challenge‚Äù of the Pentagon research institute (DARPA), which is the basis of the current boom in autonomous vehicles.The head of the JAIC knows what he is talking about when the military and the economy interact : Shanahan led the development of the controversial AI project Maven. It relies on image analysis AIs to enable real-time monitoring of large areas of land through aerial photography. This should automate the reconnaissance of enemy troop movements.Project Maven has been developed by Google and the Department of Defense since 2017. In 2018, Google employees protested and the company withdrew from the project .In summer 2018, Google published new guidelines for AI development that rule out future participation in the development of AI-based weapons .Google‚Äôs withdrawal did not mean the end of Project Maven: Peter Thiels Palantir took over the project . The Air Force and Marine Corps plan to deploy Maven with special drones like the Global Hawk, each of which is to visually monitor up to 100 square kilometers.Maven has made it clear how urgently the US military needs its own cloud , says Shanahan. During the development, video recordings and updates for the system were transported by truck between military installations. Maven is now receiving monthly updates.The solution to the cloud problem should be JEDI : The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure should enable data exchange via a US military cloud. In October, Microsoft secured the US military‚Äôs 10 billion order .Microsoft was able to outperform its competitors Amazon, Oracle and IBM. Google did not participate in the bidding competition ‚Äî in accordance with its own ethics guidelines.Shanahan wants to avoid prejudices in the data , errors in training or over- adapted algorithms with a test and evaluation program. Pilot projects are already underway: one is to predict impending material failure in the widespread UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, another is to accelerate artillery support.If AI systems are to predict war patterns or strategies at some point , they must become more understandable. In addition to tech companies such as Google or Facebook , the Pentagon‚Äôs research department (DARPA) also invests in ‚Äúexplainable AI‚Äù. However, the fundamental question here is whether the human brain does not also act as a black box .In addition, commanders should be trained in AI technologies, says Shanahan. Participation in current military AI projects should contribute to this. Shanahan gives the prediction of flood and forest fire disasters as an example. Commanding officers should learn what is possible with AI and what is not ‚Äî otherwise all plans are just science fiction, he says.The billion sums that China is investing in AI development are not science fiction. AI will play a central role in a possible conflict between the United States and China , Shanahan says: ‚ÄúIn 20 years, algorithms will compete against each other.All U.S. military departments are working on AI-based weapon systems , including automated guns, a stealth drone as a wingman for human pilots, and an autonomous fleet for the navy.The USA wants to do without so-called ‚Äúkiller robots‚Äù. Shanahan calls these autonomous killing machines a bit more complicated: ‚Äúunsupervised, independent self-targeting systems that make decisions about life and death‚Äù. The last decision about life and death must always be made by a person, says Shanahan.That is exactly what is in a draft of an AI ethics directive that the Pentagon published in October. Shanahan emphasizes that he is involved in the ethical debates and is firmly opposed to killer robots. He plans to hire an ethicist at the JAIC.The interview with Shanahan makes it clear that the great AI revolution in the military is only just beginning. This can also be seen in the presumed budget of the JAIC : in 2019 it was just under $ 90 million. In 2020, it should already be $ 414 million, about a quarter of the Pentagon‚Äôs estimated AI budget of $ 4 billion.For comparison, the total budget of the U.S. Armed Forces in 2019 is almost $ 700 billion. Around 13 billion are planned for space projects.WRITTEN BY"

However, I sometimes have to deal with people who don‚Äôt exactly understand this role in the organization nor the field in general. This, quite frankly, is what makes things a little bit frustrating, for me and also for a lot of people I know.Before you keep reading, I should mention that I don‚Äôt aim to discourage anyone from aspiring to this role. I‚Äôm only stating some negative aspects that occur in the industry in general and the possible solutions for avoiding them.In principle, this is fine. I don‚Äôt understand what most of the people do either. What I do not get, however, is the total lack of interest and curiosity of some parties in learning about what you do while helping them. I don‚Äôt mean they should get every small algorithmic detail of your neural network for example, but at least, they should get to know your approach, your way of solving the problem. Sometimes, it‚Äôs as if you were commissioned with the painful dirty task that no one cares about.
Some project managers take zero interest in what you‚Äôre doing unless you‚Äôre done doing it. I think these fellas bring management to a whole new level.Oh! you‚Äôre a data scientist? You must be really good with the numbers. Why don‚Äôt you have a look at my files and crunch the data? I hear your ‚Äúpyton‚Äù thing can pops out the magic real quick. Here, go play with my files and come see me when you‚Äôre done.‚Äî What to do?
To make everybody on the same page, one solution is to provide training and awareness to the teams who have no technical background. This goes through internal workshops, certifications or MOOC subscriptions in technical broad topics such as introductory lectures to machine learning, deep learning or NLP. When building knowledge in these areas, teammates become proactive and more engaged in the building process. Project managers become also aware of the challenges.Well, this worked quite well ten years ago when the field started to emerge and the words Hadoop and Spark were all over the place. You could stack all the buzzwords you know and hope for a big check (and it worked!).This isn‚Äôt 2010 anymore. Companies now pay close attention to what you‚Äôre willing to sell. They know the market, the competitors and the challenges. They‚Äôve scanned merely everything, thorougly. They also know what‚Äôs feasible and what‚Äôs not. If you don‚Äôt stand out of the crowd and are not clear enough about your value proposition and the technical expertise that your data science team can bring, you‚Äôre most likely to lose the deal.Of course, despite all of this, there is always some ballsy guy in a suit to make this kind of inspirational statement:Let‚Äôs throw a little bit of data science here and there to beef up our pitch and make the client pay a buttload of money!Isn‚Äôt that beautiful?‚Äî What to do?
Don‚Äôt act as if a data scientist would completely change and disrupt your organization. The market starts to know what the limitations are. Be in line with the market.We all know this feeling, it sucks. You bust your a** working hard and some other guy present your results and takes all the credit. This is common everywhere and happens even more when you work in a data science team in collaboration with business partners.If you‚Äôre valuable to the team, your colleagues should naturally let you shine in front of the stakeholders. Your voice is then heard and engaged in the decision process.If you‚Äôre feeling, however, that you‚Äôre treated like an interchangeable resource or put aside working in the shadow and producing numbers for those who speak, maybe it‚Äôs time to rethink your position.‚Äî What to do?
Everyone is important when building a data product. This should not only be a statement that we tell ourselves. It must materialize in our meetings, presentations, and daily relationships.Well, as tempting as it sounds, this is not as easy as we think. Just because we‚Äôre equipped with the tools doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that you can expect immediate actionable results. This requires building knowledge about the business, forging the right intuitions and the assumptions. This takes time and it‚Äôs a learning process.Let‚Äôs crunch the data and make it speak‚Äî What to do?
Accept the fact that a data scientist has to spend a substantial amount of time learning about the business and building his own intuitions about it. This goes through interviewing different actors in the organization, running all sorts of analyses on the data, experimenting, failing, and getting continuous constructive feedback.
If you also want to provide the best conditions for your data science teams, make sure you have, at least, clean data pipelines with clear descriptions.There‚Äôs still a strong misconception about the role of the data scientist. Not only non-technical executives but other colleagues in tech believe that data scientists know their way around Spark, Hadoop, SQL, TensorFlow, NLP, AWS, production-level applications, docker and more. It‚Äôs great to master these tools, but this process takes several years and a lot of experience.If you‚Äôre a data scientist and you‚Äôre applying for a company that mentions all of these techy words in one application, double-check the company. It‚Äôs possible that it hasn‚Äôt a clear vision of its data strategy nor a clear definition of the role it‚Äôs hiring for.We need to fix our data problems. Let‚Äôs hire a data scientist.‚Äî What to do?
A data scientist is not always the ultimate solution to your data problems. Double-check before hiring. Maybe what you need is a data analyst or a back-end developer. A data scientist is not a ninja that masters everything.If you want your team to succeed in building whatever you intend to build, make sure you surround yourself with complementary skills.At the delivery level:At the management level:This is based on a compilation of discussions and several feedbacks coming from friends and colleagues.If you have anything to add, don‚Äôt hesitate to drop a comment!Thanks for reading! Take care.WRITTEN BY"

No problem!,https://towardsdatascience.com/no-labels-no-problem-30024984681d?source=extreme_main_feed---------31-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"There is a certain irony that machine learning, a tool used for the automation of tasks and processes, often starts with the highly manual process of data labelling.The task of creating labels to teach computers new tasks is quickly becoming the blue collar job of the 21st century.It has created complex supply chains which often end in lower income countries such as Kenya, India and the Philippines. Whilst this new industry is creating thousands of jobs, workers can be underpaid and exploited.The market for data labelling passed $500 million in 2018 and it will reach $1.2 billion by 2023. It accounts for 80 percent of the time spent building A.I. technology.A.I. Is Learning From Humans. Many Humans. New York TimesThe ability, therefore, to automate the process for creating data labels is highly desirable from a cost, time and even ethical standpoint.In this post, we will explore how this can be achieved through a worked example in Python using the excellent Snorkel library.Snorkel is a really innovative concept; create a series of ‚Äòmessy‚Äô label functions and combine these in an intelligent way to build labels for a data set. These labels can then be used to train a machine learning model in exactly the same way as in a standard machine learning workflow. Whilst it is outside the scope of this post it is worth noting that the library also helps to facilitate the process of augmenting training sets and also monitoring key areas of a dataset to ensure a model is trained to handle these effectively.Snorkel itself has been around since 2016 but has continued to evolve. It is now used by many of the big names in the industry (Google, IBM, Intel). Version 0.9 in 2019 brought with it a more sophisticated way of building a label model, as well as a suite of well documented tutorials covering all of the key areas of the software. Even if you have come across it before, with these updates it is worth a second look.Before we get started with a worked example, it is worth considering when you should use this library over a traditional (manual) approach of creating labels. If the answer to all of the below is ‚ÄòYes‚Äô then it would be worth considering Snorkel:The process for using Snorkel is a simple one:This process is iterative and you will find yourself evaluating the results and re-thinking and refining the label functions to improve the output.Let's take a real life problem to show how Snorkel can be used a machine learning pipeline.We will be trying to split out ‚Äòframeworks‚Äô from ‚Äòcontracts‚Äô in an open source commercial dataset (from Contracts Finder, a UK transparency system which logs all Government contracts above ¬£10k).What is a framework?A framework can be thought of as a ‚Äòparent agreement‚Äô. It is a way of settling the ‚ÄòTs and Cs‚Äô with one or more suppliers which then allow for contracts to be agreed without having to go through the paperwork all over again.The issue is, because there is a parent-child relationship between frameworks and contracts, this can lead to double counting when analysing the data. It is therefore important to be able to split out frameworks from contracts.The dataThe data in this example consists of a contract title, description and value. The below shows an example of what we have to work with:We have a placeholder column called ‚Äòframework‚Äô which we will be using to add our labels. The naming convention we will use is:We will start by creating a series of label functions. These can essentially be any standard Python function and can be as simple (or as complex) as you need them to be.We will start with a simple keyword search on the data set. This example searches for the phrase:‚Äúuse by uk public sector bodies‚Äùas this is only likely to occur in the descriptions of frameworks. Snorkel makes this really simple, all you have to do is wrap a standard Python function with the decorator @labeling_function():Great we have just created our first label function! We now build up a number of other functions which will help separate frameworks from contracts.Tips on creating effective labelling functionsAfter working with the library, the following guidelines should be helpful in designing effective label functions:Once you have built one or more labelling functions, you need to apply these to create a set of data points. This can be achieved using the PandasLFApplier which allows you to build these data points directly from a Pandas dataframe.Note that in this example we have a train and ‚Äòdev‚Äô set of data. The dev set is a small data set of manually labelled items (our ‚ÄòGold‚Äô labels). This makes things easier to quickly get a rough sense of how label functions are performing (the alternative to eyeballing the results produced).Once you have applied your label functions, Snorkel provides easy access to label performance by using LFAnalysisAs we have a dev set of information with labels this will provide us with the below information:The meaning of each of these is below (straight from the Snorkel documentation):Once we are happy with our label functions, we can bring these together in a probabilistic model. This is Snorkel‚Äôs ‚Äòmagic source‚Äô which combines the outputs of each of the functions and either returns the probability of a data point having a particular label, or the labels themselves.Filter the datasetDepending on the coverage of our label functions we will need to filter out some of our training data before using the labels to train a machine learning model. The reason is that some data points will not have been picked up by any of our label functions. We want to remove these items as they will add noise to the training data. Snorkel has an inbuilt function which makes this easy:You now have a training set of data with labels without having to perform any manual labelling on the dataset.You can use these as a starting point for a supervised machine learning task.As highlighted earlier, the documentation on the Snorkel is excellent and there are a number of in-depth tutorials which go into greater depth of the features available within the library:Image sources:WRITTEN BY"
29,How exactly does PCA work?,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-exactly-does-pca-work-5c342c3077fe?source=extreme_main_feed---------32-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"Principal Component Analysis is the process of compressing a lot of data into something that captures the essence of the data.PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique which finds the major patterns in data for dimensionality reduction. Reading this line for the first time may trigger a few questions:What are these patterns?How to find these patterns?What is dimensionality reduction?And what are dimensions anyway?And why to reduce them?Let‚Äôs go around each of them one by one.Assume we have a dataset with, say, 300 columns. So our dataset has 300 dimensions. Neat. But do we really need so many dimensions? We could. But most of the times, we don‚Äôt. So we need to find a fast and easy way to not just remove a certain number of features, but to capture the essence of the data of 300 dimensions in a much lesser number of transformed dimensions.Each of the 300 features would be having a certain amount of variance ‚Äî that is a change in the values throughout. If a feature describes number of floors in a particular building for 200 days, its variance will be 0. As there is no change in its value throughout. Features with 0 variance are of no use as they provide no insights. So, variance is indeed our friend! And this is the pattern I mentioned earlier.More the variance, more is the importance of that feature. As it contains more ‚Äòinformation‚Äô. A variable with 0 variance contains 0 information. Do not confuse variance with correlation! Variance is not with respect to the target variable of your data. It just states how the value of particular feature varies throughout the data.Now that we know variance, we need to find a new set of transformed feature set which can explain the variance in a much better manner. The original 300 features are used to make linear combinations of the features in order to push all the variance in a few transformed features. These transformed features are called the Principal Components.The Principal Components have now got nothing to do with the original features. We will get 300 principal components from 300 features. Now here comes the beauty of PCA ‚Äî The newly formed transformed feature set or the Principal Components will have the maximum variance explained in the first PC. The second PC will have the second highest variance and so on.For example, if the first PC explains 68% of the total variance in data, the 2nd feature explains 15% of the total variance and the next 4 features comprise of 14% variance in total. So you have 97% of the variance explained by just 6 Principal Components! Now, let‚Äôs say the next 100 features in total explain another 1% of the total variance. It makes less sense now to include 100 more dimensions just to get a percent of variance more. By taking just top 6 Principal Components , we have reduced the dimensionality from 300 to a mere 6!Let‚Äôs now consider a simpler example with only 2 features which will be easier to visualize. Below is the figure if we plot feature 1 with feature 2.What PCA (with SVD) does is, it finds the best fit line for these data points which minimizes the distance between the data points and their projections on the best fit line. Now, consider the average of the data points of feature 1 and feature 2. It will be somewhere around A. Hence, likewise PCA can also maximize the distance of the projected points on the best fit line from the point A.Shifting the line so that the point A coincides with the origin, which will make it easier to visualize.The distance d1 is the distance of the point 1 with respect to the origin. Similarly, d2,d3,d4,d5,d6 will be the respective distances of the projected points from the origin. The best fit line will have the maximum Sum of Squares of Distances. Suppose that the slope of the line is 0.25. That means the line consists of 4 parts of feature 1 and 1 part of feature 2. This would look something like :where B=4 & C=1. Hence we can easily find A by the Pythagoras Theorem, which comes out to be 4.12. PCA scales these values so that the vector A is unit length long. Hence A=1, B=4/4.12 = 0.97 & C=1/4.12 = 0.242. This unit vector A is the eigenvector! The Sum of Squared Distances d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6 is the eigenvalue. Quite straightforward! This is the linear combination of feature 1 and feature 2 I mentioned earlier. This tells us that for PC1, feature 1 is almost 4 times as important than feature 2 or in other words, it contains almost 4 times more the spread(variation) in data than feature 2.Now, the Principal Component 2 will be the vector orthogonal to PC1 as the principal components have 0 correlation among them. That will be something like the red line:From similar understanding, PC2 will have -0.242 parts of feature 1 and 0.97 parts of feature 2. This tells us that for PC2, feature 2 is almost 4 times as important than feature 1. The eigenvector and the eigenvalue can be calculated similarly for PC2. So we finally have found our Principal Components!We calculated the Sum of Squared Distances for both the principal components. If we divide those values by n-1 (where n is the sample size), we will get the variance for the respective principal component.Let us suppose that the variance for PC1 comes out to be 15 and that for PC2 comes out to be 3. Hence the total variation around both the principal components is 18. So PC1 accounts for 15/18 which is equal to 0.83 or 83% of the total variance in the data. And PC2 accounts for 3/18 which is equal to 0.17 or 17% of the total variance in the data. This is Explained Variance Ratio. This tells how much variance in the data is explained by a particular principal component. Principal components are ranked in order of their explained variance ratio. We can select top m components if the total explained variance ratio reaches a sufficient value.Principal Component Analysis reduces the dimensionality to overcome overfitting. Your model might not need all the features to give a good performance. It might give a great training score but a very low test score. In other words, it might overfit. PCA is not a feature selection or a feature elimination technique. It is more of a feature extraction technique. You might also group it under the feature engineering umbrella.That is all for this article. Refer to below excellent sources for more insights:WRITTEN BY"

However, they have a couple of drawbacks. Jupyter notebooks are great for developing machine learning models locally but it is difficult to share and collaborate on the code you produce with this tool.Additionally, there is a reasonable amount of set up required, especially if you aren‚Äôt a current user of python. You need to set up a python environment, install Jupyter and its dependencies and any other python packages you might need.Fortunately, there are tools available that allow you to run and develop python code in notebooks directly in your browser with no setup required. In this article I am going to give a brief introduction to two of these tools;Google ColaboratoryGoogle Colaboratory, often referred to as colab, is a product created by Google to allow anyone to create and run python code in the browser. It has many standard machine and data science libraries built-in including pandas and scikit-learn. You can also install practically any other python library for use in each notebook.To access colab you need to sign up for a Google account and this then gives you free access to the notebook environment and computing resources that include GPU‚Äôs.Let‚Äôs walk through a quick demo.While signed in to your Google account go to drive and select new Google Colaboratory.This opens a new empty notebook.You can view the preinstalled packages by running pip freeze .If you need to install any package that is not already available you do this by running pip install package .There are a number of ways to import data including loading files directly from Google drive. Let‚Äôs look at an example of importing data from a local CSV file.First, we run this code.You are then presented with a button to select files stored anywhere on your local system.You are now free to write code to create your machine learning model.Google colab notebooks can be shared via a link in the same way that you would share any Google docs. The recipient of the link can run and edit your code.Kaggle kernels require a Kaggle account but are also completely free to use. They are very similar to Google colab notebooks but one advantage is that they include version control.Once you have created an account you can navigate to the kernels section of the website and select New Notebook.As with colab Kaggle kernels provide a number of common python libraries as standard which you can view with pip freeze . Importing other libraries uses exactly the same method as colab, as does installing packages.Loading data is very simple. First, select File and then Add or upload data.Now you are presented with a number of options. You can either use a Kaggle data set, a kernel output file or upload your own local CSV file.As I mentioned Kaggle has version control built-in. This means that you can commit changes to your kernel, or somebody else's kernel, and track and revert back to previous versions where needed. This facilitates collaboration.This is a brief introduction to the options and functionality available within these tools. It is worth further exploring the functionality in both. I often use in-browser notebooks to provide a demo of my work to others, especially non-data scientists who may not use Jupyter Notebooks or python. Both tools can also be a great way to learn machine learning and data science without the overhead of setting up a python and notebook environment locally.Thanks for reading!I send out a monthly newsletter if you would like to join please sign up via this link.

31,Three Datasets I Often Use As Examples,https://towardsdatascience.com/three-datasets-i-often-use-as-examples-c70ec5b2f793?source=extreme_main_feed---------34-59--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"TLDR: Within the world of technology, and beyond, a play space is sometimes affectionately referred to as a sandbox. This article outlines three datasets that often serve me as sandbox examples with others at work and in other settings.W
hen establishing a data-driven culture, a successful tactic that can promote the use of a shared data-driven vocabulary and then also development of data-driven conversations is to create play spaces. The importance of engaging in data-driven conversations is that they build shared understandings of data-related ideas and topics. What is culture, other than shared ideas, language, customs, conventions, and similar?This article first explains what a dataset is. This article then provides an excerpt from, and a description of, three datasets that I often use or offer to others as shared sandbox play spaces.Wikipedia defines a dataset as ‚Äúa collection of data.‚Äù This definition is too simplistic for purposes of building a shared data-driven vocabulary, engaging in a data-driven conversation, and establishing or growing a data-driven culture. A previous article gives a better definition: A dataset is a collection of observations stored in a tabular format where each row is one observation and where each column contains a data point that pertains to a characteristic of an observation.This dataset comes from Stata Corp, the makers of Stata which is a popular statistical programming language. In a companion article, I have used this automobile dataset to illustrate why researchers and data scientists sometimes refer to columns as either dimensions or variables.Here in Figure 1a, there is one row for each vehicle model. Then for each vehicle model, there is a column for specific observable characteristics such as miles per gallon (mpg), weight (weight), length (length), etc.To build this dataset, one or more scientists referenced a catalog of information for each make and model listed on the left-most column. Then for each column, the scientist observed that vehicle‚Äôs characteristics. The results of those characteristic observations were then recorded in the dataset columns.To explore Stata‚Äôs Auto dataset on your own in Python use the code shown here. From Pandas it is possible to export the Auto dataset to CSV, as shown.The iris dataset is canonical and widely cited. Many have used this iris data as an example when demonstrating a broad range of analytical techniques. Figure 2, displays an expert of this dataset. Also shown in Figure 2 is code that will load and display an excerpt of this data.In this dataset there is an observation for each flower. There is one row per observation (one row per flower). To build this dataset, scientists collected flowers and then observed a variety of characteristics such as sepal length & width along with petal length & width. As with all datasets which have been properly configured for research or analysis, there is a column for each observable characteristic of interest and one row for each observation.Figure 3a displays an excerpt of data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). This data is publicly available from the National Center for Education Statistics. I maintain a GitHub.com repository that discusses this data.In this data, there is an observation for each institution and for each year. With the addition of a column for year, this dataset could also be called a panel or longitudinal dataset. The Auto and Iris dataset would be called cross-sectional datasets. Generally, cross-sectional data represents a single moment in time. Panel datasets represent multiple repeated observations of the same subjects over time.Given that this data includes one observation per row, per institution, (per year) it is optimized for an analysis in which the unit of analysis will be institutions of higher education over time. There are columns for specific observable characteristics. In this case the institution type (sector), the institution size (instsize), and the institution‚Äôs state (stabbr), etc.I am fond of using this dataset for demonstration purposes because it is data to which many can relate. For example, I am twice an alumni of The University of Wisconsin and I have twice been an employee of Duke University. Thus, I know these two institutions well enough to use them as test cases when I prototype, finalize, put into production, or otherwise disseminate any given analysis. I demonstrate a Wisconsin-Duke comparison below in figure 3b.I maintain a tool that retrieves from the US Department of Education‚Äôs website IPEDS data and then assembles that data in a manner that is optimized for research and analytical purposes.This article seeks to explain what a dataset is in a simple manner. Equipped with this simple definition, that is generalizable to many research and analytical tasks, individuals and organizations can better engage in high-quality data-driven discussions.Working to define, as a group, the meaning of key terms and phrases, such as ‚Äòdataset,‚Äô is an important task in the process of establishing, building, and maintaining a data-driven culture.After discussing what a dataset is, this article then gives three examples of datasets that I and others frequently reference as model datasets. Having one or more model datasets is useful for individuals and teams because they provide a shared sandbox in which thoughts and ideas about data can be tested. These shared sandboxes promote high-quality data-driven discussions which then support establishing, building, and maintaining data-driven cultures.WRITTEN BY"

Enduring love is hard. Here are 5 facts you should know before going for the first date and building a long term relationship with Data Science. Finally, you can find out how committed the community is to Data Science via a live survey.Disclaimer: all opinions are mine. I use ‚ÄúData Science‚Äù, ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAnalytics‚Äù interchangeably.Like What You Read? Follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, or Twitter.I came by an entertaining and provocative video by Wisecrack recently. It explores what true love is and the dynamics between modern-day couples. It reminded me of our relationships with ‚ÄúData Science‚Äù (or any career).Here is the gist in case you are busy:Let‚Äôs draw a parallel to a career in Data Science.You fall in love with Data Science at first sight because it‚Äôs so sexy ‚Äî well, it‚Äôs the sexiest job of the 21 century. Who won‚Äôt get carried away? So, swipe right.Then, you go out for a date with the best suit, makeup, or whatever you want to do to impress. Data Science shows off all the fantastic possibilities and fancy gadgets. In fact, Data Science likes you so much and decides to give you an offer to explore things further.Next, you ended up getting married by signing the offer (oops). In a Disney movie, this is when Cinderella and Prince Charming live happily after. The movie ends; the curtain drops; the crowd claps and cry in joy.But in reality, Prince Charming gets lazy (and probably fat). Cinderella gets grumpy (and probably wrinkly). Baby Cinderella keeps crying. King Charming gets sick. Uncle Charming starts a civil war. Finally, the Prince runs away like a coward.Now, you start to question if Data Science is for you and start looking for new jobs. The vicious cycle begins. You fall in love with something else, get frustrated, look for a way out, repeat. Getting into Data Science is just like finding relationships using Tinder.So, why don‚Äôt we focus on finding the right person (e.g. a data science career) and sustaining a good relationship?I believe everyone wants happy, fulfilling, and healthy relationships, personally and career-wise. The key to building such relationships is to understand and be honest about reality.Here are 5 important (pseudo) facts to help you do that:Fact 1: Data Science uses the best selfie filter. Employers want to portrait Data Science roles in the best light possible. This is understandable. So, ask about what they do every day. Don‚Äôt get fooled by the profile picture.Fact 2: Chores never end. ‚ÄúThere is no free lunch.‚Äù Everything comes with a cost. Being in love and having a good relationship are no exceptions. Be aware of the boring stuff you have to do to enjoy the fun of Data Science.Fact 3: Family dynamics can be complicated. Many data science teams are trying to prove value to Business, Engineering, and Product counterparts. This can cause tension, confusion, and frustration.Fact 4: Dogs are cute; kids can be annoying. Making prototypes is like having a dog. It takes less work and heart-warming. In contrast, deploying ML to production is like having kids. It takes a lot more work and is annoying when things break, especially in the middle of the night.Fact 5: Change is the only constant. Just like us, Data Science changes over time. We don‚Äôt know what it will become in the next 5 and 10 years. Being receptive and adaptive to change is critical in a relationship. Keep learning and be curious, or be left behind.Recognizing, understanding, and accepting these facts are major steps toward a healthy and sustainable relationship.So, what is real love?‚ÄúLove is above all construction that lasts. Real love is that triumphs lastingly, sometimes painfully, over the hurdles erected by time, space, and the world.‚ÄùAlain Badiou, French PhilosopherSo, is your love for Data Science real?Like What You Read?

atural language processing is an interesting field because it is thought-provoking to disambiguate the input sentence to produce the machine representation language. Take a look at the famous Groucho Marx‚Äôs joke:One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I‚Äôll never know.At the human level, there are several interpretations of this sentence. But it is almost impossible for the computer to comprehend.Nonetheless, the learning curve of NLP is not so steep and can be captivating. In this project, I will explain an introductory level of natural language processing with the Beatles and Taylor Swift song lyrics. The final goal is to compare the word usage of the Beatles and Taylor Swift song lyrics and see if we can visualize them in clusters. To achieve this goal there are 6 steps:You do not need to run the code to understand this blog. But if you are interested in it, you can folk my Github repository here. The tree structure of the folder is:The Beatles: Love Me Do, I Want to Hold Your Hand, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Come Together, Something, Eleanor Rigby, a Day in The Life, Don't Let Me Down, Help, Hey JudeTaylor Swift: Bad Blood, You Need to Calm Down, Delicate, The Man, You Belong With Me, Soon You Will Get Better, Look What You Make Me Do, Me!, Love Story, 22.We need one song to make a test, let‚Äôs take a look at the first 4 lines of ‚ÄúHey Jude‚ÄùGreat, we just finished the first step of the project.The first question we need to ask ourselves is what we are going to clean. Our goal is to reduce the complexity of the sentences and remove unmeaningful characters. To change to different songs, look at the filenames list and choose the corresponding directory to the song lyrics. From this point, I change the link to ‚ÄòData/TaylorSwift/YouNeedToCalmDown.txt' as an example because its content has more interesting characters to clean. Let‚Äôs look at the first few lines of ‚ÄúYou Need to Calm Down‚Äù by Taylor Swift.We need to remove\n and some punctuation if they exist. We want to leave the number there, it might indicate the style of the singers. Lower case all the words make it easy for processing but might make proper nouns become regular nouns. We also need to convert the word you‚Äôre to you are, I‚Äôm to I am, that‚Äôs to that is, takin‚Äô to taking but this step will be achieved at a later step.Note that I want to leave the apostrophe 'there because removing it may make a word meaningless2) TokenizationTokenization is the process of tokenizing or splitting a string, text into a list of tokens. One can think of token as parts like a word is a token in a sentence, and a sentence is a token in a paragraph.The simplest way to token a word is thesplit() method that turns a string into an array of strings. However, this method has a problem. Words such as don‚Äôt or Taylor‚Äôs are 2 different words combine. It‚Äôs hard to list all the split rules that apply for all cases. Hence, we need the help of the NLTK tokenizer. NLTK stands for Natural Language Processing Tool Kit. It is the one-stop-shop for text processing and is accessible for everyone. Let‚Äôs take a look at the NLTK functionword_tokenize and find out what it does to a random sentence.Note that word_tokenize splits the verb in negative form into verb+ n‚Äôt. It also splits exclamation and dot marks out of the word. In this case, we have already taken care of punctuation in the previous part, but it is ok to repeat. The following is the function that receives the clean version of the song and tokenizes it:According to Geek to Geek, Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word, so they can be analyzed as a single item.A few examples show how each method has different effects on our work and decide which method we want to includeThe first column is the word from our text and following by stemming and lemmatizing columns. Stemming is a crude way to process a word. It just truncates the words to convert it into a root word base on some certain rules. Sometimes it messes up the words really badly. We do not want apples becomes appl. That‚Äôs why I do not choose stemming.On the other hand, lemmatization is followed by more complicated rules. Note that in the method lemmatize has pos (part of speech) changed to ‚Äúv‚Äù (verb). Therefore, died becomes die. If we change pos to ""n"" , appleswould become apple. If we change pos to ""a"" (adjective), better would become good . There are many other layers that we can filter, but to keep it more simple, I will apply ‚Äúa‚Äù,‚Äùv‚Äù, and ‚Äún‚Äùlayers sequentially.Stop Words: A stop word is a commonly used word (such as ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúan‚Äù, ‚Äúin‚Äù) that we can simply ignore because they bring no values to our analysis. The code below shows how we can import the list of stopwords from nltkThere are 179 stopwords, but I do not want to use all of them. For this project, I think pronouns may indicate an author's perspective about the song. For example, I use ‚Äúwe‚Äù in this article because I want the readers to be on the same page with me. The word you and I repeated in the song might indicate that the song is actually the story of the author. Taylor Swift is being known for writing love stories of her past relationships, which might distinguish her from the Beatles. However, the 35th stopwords beyond might not be that‚Äôs interestingI also created a few more stopwords that are not on the list. I know what to add because I have tried different songs to understand what was missing. Let‚Äôs create a function for what we have been discussed:After having a really nice function that can clean and tokenize the song, our next step is to count how many times each word appears. The function would receive a list of tokens and return unique tokens with their counts. Note that, in the later step, we want to compare the similarity of all the songs. Therefore, the second input (optional) should be the unique tokens of all songs. Let‚Äôs take a look at the function below:Excellent! You are almost done. Now come to the most important step of the projects.TF-IDF is a combination of two individual metrics, which are the TF and IDF. TF-IDF is used when we have multiple documents. The idea is one word can appear more in one type of document than the others. The final goal of this step is to have a table of 20 songs with columns be the unique vocabs in all documents. The values in each column are corresponding weights of each word assigned by TF-IDF formulaa) Term frequencyAs the name suggested we want to find the rate of appearance the word t has in a single document. Let‚Äôs create the term frequency function and display the first 10 most common words in the whole song.The term_frequency's function is just a normalized vectorize_and_freq function using vocabs in one song.b) Inverse Document FrequencyThe inverse document frequency takes the natural log of the ratio between the total number of documents and the number of documents with the word t in it:After calculating each TF and IDF separately, let‚Äôs combine them togetherThis function takes a list of the vocab dictionary of every song and created the corresponding ‚Äútf-idf‚Äù weight for each vocab in each song. Observe that, these weights can not be 0, since the TF and IDF term are always greater than 0.Finally, we want to combine all the functions we have created into a metafunction:The output of this main function is the list of 20 songs with corresponding tf-idf weight for each word. There are 712 vocabs (root words) in 20 songs. The output above shows the tf-idf weight of some vocabs in ‚ÄúDelicate‚Äù by Taylor Swift.6) VisualizationOur goal is to plot these 20 songs on a visualizable space. However, there are 712 dimensions. There are two methods that come to my mind when talking about reducing dimensionality: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). While PCA focuses on preserving variances of data points from higher to a lower dimension, t-SNE focuses on the probability distribution of similar points. Therefore t-SNE is more appropriate in this project.Let‚Äôs define the t-SNE instance that transforms our data to 2D:Note that I change the seed to 4 because it is possible to have different results on a different run. The reason is unlike PCA, t-SNE has a non-convex objective function. The objective function is minimized using a gradient descent optimization that is initiated randomly. Let‚Äôs take a look at the 2D plot of our songs:This is the result with seed number 4The plot does not really show clear clusters. Let‚Äôs try seed number 10The points are even more scattering. There are a few points that we can conclude about this result:There are a lot of uncertainties, but one thing that we certainly learned is that NLP requires a lot of thoughts and techniques to produce something meaningful.In this project, we learned about some foundational concepts in Natural Language Processing such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, TF-IDF, as well as various strategies for removing stopwords and visualize the results.Thanks for reading!WRITTEN BY"

rom Google‚Äôs 43 rules of ML.‚ÄúRule #4: Keep the first model simple and get the infrastructure right.‚ÄùWith some opinions floating in the market, I feel it‚Äôs a good time to spark a discussion about this topic. Otherwise, the opinions of the popular will just drown other ideas.Note: I work in NLP and these opinions are more focussed towards NLP applications. Cannot guarantee truthfulness for tabular and image problems.Feature engineering analogy ‚ÜíHow deep learning changed Computer Vision and how the new language models put an end to statistical NLP.The automated feature engineering libraries like featuretools and tsfresh are also rising. We don‚Äôt need to rely just on domain experts for features.We often resort to short-circuit fast thinking.‚ÄúThinking, Fast and Slow is a best-selling book published in 2011 by Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureate Daniel Kahneman. The central thesis is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: ‚ÄúSystem 1‚Äù is fast, instinctive and emotional; ‚ÄúSystem 2‚Äù is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.‚ÄùNowadays when work pressure is high, we don‚Äôt want to think slowly and directly resort to using the old advice of making a simple ML system first.Why argue when it actually makes your work easy? üòÜ‚ÄúWhen a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric.‚ÄúWhen your seniors might hold the philosophy of ‚Äòsimple model‚Äô, you will avoid conflict and make a good rapport.I see many argue against putting transformer NLP models in production because they are heavy and more blackbox which is actually not true.TinyBERT has 15M parameters while AWD-LSTM of ULMFiT has 24M. AWD-LSTM is often used by people due to its ease of use with fastai library.Also you can interpret transformer models using Captum by PyTorch.The philosophy of the group is a function of majority.As you might have seen while choosing a restaurant ‚Äî we have to go with the majority because if we took the risk of suggesting a new restaurant and forcing people to eat there, the high expectations of people will put immense stress on us.Why not just chill instead of taking the risk? There is no clear cut reward for taking risk unless it‚Äôs tied to our individual SMART* goals!Have you ever seen ‚Äòtake risk‚Äô in anyone‚Äôs SMART goals? üòÇNote: SMART is a common goal-setting philosophy used in organisations.Data scientists are changing jobs very frequently and have difficulty building trust at a new place. Hence, they will reduce the risk of failure of the first project because the risk is proportional to the complexity of the project.Your new ideas will hold value only when people trust you and you have a history of execution. People tend to reject the ideas of a new person talking ‚Äòcomplex‚Äô when the group is in favour of simple.To change the group thinking, team needs to have an established person with history in the same or old organisation with an appetite for challenging the status quo.Conformity kills creativity. üòÑLet me tell you about my recent experience. I just deployed a transformer model to production for semantic search. Earlier we had a non-contextual model with a complex pipeline of processing, external APIs and rules to handle edge cases.Now our new search system is extremely simple and scalable. It's not only better at understanding queries but also faster due to less reliance on external APIs. In fact, it costs us less now because we don‚Äôt have to use paid APIs anymore.Choosing a heavier model saves us current and future troubles üí∞This is what happens with many companies.Adding a rule to ML pipeline for edge case always seem saner than making a new system.But if these cases keep popping again, you might want to reconsider.Companies like Google understand this. That‚Äôs why they make better language models as they don‚Äôt have time to make rules in the age of hyper-personalisation.The current problem of data science is the ‚Äòsearch space‚Äô. We have extremely simple models to 17B parameters models available for free to use.In order to find the best model for production, we should ideally evaluate all of them with hyper-tuning and then come up with a prescription. But who has time for such experimentation when your competitor is growing fast and we need to put ‚Äòsomething‚Äô to production ASAP. üòïTo find a solution to this problem, I run experiments in my freetime to understand the sweet point of complexity.ML is quite empirical and my assumptions turn out wrong on a regular basis. Hence it‚Äôs very important to keep trying new methodologies and learn from them.1. Don‚Äôt start the research when the project starts.2. Be proactive. Experiment and read papers for insights.3. Setup your own research lab on Colab.Takeaway ‚ÜíHire engineers who do research to develop a dictionary of solutions and use their fast-thinking for selecting solution for production.My goal is not to convince you to waste time researching to deploy big models. My aim is to throw light on the importance of innovation and thinking from the basics.Don‚Äôt use time constraints as an excuse to do simple modelling. üí©I work in a startup myself and hence I understand all types of constraints such as time, data, manpower and compute.Google doesn‚Äôt shy away from putting heavy models to production ‚Äî be it for machine translation or YouTube‚Äôs recommendation system. They have always believed in using the state of the art. AI is their strategy. Not a part of strategy.If the cost of production doesn‚Äôt work out, they push the limits by doing hardware innovation like TPUs.My heroes üôáAll these efforts took time to develop but had a global impact. Don‚Äôt stop your engineers from experimenting and open-sourcing. Let them try complex solutions and take risk. One of them will turn out your 100x engineer.WRITTEN BY"

But yeah, the more, the merrier üòè.Permutations give the number of ways of ordering n elements. Here sequence matters. n! factorial represents the number of possible permutations:And if we have k slots to fill only:In contrast, order doesn‚Äôt matter in combinations. It helps answer questions given n choices and a subset of k elements, how many ways this can be done.Fundamentally it is the same as filling k slots like above. Since the order no longer matters, we therefore divide by the number of possible orders of k elements, which is k!.It is denoted by n choose k or C(n, k):Here comes another problem we might face some day (or if you‚Äôve gone through it, congrats!).Suppose you want to make sure a couple sit together in a table with 6 seats, how many ways can you seat them?Since the order of AB or BA doesn't matter here, the couple can be placed in any two empty slot, i.e. 6 * 2 = 12. Once two seats are taken by them, there are 4 empty seats left to be filled by the other 4 guests, which is 4!. As a result, the total number of ways to arrange seats so that the couple can sit together is 6 * 2 * 4! = 288 ü§Ø.An extension to combinations is to find out how many possible subsets a set {1, ..., n} can have, which isHere the logic is that for each element in the set, there are two choices or either including it in the subset or not ‚Äî 2 * 2 * 2 * ... * 2 = 2^n. A simple example would be given a set {1}, it has two subsets with 1 and an empty set.This counts the number of ways we can partition a given set of items into subsets of prescribed sizes:Suppose there are 9 distinct flavours of pizza to give away to 3 people (none of them cares about which flavours they get), with A getting 2, B getting 3 and C getting 4. Based on the formula above, there areways of distributing flavours to A, B and C!I‚Äôll try to solve it in an analytical way and through simulation in Python code.Therefore, the probability that the last person takes the assigned seat isAlternatively, we can use simulation to find out the probability of the event, i.e. last person taking last seat happening.The figure below shows both the Gaussian kernel density of the simulation, as well as the fitted normal distribution. It has a mean of 0.5 and standard deviation of 0.01.There are multiple approaches to this problem, and I‚Äôve found other solutions here as well as a discussion in the original tweet.The concepts of combinatorics are not only important to other areas of mathematics and physics, but also relevant to our daily lives ‚Äî math is everywhere! Understanding some of the basic concepts of combinations, permutations and partitions can surely help us manoeuvre endless possibilities in the real world.If you found this post helpful, please let me know!

36,Effect of Initialization on Optimization Trajectory,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/effect-of-initialization-on-optimization-trajectory-129746a2bb9d?source=extreme_main_feed---------39-59--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"In simple words, finding a minimum value for a given equation is considered as optimization. This has many applications in real life ‚Äî finding the fastest path when travelling from one place to other, job shop scheduling, air traffic management etc. The optimization has been the backbone of machine learning, where the algorithms are expected to extract knowledge from huge volumes of data.Optimization plays a major role in Neural Networks, where there are millions of parameters and the goal is to find the right set of parameters to correctly represent the data. There has been a lot of research in this field and many algorithms have been developed for effective optimization. Even though the performance of the optimizer has improved a lot, there is another problem that the optimization depends upon i.e. the initial point. The trajectory of optimization is largely dependant on the initialisation. This has been studied and numerous initialization techniques have been proposed to effectively exploit the power of optimization algorithms.In this post, we are going to see how the initialization can affect the performance of some of the optimization algorithms until the day. Although we are using a two-dimensional problem here since it is easy to visualize, the initialization problem becomes more prevalent when there are millions of parameters (Neural Networks).Initialize x, y and use gradient descent algorithms to find the optimal values of x and y such that the value of the Beale function is zero (or as low as possible).We are going to consider three popular optimization algorithms since we are more concerned about the initialization these will be sufficient for our analysis.A more detailed explanation about gradient descent optimization algorithms, please read this post by Sebastian Ruder.Importing required librariesWe are going to use the autograd functionality of PyTorch for getting the gradients and matplotlib for plotting the trajectories.f(x, y) = (1.5 ‚Äî x + xy)¬≤ + (2.25 ‚Äî x + xy¬≤)¬≤ +(2.625 ‚Äî x + xy¬≥)¬≤The Beale Function, a two-dimensional function is chosen to make visualizations simple.Visualizing the Beale FunctionAs the Beale function is a two-variable function ranging between -4.5 and 4.5, we can generate a mesh grid using NumPy to pass all the possible values of x and y to the function. This enables us to have the output of Beale's function at each possible point, we can use these outputs to visualize the function in a contour plot.As we are relating the optimization problem with neural networks, we will refer to (x, y) as (w1, w2). Also, when using a neural network we refer to objective function as a loss function and the output of the function as a loss. In this case, we refer to Beale‚Äôs function as loss function and the outputs as losses.We will now plot the losses on a contour plot with the following code.As seen in the image, the blue region indicates lower values and the red region is higher values of Beale‚Äôs function. The minima (3, 0.5) is indicated with a star.Setting up ParametersAs we are using PyTorch, we need to have parameters that are to be optimized put into a nn.Module class. The __init__() takes (x, y) as inputs to initialize the parameters (w1, w2). Also, we are going to write Beale's equation in the forward function.Since we are interested in tracking the path of the optimization, we need to collect the parameters at each step/desired steps and save them for plotting.The below function initialises the parameters of the network, initializes an optimizer and runs the optimization for the specified number of steps while collecting the path of the parameters.Comparison between trajectoriesAfter collecting the paths of parameters with different algorithms, we are going to plot them on the Beale Function Contour plot. The below function takes in the initial position, list of optimizers and corresponding learning rates and epochs and plots the trajectories of algorithms with specified settings.After setting up everything, we are now ready to compare the three algorithms with different initial points.The learning rates observed to be working in this problemWe are going to use the same learning rate for different initial points considered for respective algorithms to keep the analysis simple and since we are not doing hyperparameter tuning. Feel free to download this notebook and trying out different hyperparameters and initial points.Case 1: A point close to minimaAll the three reach the global minima, let us move a little further and see what happens.Case 2: Moving a little furtherMoving a little further from where we have started has made a huge difference in how an optimizer moves the parameters towards the minimum. As seen in the figure above adam optimizer moves towards a local minimum and is stuck there, whereas sgd and momentum reach the global minimum. Things to notice, we are not changing the learning rate here, as we are focusing on the effect of initialization on optimization.Case 3: Far from minima(more examples can be found in this notebook)The initial point plays a crucial role in optimization problems. Here we are trying to solve a two-dimensional problem which is fairly easy when compared to finding a minimum when we have a large dataset and more than a million parameters (dimensions).Although we are not tuning the hyperparameters here, we can effectively drive the optimization in the right direction with the right set of hyperparameters.This post was originally published here.WRITTEN BY"

Automation of data extraction, data enrichment, and data cleaning with APIs can save you a lot of work doing manual extraction.The focus in this article will be on how to interact with APIs in Python and we will be working in the context of the Singapore public housing data set and explore the Bid-Rent Theory in the housing market. It will be heavier on the Python scripting and lighter on the actual analysis so do forgive me if there is a lack of academic and statistical rigour in any part of this article.Github Link for full code: https://github.com/yuan-yexi/hdb-resale-api/blob/master/script.pyWe are basically exploring the relationship between price per square meter and the distance of the property to the CBD.Great, now that is out of the way, let‚Äôs let into the thick of things.First, we will start off with import some essential librariesTo make our first API request we will be using the requests library. But before that let‚Äôs examine the API in our browser:We can see that we can query the results by using the ‚Äúlimit‚Äù or the ‚Äúq‚Äù parameters to obtain results from the search. Since will we be needing the entire date set we just need to specific the limit to be the entire data set.Quickly examining the example query in our browser, we can see that the ‚Äúrecords‚Äù of transactions that we are interested in at nested in the ‚Äúresults‚Äù array of the JSON response. With a sense of the data structure we are dealing with, we can move to our Python IDE and query our data.Since it is a rather large data set (101994 as of time of writing), we will sample 500 records to make it easier to work with before moving to the entire database. This is good practice in exploratory phase of using APIs to not use up unnecessary serve resources querying huge data sets repeatedly. Now, let‚Äôs examine what the serve returned to us in our IDE.Nice, the JSON object returned from the serve is basically a Python Dictionary which are familiar with! Our job just got a little easier and no additional work is needed to transform our JSON object for it to work in Python.All we have to do is access the records key in our dictionary object to obtain the list of transaction data that are stored as dictionary key-value pairs.Now that we are comfortable with traversing the nested data, let‚Äôs create our Pandas data frame.In the above, we are creating a for loop to append our dictionary values in each records to the relevant list that will form each column in our data frame.Cool! Our data frame is looking good!The next part gets a little tricky. We need to find the nearest MRT station the HDB unit is located in using their geo-location coordinates (Latitude, Longitude). We will use another API to achieve this ‚Äî the OneMap API.First let‚Äôs create a list of all the MRT stations in Singapore. Since MRT stations change relatively slowly overtime, we can leverage a static list instead. I obtained (good ole copy and pasta ;) ) the data from Wikipedia, which also provides data on upcoming MRT stations. We will only consider existing MRT stations for now.Quick look at the OneMap API ‚Äî we can see that we need to input our address into the ‚ÄúsearchVal‚Äù parameter of our URL like so:Let‚Äôs use the OneMap API to obtain the (lat, long) coordinates of each MRT station. The for loop below iterates through the list of MRT stations and returns the results, we will then grab the first result of the response, similar to what we did when we transverse through the resale JSON object earlier.Then we store it into a new data frame:Now ‚Äî let‚Äôs find grab the geolocation of each unit that was transacted using the same method. But hang on ‚Äî that‚Äôs a large data set.. we can make it a bit more efficient. We know that there will be multiple units that will be transacted in the same HDB Apartment block. We can de-dup our data frame and obtain only unique addresses in our data frame.We can now obtain the (lat, long) coordinates through our OneMap APIWith that done, let‚Äôs save it to a date frame:We will need to solution for our next task, find the nearest MRT for each address that we have in our data frame and obtain the distance in meters.We will be using the Haversine formula to obtain the distance between 2 points on a curved surface. Alternatively we can use Pythagoras‚Äô theorem too since the distance between our points are not that large. But to make things simplier, we will use the geopy package for the Haversine formula.To obtain the nearest MRT station for any given point on the map we will need to:Above we have a nested for-loop that iterates through the 2 sets of coordinates to obtain the nearest MRT for every unique address that we have in our data set. This is definitely not the most efficient solution though. We can for example group our addresses into various districts of Singapore and only check against a list of MRT stations that fall within the given distance instead of the whole list. But for now we will rely on the brute force of our CPUs to churn those numbers for us :)We will do the same for our distance to CBD and distance to nearest shopping mall.Lastly we will use an outer join to merge our distance data with our main data frame.We are ready to plot out our price/sqm to distance to CDB relationship!We definitely see a negative relationship between distance and price per sqm from our dataset. But there is also a large variance at certain intervals of distance between the property and the CBD. There must be other explanatory factors that determine land price beside our cdb_dist variable. Let‚Äôs explore the correlation between our variables.Looks like distance to key amenities such as MRT and a shopping mall have an impact on our land price. While the lease of land also can explain part of the price as well.We will further explore the explanatory powers of our features using a simple multi-linear regression model. Let‚Äôs engineer the features we need.Mapping Ordinal Categorical Features:One-Hot Encode our ‚Äòtown‚Äô feature:Create our Regression Model:Mean Abosulte Error gives us the average absolute value of our actual data from the model‚Äôs prediction. Our MAE is fairly small compared to the range and mean of price per sqm in our data set.From our RMSE value, our model‚Äôs prediction will miss the actual value of the property by $628.85 on average. If we take our RMSE as a percentage of our mean price per sqm, it will give us a 14% error rate ‚Äî which is rather high.Let‚Äôs try to improve our model‚Äôs explanatory power by introducing our categorical variables into our regression.Our MAE, MSE, RSME have all decreased as well, implying a higher accurarcy for our model. Our RMSE/Mean has also dropped to 11.2%.Clearly, there is a statistically significant relationship between distance to the CBD and price per sqm. However, it does not fully explain HDB housing prices in Singapore. From our regression model we see there are more to residential estate pricing such as amenities, political boundaries, and maturity of the property and the estate it is in that could potentially have stronger explanatory and predictive powers than distance to CBD.Thanks for reading till the end! It‚Äôs a long one and hope this helps you in better understand how to interact with APIs in Python and how it can help to automate your data processing and analysis workflows!

My primary motivations have been that (1) Python is open source, and (2) the amount of hard drive space taken up by MATLAB (especially on my laptop, where HD space comes at a premium). Also, never having to worry about keeping software licenses up to date has been an added plus. The flurry of trial-and-errors and Google searches I had to conduct until I found the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù parameters for my plots has led me to put together this article ‚Äî both as an informative tool for outside readers, and a way for me to document things for myself. Aesthetics are subjective, but I hope this tutorial can point out important settings and parameters that will allow you to customize any dataset to your personal preference. This is the first article in what I hope to be a series of tutorials ‚Äî I will continue adding sections over time for different types of visualizations. I would recommend installing Anaconda if you don‚Äôt already have it as it contains all required packages for data analysis and visualization that you will need.The majority of the functions used are in the matplotlib package (with most of the plotting functions being from matplotlib.pyplot subpackage). Additionally, I typically import numpy for any quick computations and pylab for quickly generating colors from any built-in colormap. Often times, when we import packages, we create a short-form alias (i.e. mpl for matplotlib ) so that we can refer to its functions using the alias instead of typing out matplotlib every single time.Since scientific instrument data is typically fairly simple (usually just one independent variable that we control and a measured, dependent variable), we can use numpy.loadtxt to import our data. For more complicated datasets, I highly recommend using pandas , which has incredibly sophisticated functions for loading and sanitizing data for visualizations ‚Äî a comprehensive documentation can be found here. For this example, I have a file called Absorbance_Data.csv with some absorbance data for two samples collected on a spectrophotometer.We can load this data into our script with the following command:We pass our file to the numpy.loadtxt function along with the parameters:unpack‚Äî transposes each column into an array, allowing you to unpack multiple variables at a time ( wavelength , samp_1_abs , samp_2_abs )delimiter ‚Äî delimiter character used to separate columnsskiprows ‚Äî amount of rows to skip at the top of the file (since the first row is the column titles, we want to skip this so skiprows=1 )Once we have loaded our absorbance data, we can quickly plot and inspect both of the datasets with the following code:The data plots properly, but the default matplotlib settings just don‚Äôt give the figure that publication quality. As we change some of the parameters below, we will end up with a much better looking plot.This is a setting that I spend an irrationally large amount of time on ‚Äî picking the right font for my plots. Your system already comes with a long list of pre-installed fonts, and you can check which fonts are already available to matplotlib with the following:If you would like to install a new font to your computer and then use it for your plots, this is also possible. First, you must download and install your desired font ‚Äî many options can be found here. Once installed, you must rebuild the font cache so that it will be available to matplotlib when you make your figure. We do this as follows:If you now check the list of available fonts, you should see the new font that you just installed.The three general parameters that I set at the beginning of my plot script are: (1) font, (2) font size, and (3) axis line width. These are essentially global parameters that I do not edit later so setting them at the beginning makes everything easier (i.e. do not have to explicitly set font/sizes for each label down the line). We must add the following code before we generate any figures, so I typically put it near the top of the script immediately after importing packages.If you have a set of colors that you like to use, you are free to skip this step. In this case, since we only have two samples, it is better to manually select two high-constrast colors. But, if you want to generate a list of colors without too much effort on your end, we can use the pylab package we imported to generate a list of them from one of the various matplotlib built-in colormaps, which can be found here. This becomes very useful when you need a large number of colors, as you can generate them programatically.For our dataset, we are just interested in easily distinguishing between our traces, so we would be best served using one of the colormaps in the qualitative section (I will use ‚Äútab10‚Äù for this example). We use the following code ‚Äî the first argument is the colormap name and the second is the number of colors we want to generate:If we were, for example, measuring the temperature-dependence of a single sample and wanted to plot the spectra at different temperatures, we could use a diverging colormap such as ‚Äúcoolwarm‚Äù. Ultimately, the colormap you choose will be up to you and based on the type of data you are plotting.We must create a figure, which is a blank window, and then add an axes object to it for our plot. To generate the figure, we have the following:figsize ‚Äî size of our figure (width, height) in inches, with the default being (6.4, 4.8)Now we must add an axes object to our blank figure by specifying the bottom left coordinate and the width and height in relative coordinates (1 is the full size of the figure window). If we want it to fill our entire figure, we can specify [0, 0, 1, 1] which sets the bottom left corner to (0, 0) and the width and height to 1.We can use this axis construction to create paneled figures and insets by making multiple axes objects as follows:If we do not want our plot entirely enclosed, we can remove the top and right spines as follows:We can edit the tick widths and lengths to match our axis parameters with the following code. If we have minor ticks, we can also edit the properties of these:which ‚Äî whether we are editing major , minor , or both tickssize ‚Äî length of ticks in pointswidth ‚Äî line width of ticks (we can set this to the same as our axis line width)direction ‚Äî whether ticks will face in , out , or inout (both)top / right ‚Äî whether there will be ticks on the secondary axes (top/right)We can now again plot our data, using the colors that we generated from the colormap to distinguish the samples:linewidth ‚Äî line width of the line in the plotcolor ‚Äî color of the line in the plotlabel ‚Äî label for the trace (reference for the legend)Now we can set the x and y-axis ranges with the following lines:We notice that the tick marks seem unbalanced between the two axes ‚Äî we can also semi-manually edit this using a function called MultipleLocator which will create ticks at every multiple of a base number that we provide. We must edit the major_locator for the major ticks and minor_locator for the minor ticks. We will set major ticks every 100 nm and minor ticks every 50 nm for the x-axis and major ticks every 0.5 and minor ticks every 0.25 for the y-axis.We must add labels to the x and y-axes, which we can easily do with the following code:labelpad ‚Äî extra padding between the tick labels and the axis labelIf you want to include Greek characters in your labels, you can use LaTeX syntax to do so. We create a raw string by prepending the string with r and enclose the LaTeX command with $$ . However, this will use the default LaTeX font for the Greek characters ‚Äî if we want to use the same font as the rest of the plot (assuming the character exists), we enclose our command with $\mathregular{'Command goes here'}$.If we want to place ticks on one of the secondary (top/right) axes to show either a different dataset or scaling, we can do so using a parasitic axis. This axes object duplicates one of the axes of the original plot, allowing you to change the scaling on the other. To illustrate this, we can use our absorbance data as an example. The current x-axis is the wavelength of absorbed light, but based on the application, the energy of this light might be the more relevant parameter.We can create a second x-axis on the top of the plot to show the energy scaling. First, we must create a parasitic axis with either the twinx() or twiny() command to clone the x or y-axes, respectively. In this example, we want the y-axis data constant, so we will clone the y-axis. We also need to match the tick parameters of this new x-axis to the old plot‚Äôs x-axis (and remove top='on' from the original x-axis parameters).To make our job of adding ticks in energy units to this axis easier, we can write a function to convert energy to wavelength (since we will place the ticks on the wavelength axis at points that energy values would correspond to). We will treat the input E as an array so we can do all the conversions at once:Since this is a non-linear transformation, we cannot easily use the MultipleLocator function, and we will add the tick marks manually, using a function called FixedLocator . To use FixedLocator we provide an array of all the locations at which we want there to be tick marks:Since we added the ticks manually, we must also add the major tick labels manually.Finally, we also want to add an axis label to our new x-axis and make sure the axis limits are the same as the original x-axis:The final thing we must add to our plot is a legend, so that a reader can know which trace corresponds to which sample. To do so, we can use the following code:bbox_to_anchor ‚Äî coordinate of the bounding box for our legendloc ‚Äî which part of the bounding box to use the coordinate of the bbox_to_anchor value ( 0 for automatic, 1 for top right corner, 2 for top left corner, 3 for bottom left corner, 4 for bottom right corner, 5 for right, 6 for center left, 7 for center right, 8 for lower center, 9 for upper center, and 10 for center)frameon ‚Äî whether to draw a frame around the legendfontsize ‚Äî font size for legend entries (if different from general parameter)Lastly, saving your final plot is very simple ‚Äî we can use the function plt.savefig to do this.dpi ‚Äî resolution for a rastered image file format (in this case we are saving as .png file so this means that we are saving with a resolution of 300 dots per inch. The other possible file formats you can save are .ps , .pdf , and .svg which are all vector graphics formats, in which case you do not need to specify a dpi value)transparent ‚Äî whether to make the figure transparent, or with a white backgroundbbox_inches ‚Äî defines the bounding box around the figure ( tight ensures that there is no extra whitespace around the figure)To actually view our final plot in a figure window, we must add a plt.show() command after saving the figure.That‚Äôs it! We have successfully made a publication quality plot using Python! This example and all subsequent examples will be freely available online at this Github repository.Thanks for reading and I will continue to keep this series up to date with new examples and tutorials!WRITTEN BY"

hen I say ‚Äúlinear regression‚Äù, most of the people start thinking about the good old Ordinary Least Square(OLS) regression. If you are not familiar with the term, these equations might help‚Ä¶Did you also think about OLS? If yes then you are on the right track. But there‚Äôs more to linear regression than just OLS! First, let us look at OLS a bit more closely.The name of this technique came from the cost function. Here, we take the sum of squared errors (the difference between ground truths and predictions) and try to minimize this. By minimizing the cost function we achieve the optimal value of the vector Œ≤ (contains bias and weights). In the below plot, the contour (concentric ellipses) of the cost function is shown. After the minimization, we get Œ≤ as the point at the center.At first, it seems like OLS is enough for any regression problem. But as we increase the number of features and the complexity of data OLS tends to overfit the training data. The concept of overfitting is vast and deserves a separate article (you can find plenty of them) so I‚Äôm going to give you a brief. Overfitting means the model has learned the training data so well that it fails to generalize. In other words, the model has learned even the small scale (insignificant) variations in the train data so it fails to produce good predictions on unseen (validation and test) data. To tackle the problem of overfitting we can use many techniques. Adding a regularization (penalty) term to our cost function is one such technique. But what term should we use? We generally use one of the following two methods.In this case, we add the sum of squares of weights to our least square cost function. So now it looks something like this‚Ä¶But how does this term prevent overfitting? Adding this term is equivalent to adding an extra constraint on the possible values of Œ≤. Because to achieve the minimum cost, the sum of Œ≤¬≤_j‚Äôs must not exceed a certain value (say r). This technique prevents the model from assigning very large weights to some features over the others thus tackling overfitting. Mathematically,In other words, Œ≤ should lie inside(or on) the circle with radius ‚àör centered at the origin. Here‚Äôs the visualization‚Ä¶Notice that because of the constraint (red circle), the final value of Œ≤ is closer to the origin than it was in the OLS.The only difference between Ridge and Lasso is the regularization term. Here, we add the sum of absolute values of the weights to our least square cost function. So the cost function becomes‚Ä¶In this case, the constraint can be written as‚Ä¶Now we can visualize the constraint as a square instead of a circle.It is worth noting that, if the contours hit a corner of the square then one feature is completely neglected (weight becomes 0). For higher-dimensional feature space, we can use this trick to reduce the number of features.Note: In the regularization term we are not using bias (Œ≤_0) because only the very large weights (Œ≤_i‚Äôs for i>0) corresponding to the features contribute to the overfitting. Bias term is just an intercept hence does not have much to do with the overfitting.Phew‚Ä¶that was a lot about regularization. The common thing among the above methods was: they all have residuals/errors (ground truth-prediction) in their cost function. These errors are parallel to the y-axis. We could also consider errors along the x-axis and proceed similarly. See the plot below.What if we use a different kind of error?In this case, we consider errors in both directions (x-axis and y-axis). The sum of the square of perpendicular distances between the observed data points and the predicted line is to be minimized. Let‚Äôs visualize this by taking only one feature.Let our model beThen the regression coefficients can be obtained by minimizingunder the constraintsThis is very similar to the above method with a slight change. Here, we minimize the sum of areas of the rectangle formed by (X_i, Y_i) and (x_i, y_i).The total area extended by n data points is,The constraints here are the same as orthogonal regression.One should go for orthogonal and reduced major axis regressions when the uncerttainties are present in study (y) and explanatory (x) variables both.One interesting thing in orthogonal regression is, it produces symmetrical fit w.r.t y-errors and x-errors. But in OLS we don‚Äôt get the symmetry for we minimize either y-errors or x-errors, not both.I hope you enjoyed the reading. Until next time‚Ä¶Happy learning!WRITTEN BY"

Enjoy!If this is the kind of stuff that you like, be one of the FIRST to subscribe to my new YouTube channel here! While there aren‚Äôt any videos yet, I‚Äôll be sharing lots of amazing content like this but in video form. Thanks for your support :)Two weighings would be required (see part A and B above):A convex function is one where a line drawn between any two points on the graph lies on or above the graph. It has one minimum.A non-convex function is one where a line drawn between any two points on the graph may intersect other points on the graph. It characterized as ‚Äúwavy‚Äù.When a cost function is non-convex, it means that there‚Äôs a likelihood that the function may find local minima instead of the global minimum, which is typically undesired in machine learning models from an optimization perspective.Overfitting is an error where the model ‚Äòfits‚Äô the data too well, resulting in a model with high variance and low bias. As a consequence, an overfit model will inaccurately predict new data points even though it has a high accuracy on the training data.I‚Äôm not 100% sure about the answer to this question but will give my best shot!Let‚Äôs take the instance where there‚Äôs an increase in the prime membership fee ‚Äî there are two parties involved, the buyers and the sellers.For the buyers, the impact of an increase in a prime membership fee ultimately depends on the price elasticity of demand for the buyers. If the price elasticity is high, then a given increase in price will result in a large drop in demand and vice versa. Buyers that continue to purchase a membership fee are likely Amazon‚Äôs most loyal and active customers ‚Äî they are also likely to place a higher emphasis on products with prime.Sellers will take a hit, as there is now a higher cost of purchasing Amazon‚Äôs basket of products. That being said, some products will take a harder hit while others may not be impacted. It is likely that premium products that Amazon‚Äôs most loyal customers purchase would not be affected as much, like electronics.Decision Trees: a tree-like model used to model decisions based on one or more conditions.Support Vector Machines: a classification technique that finds a hyperplane or a boundary between the two classes of data that maximizes the margin between the two classes. There are many planes that can separate the two classes, but only one plane can maximize the margin or distance between the classes.Random Forests: an ensemble learning technique that builds off of decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree.Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset. This is important mainly in the case when you want to reduce variance in your model (overfitting).Wikipedia states four advantages of dimensionality reduction (see here):We need to make some assumptions about this question before we can answer it. Let‚Äôs assume that there are two possible places to purchase a particular item on Amazon and the probability of finding it at location A is 0.6 and B is 0.8. The probability of finding the item on Amazon can be explained as so:We can reword the above as P(A) = 0.6 and P(B) = 0.8. Furthermore, let‚Äôs assume that these are independent events, meaning that the probability of one event is not impacted by the other. We can then use the formula‚Ä¶P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) ‚Äî P(A and B)
P(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.8 - (0.6*0.8)
P(A or B) = 0.92Answer already provided in previous questionBoosting is an ensemble method to improve a model by reducing its bias and variance, ultimately converting weak learners to strong learners.

42,The Social Graphs in Viral Growth,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-social-graphs-in-viral-growth-29eed172ba74?source=extreme_main_feed---------45-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"At the time of writing, the coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is spreading over the globe. The virus spreads from a contagious person to another person, and after a time of incubation, the spread might continue to yet another person.In one view of the matter, the virus spreads in the social graph of the world. The social graph is a mathematical representation of relevant social interactions of people in a community ‚Äî in this case the real-world interactions that have a non-zero probability of mediating the spread of the virus.In what follows I illustrate how the spread depends on features of the social graph.I use computer simulations of a mathematical model built on abstractions. Therefore the simulations deal with the general phenomena of how things or beliefs can replicate in networks, and how the nature of said networks in turn impacts the nature of the spread. Economists, marketers, counter-terrorists and epidemiologists, among others, apply the theory of networks and graphs in their practice.The simulations I run connect macro statements of viral spread in a community to details of the mechanism of interaction and replication. In other words, intuitions about person-to-person interactions can be linked to macroscopic or collective properties of the viral spread. The bottom-up computer simulation is by design explainable in terms of beliefs about fundamental properties. That is one of the virtues of this approach.I do not claim, however, to present quantitative predictions or advice for individual or collective action for the particular COVID-19 disease. Local health authorities are better places to look for that information. Rather, I am motivated by the belief that a more definite way to reason, as a community, about complex events can be attained if the model of the world and its logic is explicit. Any preference we declare for one action over another, or judgement of the past, builds on beliefs about how the world works. Our choice is only if, and how, we make these beliefs ‚Äî that is the model ‚Äî evident.A far greater effort of calibration against specific data and validation is needed in order to go beyond the qualitative statements I formulate. But viral spread is reasoned about now more than ever. That is why I present these tools.In the next sections I present and discuss results of the computer simulations. At the end I provide a few technical method details along with links to the Python code I created and used.Picture a community wherein everyone interacts with everyone with no preference for one over another. An idealized community like this is a suitable baseline against which to compare subsequent simulations with additional heterogeneity added to the social graph.A well-mixed community maps onto a complete graph. The nodes represent the individuals in the community. The edges connect pairs of individuals that can meet, at which time a viral transmission can take place with a typically low, but non-zero, probability.In what follows I employ a general Time Unit (TU) rather than hour, day, or week in order to not create a false sense of specificity. The reader can if so desired make the substitution of terminology.For the baseline scenario, further picture the following: All individuals, except one, start out healthy. Transmission of the virus in one TU takes place with probability, P, when a contagious individual meets a non-infected and non-immune individual in the social graph. Once infected, the individual in the baseline scenario progresses as follows:I omit modelling death events. They are of course the most momentous in real-world cases. My current focus is on the short-term viral spread, so this omission is justified.Further imagine two minor variations to the baseline scenario:These three scenarios are simulated with one thousand individuals in the complete social graph.Common to the three scenarios are that early in the progression of the disease, the number of infected individuals grows exponentially. That is because the infected individuals are relatively rare at that time, so the vast majority of meetings the infected individual is part of has the potential to transmit the virus to a healthy individual.The growth levels off some time later and reaches a peak value. When many meetings involve pairs of already infected individuals, or immune individuals, fewer meetings in the social graph can contribute to the spread of the virus in the community, and recovery rate soon exceeds infection rate.The difference in the collective outcome between the scenarios stem from these relations:These are quite intuitive relations and a good ground for the further analysis.A different way to characterize the collective outcome is to determine the number of healthy individuals a contagious individual transmits the viral particle to before they self-quarantine and later recover.From the first 100 infected individuals‚Äô disease progression, the following histograms are obtained.In the more likely transmitter scenario, an infected individual is more likely to infect a greater number of individuals before self-quarantine. That is a different way to quantify that the growth in infections is greater in that scenario. The delayed recovery is no different from baseline with respect to this quantity, which is because they differ not with respect to the nature of transmission, but with respect to recovery.The average value of transmissions per infected individual is sometimes called R0 in the epidemiology literature. In some models of viral spread, these histograms are inputs to the model, not outcomes, and they can under reasonable theoretical assumptions be modelled as negative binomial distributions.The outcomes and relations described so far can be obtained from standard growth models using ordinary differential equations or simple types of random sampling. They can therefore be mathematically very efficient. Such models make various assumptions of homogeneity, including with respect to the social graph.Since I model the individual-to-individual dynamics explicitly, I can introduce heterogeneity and see how that manifests itself in the collective outcomes. That is the connection between intuitions and macro observables I wish to explore.I model social distancing along two dimensions: how much social distancing is done by a given individual, and how many individuals engage in such social distancing. A non-uniform degree of social distancing across the individuals in the community is therefore modelled.I continue with the complete social graph and employ the same baseline scenario as described above. In addition, variations of the following kind are also simulated: X% are Y% more cautious. This signifies that X% of the individuals in the simulated community are Y% less likely to transmit or receive the virus when they interact with another individual in the social graph. The remaining percentage of individuals, 100-X%, are no different than the individuals in the baseline scenario.Again, one thousand individuals are simulated.The curves in the diagram exhibit the property that has become known as flattened curve. The greater the proportion of the individuals in the community that are cautious in their social interactions, the slower the growth and consequently the lower the peak of infections.The diagram below shows how many other individuals the first 100 infected individuals transmit the virus to in turn. As expected, the more cautious the interaction, the fewer transmissions take place per infected individual.In these simulations the population of the community consists of individuals of two types: those who practice social distancing, and those who do not. The latter part are in other words identical to the types of individuals that comprise the population of the baseline scenario.That part of the simulated populations, that is the non-distancing individuals, is analyzed separately.The diagram shows relative numbers of non-distancing individuals who are infected in the different simulated communities. Note that the curves have been scaled so they can be compared and not simply reflect the different number of non-distancing individuals in the communities.The key conclusion is that individuals that do not alter their individual actions, still become infected at a lower rate as the number increases of other individuals in the community that practice social distancing.The people who practices social distancing also benefits from their practice, though less so if fewer other individuals engages in the same practice. The collective outcome is in other words cooperative, not just an summation of its parts.Under some conditions this can therefore function similar to a classical coordination dilemma, akin to the famous Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma. If for example there is a cost to practicing social distancing, the individual optimum is to be the sole person who does not practice social distancing, while all others do. Once some individuals ‚Äúdefect‚Äù from the distancing practice, the individual benefit to remain socially distant decreases, and the incentive to defect increases even more. The collective optimum is therefore unstable.It must be said, however, that just because a dilemma might be present it may not become activated in real-world settings. As shown by Ostrom and Sigmund, among others, studies on real-world humans, institutions and cultures, have shown that additional norms and taboos often have evolved to indirectly short-circuit coordination dilemmas. Once we can look back at the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be instructive to empirically investigate how different communities across the world have navigated these potential coordination dilemmas.The effects of social distancing on the more likely transmitter scenario (see previous section) is contrasted against baseline in the diagram below.Considerable social distancing in the more likely transmitter scenario still leads to more rapid infection growth than the baseline scenario.This illustrates that even though social distancing qualitatively always flattens the curve, other properties of the viral spread matter greatly to the precise quantitative reduction that can be attained through such mitigating efforts. If the peak needs to be flattened below a given threshold, how much social distancing by how many that is required must be inferred from quantitative considerations of relevant properties of the viral spread.I have only modelled modest heterogeneity among the individuals of the simulated communities. It is likely that degree and extent of social distancing will vary as a function of perceptions about the severity of the disease in the community, which changes over the course of the viral spread. To account for this, more complex models of intentions and behaviours of individuals are needed. So called agent-based models provide the means to model behaviour from beliefs and intentions under certain assumptions of self-interest. When faced with extreme events for which, by definition, little retrospective data can be used for training of a model, first principles models of human and social mechanics are required instead.In graph theory a host of archetypical graphs are defined and studied. The complete graph used in the previous section is one. It is an extreme case of connectedness: each node is within one step from all other nodes.A far less connected graph is the so-called caveman graph. I will use the related relaxed caveman graph as the social graph and explore how that alters the nature of the spread.The blue dots in the image represent nodes in the graph which correspond to healthy individuals; the four red dots are infected individuals; and the white overlapping and intersecting lines are edges which connect pairs of nodes. The nodes are placed such that nodes with many connections between each other are close. Each of the ten white bundles contain 100 nodes, each which form almost completely connected groups or cliques. Only 1% of edges in the graph are between groups.A close-up of a bundle of almost completely connected nodes.The relaxed caveman graph represents an archetypical community wherein everyone is tightly connected to a small sub-community. Some individuals are directly connected to two or more sub-communities, though the vast number of social connections are within the group for any individual. However, there always exists a path through intermediaries between all individuals in the community. Everyone is at least a friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend of everyone else.The animated image below shows one simulated disease trajectory in steps of five TUs. In addition to blue and red nodes, purple ones represent the reactively self-quarantined individuals, and the green ones the recovered and immune individuals.The spread appears to progress in two bursts. First, five groups start to transition from blue to red, purple then green. Second, when the first groups are mostly green, the remaining five groups begin to significantly shift from blue.This appearance of sudden jumps in the spread is a consequence of that transmissions that take the virus between groups are rare. In effect, there is an invisible transition barrier.However, there is nothing in the viral spread or the social graph that requires the spread to proceed in two bursts like above. The particular outcome depends on how a few critical low probability events turn out. The diagram below shows the number of infected over time in nine independent simulations of the relaxed caveman social graph (different randomizations of the social and transmission events), with otherwise baseline virus properties.There is a great deal of variance in the viral spread around the mean (or expected) progression of the infection in the relaxed caveman social graph. Repeat number 2, the clearly bimodal curve, is the one shown in the animated image.The key point is that the uncertainty in the input information translates into a great deal of uncertainty in the outcome. The random variables in the model quantify the uncertainty of our knowledge of the individual components of the process. For example, in a given day, individual A might meet with individual B, a meeting which if it happens, might lead to a transmission of the virus. If individual A and B belong to different groups of nodes, this meeting and transition might prove ‚Äî after the fact ‚Äî to be the critical event that made the virus spread to a mostly healthy group of individuals.For the complete social graph, the same uncertainty of input knowledge exists. However, viral spread in that type of social graph has a far narrower band of possible outcomes in collective output. So, identical person-to-person transmission properties translate into distinct collective outcomes as the topology of the social graph is altered.Another consequence is that two identical groups in the relaxed caveman social graph can experience quite different outcomes at a point in time for no other reason than that a single rare event took a different turn. Some differences observed retrospectively have no grand structural causes in need of being explained and turned into prospective statements.Another class of graphs is the small world graph. Many real-world networks are highly clustered (one‚Äôs friends are also likely friends with each other), and have modest shortest path lengths (if one can find it, there is a relatively short path between almost any two individuals in the network). The Strogatz-Newman graph algorithm is used to construct an archetypical small world social graph, and the spread of the baseline scenario virus is simulated again.The variability in outcomes is not as great as for the relaxed caveman, though greater than for the complete social graph.Another archetypical graph is the ring lattice. The individuals are clustered in the identical manner as in the small-world graph. The shortest path length, though, between any two nodes can be quite high. However, there are no groups of nodes as distinct as in the relaxed caveman graph.For reference, the simulations with the different social graphs are set up such that the total number of meetings in a TU is the same regardless. Hence, differences between graph types do not reflect any modification in aggregate totals of meetings per TU.The mean values of the growth are put together for easier comparison. The small world (10%) graph is like the small world social graph above but with additional paths between non-clustered nodes.For more clustered social graphs, the viral spread is more protracted and the peak value of infected individuals is hence reduced, though, any single particular outcome for these social graphs can deviate more from the mean values.If we picture the virus as an object that is moving randomly in the social graph, its ability to discover a path to a certain individual will depend on the topology of the graph. Bottlenecks, number of shortcuts between clusters, and so on, are features of the social graph that in addition to how readily the virus transmits between persons, determines collective outcomes, including the range of possible outcomes. After all, we observe only one reality, so range matters to statements about possible futures to be prepared for (a topic I have discussed in more detail with respect to urban fires in Toronto).The social graphs above are illustrative archetypes. They are only meant to typify how variations in social features can impact collective outcomes under otherwise identical conditions. What the actual social graph that is relevant to any specific case, like SARS-CoV-2 spreading in a city, cat memes on social media, or political influence in Renaissance Florence, is a non-obvious empirical question.All simulations so far have assumed that immunity to further infections follows upon recovery. For virus infections this tends to be the case since the immune system can adapt to specific pathogen. However it is not guaranteed, since persons can recover through the non-adaptive parts of the immune system, through medical treatment (not vaccine), or it can also happen that during the course of the epidemic the virus mutates, such that immunological memory of the previous infection seizes to apply.The dynamics of this can be complicated and would among other things depend on the segment of the population that succumb to the first round of infections and how adaptable the specific virus is. I have too little present understanding of the range of possibilities. So I will not explore this in any further detail, only note that this can matter a great deal for the long-term progression of the viral spread.Another feature that matters to the spread in the social graph is proactive quarantine, that is when people are quarantined regardless of their known state of infection. In its simplest form it could be modelled as a group of nodes in the caveman graph that is entirely isolated from the other groups. However, large-scale quarantines typically involve friction, with individuals who resist, or where duration, not status of epidemic, determines if the quarantine applies. These dynamics require more thought to include, and I defer that to another time.Next I provide brief remarks about the model. Link to code at the bottom.An individual is modelled as having a disease state. The state can undergo a state transition. The green boxes in the image below represent disease states in the mathematical model, and the black text above the arrows represent state transitions.The arrows represent conditional relations (not a flow-chart). Activation, and downstream state transitions, are modelled as stochastic events. The uncertainty in the knowledge of the dynamics are quantified through cumulative probability density distributions. For example, the activate transition requires infection to be present. Given that condition, the outcome of a Bernoulli trial determines if a state transition takes place in a given day. The probability parameter for the Bernoulli trial depends on how many days have passed since the infect transition, such that a state transition becomes more likely as time passes.The infect state transition depends on an interaction between individual and a neighbour in the social graph. The steps that can lead to infection are:In the simulations described above the weights on the edges are set such that the total expected number of meetings within one TU is proportional to the number of nodes. That is true regardless of social graph topology, which implies the differences between graph topologies are not from any difference in the number of attempted viral transmissions.The Python code is freely available in this Github repository without any quality guarantees or support. The code builds on the Pandas and networkx libraries in particular, and the graphics are created with the Bokeh library, except the network images, which are created with Cytoscape.WRITTEN BY"
43,How to Learn Data Science when Life does not Give You a Break,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-learn-data-science-when-life-does-not-give-you-a-break-a26a6ea328fd?source=extreme_main_feed---------46-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"With the goal of getting into the data science field, you decide on what sets of skills you want to obtain. Now you just need to have the time to sit down to obtain those skills. Eventually, you will become a competitive candidate and get the job that you want.But life does not let you sit down. It demands you to keep going and does your normal stuff while still expects you to get 2+ years of experience in your resume. You feel stuck and frustrated. You know that you need to learn and get some projects done but find it so difficult to stick with your commitment. So should you give it up?I experienced the same things 2 months ago. As a mathematics student with 5 classes and a job, I found it extremely difficult to find the time for data science. When I was about to give up, I told myself to keep going. It is not about working harder; it is about working smarter. I just needed to switch my learning strategies.It‚Äôs not about Working Harder. It‚Äôs about Working the System.- Evan Spiegel, CEO of SnapchatNow I manage to finish many fun data science projects, publish at least 2 articles per week, have new findings in NLP research while maintaining my 4.0 GPA. As I keep asking myself questions about how I can be more efficient in my work, I find the way. Since new approaches are working for me, I want to share them with the hope that you could adopt some for yourself to get those skills in a short amount of time and make your data science journey more enjoyable.Spend one hour every day to work on one project for weeks. By the time I finish, I feel like I haven‚Äôt achieved anything much.Set a small goal of what I want to complete and finish it in a short amount of time. Let‚Äôs say when I come back from school, I would tell myself: I want to finish my school work in 2 hours and get my NLP project done for 2 hours. Tomorrow I will write a short article for 2 hours before getting to school.Knowing that I can complete these things in a short amount of time makes me excited and be in the flow. I can concentrate for hours without getting distracted. Seeing my work accomplished makes me feel motivated and have the momentum to keep going.Open several browsers for different projects I want to finish and new articles I want to read. I felt distracted knowing that there were still many things that I needed to finish.Once I get one thing done, I close all the files or browsers related to the previous work and move on to the next one. If the work hasn‚Äôt been done yet and I want to go back to the websites later, I just use One Tab to condense multiple browsers into one. Seeing my browsers clear prevents my mind from being distracted and clustered to focus on the work.Later when I want to come back to my work, I just open One Tab and can quickly access my own work.Another small secret that I have been adopting: put my phone on the airplane mode and turn off any notifications on my MacBook. I will answer messages at the time of my choice. Any message can wait.I knew learning new knowledge and getting updated with new technologies and techniques is important in the data science field. So I would spend a lot of time per day to explore different tools and read many articles without applying them. I felt exhausted and incompetent because I realized there were so many things I needed to learn but I hadn‚Äôt learned any of them yetWhenever I see interesting articles on Medium or from other websites, if I am doing something at that moment, I will skim some worthy articles, save them to Instapaper, and put them in a specific category (data science, programming, math, data viz, etc) so I can easily get access to them later. When I have a small free time (like on the bus, on the line, or in the lunchtime), I will pull out the articles I save in the app to read. Once I finish reading, I either delete them or save them if I want to get access or try out the codes later.By creating my own reading space and habits, I am able to get myself updated with new knowledge while still get the work done.Silently did the work every day. When it was time for me to show my work on my resume, I had nothing to show because I never shared or published my work after finishing it.Break a big project into smaller projects. Push my small accomplishments on Github or share my shortcodes on Medium. Then I will share my projects and articles on LinkedIn, Twitter, or my website. I never leave any of my projects and small accomplishments unnoticed.If you are hesitant to share your work because you think your work is not good enough, you will never be good enough. Once you share and receive the positive (or negative) feedback from others, you will feel more motivated to improve your skills to share better content.‚ÄúCan I skip my project for today? No, I should not make an excuse because I have promised myself that I need to dedicate the time to data science, for one hour every day, no matter what‚Äù. That thought gave me the feeling of obligation and the project became like homework or a job. I did not look forward to tackling the project.Tell myself I could skip my project, skip writing the article, skip my research if I want to. Nobody forces me to do it. That thought surprisingly switches my mindset about the work. I have the freedom to choose what I want to do and I still choose to work on my project. That means I really like this project! This will be fun. I immediately feel a boost in energy and enthusiasm to get my hands on the project.Whether you think you can or you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôre rightHenry FordThere are still many skills that I need to obtain to become a data scientist. But as I see my experiment with new approaches help me to obtain new skills efficiently and get more work done, I know that if I do not give up and have the courage to change the approaches that are not working, I will eventually achieve my vision.Thank you for reading my article. I will be happy to hear your opinions on any of these strategies and what strategies are working for you. I like to write about basic mathematical concepts and play with different data science tools. Follow me on Medium to get updated about my latest articles. You could also connect with me on LinkedIn and Twitter.Check out my other blogs on math and data science topics:WRITTEN BY"

Compared to a programming language like Python, it seems like a tool from the stone age. It doesn‚Äôt scale well, it's hard to reproduce results, and once you start writing VBA macros, you might as well be using Python.Given all that, though, Excel has survived. I can‚Äôt even think of a business that doesn‚Äôt use some type of spreadsheet software to help analyze data. As Joe Reis said:Excel is also still the mainstay of the business world. After WW3, cockroaches and Excel will survive.You might be wondering, why has Excel survived in a world of big data and sexy tools such as Spark and Snowflake? How is it possible that the humble spreadsheet has not been completely disrupted?I believe it is because Excel is one of the most user-friendly ways to view and analyze data. Excel is a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type of product. You enter Excel with a tabular view of your data and you can start editing, adding formulas, and creating pivot tables to your heart‚Äôs content. As you make these changes, what you see automatically updates. This is incredibly powerful and it makes Excel much more approachable.Also, Excel makes it very easy and intuitive to do basic analyses. Want to take the average of a column? Just use the AVERAGE formula. Want a scatter plot of your data? Just highlight your data, and click ‚Äúscatter plot‚Äù. This ease of use is an incredible benefit. One that allows companies to leverage non-programmers to analyze and visualize data. In my opinion, Excel is one of the best tools in existence to help a company have a data-driven culture.I think everyone can agree with the above points. Excel is a useful tool to help people easily and intuitively do basic data processing and analytics.But ‚Äî should it be a tool for data scientists?Or ‚Äî are we too advanced? Too sophisticated for the likes of Excel? Should all problems be run through Python or R?I would argue that every data scientist should have basic comfort with Excel and feel no shame in using it as a tool.I mention shame because I find it all too easy for data scientists to hate Excel. It definitely isn‚Äôt a tool for every problem. Probably not even most data science problems. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt have its place. I‚Äôve found Excel to be very useful in the following situations:Note: In all of the above examples, these would be ad-hoc requests which were not expected to be repeated. Once you start having to create a repeatable process, I would move to a programming language even if the analytics are simple. Doing so will make it much easier to reproduce and scale your analytics process if necessary. Reproducibility and scaling are two of the major downfalls of Excel.Hopefully, this short article has convinced you that Excel has a place in your data science toolbox. If you have not done much with Excel, I would urge you to go open up a CSV in Excel and explore the functionality. It is pretty easy to get started.If you‚Äôd like some help on getting started, Microsoft has some pretty nice, free tutorials.Lastly, also remember that Excel is not a good tool for many data science projects. If you find yourself with larger datasets, more advanced analytics/machine learning needs, or need to create a reproducible process, don‚Äôt use Excel. Go back to your programming language of choice.If you need a resource to help get you started in Python with analytics and visualization, you can check out a course I created to do just that.Now ‚Äî go and add another tool to your data science toolbox (if you haven‚Äôt already)!WRITTEN BY"
45,7 Modern Life Habits That Can Be Incredibly Bad For Your Brain Health,https://medium.com/kaizen-habits/7-modern-life-habits-doing-the-most-damage-to-your-brain-e392c9cfee42?source=extreme_main_feed---------48-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"In an era of better technology, we are all being rewired to do more to the detriment of our brains. According to experts, our modern lifestyle is chipping away at neural pathways and making us slower, denser and less capable of original thought. Hyperconnectivity is increasingly taking its toll on our brains. In the end, we end up less productive and ineffective.When it comes to our health, we don‚Äôt always think about nurturing our brains the way we nourish our bodies. But to be our most productive self, we need to do more of what improves our brain health, and less of what causes cognitive decline. Start by adjusting your daily habits and avoiding these common modern habits ‚Äî your mind will thank you.Physical inactivity has its price tags ‚Äî It‚Äôs linked to the development of chronic health problems like heart disease, obesity, depression, dementia, and cancer. Many people are too busy to make time for ‚Äúbasic movement activities‚Äù that can slow cognitive decline ‚Äî walking, cycling, stretching, etc.Being sedentary changes the shape of certain neurons in the brain, according to a new study in the Journal of Comparative Neurology that suggests a link between inactivity and mental decline.Regular physical activity can benefit you cognitively ‚Äî increase brain chemicals which promote better memory and learning, and medically. You know this though. Knowledge of the benefits of exercise is not a problem in the modern world, it‚Äôs the application of relevant information.Our smartphones have become Swiss army knives. We use them all the time. We text while we‚Äôre walking across the street, catch up on email while commuting, read or listen to podcasts while standing in a queue.You‚Äôve likely heard that multitasking is bad for your productivity. It turns out, it‚Äôs a habit that also rewires the brain and makes you less effective.Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT and one of the world experts on divided attention, says that our brains are ‚Äúnot wired to multitask well‚Ä¶ When people think they‚Äôre multitasking, they‚Äôre actually just switching from one task to another very rapidly. And every time they do, there‚Äôs a cognitive cost in doing so.‚ÄùMultitasking also increases the stress hormone cortisol as well as the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline, which can overstimulate your brain and cause mental fog or scrambled thinking.The sheer volume of emails, social updates, and notifications we receive can be overwhelming ‚Äî it takes a huge bite out of the day for many people. The constant stream of content if not managed can cause stress and lead to decision overload.‚ÄúToo Much Information‚Äù that, ‚ÄúInformation overload is one of the biggest irritations in modern life‚Äù, writes Schumpeter of The Economist.Some people proudly boast of how many things they can juggle in a single day. Glenn Wilson, former visiting professor of psychology at Gresham College, London found out in his research that being in a situation where you are trying to concentrate on a task, and an email is sitting unread in your inbox, can reduce your effective IQ by 10 points.To maximize your brain every day, use better tools and settings to filter information throughout the day. Be proactive about how you consume media. Prepare your brain to ignore unnecessary information. When you organize your day with these principles in mind, you will likely increase your brain‚Äôs efficiency significantly.Sitting is one of the worst things we can do for our health. A new UCLA study reports that people who are more sedentary have thinning in brain regions linked to memory.It finds that sitting isn‚Äôt just a physical health risk ‚Äî it‚Äôs a neurological risk as well. The authors write in their paper, ‚Äúit is possible that sedentary behaviour is a more significant predictor of brain structure, specifically [medial temporal lobe] thickness, and that physical activity, even at higher levels, is not sufficient to offset the harmful effects of sitting for extended periods of time.‚ÄùYou can reduce the amount of sitting you do by adopting interventions like moderate walking, standing while working, even for just 10 minutes at a time, standup meetings ‚Äî it offers the opportunity to sit less, move more and conduct short meetings.Today, face-to-face interactions are increasingly being replaced by digital tools. People spend more time online than ever before.‚ÄúAnything with a screen ‚Äî television, phones, tablets, computers, video games ‚Äî constitutes screen time,‚Äù explains Tom Kersting, a licensed psychotherapist and an expert in the field of mental health and parenting in the digital age. ‚ÄúIf the majority of our waking hours entails looking at a screen, then we know it is way too much.‚ÄùA face-to-face conversation is incredibly beneficial for your brain. A study by the University of Michigan found that even just 10 minutes per day of conversation with another person improved memory and cognition.‚ÄúIn our study, socializing was just as effective as more traditional kinds of mental exercise in boosting memory and intellectual performance,‚Äù said Oscar Ybarra, a psychologist at the U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR) and a lead author of the study with ISR psychologist Eugene Burnstein and psychologist Piotr Winkielman from the University of California, San Diego.The lack of true personal interaction limits the brain‚Äôs opportunities to make better connections. It can also lead to loneliness and depression ‚Äî mental conditions that contribute significantly to reduced brain health.Looking at screens all day can hurt your eyes, ears, neck, shoulders, back, wrists, and forearms. It also interferes with getting a good night‚Äôs sleep.According to experts, excessive screen time has a negative effect on intellectual abilities as well as emotional well-being.Set clear boundaries with screens to avoid developing detrimental habits. The goal isn‚Äôt to avoid screen time entirely, as that‚Äôs not realistic in modern life. However, if you‚Äôre going to use a device, be mindful.People, by nature, love to switch up the volume. It makes the music sounds more ‚Äúfun‚Äù and immersive. In the age of noise-cancelling earbuds and headphones, you can easily damage your hearing.When the rest of the world gets too distracting, it‚Äôs tempting to pop in your earbuds, crank up your favourite tunes, and close yourself off to focus better.If you consistently blast your music too loudly, you can damage your hearing. But it‚Äôs not just your ears: Hearing loss in older adults is linked to brain problems, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and loss of brain tissue.When your brain has to work so hard to understand what‚Äôs being said around you, it can‚Äôt store what you‚Äôve heard into memory. So, protect your hearing by adjusting the volume of your headphones ‚Äî it‚Äôs an excellent way to preserve your hearing and allow your brain to work better.‚ÄúOne test we recommend is to remove your headphones, keeping them at your preferred volume, and hold them out in front of you at an arm‚Äôs length. Can you hear the music clearly? If so, try turning it down and repeating again,‚Äù writes Headphonesty. Always aim to take regular breaks during the course of the day to give your ears a much-needed rest.Insufficient sleep is a huge problem for many busy professionals. Sleep deprivation can have serious short-term and long-term consequences ‚Äî it can delay reaction times, glucose levels, mood, headache, impaired memory, and hormone imbalances. Recent research shows that not getting enough sleep may actually shrink your brain.Sleep is absolutely essential for your brain. When you deprive your brain healthy sleep, how it process information, consolidates memories, make connections, and clear out toxins suffers.Lack of sleep slows down your thinking, impairs your memory, concentration, judgment, and decision-making, and impedes learning.Improving your sleep habits could be an important way to improve brain health. 7‚Äì8 hours/night of good sleep is essential for stimulating new connections and brain growth.If you are concerned about the health of your brain and the quality of your thinking now or in the future, learn to take care of your brain. A few simple changes to your lifestyle could boost your memory, learning, mental resilience and overall health of your brain.WRITTEN BY"
46,"Using Python to Analyze the Brutal Lyrics of The Black Dahlia Murder with Genius API, SpaCy‚Ä¶",https://towardsdatascience.com/using-python-to-analyze-the-brutal-lyrics-of-the-black-dahlia-murder-with-genius-api-spacy-bfc7e0e8577f?source=extreme_main_feed---------49-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"In honor of their upcoming album Verminous, releasing April 17, 2020, and because they are one of my favorite death metal bands of all time, I decided to analyze The Black Dahlia Murder‚Äôs (BDM) lyrics to see how they have evolved over time. Back in 2006, my buddy burned a CD of his favorite metal songs, and ‚ÄúMiasma‚Äù from BDM‚Äôs album Miasma was on it. Once I heard that song, I was hooked for life and have seen them perform live five times. Formed in 2001, BDM quickly rose up as one of the most popular American death metal bands. Their last seven albums charted on the Billboard 200 with their fifth album, Ritual, peaking at 31 in 2011!The subject-mater is dark and morose, and the music feels like the embodiment of rage and depression, but as an angsty teenager in the early 2000's, the energy and the anger of Death metal struck a chord with me. I could relate to it. To this day, I find comfort in melodic riffs, double kicks, and grumbling vocals because they put me in a trance-like state, relaxing me and focusing my mind. I find Death Metal to be the perfect music for coding and working out, and I like to start my day headbanging to blast beats.I am extracting the lyrics from Genius.com. Because of the blood curdling screams and the unearthly growls used in heavy metal, lyrics can sometimes be quite difficult to understand. That‚Äôs why I use Genius to decipher them. Genius.com is a platform for annotating lyrics, and collecting trivia about music, albums and artists.Although the website doesn‚Äôt allow users to extract lyrics using the API, I am using a Genius API wrapper that parses the Genius HTML with BeautifulSoup. The process results in a pandas DataFrame that contains the song title, url, artist, album and lyrics. Find the wrapper on my GitHub in a file named getLyrics.py.To use the wrapper, pass your Genius API token and the artist into the GeniusLyricCollector. Then call get_artist_songs() to populate the DataFrame.Before analyzing data, it is always best to explore and clean it as needed. Right off the bat, I notice row 2 has no album listed, so I know I need to clean the data, and I want to add some features too. In order to preserve the original dataframe in case I need to go back to it, I‚Äôll copy it and work on the copy. I check the included albums:I only want songs from their 8 studio albums. Verminous hasn‚Äôt released and has no lyrics, Black on Black is a tribute album and A Cold-Blooded Epitaph is an EP, so I‚Äôll exclude all of those.Feature engineering is the process of using data mining techniques and domain knowledge to extract features from raw data. I want to engineer some features that will give me insight into the lexical richness of the albums. I‚Äôll define lexical richness using a few different factors. I‚Äôll add a word count, unique word count, and unique words/word count (lexical diversity). While it can be a useful measure and is a simple calculation, the basic problem with calculating lexical diversity this way is its sensitivity to text length. Luckily, the length of each album is fairly similar. Several different ways have been devised to overcome the problems with the method, but I‚Äôll use the simple calculation.I also add the album‚Äôs year of release and sort by the column.During a 2019 interview for kerrang.com, lyricist, vocalist and band frontman Trevor Strnad discussed albums, ranking them worst to best. In last place, he put Miasma, the band‚Äôs second studio album. Having grown up with the album, I love it, but he said the album felt unfocused, in part because they were riding such a high from their early success with Unhallowed. The stats show that Miasma has the fewest words and the fewest unique words suggesting that Trevor is correct about the themes and the lyrics being less defined compared to other albums. He wasn‚Äôt able to give the album the attention he thought it deserved.To visualize the data, I‚Äôm using plotly express since it produces interactive visualizations in only a few lines of code! Below is a histogram showing the distribution of word count by album.Box plots are a great way to visualize the quartile statistics. Using pandas‚Äô describe(), it is easy to generate the raw quartiles too. Using Plotly Express, it is possible to set the quartile algorithm used in the box plots. It defaults to linear.Once again, we can see the Album Miasma doesn‚Äôt have quite the range and diversity of the other albums. Looking at the albums that have lower lexical diversity, I notice that those are all of the albums with well defined themes: Nocturnal, Ritual, Abysmal, and Unhallowed. Ritual for example, is their highest charting album, but has a lower lexical diversity than other albums. This is likely due to songs like ‚ÄúOh Great Burning Nullifier‚Äù that have repeating patterns, like chants, which are thematic to the album.SpaCy is ‚Äúan industrial-strength‚Äù Natural Language Processing library for Python. It was developed using Cython under the hood, making it fast and and efficient for large-scale text processing tasks like Parts-of-speech (PoS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER). I‚Äôm going to use the part of speech tagger to get a deeper look into the lyrics and themes used in the albums.If you‚Äôre new to spaCy, I recommend checking out their installation page since they have a lot of installation options. SpaCy is compatible with Python 2.7 / 3.5+ and runs on Unix/Linux, macOS/OS X and Windows. The latest spaCy releases are available via pip and conda. Otherwise, these commands will get you up and running.Using spaCy, I can split the text into tokens, and use the part of speech tagger to identify all of the nouns, verbs and adjectives. I‚Äôm going to take a look at the top 15 adjectives per album to see what patterns emerge. It is important to note that spaCy is powerful, but not perfect. It uses statistical models to predict parts of speech or named entities.Instead of analyzing the raw word, I‚Äôm going to analyze the lemmas. Lemmatisation is a technique that normalizes the language by reducing the word to a root form while maintaining that it is a real word. Another commonly used normalization technique is called Stemming.Notice in the above code snippet, I create a dataframe and populate it with the word token, the part of speech tag, and the lemma. When I calculate the counts for ADJ, I‚Äôll use the lemma instead of the token.Rightly so, it is clear that death, darkness and human fragility are major themes in the BDM‚Äôs music. The word ‚Äúdead‚Äù tops the list for all albums except Unhallowed and Nocturnal, two of their early hit albums. Although a lot of the same words show up in each album, there are a few thematic differences. For example, in Nocturnal I can see the words ‚Äúunholy‚Äù, ‚Äúwretched,‚Äù and ‚Äúnecromantic‚Äù appear multiple times which are thematically representative of a world cast into eternal darkness, like the album conveys. Using a plotly express bar chart, the data is easy to visualize.Although the lyrics are only a small portion of what I enjoy about death metal, they are interesting to analyze. Even without running techniques like K-means or LDA, spaCy can help identify themes in the text using the features like the tagger and named entity recognition. Looking at The Black Dahlia Murder‚Äôs lyrics, they represent anger and depravity, depression and insanity.

47,How Machine Learning Works!,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-machine-learning-works-b801303b1a19?source=extreme_main_feed---------50-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"Machine Learning is a data analysis technique that builds predictive models on data sets to provide useful answers that can be utilized in making important decisions. It utilizes statistical concepts as well as mathematical approaches to work on big data via coding languages such as python and R. There are multiple machine learning techniques. However, this article will be covering regression and classification.Regression is used to predict continuous numerical data. It is a widely used statistical concept that can be applied manually for small data sets with about two variables and few elements. When dealing with large data sets with multiple variables and loads of elements, regression is done by uploading files containing data sets into coding platforms and running a bunch of codes.There are different kinds of regression techniques such as linear regression, polynomial regression, multiple linear regression and multiple polynomial regression. Their applications vary based on how many independent variables are going to be used for predicting the dependent variable. Below are some useful terminologies associated with regression:A regression equation is an equation that takes uses the independent variable(s) to make predictions of the dependent variable. It can be expressed as y=mx + b, y = ax^n + bx^n-1 + ‚Ä¶+ c, y = ax+ bx2 +‚Ä¶+ c or y = ax^n + bx^n-1 + ‚Ä¶+ c for linear regression, polynomial regression, multiple linear regression and multiple polynomial regression respectively.Regression coefficient is a constant value that is applied in linear regression or multiple linear regression. It can have an increasing or decreasing effect on the dependent variable. Let‚Äôs use an example where variables such as age and height(cm) are used to determine weight (pounds).For linear regression, it can be either expressed as weight = 5*age + 30. This equation suggests that for every increase in age by 1 year there is an increase in weight by 5 pounds.For multiple linear regression, it can be expressed as weight = 4*age +2.5*height + 30. This equation implies that given that age is zero, weight is going to increase by a magnitude of 2.5 for every cm of height and given that height is zero, weight is going to increase by 4 pounds for an increase in age by one year.This is the can be described as the value of the dependent variable given that the regression coefficient(s) or x is set to zero. It can be expressed as y=c. It is also the point at which the line of regression cuts the y-axis.The data set is split into two groups: the training data set and the testing data set. After splitting the data set into groups, a regression equation is generated using the training data set. Once developed, the regression equation is applied on the testing data set to create predictions.The predicted values can be compared with the actual values to test for accuracy. Metrics for evaluating the predictions are described below:Coefficient of Determination, r-squared, is a useful mechanism for explaining how the accurate the regression equation is for making predictions. This is done by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. It provides a value that signifies what proportion of the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s). In order to improve the r-squared score, one can switch from one style of regression to another.This is another very useful value that describes the relationship between the values in both the actual results and predicted results. It ranges from -1 to 1. If the correlation coefficient is negative, then the predicted results increase as the actual results decrease and vice-versa. If it is positive, the predicted results increase as the actual results increase. The closer the value is to |1|, the more perfect the relationship is.Mean Squared Error is the average of the total squared differences between the predicted values and actual values at each data point. This value is a measure of how close the data set is to the line of regression on average. The square root of this value is called the root mean squared error. The goal is to make the root mean square error close to 0 to obtain an optimal fit.Classification is another great machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict categorical data sets. The independent variable(s) can be continuous or categorical while the dependent variable is categorical. Classification can be used to build either a model that provides a yes (1) or no (0) answer or multiple categories (0,1,2‚Ä¶.) depending on what the user‚Äôs agenda is. It makes use of training and testing data set just like regression.Using the results from one of my former project in which I predicted loan application status, classification methods such as K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree Classifier and their metrics shall be explained below:This is a classification method that uses the closest data points to that specific data point to predict what category that data point should belong to. By evaluating each data points‚Äô independent and dependent variables and comparing them to the k nearest ones, it creates a predictive model using the training data set. This model is used in predicting the category of each data point in the testing data set and its accuracy is measured.Multiple iteration is done by setting k to a value of 1, measuring its accuracy and increasing the k value until it reaches the point of peak accuracy.This k-max value predictive model is used to further analyze the data set by fitting a predictive model with the training model and categorizing the data points in testing data set using the predictive model.Decision Tree Classifier uses a different approach from the K-Nearest Neighbor. It starts off by looking at all the data points in the training model and evaluating an independent variable and assigns it a Yes (1) or No (0) label according to the value of this variable. Then, it proceeds to other independent variables based on the output of the previous independent variable(s) to arrive at a final label of Y or N as the predicted outcome.The predictive model that is generated from the decision tree classifier training data set can be used to predict the categories of the data points in the testing data set.A confusion matrix is a table that is used in classification to show how many values were predicted correctly and how many values were predicted wrongly. There are two types of errors: Type I error and Type II error. A type I error is regarded as a false positive, that is, a negative value which is categorized as positive. A type II error is a false negative, that is, a positive value which is categorized as negative.Classification performance can be measured using metrics such as precision, recall and accuracy can be calculated using the confusion matrix.Precision is used to see how much of the positive value recorded are actually positive. Its formula is TP/(TP +FP). For the confusion matrix above, the precision is: 119/(119+54) = 0.69Recall is also a called true positive rate. It calculates proportion of true positive values among the actual positives. Its formula is TP/(TP +FN). Recall in the confusion matrix above is 119/(119+10) = 0.92True Negative Rate measures proportion of true negative values among the actual negatives. Its formula is TN/(TN +FP). For the confusion matrix above, it is 9/(9+54) = 0.15.Accuracy is simply the total of all the accurately recorded values divided by the sum of all the recorded values. Its formula is (TP + TN)/(TP +TN + FP+FN). Accuracy in the confusion matrix above is (119 + 9)/(119 + 9 +54 + 10) = 0.67.The F-1 score is similar to the r-squared score. It is a measure of how well the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables. This is done by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. The closer it is to 1, the stronger the predictive model. The F-1 score can be measured for the predictive models of different classification methods to decide which one to use.Machine Learning is a field that has the ability to guide us towards making effective decisions in our daily activities. It is going to be very helpful in assisting humans and companies to make intelligent decisions in the future. For instance, classification can tell us whether or not to invest in a certain business and regression tells us how much we are likely to make if we invest in that business.WRITTEN BY"
48,"The Frameworks that Google, DeepMind, Microsoft and Uber Use to Train Deep Learning Models at Scale",https://towardsdatascience.com/the-frameworks-that-google-deepmind-microsoft-and-uber-use-to-train-deep-learning-models-at-scale-30be6295725?source=extreme_main_feed---------51-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"Large scale training is one of the most challenging aspects of building deep learning solutions in the real world. Like the old proverb says, your greatest strength can become your biggest weakness and that certainly applies to deep learning models. The entire deep learning space was possible in part to the ability of deep neural networks to scale across GPU topologies. However, that same ability to scale resulted in the creation of computationally intensive programs that result operationally challenging to most organizations. From training to optimization, the lifecycle of deep learning programs requires robust infrastructure building blocks to be able to parallelize and scale computation workloads. While deep learning frameworks are evolving at a rapid pace, the corresponding infrastructure models remain relatively nascent. Over the last few years, technology giants Google , Microsoft, Uber, DeepMind and others have regularly unveiled separate efforts for enabling the parallelization of deep learning models across large GPU infrastructures.The principle of distributing and parallelizing computations is relevant across almost any stage of the lifecycle of a deep learning program. Training a deep learning model can be an incredibly expensive exercise and so is its execution. The obvious answer obvious is to leverage large GPU networks to distribute the workloads of deep learning programs but that‚Äôs far from being an easy endeavor. Concurrent and parallel programming is notoriously complex and even more so when applied to large neural networks. Large technology companies face these challenges every day as they operate incredibly complex deep neural networks for mission critical applications. Today, I would like to review some of the top architectures used at Google, DeepMind, Microsoft and Uber to parallelize the training of large scale deep learning models. Specifically, I would like to discuss the following projects:¬∑ Google GPipe¬∑ Uber Horovod¬∑ DeepMind TF-Replicator¬∑ Microsoft DeepSpeedGPipe focuses on scaling training workloads for deep learning programs. The complexity of training processes from an infrastructure standpoint is an often-overlooked aspect of deep learning models. Training datasets are getting larger and more complex. For instance, in the health care space, is not uncommon to encounter models that need to be trained using millions of high resolution images. As a result, training processes often take a long time to complete and result incredibly expensive from the memory and CPU consumption.An effective way to think about the parallelism of deep learning models is to divide it between data and model parallelism. The data parallelism approach employs large clusters of machines to split the input data across them. Model parallelism attempts to move the model to accelerators, such as GPUs or TPUs, which have special hardware to accelerate model training. At a high level, almost all training datasets can be parallelized following certain logic but the same can‚Äôt be said about models. For instance, some deep learning models are composed of parallel branches which can be trained independently. In that case, a classic strategy is to divide the computation into partitions and assign different partitions to different branches. However, that strategy falls short in deep learning models that stack layers sequentially, presenting a challenge to parallelize computation efficiently.GPipe combines both data and model parallelism by leveraging aa technique called pipelining. Conceptually, GPipe is a distributed machine learning library that uses synchronous stochastic gradient descent and pipeline parallelism for training, applicable to any DNN that consists of multiple sequential layers. GPipe partitions a model across different accelerators and automatically splits a mini-batch of training examples into smaller micro-batches. This model allows GPipe‚Äôs accelerators to operate in parallel maximizing the scalability of the training process.The following figure illustrates the GPipe model with a neural network with sequential layers is partitioned across four accelerators. Fk is the composite forward computation function of kth partition. Bk is the corresponding backpropagation function. Bk depends on both Bk+1 from upper layer and the intermediate activations of Fk. In the top model, we can see how the sequential nature of the network leads to the underutilization of resources. The bottom figure shows the GPipe approach in which the input mini-batch is divided into smaller macro-batches which can be processed by the accelerators at the same time.Google open sourced an implementation of GPipe as part of the TensorFlow project.Horovod is one of the Uber ML stacks that has become extremenly popular within the community and has been adopted by research teams at AI-powerhouses like DeepMind or OpenAI. Conceptually, Horovod is a framework for running distributed deep learning training jobs at scale.Horovod leverages message passing interface stacks such as OpenMPI to enable a training job to run on a highly parallel and distributed infrastructure without any modifications. Running a distributed TensorFlow training job in Horovod is accomplished in four simple steps:You can see these four steps in the following code sample that is a template of a basic TensorFlow training job:TF-Replicator focuses on a different aspect of scalability related to how TensorFlow programs leverage Tensor Processing Units(TPUs). Considered one of the most advanced AI chips, TPUs provide native scalability for machine learning workloads. However, the usage of TPUs in TensorFlow programs require specialized APIs which causes issues with portability and barriers of adoption for data scientists who are not familiar with the underlying hardware model. DeepMind‚Äôs TF-Replicator addresses this challenge by providing a simpler, developer friendly programming model for leveraging TPUs in TensorFlow programs.The magic of TF-Replicator relies on an ‚Äúin-graph replication‚Äù patter in which the computation for each device is replicated in the same TensorFlow graph. Communication between devices is achieved by connecting nodes from the devices‚Äô corresponding sub-graphs. To achieve that level of parallelization, TF-Replicator leverage TensorFlow‚Äôs graph rewriting model to insert native communication between devices in the graph. When presented with a TensorFlow graph, TF-Replicator first builds the computation for each device independently and leaves placeholders where cross-device computation has been specified by the user. Once the sub-graphs for all devices have been built, TF-Replicator connects them by replacing the placeholders with actual cross-device computation.From the programming model standpoint, code written using TF-Replicator looks similar to native TensorFlow code authored for a single device. The user simply needs to define (1) an input function that exposes a Dataset, and (2) a step function that defines the logic of their model (e.g. a single step of gradient descent). The following code snippet shows a simple TF-Replicator program:To optimize the communication between different devices, TF-Replicator leverages state-of-the-art MPI interfaces. In some experiments, DeepMind was able to train the famous BigGAN model on batches of size 2048 across up to 512 cores of a TPUv3 pod. At the moment, TF-Replicator is the main programming interface for TPUs at DeepMind.Microsoft‚Äôs DeepSpeed is a new open source framework focused on optimizing the training of massively large deep learning models. The current release includes the first implementation of ZeRO as well as other optimization methods. From a programming standpoint, DeepSpeed is built on top of PyTorch and provides a simple API that allows engineers to leverage training parallelization techniques with just a few lines of code. DeepSpeed abstracts all of the difficult aspects of large scale training, such as parallelization, mixed precision, gradient accumulation, and checkpoints allowing developers to focus on the construction of the models.From the functional standpoint, DeepScale excels at four key aspects:¬∑ Scale: DeepSpeed provides system support to run models up to 100 billion parameters which represents a 10x improvement compared to other training optimization frameworks.¬∑ Speed: In the initial tests, DeepSpeed showed 4x-5x higher throughput than other libraries.¬∑ Cost: Models could be trained using DeepSpeed at three times less cost than alternatives.¬∑ Usability: DeepSpeed does not require refactoring PyTorch models and could be used with just a few lines of code.Parallelizing the training of deep learning models is a very complex excercise that falls beyond the expertise of most machine learning teams. Leveraging the frameworks and architectures created by technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Uber or DeepMind can certainly streamline these efforts. In the near future, we expect to see some versions of these frameworks included in mainstream deep learning stacks to democratize the access by the core deep learning community.WRITTEN BY"

Millions of jobs are being lost due to automation.In fact, according to a McKinsey study, an estimated 73 million jobs are going to be lost due to automation by the year 2030. You don't need to look that far to see how the changes are already effecting the current economic landscape. In 2015, McDonald's restaurant started implementing automated kiosks in their U.S. stores ‚Äî they plan to have these rolled out in all 14,000 locations by 2020.The fears of automation extend beyond the marketplace. In order to confront and offer counter measures to the onslaught of job loss looming; we even have a 2020 United States Presidential nominee whose campaign platform combats the issue with Universal Basic Income:The redistribution of certain tax dollars (gained through a value added tax) as a basic citizen stipend of $1,000 to be used by the recipient with no questions asked in order to create monetary movement throughout the economy.Like many modern technologies, there are both positives and negatives associated with these innovations. We see this with many of the things that have entered the marketplace in the last decade or so:All of this brings us to the looming fears of automation and how that will strip away millions of jobs for hard working individuals.But all too often when broaching this subject do we note the negatives of the technology. We often let fear get in the way of the opportunities that may lie in this encroaching technological and economic metamorphosis.The jobs that are going to be lost with the onset of automation are jobs that are automatic in their own nature. They are monotonous, repetitive jobs that require mindless work that‚Äôs incompatible with creative human nature.In this article, we'll uncover how despite the looming fears of automation, it is actually a good thing. With the right tool set and strategies you can take this opportunity and develop an entrepreneurial endeavor with it.I come from a small business family.My grandfather, who was first generation American, decided to take a risk with his brother in the 1960s and go into business for himself and his family. They started a modest masonry business.As things took off, he and his brother decided to part ways. My grandfather knew someone in manufacturing and in 1979 he started another business in metal finishing.Straight out of high school, my father went work for him. In 1997, my father decided to break from his father's business and started his own metal finishing enterprise.You get an idea to start a businessYou create a business plan of how you are going to actualize said business ideaYou interview with banks in order to secure a business loan.This business loan takes into consideration your operating costs, building rent, utilities, widget creation and all associated costs with getting your business off the ground.You receive your business loanYou put yourself in debt to the bank and any other lenderYou work your ass off to make a name for yourselfYou have started a business ‚Äî now you hope that you can sustain itSure, in that description, there are liberties taken. However, the overarching points of having a massive influx of tangible responsibilities (product, space and financial) make it hard to go into business for yourself. This doesn't even take into consideration that 82% of businesses today that apply for a business loan are denied.Have a great ideaUse the internet to get that business idea out to the globeSell your ideaYou see, with the automation of the repetitive job, the global economy is going to be looking for human creativity to solve its problems and fill its needs.Let's unpack the three listed steps above and how those steps can lead you to developing yourself into a badass that creates passive income‚Ä¶‚ÄúGood artists copy; Great artists steal‚Äù ‚Äî Pablo PicassoMany people get stuck at this step (and we haven't even left the runway yet) because they think that they need an idea that is completely and utterly unique in its essence.This couldn't be further from the truth.In tomorrow's economy, the marketplace isn't going to be contingent on everyone creating the next Facebook or Twitter.As we move away from automated and monotonous work, the need for communication and storytelling will create micro-niches of like-minded tribes and within those tribes you will be able to create self-sustaining enterprises that don't require millions of customers.Take for instance the idea of 1,000 True Fans, Kevin Kelly's groundbreaking article on how moving into the future, a viable business can be sustained through the adoption of a product or service by 1,000 True Fans (fans that have literally and figuratively ""bought-in"" to a company or individual's narrative and business thus creating repeat business whenever a new product or service is introduced to the marketplace).The premise is simple:You have a product that sells for $100 and you have 1,000 True Fans (as defined above). Those 1,000 fans buying a $100 product will lead to $100,000 in revenue. You can take it further by increasing the product price or the audience and the number of times you create, release and sell a product.Your own idea that you are going to turn into an enterprise can be within a number of niches:To be clear, it's not the uniqueness of the idea that is going to set your idea into monetary-building-motion, it's the way you share and tell that idea.Millions of people are into cross-fit, but perhaps a few hundred or thousand might be attracted to the way you share the ideas associated with the discipline. Same goes for many other areas of interest.Let's now take a look at how to get that idea out and to the masses‚Ä¶""No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.""
‚Äî Robin WilliamsThe internet is the epitome of game-changing technology.While we've had the internet for many years, people are finally discovering the true potential of what it allows for us to do.One of the biggest opportunities of the internet is the ability to connect like-minded individuals and groups with one another at extremely low costs and easy accessibility.Through the creation of a website or through social media and internet forums, humans have the ability to find like-minded individuals engaging in discussion, discovering and examining their mutual interests.The most viable route, considering the methods above, to becoming a badass that creates passive income is through purchase, creation and promotion of one's website.Consider your website as a modern day store front or manufacturing plant. It is your most valuable tool in becoming a modern day entrepreneur. In fact, new research notes that 87% of all consumers begin with their product searches online.If you're not online with your business idea and product or service, you're not going to last in the future economy.There are many avenues one can go with creating and hosting a site. The purposes of this article aren't going to go into the specifics of how ‚Äî on a technical level to do that ‚Äî for more on that, check out this resource:Once you have your site built and you begin to gain traction on the internet, it's time to turn your site into a business.‚ÄúHuman beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives.‚Äù ‚Äî Daniel PinkAs stated earlier in the article, the problems that are going to be solved in the future economy are going to require human ingenuity, spirit and creativity.All of those human attributes are going to be shared through educating one another.Did you know that national college enrollment has declined the last seven years in a row? While there are many factors that contribute to the decline in enrollment including:One culprit is due to the ability of self-starters to be able to glean their education from utilities such as YouTube. With over 100 million hours of content being uploaded on YouTube every minute, it (and the rest of the internet) are turning into education machines.Why put your content up on YouTube for the world to learn via your expertise and experience and have YouTube take home the spoils with the help of their advertisers?In order to take home your piece of the pie in terms of your entrepreneurial pursuit, you'll need to utilize the E-Learning marketplace and all of it's available opportunities. E-Learning is an industry geared towards building educational content to audiences looking to increase skill share, knowledge, entertainment and the like.Market research firm Global Industry Analysts projected E-Learning would reach $107 Billion in 2015 (spoiler alert: it did!). Currently, research indicates that the industry will triple in size compared to 2015 with an expected value of $325 Billion by 2025.What types of educational products can you educate your audience with in order to solve their complex and creative problems the future will hold for them?Can you see how this all starts to tie together?The world isn't what it used to be. Most of the time when people say this, they get fearful of what the future holds.Millions of people are going to lose the jobs that they perform today ‚Äî this is a fact.But many overlook the opportunities in front of them. Take what passions you have and leverage that into a self-sustaining business, with little financial obligation needed to start it.Starting a business that builds passive income can be done in three overarching steps:When you have an idea that helps solve a complex problem for a group of people, you have an enterprising business.You don't need to covert the world over to your idea. Using Kevin Kelly's 1,000 True Fans idea ‚Äî you only need to win over a small fraction of the population in order to make your idea a viable business.When you utilize tools and modern technology, you can get that idea out to the public without the barriers (financial, distribution, inventory, etc) that stalled people from going into business for themselves in decades past.This should be done through the ownership of your own site. With your own site, you create your internet store front.Through your internet store front, you can utilize different strategies to generate traffic and build your audience base.Once you have a platform from which to launch, you can use the growing industry of E-Learning to take your idea and form it into a product or service that will educate your loyal fans.From there, there really is no limit to what you can create‚Ä¶You can branch off and open up other businesses (create new websites in different niches) or build a personal brand and see where that takes you as an influencer or thought leader.The choice is yours.So stop being fearful of the future and start to see what opportunity lies on the opposite side of the same coin!WRITTEN BY"
50,How the Macy Conferences Shaped the Future,https://medium.com/in-tech/the-macy-conferences-shaped-the-future-50df51361818?source=extreme_main_feed---------53-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"Read how getting people working on the edge of their disciplines together unleashed new thought paradigms, transformed entire disciplines and fuelled decades of innovation.At the radical Macy conferences in New York in the 1940s, neuropsychologist Warren McCulloch‚Äôs job was to ensure that disciplinary boundaries were not followed. The idea behind the conferences was simple. Bring the best minds working at the edge of their disciplines to talk about our future. The Macy conferences influenced the internet and redefined social systems, psychology, neuroscience, and informatics for decades to come.It was perhaps the first academic exercise in true transdisciplinarity.The Macy conferences were set up to push the frontiers of medical research and develop a unified theory of the human mind. Invitees would not present their research or explore their domain expertise. Instead, they would discuss their work in progress and develop an epistemology that did not exist. The concept of ‚Äúinformation‚Äù, so ubiquitous now, was born there.Psychologists, anthropologists, neuroscientists and mathematicians sat down to discuss what ‚Äúinformation‚Äù meant to each of them in their domains and develop a common vocabulary to understand what the concept meant, and how it was changing over time. This allowed them to transcend disciplinary boundaries to develop new ways of seeing what was coming- the information revolution that was going to transform the world.Using new terms such as ‚Äúinformation,‚Äù ‚Äúfeedback,‚Äù and ‚Äúanalog/digital‚Äù, the participants tried to develop a universal theory of regulation and control, applicable to living beings as well as to machines, to economic as well as to mental processes, and to sociological as well as to aesthetic phenomena.These concepts changed thinking in such diverse fields as biology, neurology, sociology, language studies, computer science, psychoanalysis, ecology, politics, and economy.It created new methodologies in each discipline and opened space for interpretive inquiry in an interconnected system, something that was a result of putting the human next to the machine and interrogating both thoroughly.This is how cybernetics and cognitive science were born twins.Playing the role of a professional catalyst made John Brockman a superstar. Long before he joined the legendary MIT Media Labs, he was an established literary agent who brought together the worlds of the arts and sciences together, putting seemingly irreconcilable worlds in conversation(evident even today in the brilliant content that edge.org produces). He was buddies with Andy Warhol and Bob Dylan, known for going around circles that never otherwise intersected.The story goes that Brockman was given a copy of Norbert Wiener‚Äôs Cybernetics by Stewart Brand. Both read the book cover to cover in the following days. Brockman says that it changed his life. There were sowed the seeds of the ‚ÄúThird Culture‚Äù as a literary genre, along with science fiction as a new form of writing. He was called upon by MIT to organise meetings between those who did the arts and the sciences. He founded The Whole Earth Catalog, a collection of alternative products and innovative technologies that were cutting edge. What the MIT Media Lab would become as a center, full of diverse creative genius who did technology, art, and design under one roof and innovate far ahead than what the world could fathom, goes back to the fountainhead.The conferences impacted people as diverse as Steve Jobs and Gilles Deleuze, the former drawing heavily from the catalog that Brockman started. The formative work available in the transcripts of the Macy Conferences was circulated far beyond its attendees and inspired a generation of American innovators late till the 21st century. Across disciplines, Norbert Wiener (the founding father of cybernetics) to philosopher Gilles Deleuze, to sociologist Jean Francois Lyotard, all owe their dazzling successes to the epoch changing shifts that Macy enabled. Thinking of information in systems through feedback, neural networks and the nature of information gave birth to Wiener‚Äôs path-breaking book Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine that would create a new field of inquiry altogether. The idea was to arrive at principles of behaviour and information-feedback that would apply to organisms, machines and social systems.Sociologist Jean Francis Lyotard traced the development and characteristics of the new information society that followed from industrial society in his book The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. He examined how for, the first time, whoever controlled data banks and communication systems would rule the world, years before businesses and thinkers hit the realisation. Gilles Deleuze became possibly the most radical French philosopher to write about societies of control that followed industrial society, worrying about issues such as surveillance in technologically advanced states.It would be an understatement to say that the future was crafted at the Macy Conferences.The ‚Äúhuman‚Äù as we know it, is fraying. At the cusp of a new technological transformation as we grapple with questions of human/artificial, material/abstract, subject/object we can learn much from what happened in those ten years. We need to come up with methods and techniques of engagement that foster newer understandings of what makes us human, what is consciousness and how do we understand the world we are going to inhabit. As computer scientists and philosophers ponder on what ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù and ‚Äúartificial‚Äù mean, we need mathematicians, ethicists, designers, and psychologists to get together and create new forms of thought and praxis that pave the way for tomorrow. Macy seems like a good place to look back to look ahead.Can we think and create the future together afresh, now?In our time of rapid technological flux and immense information flows, In.tech is a space to slow down and reflect on fundamental questions. Twice a month, we give you the big-picture, reading the relationship between technology, politics, culture and ourselves.

51,How I Learned Python in 6 Months,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-learn-python-in-6-months-87fbef0eceae?source=extreme_main_feed---------54-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"To be frank, learning a new language is no easy feat. For someone with no prior experience in programming or computing, learning a whole language like python might seem like an impossible task. However, with all things alike, nothing is quite impossible unless you think it is. Here, I share with you some of my tips to learn the most popular programming language in 2020.Learning without a goal is one of the worst mistakes you can make. Without a motivating goal, you will easily lose track of why you are learning the language in the first place. I wrote this from experience as I had tried to pick up C and Java before without any success. Both end up in failure as I had no idea where to apply the language and soon gave up the idea of learning. Without any use cases, I also did not manage to learn past the syntax of those languages.However, things are different when I'm learning Python. Learning python is part of my plan of picking up data science skills and shift my career into an analytics one. Hence, I am not learning python just for the sake of learning. I need a working knowledge of python to work on data analytics, require understanding an array of libraries to start on my projects. I have a bigger purpose to learn python.Setting an initial goal is getting the job half done. Find an application for the language you are learning and you will be one step closer to mastering it.There is no lack of resources online. My only advice is not to rely solely on one. Make use of the vast variety of resources available that utilised different mode of delivery to enhance your learning experience. Here are some of the resources I used to learn python;Complete Python Bootcamp and Python for Data Science covered the basics of python programming and libraries essential for data science. These courses come in the form of video lectures with Jupyter notebooks as assignments.2. Interactive Coding EnvironmentDatacamp and Dataquest are great platforms to code while you learn for data science. They provide an interactive environment for you to practise as you go, allowing concepts to stick and familiarise yourself with coding. For general python, check out learnpython.org for similar delivery. A programming language is similar to natural language, practise and practise is the way to learn.3. edXComputation Thinking using Python by MITx teaches python in a classroom-style manner. This is best for you if you miss attending on-campus lesson as lectures and assignment are given on a weekly basis together with a mid-term and final examination. What differentiates them from other MOOCs is the programming assignments they gave. These assignments are well thought of and require learners to code basic algorithms which serve as a great exercise for logical thinking.4. BlogsThere is no lack of blogs providing recommendation or advice on the resources to learn data science. One such blog I encountered recently is Self Learn Data Science where they actively push out contents that help beginners to get started in their data science learning journey. They also present it in a clear and concise manner, providing their reviews and recommendation in an objective way. Others more reputable blogs include Data Science Central or KDnuggets. Depending on your preferences, you might prefer some over others. Look around and see which blogs suit your learning style.You would not know how much you know unless you apply what you learned. Project is a great way to assess your knowledge and definitely a great addition for your resume. Work on a project that interests you and you might just learn much more than going through courses. Practical application is always the best approach to learning a technical skill.As an example, I myself work on translating a Machine Learning Course material from MatLab to python codes. I spent a whole month coding every day, googling and getting hang of the language. I strongly believed that this has contributed much more to my mastery in python than any courses I took. You can read more about the project here.Having a GitHub profile is a must if you plan to move into the tech space. You can find helpful sample/starting codes for all kind of application that you want to build and even contribute to interesting projects. So what does GitHub got to do with learning python? Almost everything. Programmers learn from copying codes and GitHub is just a great repository of codes in one place. There are a few ways you can learn python from GitHub:That's how I pick up python in 6 months. You can certainly do it too, let me know how it goes in the comment section.To have another language is to possess a second soul ‚Äì CharlemagneWRITTEN BY"
52,A Simple Approach To Building a Recommendation System,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-approach-to-building-a-recommendation-system-d0f4de1a1f50?source=extreme_main_feed---------55-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"To understand the power of recommendation systems, it is easiest to focus on Netflix, whose state of the art recommendation system keeps us in front of our TVs for hours. However, recommenders are extremely diverse, playing a role in cross-selling products, identifying employee candidates who have similar skill sets, and finding customers who will respond to promotional messaging. And these examples only just scratch the surface of how recommendations systems can be used.Although recommenders can be very complex, there are two simple approaches that act as a good starting point.This post will focus on developing a collaborative filtering recommendation system using sales transaction data released by the Brazillian e-commerce company, Olist.To build the recommender, we will use Surprise, a Python scikit package built for collaborative filtering.The first step is to load in the packages we‚Äôll need and the dataset. The dataset is made up of 8 tables but for the purposes of this demonstration, I have already joined tables and isolated the columns we need. The full code is here.As often happens with real-world data, this dataset is not perfectly constructed for creating a collaborative recommendation system. A big challenge here is that almost 90% of the users are first-time customers which means that we don‚Äôt have previous ratings from them to identify products that like. Instead, we will separate the dataset into repeat and first time users and feed only the repeat customers into the collaborative filtering model. For first-time customers, we can still provide recommendations but they will be more generic, focused on item popularity and the user‚Äôs location.In order to leverage surprise‚Äôs built in user-ratings matrix conversion, we will need to supply a dataframe that contains a user id column, an item id column, and a rating column.From here, Surprise will help us generate a user-ratings matrix where each user id is a row and each product the company offers is a column. This will have the same impact as creating a Pandas pivot table. We will divide that dataframe into a train and test set with an 80/20 partition.Surprise offers 11 different prediction algorithms including variations of KNN and dimensionality reduction techniques such as SVD and NMF. For this demonstration, we will test out a few of the most common techniques.Using a 5-fold validation, we will compare the results of the following models.There are two ways to assess model performance. Qualitatively, you can look at a given user and determine if the recommendation makes sense given other products they like. For example, if someone likes horror movies and doesn‚Äôt like romantic comedies, The Shining would be a good recommendation relative to Love Actually. For this dataset, we do not have information about each product, only a product id so we will use a quantitative measure, root mean squared error. A combination of the two methods is ideal, though a quantitive measure is much more realistic in production.Based on the above, we determine that SVD has the lowest rmse and is the model we will move forward with tuning.The surprise package offers an option to tune parameters using GridSearchCV. We will provide GridSearchCV with a dictionary of parameters and the rmse will be calculated and compared for every combination of the parameters.From that search, we receive an output that tells us the best score (lowest rmse) obtained was 1.27 which was produced using the parameters {‚Äòn_factors‚Äô: 25, ‚Äòn_epochs‚Äô: 50, ‚Äòlr_all‚Äô: 0.01, ‚Äòreg_all‚Äô: 0.1}.Leveraging the parameters above, we then run the model on the full train set without cross validation and obtain accuracy scores against the test set.The .test attribute outputs predictions that contain the user id, item id, the users actual rating, the models estimated rating, and indicator that the prediction was possible to make. In addition to looking at the model_rmse output from our final, trained model, we will look at the distribution of the absolute errors across all predictions. To do this, we will package the predictions output into a dataframe and add on a column that indicates error for each prediction. We will then visualize the results by plotting a histogram of the errors.In the plots below, we see that although the error on the full dataset was 1.0, when a user gave a product a rating higher than 3, the model made much better predictions and the error was only 0.8. In contrast, when a user gave a product a rating of 3 or below, the error was significantly higher at 1.5. This is a good result because to provide good recommendations, we care much more about accurately predicting the products that a user likes and rates above 3.The model can then be packaged using the dump module, which is a wrapper around Pickle. For this example, the collaborative filtering recommendation is just a part of the overall system. It pairs with a recommendation based on overall top selling products and top performers in each geographic region.To become familiar with the process, Surprise has some great built-in datasets and the documentation thoroughly explains different cross-validation approaches, similarity metrics, and prediction algorithms.At the moment, Surprise is not capable of handling implicit ratings, performing content filtering, or generating a hybrid recommender. However, for a beginner, Surprise is a simple and straightforward package for collaborative filtering.You can find all code from this example on github.WRITTEN BY"
53,Just Used Machine Learning in My Workout!,https://towardsdatascience.com/just-used-machine-learning-in-my-workout-ff079b8e1939?source=extreme_main_feed---------56-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"I‚Äôm a big fan of a bodyweight approach and generally of doing workouts, but I don‚Äôt like too much going to the gym.Besides, in this time of forced lockdown due to Coronavirus, it could be useful to try a different way to approach fitness and training.So I asked myself: is there a way to use Machine Learning in this area? Can I join two passions together to make something useful?One of the main problems is having a way to validate the correctness of an exercise, so I did some experiments and tried an approach and found that‚Ä¶Ok, don‚Äôt want to spoil anything, just continue reading to find out!As always, let‚Äôs start with framing the problem. What we want to achieve is having a way to assess the correctness of an exercise, using a video as input.The optimum should be using live streaming, but let‚Äôs keep it simple using a file for now as, after all, we want to validate an approach before building something on top.So, having a video of a (hopefully) proper execution should be the first step, as it can be used as a baseline to compare other ones.Here‚Äôs the first video, did in my underground fatigue room :)My first thought was to use CNNs to build a classifier but, besides the number of needed examples, I‚Äôm not sure images sequence pixels can be useful to train a model about what is wrong and what is right in the exercise execution.So, I did some research to find if there is the possibility to have different features using a video as input and found a great library, OpenPose, a ‚ÄúReal-time multi-person keypoint detection library for body, face, hands, and foot estimation‚Äù.Seeing the demo videos, I understood could be very useful, so I tried to apply it to my problem and had this‚Ä¶(I‚Äôll write later, in the Appendix, all the necessary steps to setup)As you can see in the video, the library works very well tracking different body parts (used the COCO configuration with 18 key points)The cool thing is it‚Äôs possible to have as output a json file too, with all the positions, frame by frame, so it should be possible to have an alternative numeric representation of an exercise.So, doing some helper function and using Plotly, this is how this exercise looks considering the y-axis movements ‚Äî skipping x-axis as less useful given the camera position.Let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúok1‚ÄùNice, the next step is now to find a way to compare two different executions to spot if there are significant differences.Let‚Äôs make first a visual comparison based on these metrics and let‚Äôs call this execution ‚Äúfail1‚ÄùLet‚Äôs compare the graphs of the movementsThere are evident differences.Let‚Äôs try with another failed performance (‚Äúfail2‚Äù)and let‚Äôs compare with the baseline proper execution ok1Let‚Äôs try now to compare two good performances (let‚Äôs call it the second ‚Äúok2‚Äù)The curves look very similar, so we empirically tested this approach.Now the question is: is there a way to evaluate the similarity between these univariate time-series curves, considering could have different timescale too?It turns out there is something called Dynamic Time Warping that can be used ‚Äúfor measuring similarity between two temporal sequences‚Äù. More hereIs there an implementation in Python? Of course, using tslearn.metricsSo let‚Äôs crunch some numbersFist compare ‚Äúok1‚Äù with itselfSo 0 values is the maximum similarity and a lower score means more similarityLet‚Äôs try now measuring ok1 and fail1I found useful adopting an overall value to have a more condensed info, such as the medianComparison between ok1 and fail2Comparison between ok1 and ok2So it seems this value can be used as an indicator to compare the correctness of two executions based on a threshold to be found.As an empirically counter check, let‚Äôs try with other examples starting from this valueok1 and check1 -> median 82.22671018607622ok2 and check2 -> median 196.313312415643ok and check3 -> median 25.03920782168309It seems that a median lower than 30 could be a starting thresholdLet‚Äôs see them on videoThis is just the beginning of this experiment: assuming this is the right approach, there are a lot of open points such as:I had some ideas to check, and I‚Äôll do in the future, even because the possibilities are fantastic.Imagine a workstation with a camera thatEven training could be customized on the fly based on previous sessions and overall person condition.As always, I‚Äôm amazed about what is possible to achieve and imagine with these technologies and it‚Äôs big fun to use them.In the meantime, happy workout and stay safe.Instead of installing directly OpenPose with all the necessary dependencies, I opted for a Docker approach. You can found here the image: https://hub.docker.com/r/garyfeng/docker-openpose/Keep in mind that probably for a real-time approach using a container is not the right solution as there is a lot of lag but I haven‚Äôt tried other solutions so I cannot say it for sure.But before running it, you need to run containers using GPU, otherwise, OpenPose will not start. Here all the instruction to do it (with Invidia GPUs): https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-dockerYou‚Äôll see in the command The ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù and -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix parts that are used to access the camera inside the container if you need it.Before launching the docker command, be sure to execute:so the container can connect.Then, just launchAfter a while, you‚Äôll enter in a bash shell inside the containerif you check OpenPose documentation there are a lot of parameters but let‚Äôs see a couple of examplesIt should turn on the camera and start to detect keypoint in your face.The command I used to create the data used before:Notice the ‚Äúdata‚Äù folder that was mounted while launching the container. If you change it, be sure to adapt accordingly to the command.Let‚Äôs see now some Python code to deal with the data used in the articleThis is used to return a DataFrame with all the json found in an OpenPose json output path (beware, it will break if there are 1000+ files ‚Äî definitely to fix :)Here we‚Äôre doing columns renaming based on COCO setup and a basic interpolation if there are 0 values (for example when a nose is behind the pull-up bar):Putting all together, the function to use to have the final DataFrame.Let‚Äôs see some graphs now:Drawing the subplots for all the positions.Now drawing the comparison for two exercises:Finally the Dynamic Time Warping part:That‚Äôs all!

54,6 Habits of Highly Healthy Brains,https://medium.com/mind-cafe/6-habits-of-highly-healthy-brains-ef0c1c86014b?source=extreme_main_feed---------57-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"The relationships between our brain and body and the world around us are complex. What you do or don‚Äôt do can significantly change how your health and wellbeing.A healthy brain is determined by both biological and physiological factors ‚Äî genes, hormones, the immune system, nutrition, exercise, and other lifestyle choices.Social, psychological and environmental factors including relationships, stress, emotions, mindset, life events and current circumstances also contribute to your brain health.Each element can impact others in a multi-directional and dynamic way. Example, your thoughts can influence your physical health (which is why chronic stress can lead to abnormal heart rhythms or heart attacks).Everyone wants to live an active, vibrant life for as long as possible. And that goal depends on robust brain health. You can‚Äôt do much about your genes, but other physiological, social and environmental factors can be modified to improve your brain.Our brains naturally decline if we do nothing to protect them. However, if we intervene early, we can slow the decline process ‚Äî it‚Äôs easier to protect a healthy brain than to try to repair damage once it is extensive.You can improve your lifestyle habits to promote a highly healthy brain ‚Äî one free of physical or mental illness, disease, and pain. We have more control over our ageing brains than we realise.These habits are just a reminder ‚Äî you already know the importance of these lifestyle choices. It pays to make a conscious effort to help yourself ‚Äî your brain will thank you.That means eating lots of foods associated with slowing cognitive decline ‚Äî blueberries, vegetables (leafy greens ‚Äî kale, spinach, broccoli), whole grains, getting protein from fish and legumes and choosing healthy unsaturated fats (olive oil) over saturated fats (butter).The connection between what goes into your body and how your brain performs is a strong one. The best diet should also be good for your brain, your heart and blood vessels.‚ÄúOmega-3 fats from fish or nuts fight inflammation associated with neurodegeneration. Fruit and vegetables combat age-related oxidative stress that causes wear and tear on brain cells,‚Äù says Dr Gary Small, a professor of psychiatry and ageing, and director of the Longevity Center at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles.Find your moment or place of calm and separate yourself from chronic stress.Chronic stress can change the wiring of our brains.‚ÄúStress shrinks the brain‚Äôs memory centres, and the stress hormone cortisol temporarily impairs memory,‚Äù says Dr Small.To reverse stress and improve your mood and memory, adopt relaxation methods like meditation. ‚ÄúMeditation even rewires the brain and improves measures of chromosomes‚Äô telomere (protective cap) length, which predicts longer life expectancy‚Äù argues Dr Small.Find your place or moment of calm, and do something pleasurable that makes you come alive ‚Äî a personal passion project can help you destress.Physical activity is one of the best things you can do for your brain and body. You already know the countless benefits of exercising.Dozens of research have found that that nearly any type of physical activity ‚Äî walking, running, cycling, minimal weight-lifting and even mindful exercise such as yoga contribute to improved cognitive performance.Exercise stimulates the brain to release brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a molecule essential for repairing brain cells and creating connections between them.Physical activity also boosts endorphins, which can lift your mood. ‚ÄúAerobic exercise helps improve the health of brain tissue by increasing blood flow to the brain and reducing the chances of injury to the brain from cholesterol buildup in blood vessels and from high blood pressure,‚Äù says Dr Joel Salinas, a neurologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.A simple walk outdoors gets you away from digital devices and into nature. You‚Äôll do your best thinking when walking.Stimulating and challenging the brain helps it stay fit and firing. Spend some time in new thoughts.To improve your brain health, try to do one activity that challenges the mind every day ‚Äî spend some time in new thoughts. The desire to learn and understand other people, ideas, cultures and concepts can boost your brain.‚Äú‚Ä¶higher cognitive activity endows the brain with a greater ability to endure the effects of brain pathologies compared to a person with lower cognitive engagement throughout life,‚Äù says David S. Knopman, M.D., a clinical neurologist involved in research in late-life cognitive disorders.Lifelong learning and mentally challenging work build cognitive reserve. Find reasonably challenging activities you can practice regularly ‚Äî try activities that combine mental, social and physical challenges.We‚Äôre social creatures ‚Äî meaningful social connections make us happier. Happiness makes your brain work better.Psychological studies show that conversation stimulates the brain. It may seem effortless to many, but it requires a complex combination of skills including attention, memory, thinking, speech and social awareness.A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that better social interaction can help protect the brain against dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs.Social connections are as important to our flourishing as the need for food, safety, and shelter. The urge to connect is a life-long human need.Matthew Lieberman, a social psychologist, neuroscientist, and author of Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect, sees the brain as the center of the social self. He writes in his book, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to find meaning in what we do if at some level it doesn‚Äôt help someone else or make someone happier.‚ÄùResearchers at the Oregon Health & Science University and the University of Michigan have suggested that human interaction and conversation could be the keys to maintaining brain function as we grow older.Supportive friends, family and social connections helps you live longer, happier and healthier. Socialising reduces the harmful effects of stressSleep is the number one, fundamental bedrock of good health. A good night sleep every night should be a priority, not a luxury.‚ÄúWithout good sleep, we see increased anxiety and stress. Sleep is restorative, helping you be more mentally energetic and productive,‚Äù advises Sandra Bond Chapman, Ph.D., founder and chief director of the Center for BrainHealth at the University of Texas at Dallas and author of Make Your Brain Smarter.Apart from getting a good and quality night sleep, make time for ‚Äúwakeful rest‚Äù ‚Äî it pays to plan breaks in between your busy schedule. Plan downtime on your calendar.After a busy day, give your brain time to recover ‚Äî sit back, close your eyes and let your mind wander (spontaneous thought in our wakeful life)‚Äî in the knowledge that your brain is busy consolidating information.In a study on Boosting Long-Term Memory via Wakeful Rest, the authors found that ‚Äúwakeful rest‚Äù ‚Äî without any external stimulation ‚Äî allows the brain to consolidate the memories of what it has learned.It is never too early or too late to start living more healthily. Your daily habits have more impact on how long and how well you live ‚Äî plan to eat well, take short walks, engage in mental stimulation, and manage your social connections for better brain health.WRITTEN BY"
55,Interactive Reporting in Jupyter Notebook,https://towardsdatascience.com/interactive-reporting-in-jupyter-notebook-92a4fa90c09a?source=extreme_main_feed---------58-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"Seeing reporting in Jupyter from a new angleJupyter Notebook is an important arrow in the data scientist‚Äôs quiver. This open-source application is flexible and, most importantly, interactive. This is a tool you need for basic data science tasks, such as data cleaning, building visualizations, creating machine learning models and a lot more. You can write here Python or R code (depending on the kernel you use), save results of code execution in the cells and share them with other people.I can‚Äôt imagine my work without Jupyter Notebooks. They are shareable, fast to set up, and simple to use even if you‚Äôre just starting your path into the data analysis world or learning Python.If you work with data in Python a lot, you may look at it in a summarized form quite often. In Python, you can group or pivot your data using built-in functions from the pandas library.A classical way to go with pivoting is to use the good-old pivot_table method. As for most Python methods, its syntax is straightforward and easy to read.However, the more complicated logic of the pivot table‚Äôs layout you have, the more time you may require to code it. Besides, the resulting pivot table is always static rather than interactive. Each time you need to arrange data on the pivot grid to see it from a different angle, rewriting code is needed. Yes, this may involve not so many changes, but instead, you could spend this time focusing on your data and getting a better understanding of it.Today I‚Äôd like to show you an alternative way to pivot your data in Jupyter Notebooks. After mastering this approach, you‚Äôll easily generate interactive reports in no time.The greatest thing about the approach I‚Äôm going to show is that you can save the resulting notebook with interactive data visualization components to HTML and send it to your friends and teammates. They can open it in the browser, play with the pivot table and pivot charts, gain their personal insights, save the report they configured and resend it to you. This may make the entire data analysis experience more productive.We‚Äôll be working in JupyterLab since it‚Äôs an extremely comfy environment to run your notebooks in. JupyterLab is simply a user-interface for Jupyter Notebooks. Everything you use in a classical Jupyter is here: notebooks, file browser. But JupyterLab offers more extended functionality: you can install extensions, expand and collapse cells, drag and drop them ‚Äî the feature you may lack in Jupyter. Also, the text editor provides a tab auto-complete feature.So, run your JupyterLab and let‚Äôs start!First and foremost, let‚Äôs import the Python libraries we need. These include pandas, json, and the display module from IPython. All these libraries are shipped with Anaconda distribution, but if you‚Äôre not working with it, you may need to install these libraries globally or within your virtual environment.For data visualization, we‚Äôll be using Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts, which is a JavaScript library.What about data? For the demonstration purposes, I‚Äôve chosen an ‚ÄòAvocado Prices‚Äô dataset from Kaggle. It‚Äôs lightweight and contains a reasonable number of fields. Instead, you can choose any data set you like.‚ñ∂ Load your data. Using pandas, read CSV data to the dataframe. Drop the column `Unnamed: 0` ‚Äî an index column that often appears when reading CSV files.‚ñ∂ Call the to_json() method on the dataframe to convert it to a JSON string and save it to the json_data variable.‚ñ∂ Now let‚Äôs create an instance of Flexmonster using a nested dictionary. Here we specify all the necessary initialization parameters and pass the decoded data to the component. For decoding JSON, we use json.loads() method.‚ñ∂ Now we encode Python object into JSON using json.dumps():‚ñ∂ The next step is to define a function that renders the pivot table directly into the cell. For this, we‚Äôll define a multi-line string and pass it to the imported HTML function:‚ñ∂ Finally, we can pass the JSON to this rendering function and call it:Voila! You see the interactive pivot table on the page. And the data set is ready to work with: you can rearrange the fields on the grid, change aggregations, set filtering and sorting, format values, and do everything to create your unique report. Besides, if you miss the way records were displayed within the dataframe, you can switch from the pivot mode to the flat view. This way you‚Äôll see the data as it comes from the source, but with interactive functionality.Here‚Äôs how the pivot table looks like now:Additionally, you can try applying conditional formatting to focus on the values that matter most.Now, let‚Äôs complicate our logic a bit by adding more elements to the notebook. Two pivot charts will make our data visualization more versatile. For this, we‚Äôll define an extra function that accepts multiple JSON components and renders them on the page. Its logic is the same as for a single pivot table. Pivot charts components are defined in the same way as for a pivot table.In the report slices for pivot charts, we can set Top X filters, which are comfy for limiting the number of categories displayed on the pivot charts. This makes them more neat and compact.Hooray! Now you can enjoy an interactive dashboard inside your Jupyter Notebook! Don‚Äôt hesitate to generate a report on your data analysis and share it.Today we tried a new way of manipulating and presenting data in Jupyter Notebook, using Python and a JavaScript data visualization library. As you see, it takes not too much code and time to set everything up.Once you do it, you can explore your data right in the workspace you‚Äôve got used to.This approach frees you from rewriting bits of code each time you need to look differently at the data. And it goes hand-in-hand with the central idea of Jupyter Notebooks ‚Äî to make the data visualization and data analysis interactive and flexible.You can find the full code on GitHub. üëàTo fulfill your curiosity on what else you can enhance in your dashboard, here‚Äôs a brief list of top features you can make your reporting better with:All too often, the real-world data is neither neat nor consistent. Fields can be named using different cases, they may also contain indistinctive contractions, etc. To prettify it, we can use mapping ‚Äî the report‚Äôs property that sets view configurations applied to the data source. Another benefit that comes with its formatting functionality is the explicit setting of data types. By setting the types, you tell the component to treat the fields the way you intended, e.g., like strings, numbers, or dates. This will affect the choice of aggregations available for field hierarchies.In the GitHub sample, you can see how to define a mapping object and set it to the pivot table.The pivot table comes with JavaScript API methods and events. You can configure saving reports in different formats locally or to remote destinations such as servers with the exportTo method.To introduce new formulas to the report, you can add calculated values.WRITTEN BY"
56,Why I Left a Job I Loved in AI/ML,https://towardsdatascience.com/why-i-left-a-job-i-loved-in-ai-ml-eb1b2c6b260d?source=extreme_main_feed---------59-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"Last Friday marked the last day at my job as a Machine Learning Engineer. I learned a ton in my first job since graduating. Here‚Äôs my early-career story thus far plus some insights & musings.When I graduated college I was pretty certain what I wanted to do. But my insecurity had driven me to believe my lack of pedigree (mid-tier state school and average GPA) would keep me from making it to where I ultimately wanted to go.So originally I took interviews with various companies for roles in Control Systems where I knew I could find a stable job. I had settled to believe I couldn‚Äôt ultimately start my career where I wanted.But then my resume landed on the desks of a few managers in FAAAM (Facebook, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft) and I was suddenly interviewing for roles in exactly what I wanted to do ‚Äî some in ML Research but most in Applied AI (ML Engineer).Suddenly I was determined I would be moving westward from my humble mid-Missouri roots. But then something strange happened; I took an interview at a Consumer Goods company I had interned with a summer before. After the interview, there was no question in my mind where I was going to end up.What prompted me to turn down a high profile offer in big tech for a tech job in an old school industry?There were a handful of individuals I met who really made the decision easy. The spirit of innovation and a desire to really commit to giving Big Data, AI/ML, etc a shot in an old-school industry giant was super inspiring. And it wasn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúshot,‚Äù it was a mission. It was an understanding that the world is data rich and insights poor. It was an understanding that the value was there; it just wasn‚Äôt being captured.I was faced with the options:a.) heading to a tech company to fit in to an already developed Data or research teamorb.) joining a team that was in the early stages of driving business decisions through Data Science.And it really took the cake when I had a chat with leadership. They made it very clear they were all-in on some of these ideas and wanted someone to join the group who was familiar with disruptive technologies and was ready to build data-driven applications and advocate for use of AI/ML across the group and broader technical community.The leader with whom I was chatting said something that will stick with me forever: ‚ÄúDo you know what the most important skill is for your role?‚ÄùI naively responded, ‚ÄúI dunno, hard work.‚ÄùAnd without hesitation he responded:‚ÄúEmpathy. If you can really understand the pain points of the organization, of your stakeholders, of your peers, you‚Äôll quickly succeed. Too often we spend time building for the sake of building.There are soooo many easy wins to be found across the organization if you just deploy empathy and really start to understand the needs of individuals inside the organization.‚ÄùI committed to the job that day, despite a bit of a pay cut vs the other offers I had on the table. Adjust for cost of living of the midwest vs SF and the pay is pretty similar anyway.Taking a job based on the people and the work instead of the pay was the best possible decision I could have made, and I encourage you to also prioritize your own happiness over income prospects.Some intangibles you should consider other than pay:There are so many great lessons to take from this. Here are some longer form lessons I‚Äôve personally taken to heart.In tech, we shouldn‚Äôt be giving out tech salaries for engineers to build for the sake of building. We should want engineers to spend time building products that really matter. Sometimes the dart won‚Äôt hit the bullseye. But if you have indicators that there‚Äôs a significant market for your product, your chance of success is significantly higher.I‚Äôve lived my life with this key observation:If you throw enough darts, eventually one will stick.To get the interviews I got for AI/ML roles, I did an ungodly amount of applications. I reached out to an ungodly amount of recruiters and hiring managers. I took tons of interviews. In many I failed; in some I succeeded. (Hint: only one has to go well. You‚Äôre only going to work one job.) To build a startup people actually found interesting I built countless products over the last 4 years. To start getting readers on Medium, I wrote dozens of articles before really getting traction. To get a book deal I went to all the major publishing houses with a fleshed out plan and solid strategy for selling copies. I was turned down by 9/10. It only takes 1!You get the story. Nothing in life comes for free. We have to be relentless. Never take no for an answer. My dad told me something when I was younger that I‚Äôve taken with me my entire life:Being good at something isn‚Äôt enough. You have to be so much better than the second best person that they have no choice but to pick you.This is a mindset that keeps you from ever questioning why you didn‚Äôt get an opportunity. It‚Äôs all about accountability. Because that is the way I live my life, I never question why I didn‚Äôt get something. There‚Äôs always room to do more. Either do more or don‚Äôt be upset when you get passed on.And at the end of the day, if you put in all the effort you possibly could, it‚Äôs easy to end the day satisfied. It‚Äôs easy to look back and be happy because you know you gave every last ounce of effort.And now my next journey awaits. As I transition out of my full-time job with a salary and benefits and all the safety nets afforded by corporate America, I move into the startup world with tons of excitement and unmatched energy.Even though my total compensation as a Founder in this next chapter is nowhere near what it was in the last chapter, the impact I can have on the world is infinitely greater. And just like when I turned down a job in big tech, impact is ultimately the primary thing that matters to me, other than a living wage. Impact on individuals, impact on co-workers, impact on our industry, and most importantly ‚Äî impact on our users.If we fail personally in a large company, the company doesn‚Äôt feel the impact. No personal contribution typically has a dent in an industry giant. If we fail personally in a 2‚Äì5 person operation, the startup feels that failure directly. If we succeed personally in a startup, the startup feels the merit of that success as well.One things for sure, there are two teams I always want to play on:Our startup will succeed or fail on merit of what we do each and every day. We will succeed or fail based on our ability to deploy empathy for our users. Can‚Äôt wait to take you on our startup journey.Let‚Äôs continue the conversation on Twitter!WRITTEN BY"
57,Linear SVM Classifier: Step-by-step Theoretical Explanation with Python Implementation,https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-svm-classifier-step-by-step-theoretical-explanation-with-python-implementation-69767437e0e6?source=extreme_main_feed---------60-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful tool that allows humans to make the computers analyze the features of the collected data and make use of it for further predictions. Different algorithms utilize different approaches for learning and decision procedures.In Figure 1 various linear decision strategies of 3 well-known ML algorithms are shown. As can be seen from the graphs, although they use different rules to classify the samples, the fundamental principle of the decision-making process is same. All the described algorithms draw line(s) (also called decision boundary) to separate negative and positive samples.Support Vector Machines (SVM) is one of the sophisticated supervised ML algorithms that can be applied for both classification and regression problems. The idea was first introduced by Vladimir Naumovich Vapnik [1] during the early ‚Äô90s. The main question that V. Vapnik asked during the development process of the algorithm was:How to draw a straight line that best separates 2 classes?In Figure 2 lines with different positions were drawn to separate negative and positive samples. In the graph (1) and (3) the drawn lines are too close to the negative or positive samples respectively which decrease/increase the allotted gap (margin) for one of the classes. However, to sustain the objectivity of the decision process, the line must be drawn such that the allowed margin for both classes is equally wide.In the N-Dimensional (ND) feature space, the dimension of the decision boundary corresponds to N-1. For example:‚Äî For 2D feature space, the decision boundary will be a line.
‚Äî For 3D feature space, the decision boundary will be a 2D plane.Thus, to generalize the representation of the plane of the decision boundary the vector that is normal (perpendicular) to the medium of the plane can be utilized. That is how any plane (line) can be described using a single equation. [2]To represent the decision boundary, a vector (w) starting from the origin and normal the plane is drawn. However, there‚Äôs no piece of information about the parameters as well as the length of the vector w.Now let‚Äôs imagine we include an unknown sample (u) into the feature space. It is worth noting that any point in the cartesian coordinate system can be represented using a vector starting from the origin.To determine whether an unknown sample is on the right or left side of the decision boundary the vector u can be projected onto the vector w by finding their dot product. If the value of projection of u onto w is greater than an unknown c, then a sample u is on the right side of the boundary or vice-versa.Without loss of generality the equation 1 can be modified by assuming c = -b.Above-written equation 2 is a decision rule of the SVM containing two unknown variables ‚Äî w and b which are obtained during the training process of the SVM model.To be able to define the distance from each support-vector to the decision boundary, the decision rule for both classes should be considered separately. Due to mathematical convenience, the margin distance of 1 will be used after which the derived equation can be multiplied by any constant to increase/decrease margin proportionally.Thus, equation 2 for the positive (x+) and negative (x-) samples can be modified as it is described in equation 3.1 and 3.2.Basically, by doing so we force the decision boundary to have a separation of distance from -1 to +1 for all the training samples.Although there are 2 separate equations for different classes, by multiplying equation 3.1 with +1 and 3.2 with -1 the equations can be merged into one (equation 5) which will be more mathematically convenient. For this, a new variable y·µ¢ (equation 4) will be included in the equation.By considering equation 5 the result of the decision rule for the samples on the support vectors can be derived which is also described in Figure 6.In the previous sections, the constraints for determining the decision boundary of SVM were discussed. However, the main objective of SVM is to find a decision boundary with the widest distance of margin.To find the distance between the support vectors, any of the positive (+) and negative (-) samples that are located on the support vectors can be used. The distance will be equal to the projection of the difference of the vectors onto the unit vector in the direction of normal vector w. The unit vector can be calculated by dividing the components of the vector w by its length.Equation 6 can be further simplified by using equation 3.1 and 3.2Last, a simple equation (8) was derived that describes the distance between the support vectors. The objective is to maximize it as well as considering the constraints discussed above.Equation 9 describes the conversion steps of optimization problem into quadratic optimization which is more mathematically convenient during the obtaining process of gradients with respect to w.The function that has to be minimized in equation 9 is constrained by additional functions given in Figure 6. For the problem of constrained optimization Lagrange multipliers [3] can be utilized, simply, to convert a constrained optimization problem into unconstrained one [4] which is more computationally convenient. What theory of Lagrange multipliers claims is that:For the minimum/maximum solution of the function f(x) constrained by g(x), the level curve of the f(x) is tangent to the level curve of the g(x). Thus, if the level curves are tangent, their gradients must be parallel.By using equation 10 the constrained optimization problem of SVM is converted to the unconstrained one. A new equation will be the objective function of SVM with the summation over all constraints.In equation 11 the Lagrange multiplier was not included as an argument to the objective function L(w,b). As the value of the multiplier ùõº will be set conditionally during the numerical optimization process such that:To minimize the objective function the approach of Gradient Descent will be implemented. Here computation of the gradient of L(w,b) with respect to w and b is required which are described in the equations below.As the mathematical foundation of the SVM was completely discussed, it is time for the implementation in Python by utilizing only ‚ÄòNumPy‚Äô module.Because of its versatility, the implementation of linear SVM will be realized in the class form with an initializer that requires:In the following code, the function ‚Äòdistances‚Äô is for calculating equation 5 by considering the Lagrange Multipliers.The function ‚Äòget_cost_grads‚Äô is for calculating the cost for the given normal vector w and finding the gradient of the objective function with respect to w.The function ‚Äòfit‚Äô is for updating the vector w at each iteration. Function ‚Äòpredict‚Äô is for predicting the class of the unknown sample based on the decision rule given in equation 2.Now it‚Äôs time to test the performance of SVM class on a linearly separable data [5].The algorithm works like a charm!SVM is a remarkably powerful algorithm as well as one of the paradigms in the field of ML. The philosophy behind the algorithm is highly sophisticated and intuitive. In the following articles, the implementation of the Soft Margin SVM Classifier on non-linearly separable data will be discussed.Stay Healthy and Strong![1] Vladimir Naumovich Vapnik ‚Äî Wikipedia Page

58,Data Modeling for a Music Streaming App,https://towardsdatascience.com/data-modeling-for-a-music-streaming-app-db46a4595e4e?source=extreme_main_feed---------61-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"I have joined Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree. The program consists of many real-world projects. In the project, I have the role of a Data Engineer at a fabricated data streaming company called ‚ÄúSparkify‚Äù. It is a startup and wants to analyze the data they‚Äôve been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don‚Äôt have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.They‚Äôd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis and bring me on the project. My role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. I‚Äôve tested my database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare my results with their expected results.In this project, I‚Äôve applied what I‚Äôve learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. I‚Äôve defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus and written an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song‚Äôs track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.The log files in the dataset you‚Äôll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018‚Äì11‚Äì12-events.json, looks like.If you would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, you will need to create a pandas DataFrame to read the data. Remember to first import JSON and pandas libraries.df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)For example, df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True) would read the data file 2018-11-01-events.json.In case you need a refresher on JSON file formats, here is a helpful video.Using the song and log datasets, I‚Äôve created a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.songplays ‚Äî records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agentusers ‚Äî users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, levelsongs ‚Äî songs in the music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, durationartists ‚Äî artists in the music database
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitudetime ‚Äî timestamps of records in songplays broken down into the specific unit
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekdayThe conditions like Primary key and NOT NULL in columns are important while dealing with relational database systems. Again, as a data engineer, it's a must to specify primary key columns and not null depending on the business requirements. For instance, user_id and start_time should be considered as not null.In addition to the data files, the project workspace includes six files:To create all the tables I needed, I have done the following four steps:Inside create_tables.py, there is a function create_tables to execute all the queries listed in create_table_queries list.You can see the tables have been created with the columns defined from test.ipynb.It‚Äôs time to develop ETL processes for each table. In etl.py, there is a function called process_data. You can pass the file path and the process function you need to process your data. It gets all files matching extension (.json) from the directory. And then it iterates over files and processes using your function passed into.First, let us handle song_data and create the songs and artists dimensional tables. I‚Äôve builtprocess_song_file function to perform the following tasks:To extract data for Songs table, the following tasks are done:Write the song_table_insert query in sql_queries.py and insert a record for this song into the songs table.Data Extraction for Artists table is similar to that for Songs table, but this time I selected columns artist ID, name, location, latitude, and longitude.Second, I‚Äôve performed ETL on the second dataset, log_data, to create the time and users dimensional tables, as well as the songplays fact table.I‚Äôve filtered records by NextSong actiondf = df[df['page']=='NextSong']and converted the ts timestamp column to DateTime.t = pd.to_datetime(df['ts'], unit='ms')Note: the current timestamp is in millisecondsI used pandas‚Äô dt attribute to access easily datetime-like properties such as hour, day, week of year, month, year, and weekday from the ts column and set time_data to a list containing these values in order. I‚Äôve also specified labels for these columns and set to column_labels. I created a DataFrame, time_df, containing the time data for this file by combining column_labels and time_data into a dictionary and converting this into a DataFrame. Finally, I inserted records for the timestamps in the log files into the time table.Data extraction for users table is easy, just select columns for user ID, first name, last name, gender, and level and set to user_df and insert records for the users in this log file into the users table.INSERT statements needs to be modified for each table to handle existing records where appropriate. As a data engineer, I need to give careful thought to how the tables will handle existing records when new data are being inserted into the tables.For instance, use on conflict update for the user table since the level can change from free to paid.This one is a little more complicated since the information from the songs table, artists table and original log file are all needed for the songplays table. Since the log file does not specify an ID for either the song or the artist, I needed to get the song ID and artist ID by querying the songs and artists tables to find matches based on the song title, artist name, and the song‚Äôs duration time.Since this is a subset of the much larger dataset, the solution dataset will only have 1 row with values containing ID for both songid and artistid in the fact table. Those are the only 2 values that the query in the sql_queries.py will return that is not-NONE. The rest of the rows will have NONE values for those two variables.That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve created a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. The analytics team has now an easy to query their data and analyze understanding what songs users are listening to.For more details, you can visit my GitHub repository.WRITTEN BY"

60,The Basics: Time Series and Seasonal Decomposition,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-basics-time-series-and-seasonal-decomposition-b39fef4aa976?source=extreme_main_feed---------63-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"Handling time stamped data is one of the most intuitively obvious use cases for data science. After all, any data we can collect necessarily must be gathered from or represent the past and we often want to make predictions about unseen cases we‚Äôll encounter in the future, so it makes sense that our models might have an important time component, in some form or other. Time series models are distinct from other sorts of predictive models in that the target variable is both the object of the prediction (for future values) and an input feature of the model (for the historical values).The first steps in approaching a time series project are frequently to visualize and then decompose the data into trend and cyclical components. From there, you can start to work on more complicated predictive models, though simply decomposing the series can itself yield some valuable insights. This article will focus on the simplest decomposition technique, classical seasonal decomposition, but even this can be quite useful.When are time series techniques appropriate?Nowadays, most data, particularly procedurally generated data, comes with a timestamp. Whenever a digital form is filled out and submitted, or whenever a purchase is made online, the exact time is typically recorded and stored. As a result, many datasets come with a time element of some nature, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the time series techniques discussed here are necessarily appropriate. These techniques only really make sense when there is some degree of auto-correlation in the target variable, that is, when the target variable is correlated with itself from earlier periods. If a value from yesterday or last month, or last year can help you predict the value for today, then these time series techniques are appropriate. If that isn‚Äôt the case, then they won‚Äôt help.Consider, for instance, the day to day movements in stock prices, which are famously random. Knowing that a stock went up yesterday doesn‚Äôt really tell you whether the stock is likely to go up today. Here, for example, is a real life example of day to day stock price movements:The company in question is actually Apple, but you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell that just by looking at the day to day movements ‚Äî like all stocks, Apple‚Äôs bounces around from day to day in a way that defies prediction. Time series analysis won‚Äôt help.Now, instead of looking at the day to day movement in price, let‚Äôs consider the stock price itself. Unlike the day to day change, the price does exhibit autocorrelation. Yesterday‚Äôs stock price gives me a very good indication of what today‚Äôs stock price will be because the price typically doesn‚Äôt change by more than a percent or two in any given day. If the price was $200 yesterday, I can be pretty sure it‚Äôll close between $190 and $210 today, barring exceptional events. Out of the seeming noise of the day to day movements, the price itself exhibits a trend that suggests time series analysis might be useful:But then, stock prices are still stochastic in nature and while there might be some benefit in smoothing out a graph like this depending on what sort of analysis you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôre going to have a hard time actually predicting future values. So, let‚Äôs consider one final Apple related series, the number of iPhones sold globally each quarter:Now, this is a time series we can work with! Notice that it doesn‚Äôt just exhibit a general trend, but also has predictable cycles within the trend ‚Äî you‚Äôll see a spike in sales each year corresponding with Apple‚Äôs first quarter (their accounting year starts in October, so their first quarter is picking up holiday sales). The goal of our time series techniques is often to find and exploit predictable patterns like this, even when the patterns are subtler and harder to spot than the seasonal pattern in iPhone sales.Rolling averages and trends in time seriesA common first step when approaching a new time series project is to smooth out the data with something like a rolling average. This has two main benefits. One is that real world data tends to jump around a bit, even if there is a clear underlying trend, and looking at the rolling average makes it easier to tell how the trend is moving underneath the noise. Second, finding a trend in this or a similar manner is the first step towards creating a seasonal decomposition. Let‚Äôs look at a real example. Here is a common starter time series data set, which shows the number of airline passengers there were per month in the US in the fifties:There‚Äôs obviously an upward slope as air travel went from a relatively rare luxury in the late 40s to a much more common experience in the 60s, but there‚Äôs also clearly a seasonal pattern with travel being consistently higher in some months rather than others. The month to month variation makes it hard to see exactly how fast this growth is. We can smooth out the monthly fluctuations by considering a rolling average, where a few consecutive months are considered together. A particularly high or low value in one month will, therefore, be tempered by the less extreme values in the other months in the rolling window. Consider the original data alongside a six month rolling average:The rolling average doesn‚Äôt get as high as the original data at its peaks, or as low during the troughs. One thing you may notice about this particular example is that it also doesn‚Äôt seem to hit the peaks and troughs at exactly the same time as the original data. This rolling average is more specifically a trailing average: the six months that make up the average for a given month are that month‚Äôs point and the five preceding months. As an alternative, you might consider centering your window on the month. You could, for instance, consider the month itself, the two previous months and the two subsequent months for a 5 month window (this tends to work better with odd numbers of months), but one that coincided with the peaks and troughs of the data rather than lagging them by a month or so:You might be able to see already, that this strategy has an issue when you get towards the end of your data set ‚Äî you can‚Äôt consider the average of a future month for which you have no data yet! In the above example, the centered rolling average simply stops two months before the end of the dataset while the trailing average goes all the way to the edge. There are some ways to deal with this ‚Äî perhaps as you get towards the end and start running out of future months, you start to consider fewer months to close the gap ‚Äî but these may not be satisfactory. (Of course, the trailing average also has a similar problem, but one at the beginning of the series, where you can‚Äôt take an average of the last 6 months if you‚Äôre only in, say month 2 or 3 of the data set.)You can also vary the size of the window to adjust how much smoothing you do. As you increase the window, the rolling average will get less and less peaky:There are a few other ways of smoothing out time series and finding trend lines, but they tend to be variations on the theme of the simple average. One common one worth mentioning is the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) which, true to its name, averages previous periods, but weights them so that the more recent periods count for more in the average.Classical Seasonal DecompositionOne use of a creating a smoothed trend line in this fashion is to perform seasonal decomposition, to break out the original data into components for the trend, cyclical deviations from this trend and then whatever residuals are left over. How do we go from a smoothed line to the full decomposition? Well, notice that as you increase the size of the rolling average‚Äôs window the impact of the seasonal fluctuations fade away. If your rolling average considers a window that is the same size as your seasonal cycle, it essentially washes out the seasonal cycle altogether by considering one of each month in the cycle:We‚Äôre looking for a seasonal cycle that accounts for the differences between the original data and this season-less rolling average. There are two ways to try to calculate this seasonal element. The first is as an additive model. In this method, we‚Äôll imagine that the true value for any given month is the value of the trend at that month plus a static seasonal value that changes from month to month within a year but stays roughly the same for the same month in consecutive years, with some (hopefully small) amount of error left over. Let‚Äôs start by calculating a ‚Äòde-trended‚Äô series: taking our original series and subtracting the trend from it:This de-trended series shows us just the seasonal cycle along with whatever other noise there is in our data set. Now we can simply consider each month within the cycle one by one. How much above or below the trend is the average January data point? Or the average February? We can simply take a month by month average to get an approximation of the seasonal cycle:Looking at these average seasonal components like this you can see clearly how air travel varied from month to month, with much more travel in the summer months than in the winter. Now we can model our original data as being comprised by the trend and this seasonal component:Our modeled data in the green line isn‚Äôt horrible, but it‚Äôs clearly got a problem ‚Äî it consistently overshoots in the early years and consistently undershoots in the later years. Actually, we could have foreseen this problem arising when we graphed out the de-trended data and saw that the seasonal swings got more and more extreme. In this case there is a simple fix, which is to consider the second way of decomposing the time series, the multiplicative model.The multiplicative model works similarly to the additive one, except in this case we say that the final data for any given month is some value from the trend multiplied by some seasonal adjustment that stays roughly the same year over year. The additive model says something like ‚Äúthe number of flights is typically 40,000 higher than the trend in June‚Äù, while the multiplicative model says ‚Äúthe number of flights is typically 10% higher than the trend in June‚Äù. In this way, the multiplicative model scales the size of the seasonal cycle as the trend rises or falls.Calculating the multiplicative seasonal cycle is similar to calculating the additive one, except that to find the de-trended series, we divide the original data by the trend:We can find the monthly adjustments by averaging each month of this de-trended series, and then model out our data as the trend multiplied by the appropriate seasonal adjustment:Much better!You might already be able to tell that successfully decomposing a time series set in this fashion depends crucially on properly identifying the period of the seasonal cycle. Is it a yearly cycle? Or does it take two years? Or only 6 months? Often times there are clear calendar cycles ‚Äî week to week, month to month or year to year ‚Äî but depending on what sort of data you are working with, there might not be any reason for it to conform to the calendar. Choosing an inappropriately sized period will render your decomposition functionally useless.As an example, imagine you were looking through a data set like the one we‚Äôve been considering, but you didn‚Äôt know what it represented and didn‚Äôt assume that it had an even yearly period of 12 months. What happens if you select an 11 month period instead of a 12 month one? Well, at first things seem to be going ok. When you plot out your rolling average, it looks like you‚Äôve more or less removed the seasonality:When you perform the rest of your steps to decompose the series along the 11-month period, however, you quickly see that something isn‚Äôt right:This seasonal decomposition is basically useless, adding no real value above the smoothed out trend line. As you can see classical decomposition really depends on finding a sensible value for the period.Classical decomposition may seem simple, and in a way it is and old-fashioned to boot, having been developed in the 1920s. Yet, hopefully, you can see that simple as it is, it can be fairly powerful, modeling out our data well. It may also be clear how you can extend this sort of technique to start predicting future values as well, drawing out the trend a few extra months and applying the appropriate monthly adjustment.It‚Äôs also worth bearing it in mind for how it captures the time series process in general: try to isolate the trend, look for predictable patterns and account for them. You can then look for explanations for any significant deviations. There are more complicated ways of isolating trends, but they will all, basically by necessity, look at multiple points in time to try and isolate the trend from the day to day, week to week, or month to month variation. There are more advanced methods to look for predictable patterns in the de-trended data, including methods that consider multiple patterns of different periods happening at the same time, but in principle, they also work much the same way.In my next post on time series, I‚Äôll profile some of these more advanced methods and how they can be extended for predicting future values.WRITTEN BY"

Browder said of the site when he started it:‚ÄúLawyers all over the world should be very scared of this technology.‚ÄùI am scared of one day being out of a job but also thrilled at the prospect that more people will be able to access legal advice. Access to justice is a basic human right. In South Africa, a product like DoNotPay is sorely needed.DoNotPay is revolutionary and offers its users something that before has been difficult to find; cheap or free legal advice that actually works. Although in its early stages and offering limited services, I have no doubt it will expand to offer a multitude of legal services.There other robo-lawyers; LegalZoom offers its clients the services of drafting a will, registering a trademark and incorporating a company. NDA Lyn will read your non-disclosure agreement and provide advice on whether you should sign it or not.ROSS intelligence conducts lighting fast legal research for a small monthly fee.Robo-lawyers are either free or cost a fraction of the cost of a human lawyer. You may not have the comforting hand of your lawyer guiding you through a legal matter but you will have a lawyer.The complete take over of the legal profession is not around the corner. Although many lawyers will have to change the way they practice law if they are to keep up with times. Robo-lawyers like DoNotPay consulted human lawyers before launching its products and will continue to do.A robo-lawyer can provide legal advice but it cannot run your matter in court or litigate, yet. And a robo-lawyer cannot look beyond factors that are not easily quantifiable such as emotional or sensitive information.Progress in the field of legal AI is both slow and unpredictable. It has already taken years and will take many more before all human lawyer functions are automated.The pace of technology improvement is notoriously unpredictable. For years, labor economists said routine work like a factory job could be reduced to a set of rules that could be computerized. They assumed that professionals, like lawyers, were safe because their work was wrapped in language- New York TimesThe legal profession is changing and the practice of law. There may be many challenges the profession will face in the next couple of years but no one can predict with certainty what the future legal profession will look like.One thing is certain: robo-lawyers are on the rise.WRITTEN BY"
62,The Intelligent Edge Is Not Really a Thing,https://medium.com/swlh/the-intelligent-edge-is-not-really-a-thing-2eaaed262cce?source=extreme_main_feed---------65-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"On Tuesday, July 27, 1869, the naturalist and glaciologist, John Muir, wrote an interesting observation in his journal :‚ÄúWhen we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.‚ÄùPause and consider this for a moment.Even within narrower contexts, this is true. Technologies, for instance, are inextricable from solutions.Technologies can be defined as discrete elements though, even if they are bound to other things. Buzzwords, on the other hand, often aren‚Äôt well defined or discrete.For instance, a salesman recently said to me, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing 5G AI. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ with that in mind consider these technologies:These are some common technologies associated with Intelligent Edge. Each has had a separate path to now, each lives within its own life-cycle, but each is connected to every other one and, in fact, to everything in some way.Interestingly, Muir had made a similar observation earlier (according to Stephen Fox in his book) which seems strangely relevant to Edge technologies:‚ÄúWhen we try to pick out anything by itself we find that it is bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe.‚ÄùHmmm.The Edge is the decentralized physical location where computing resources are being moved. In general, it can refer to devices or to infrastructure resources.Over the past five decades, computing architectures have favored either centralized or decentralized approaches. Mainframes with text terminals, Unix servers, and thin clients found favor in eras of centralized computing. Fat clients, personal computers, and Java applets were popular in times of decentralized computing.Today, the cloud as a centralized core dominates the computing topology. Cloud has had a big impact on applications, business models, and businesses.The pendulum, however, is about to swing. As massive and pervasive as hyper-scale cloud has become, the Edge will become far larger and more influential.The Edge does not replace centralized cloud computing though; it is a complement to it.Today, we do almost all of our edge computing with our mobile devices. But, as you will soon discover, this is going to change dramatically.Edge is growing fast. Edge market projections already far outstrip Cloud. The Internet of Things (‚ÄúIoT‚Äù) market alone, which is only a subset of the Edge, is projected to be between $442 billion and $1.2 trillion by 2022 (depending on how you define IoT) and is growing at 29.4% per year ‚Äî roughly double the size and growth of the global Cloud market.Edge AI, AI chips, 5G, Edge infrastructure, Edge computing, new sensors and devices, and Edge data management will all be massive, growing markets over the next decade.Yet, market projections alone do not capture the essence of what the Edge will become.Edge will change how we live and how businesses operate. It is certain to disrupt not only markets and but our lives in unexpected ways. Unlike past technological revolutions ‚Äî the printing press, electric power, telephones, cars, planes, optical lenses, televisions, pcs, electric power ‚Äî the Edge interacts with us and learns. It creates an ever-present feedback loop that will change and influence our behaviors.The Edge will become a pervasive, mostly invisible, ever-present (and inescapable?) intelligent UX. That much is clear. What this UX will be interfacing with and how sophisticated that may become is anyone‚Äôs guess.So, to me, ‚ÄùEdge‚Äù is a misnomer. It is the Edge only with respect to centralized computing systems such as the cloud or enterprise data centers.Yet the Edge is everywhere. It is where people, and, in fact, the whole physical world, unites with the digital world. The Edge landscape includes our homes, bodies, farms, transportation systems, apparel, stores, factories, cities, parks, buildings, hospitals, sports facilities, outer space, and unlimited other places and spaces, people and things, living and not. Soon, the Edge will be at the center of our lives.The Intelligent Edge combines advancements in Edge computing with emerging complementary technologies ‚Äî AI, machine learning algorithms, smart devices, Edge data centers, and networks ‚Äî to provide value right at the point of interaction.Intelligent Edge is a set of technologies across the technology stack that is related to moving AI and other forms of interactive computing to physical locations. Intelligent Edge solutions provide a number of key benefits over traditional cloud solutions which include:These features will work together to make the Intelligent Edge a transformational technology.Below is an example of a lifecycle map (from my soon-to-be book) that illustrates how certain Edge technologies are evolving. Note that each technology is at a different level of maturity and adoption, and it is moving at different speeds along its lifecycle.There is no need to understand what each of these technologies is. The purpose of this chart in this context is to show that any particular Intelligent Edge solution lives in an evolving ecosystem of technologies at different stages of maturity. And that planning any initiative requires anticipating how Edge technologies are likely to evolve and how fast.As such, Intelligent Edge is not a thing, but a set of changing and evolving technological processes that are moving computing into all aspects of our everyday lives.We live in the pre-Edge era where most computer input is accomplished tediously with our fingers pecking away at screens and boards. Sooner than you may think, this interaction will become more or less invisible.Evidence of the lack of Edge technologies will be what later generations notice about our time; just as we notice what‚Äôs lacking in pictures of cities in the 1890s with horses and buggies, or of families in the 1930s gathered around vacuum-tube radios. But the change the Edge will facilitate will be far more striking.Traffic, transportation, modern housing, financial instruments, restaurants, exchange, money, education, buildings, city designs, healthcare, food supply, social interaction, and a multitude of other things will be altered directly by Intelligent Edge applications.But it‚Äôs the second-order effects that will matter most. Such effects can lead to unanticipated outcomes. Even a fairly linear technology has helped create the world‚Äôs largest company:‚ÄòIt was easy to predict mass car ownership but hard to predict Walmart.‚Äù -Carl SaganHow do you think Intelligent Edge will change the world?I would love to hear from you (feel free to connect).If you would like to learn more about the Intelligent Edge, download a free copy of my soon-to-be book. I would love to hear your thoughts, corrections, and suggestions. Do you have an interesting Edge story to tell? Please contact me. I‚Äôm conducting interviews to include in the book.Cheers.

63,Mask On,https://coronavirus.medium.com/mask-on-679bfe9e9ca8?source=extreme_main_feed---------66-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"This article has been made free for everyone, thanks to Medium Members. For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.On Friday, President Trump said that the CDC is encouraging people to wear masks in public, but that the measure is voluntary. The CDC has urged the administration to make this recommendation, reasoning that it would help prevent the wearer from unknowingly spreading disease.The comprehensive guide to wearing masks published this week in Elemental outlined the two sides of the debate. Proponents of mask-wearing say that doing so would prevent people from inhaling or expelling virus particles in the form of aerosols ‚Äî extremely tiny, airborne particles. Opponents point out that coronavirus is spread primarily through bigger droplets that don‚Äôt stay airborne, so masks are unnecessary and may cause more harm than good, like deprioritizing hand-washing and social distancing and giving people a false sense of security. There are also many different types of masks, complicating the debate.We don‚Äôt yet know how the virus is transmitted, so there is no simple answer. But the research on how it moves is trickling in. Today in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers report that surgical face masks may effectively prevent the transmission of coronaviruses and the influenza virus. They based this conclusion on their study of 246 people with suspected respiratory infections and a big machine aptly named the Gesundheit II.This machine collects the exhaled breath from sick people, allowing researchers to analyze what comes out. To use it, people must stick their heads in a cone-shaped vacuum that catches all the particles they expel for an extended period of time. In the study, the researchers observed fewer virus particles in the exhalations of people who wore surgical masks, concluding that wearing them is helpful in preventing transmission to some degree.It‚Äôs encouraging news for mask proponents, though the study used a specific type of surgical mask ‚Äî Kimberly-Clark brand, model 62356. Whether cloth masks or other face coverings are as helpful remains unclear for now, though the CDC recommends them when surgical masks aren‚Äôt available, and the White House is expected to make an announcement incorporating the agency‚Äôs guidance soon.WRITTEN BY"
64,Simple Explanation of Transformers in NLP,https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-explanation-of-transformers-in-nlp-da1adfc5d64f?source=extreme_main_feed---------67-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"Sequence-2-Sequence-model-with-Attention-mechanismSeq2Seq- Neural machine translationIn this post, we will address the following questions related to TransformerLet‚Äôs dive into the Transformer‚Äôs Architecture and key concepts attached to Transformers to understand how Transformer address these challengesThe Transformer has a stack of 6 Encoder and 6 Decoder, unlike Seq2Seq; the Encoder contains two sub-layers: multi-head self-attention layer and a fully connected feed-forward network.The Decoder contains three sub-layers, a multi-head self-attention layer, an additional layer that performs multi-head self-attention over encoder outputs, and a fully connected feed-forward network.Each sub-layer in Encoder and Decoder has a Residual connection followed by a layer normalization.All input and output tokens to Encoder/Decoder are converted to vectors using learned embeddings. These input embeddings are then passed to Positional Encoding.Positional EncodingThe Transformer‚Äôs architecture does not contain any recurrence or convolution and hence has no notion of word order. All the words of the input sequence are fed to the network with no special order or position as they all flow simultaneously through the Encoder and decoder stack.To understand the meaning of a sentence, it is essential to understand the position and the order of words.Positional encoding is added to the model to helps inject the information about the relative or absolute position of the words in the sentencePositional encoding has the same dimension as the input embedding so that the two can be summed.Attention in simplistic terms is to get a better understanding of the meaning and the context of words in a sentence.Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequenceA self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations and hence are faster than recurrent layersAn Attention function in a Transformer is described as mapping a query and a set of key and value pair to an output. Query, key, and value are all vectors. Attention weights are calculated using Scaled Dot-Product Attention for each word in the sentence. The final score is the weighted sum of the values.Let‚Äôs understand this with a sentence, ‚ÄúI enjoy nature.‚ÄùThe inputs are query, key, and value. The dimension of the vectors is 64, as this leads to stable gradients.Step1: Dot-ProductTake the dot product of the query and key for each word in the sentence. Dot-Product determines who much to focus on other words in the input sentence.Step 2: ScaleScale the Dot-Product by dividing by the square root of the dimension of the key vector. Dimension is 64; hence we divide the Dot-Product by 8.Step 3: Apply softmaxSoftmax normalizes the scaled value. After applying Softmax, all the values are positive and add up to 1Step 4: Calculate the weighted sum of the valuesWe apply the Dot-Product between the normalized score and the value vector and then calculate the sumThe complete equation for Self-AttentionThese steps are repeated for every word in the sentence.Instead of using a single attention function where the attention can be dominated by the actual word itself, transformers use multiple attention heads.Each attention-head has a different linear transformation applied to the same input representation. The Transformer uses eight different attention heads, which are computed parallelly and independently. With eight different attention heads, we have eight different sets of the query, key, and value and also eight sets of Encoder and Decoder each of these sets is initialized randomly‚ÄúMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.‚ÄùWith a multi-head attention head, each part of the input representation interacts with the other parts of the input representation to get a better meaning and context. As multi-head attention looks ate different representation subspaces at different positions, it also helps learn the long term dependency.Using Multi-head Attention, we get that the word ‚Äúit‚Äù in the above sentence refers to ‚ÄúCoronavirus.‚ÄùThe Decoder has masked multi-head attention where it masks or blocks the decoder inputs from the future steps. During training, the multi-head attention of the Decoder hides the future decoder inputs.For the machine translation task to translate a sentence, ‚ÄúI enjoy nature‚Äù from English to Hindi using the Transformer, the Decoder will consider all the inputs words ‚ÄúI, enjoy, nature‚Äù to predict the first word.The below table shows how the Decoder would block the inputs from future stepsEach sub-layer in Encoder and Decoder has a Residual connection followed by a layer normalization.Residual connections are ‚Äúskip connections‚Äù that allow gradients to flow through the network without passing through the non-linear activation function. Residual connection helps with avoiding vanishing or exploding gradient issues. For residual connections to work, the output of each sub-layer in the model should be the same. All sub-layers in the Transformer, produce an output of dimension 512.Layer Normalization: normalizes the inputs across each of the features and is independent of other examples, as shown below. Layer normalization reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. In Layer normalization, we compute mean and variance from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case.Encoder and Decoder in the Transformer both have a fully connected feed-forward network, and it has two linear transformations containing a ReLU activation in between.The final layer of the Decoder applies the linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predict the output probabilitiesThe drawbacks of the seq2seq model are addressed by TransformerTransformers have a simple network architecture based on the Self-Attention mechanism and do not rely on recurrence and convolutions entirely. The computations are executed in parallel making Transformers efficient and requiring less training timeLayer Normalization by Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E.

Your alarm clock then notifies you that it‚Äôs signalled your coffeepot to start brewing you a cappuccino. It then reminds you that your wedding anniversary is coming up and asks whether you‚Äôd like it to book you a table at your favourite restaurant.In the other, you wake up as the heat of the sun starts to bake your tin roof. You start your usual morning routine, lighting a wood stove and cooking a bit of cornmeal to see you through the day. You turn on the radio and listen to the local news. You then make your way to the small field of maize that you rely on for your subsistence.Once you arrive at your allotment, you take out your basic, but functional, smartphone and start tracking how your field is doing. You‚Äôve got real-time data coming in from 10 tiny sensors embedded throughout your field measuring soil temperature, acidity, moisture and nutrient composition. A neat little heat map on your phone lets you know that everything is OK as all the key indicators are green.In all likelihood, this is what life might look like for many in the year 2030.We are on the cusp of another wave of disruptive technological innovation as 5G specifications, greater computing power, shrewd algorithms and very cheap internet-connected chips start to congregate around clever business ideas.If some estimates are to be believed, there‚Äôll be a trillion devices connected to the internet by 2025. The sheer scale of connectivity will mean that our digital footprints will become significantly larger than they currently are, further blurring the lines between reality and cyberspace.If the snapshots of people‚Äôs lives in 2030 above were to materialise, what are the opportunities and risks inherent to those two realities? And, crucially for those of us who work in the data revolution for sustainable development, what are the things we need to start thinking about now to mitigate future risks?‚ÄúMore connectivity will not reduce the world‚Äôs digital divides ‚Äî in fact, it‚Äôs likely to make them worse. Government and activist intervention will be desperately needed to bridge the gaps‚ÄùFirst and foremost, we need to acknowledge that more connectivity will not reduce the world‚Äôs digital divides ‚Äî in fact, it‚Äôs likely to make them worse. Government and activist intervention will be desperately needed to bridge the gaps.Moreover, greater connectivity will not result in the current cyber, digital and data challenges we face vanishing overnight. Without active regulation and planning, risks including personal data misuse, mis- and disinformation, AI bias, etc will continue to plague our societies. These issues will affect both the rich and the poor, but in different ways and to different extents.The opportunities are self-evident. In higher-income countries, a whole new range of gadgets will make life even more convenient and seamless ‚Äî for those who can afford them. In poorer parts of the world, there is still huge value in innovating within local markets and improving services.The benefits from a developmental point of view could be significant. Imagine if the farmer in the second scenario could look at his soil data and have it overlaid ‚Äî in real time ‚Äî with high-resolution satellite images, linked to land-registry entries and fed back to policymakers and statisticians. It would be a dream come true for many of us in the data for development world.However ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a big however ‚Äî will things really play out this way?In many low-income countries, the institutional capacity, governance and regulatory infrastructure is either non-existent or insufficient to effectively regulate data-driven innovation ‚Äî large parts of the world still lack effective data protection legislation.Without these crucial pieces of the puzzle, it is more likely that large agribusinesses and multinationals will be the primary beneficiaries of the data collected by our poor farmer friend above, rather than he himself. This could then have knock-on effects, for instance, agribusinesses buying up the best land and forcing local populations off it.In both of the above hypothetical scenarios, data governance issues ‚Äî questions of control and ownership over data, the right to licence and reuse it, share it, store it, process and analyse it, etc ‚Äî will be pivotal.Whether you rely on digital tech to brew you the perfect coffee or help you grow crops, the current global model of data-related innovation largely relies on the absence of regulation and insufficient regard being paid to potential harms to flourish.Within the sustainable development sector, as the data revolution begins to bear fruit, examples of poor data governance and management are emerging and the cracks are starting to show.Take, for instance, the concerns that have been expressed about how digital ID systems have been rolled out in India. Or current controversies in parts of the world around the use of facial recognition technologies, which have even resulted in a ban on their use by police in California. Or recent concern around the World Food Programme‚Äôs partnership with Palantir and demand to roll out a biometric data system in order to distribute food aid in Yemen. Or Facebook‚Äôs planned crypto-currency and its hopes for its application in the non-profit sector. The list goes on.Essential to changing current dominant data regulation and governance models will be how rights and duties are balanced, a theme explored in documents such as SDSN TReNDS‚Äô recent Counting on the World to Act report.Returning to the agriculture sector example, some jurisdictions are starting to set standards, with the EU leading the pack with its code of conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement.However, the need for contextually nuanced guidance will be far more acute in poorer parts of the world, which are generally starting from a less developed institutional base. Far, far more needs to be done.‚ÄúThe next major frontier issue in the data revolution is how we collectively agree to govern and share the benefits of the data revolution‚ÄùArguably, the next major frontier issue in the data revolution is how we collectively agree to govern and share the benefits of the data revolution. We have a great opportunity to work towards a rebalancing of power away from distant, privately controlled tech giants, towards vesting control back into the hands of the people from whose data value is extracted.For those of us working in the data revolution for sustainable development, we have a moral obligation to work towards tilting the balance of power and control over data in this direction through our investments, projects and interventions.To do this, we need to learn from the evidence around us, which is that, if we don‚Äôt take active steps to set standards and regulate technology and data in an inclusive, democratic and rights-based manner, we inadvertently risk further exacerbating the inequalities we hope to eliminate.Originally posted hereMore thought leadershipOriginally published at https://digileaders.com on January 9, 2020.WRITTEN BY"
66,Driverless Cars,https://medium.com/the-polis/driverless-cars-d3ab12dd7e75?source=extreme_main_feed---------69-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"Firstly, let‚Äôs call them autonomous vehicles (AVs) as that gives us much more scope to use our imagination. And we will be needing our imagination.Then let‚Äôs consider three scenarios. These aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. Though I suspect they might emerge in this order; perhaps as a kind of progression.So what might each of these scenarios be like and what might be some of the political and economic ramifications.Like now, but without driversWe already have driverless trains. The DLR in London for example. There are a number of serious firms investing heavily in autonomous vehicles like Waymo and Cruise in the west; and the Chinese goverment is also investing heavily in the industry. See The Economist. Planes already have sophisticated auto-pilot capability.So let‚Äôs assume it happens. Ride hailing businesses, like Uber, would take-off. Car ownership would probably decline, at least in urban areas. Long distance haulage would be transformed. Delivery vans would still need a loader and unloader; human for the time being.Boats and planes might go autonmous too. Still with crew, just not crew in the cockpit or on the bridge.Emergency response vehicles could move fast through traffic as the vehicles are all talking to each other and following protocols. Maybe any vehicle could be given blue-light status in an emergency.The socio-economic impact of just this could be quite significant. There would need to be new insurance and liability laws. Human driving might become illegal. There would need to be a method of prioritisation of traffic and people. Could you pay for a priority pass? Would public transport just become subsidised taxis? Would trains give way to long lines of back-to-back cars snaking along the highways?Would more people live in their camper vans?Life on the roadA car without a driver is just a room on wheels.Maybe it would be like hotel rooms or temporary office space that you just rent for a specific period of time. But if you can sleep and work actually on the road perhaps some trends might become inverted. Perhaps people would start to buy, or rent, AVs not just instead of a car but instead of a home. Perhaps AVs will become bigger. Perhaps speed becomes less important, like an over-night ferry crossing; slow is fine.Perhaps apartment blocks and hotels will be replaced by supply hubs that you can just dock with and cities will become an ever changing group of modules with AV‚Äôs docking and undocking as required.This could transform the landscape, infrastructure and the economy to an even greater extent that the motor car did. The concept of address and residence could get murky. Would borders open up or close-down? Could schools become virtual? Deliveries could be to you, not your house. Maybe, nieghbourhoods turn into convoys and society becomes more nomadic; again.And what if we went even further?Taking flightWhat if we left the roads behind? What if AVs were as common on water, underwater, in the sky and then in space as they could be on land? At this point it seems reasonable to suppose robotics have advanced enough that we no longer need the loaders and unloaders, or any crew at all perhaps. And of course, this is military as well as civilian.This is getting harder to imagine as it would inevitably link into other bigger influences on our economies and societies. Broader Artificial Intelligence (AI), Climate Change and probably several things that haven‚Äôt been thought of yet. Would work as we know it cease to exist? Could we create a world government that could credibly regulate all this movement and interconnectivity or would we break into factions, fighting for dominance, and fighting over scarce resources like energy, water, food and even air.Would there even be humans? Maybe driverless cars and the mass automation of work is the first concrete step towards the singularity and we won‚Äôt exist on the other side. Or maybe, we are about to leverage technology and colonise the galaxy.I find it difficult to be optimistic about this.Are driverless cars the road to a dystopian or a utopian future? Of course, there might be some middle ground that currently escapes me.Any thoughts?References:The Economist (2019) Chinese firms are taking a different route to driverless cars, the Economist [On-Line] Available at: https://www.economist.com/business/2019/10/12/chinese-firms-are-taking-a-different-route-to-driverless-cars.

A front end by itself doesn‚Äôt do much. A back end without a front end can‚Äôt be used the way it‚Äôs intended to.But that kind of thinking is over a decade old, and the age of APIs is already in progress.While brainstorming for this month‚Äôs upskilling prototype app, I‚Äôve been traversing the web for free APIs that help me upgrade my front-end game (among other things). Here are some of the best ones I‚Äôve found and the apps you can potentially build with them.Yes. There are already a ton recipe-related things out there on the internet. But that‚Äôs not the point.The point is if you‚Äôre new to API integrations, creating a digital recipe book can be a good exercise. You can also extend it to upgrading your visual design and interaction skills if you‚Äôre looking to get into native mobile-application development.Edamam (developer.edamam.com) has a really good API with nutritional analysis, a food database lookup, and recipe searches. The amount of data available for free is immense and should work much better than your regular Lorem ipsum stuff.Speaking of food, you might not be the type that likes to delve into the culinary delights. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôd rather it be made for you.And every now and then, you just want to check out what‚Äôs available in your local area.Never fear, Zomato is here!Or rather, their free API that you can use to integrate into your app or create it from scratch is. Some places are quite on to it when it comes to their menus and will update daily. You can create filters based on reviews, restaurants, locations, types of establishments, cuisines, cities, and categories.You can find their API and documentation here.‚ÄúFortnite‚Äù fan? I‚Äôm not much of a builder, and my reaction speeds are pretty slow ‚Äî but when it comes to creating interfaces for APIs, doing it for ‚ÄúFortnite‚Äù stats looks like something that can be an ultra-fun side project to do.You can learn to integrate with an apiKey here if you haven‚Äôt already done it before.You can get the full instructions here.From what I can see, you can query player stats, match history, what‚Äôs currently at the store, and active challenges.The endpoints are mostly self-documenting, and if you‚Äôre a fan, this API integration should be a breeze.Create a Spotify clone with Spotify‚Äôs API.Yes. It sounds kind of weird to be creating a Spotify clone with Spotify powering it. However, there‚Äôs more to it than that.The API lets you grab JSON metadata about the artists, the album, and the tracks from the data catalog available.Naturally, the default thought we get is to make a traditional list kind of app.But there‚Äôve been a few creative prototypes out there that push the boundaries of what a set of data can actually do. The community showcase ranges from a music-voting app to mixtapes created based on your current location.You can find the Spotify Web API here.Major news outlets tend to have an API of some sort today. This means you have the power to play with the layout and design of how news is going to be displayed.Here are a few APIs that are free and open that you can play with:All of the listed sources require an API key, so you‚Äôll need to go and set that up before you can create valid queries.You can even aggregate them together to form one giant newsfeed for your reading pleasure.Let‚Äôs get real ‚Äî memes are part of the internet. Why not contribute to our digital culture by creating an app that lets you search up your favorite GIFs.GIPHY is probably the largest GIF search engine out there, and it‚Äôs one of the most referenced when it comes to reposting memes here and there.It turns out, they also have a developer‚Äôs portal that provides an SDK to work with. This means APIs for your personal and commercial consumption.Their documentation is pretty extensive but also succinct. You can find their developer portal here.Have you got an e-commerce website? Or are you looking to develop some sort of app or plugin that involves tracking packages?Well, it turns out that UPS has a developer‚Äôs kit you can use to tap into their APIs.The perk of developing this is it can be used for different types of platforms and devices, not just limited to your own integrations. Having a parcel tracker can help with customer communications and gives them the ability to self-service and track on your platform, reducing the searching time required to track down their parcel and where it‚Äôs at.You can find the UPS Developer Kit at their services page.And that‚Äôs it for the apps. To flex my design and development skills, I might just do one or two integrations of my own.It‚Äôs always nice to have a sandbox project where you‚Äôre not bogged down by other people‚Äôs requirements and deadlines. Sandbox projects like these can also make fantastic portfolio pieces and help accelerate your personal and professional learning curves, giving you time to delve and explore into different domains.As always, thank you for reading.WRITTEN BY"

70,Let‚Äôs Play a Game: Designing a New Civilisation,https://medium.com/society4/starting-a-new-civilisation-7b10f963de03?source=extreme_main_feed---------73-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"If you‚Äôre concerned, confused, consumed or conflicted about what‚Äôs happening in the world, buckle up, we‚Äôre going places.Just over a year ago, the following essay was published:The essay was seen by over 10,000 people, was shared thousands of times and has generated hundreds of conversations with new friends from around the world.The outcome of these conversations? A rock-solid conviction that decisively transcending capitalism and neoliberalism as organising systems is absolutely doable ‚Äî just as feudalism and slavery were transcended ‚Äî despite how daunting it may at first appear. In this essay I‚Äôll explain why it‚Äôs doable, and more importantly, what has happened since publishing the 1-year old article about Project 2030.First, a quick summary of the major lessons learned in the past 12 months.If we are to consider starting an entirely new civilisation, it might be useful to view humanity as a single species with a common home, rather than individual races, countries, religions or political parties. It may also be useful to compare the various phase shifts our species has undergone to the phase shifts a human body goes through as it matures. So, the Agricultural Revolution signified a shift from baby to toddler; the Industrial Revolution was humanity reaching school-going age; the Scientific Revolution could be compared to teenage years.In this analogy, our current species is about to step into adulthood ‚Äî a traumatic and emotional time, as any parent of a teenager will know.For a deeper dive into humanity‚Äôs maturity, see:As our species started growing up, we invented systems to coordinate at scale. The first (Western) system to appear was capitalism, which appeared in various forms in the late 1500‚Äôs and has continued morphing and maturing to this day. In this organising system, Adam Smith‚Äîattributed for evolving the idea of wealth creation from labour ‚Äî conceived the idea of ‚Äúthe invisible hand of the market,‚Äù which became the organising system that encouraged and incentivised humans to do stuff.In the late 1800's, a group started challenging the capitalist organising system and communist philosophy began to develop in Russia. In 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power through the October Revolution. This was the first time any group managed to challenge the dominant organising system. In this organising system, the state became the ‚Äúincentive‚Äù which encouraged humans to do stuff. Ever since then, there has been a contest between capitalism and communism to prove which is the more effective organising system. Sadly, the unintended victim in this contest has been the planet, as both systems rely heavily on extractive behaviour.Side Note: If the daily news feels overwhelming, it may be useful to view the current shenanigans between the US, North Korea and Russia as the troubled teenage years of these two competing systems, instead of being caught up in the bombastic displays of fragile individual egos. North Korea is firmly rooted in communism, whereas Russia is a little more complex. While the communist Soviet Union officially ended on December 26, 1991, communist ideologies have not totally come to an end in the new, capitalist Russia. Putin has been in power longer than most Soviet premiers and enjoys similar levels of power to past dictators. While the trappings of communism no longer remain, the effects of the ideology and the nature of power politics in Russia have a strong line of continuity with its past.Here‚Äôs a deeper look at the four organising systems throughout humanity‚Äôs history: Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks.According to Elisabet Sahtouris, the natural evolutionary process of any living organism or species goes through seven stages, varying between competition and cooperation. Species which are unable to move past the competition stage eventually run out of resources and become extinct.There have been a total of 5 prior mass extinctions. While scientists don‚Äôt always know what caused these extinctions, it‚Äôs unlikely that the species themselves caused the circumstances for their extinction. It was more than likely as a result of external events rapidly changing their world (severe ice age, drop in oxygen levels, asteroid impact, etc.) Biologists suspect we‚Äôre currently living through the sixth major mass extinction. The difference is that this time a single species is responsible, because of the way we have treated our planet.Despite the bleak outlook, there is reason for celebration because we have before us an opportunity to design a more mature organising system, one which results in a giant leap of evolution.For a detailed discussion of Celebrating Crisis, see:This may be a tough lesson to fully embrace, but it‚Äôs by now undeniable that the sense-making apparatus by which we try to understand what is happening in the world ‚Äî the network of media communications portals composed of both traditional corporate and alternative outlets ‚Äî has failed to help us understand the reason for the tension between the two competing organising systems and the natural evolutionary process unfolding. New tools for sense-making are going to become critically important if this task is going to be remotely achievable. Two really interesting developments I stumbled across during the course of the year are:[Edit: As Andrew Ng points out in a comment below, while technology can help us sift through increasingly large datasets, what is really required is an entirely different way of thinking. The required shift is away from areas of specialty towards complexity and inter-connectedness. Sadly our education systems haven‚Äôt taught us how to do this kind of thinking, and so rethinking education from the ground up is a critical requirement.]The only thing all cultures, all civilisations, all organising systems have in common is our mutual home: planet Earth, all of Nature. Most human cultures have recognized Earth/Nature as a great Mother, and our deepest scientific inquiries are consistent with this view, revealing Nature as an endless source of knowledge and inspiration to guide our lives toward living in greater harmony with her and with each other.While the task of designing an organising system that decisively results in a giant leap of evolution may appear challenging, it becomes far more achievable if we acknowledge Nature as our guide. We can learn from ant colonies, bee hives and murmurating starlings. Biomimicry ‚Äî copying Nature‚Äôs solutions to make superior, non-toxic and recyclable products ‚Äî has proven incredibly successful. Why not turn to Nature for guidance in reorganising our social/political/economic systems to create peaceful abundance? The clues appear to all be there in the evolutionary process, but I‚Äôve missed them all along, either by failure to notice, or they‚Äôve been intentionally hidden and it took some prodding and prompting through newly-formed friendships.What has become clear to me is that cooperation in Nature, including in human life, is far more prevalent than competition, despite what mass media tells us. Four valuable books in this process have been:Any form of incentive results in competitive behaviour, which doesn‚Äôt happen in Nature.This has, admittedly, been the most difficult lesson for me to embrace over the past 12 months. Much of my writing in the past has been about moving from perverse incentives to positive incentives and I‚Äôve tried to describe mechanisms of rewarding people who engage in world-positive activities. What I failed to understand is that any form of extrinsic rewards strategy ends up co-opting others‚Äô choice-making and imposing someone else‚Äôs belief system of what is positive and what is perverse. The kind of civilisation we are talking about can only start taking form if we have totally expunged power and coercion from the way we coordinate and collaborate in the society ‚Äî a seemingly impossible ask.What I didn‚Äôt know is that the human body offers a perfect example of a fully functioning living system, without any form of incentive.‚ÄúSome 50 to 100 trillion cells, each as complex as a large human city, cooperate willingly, without any form of reward. All are agreed to send aid to any ailing part of the body immediately. No organ dominates ‚Äî not even the brain ‚Äî or expects other organs to adopt their ideology or worldview. No single organ or cell operates with any intention of hoarding or profit. Further, the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô in our cells is given out freely by the mitochondria, not as we do with money in an incentive model, but abundantly to meet every need, while carefully regulated to prevent both too much and too little.‚Äù ‚Äî Elisabet SahtourisWhat I believe the body teaches us is that healthy systemic flow is more important than individual reward.In one of the many rich conversations I had this year, I was reminded that the requirement for incentives is inversely proportional to level of maturity. As an example, my parents had to reward me with pocket money to get me to help with the most basic of household chores; my employers had to bribe me with ridiculously high salaries and business class international travel before I would contribute to their bottom line; as startup founders we turned to investors to stump up a reward before we commenced any work. Now, however, the work I‚Äôm currently doing is motivated solely by a desire to give the best possible gift I can to my daughter on her 21st birthday in 2035: an entirely new operating system for humanity. This form of incentive is intrinsic rather than extrinsic, and it is far more motivating than any previous incentive I‚Äôve been offered. Maybe I am finally growing up and maturing (mum are you listening)?There is still much to learn in this space, but these new insights have been tremendously helpful in thinking about designing a new civilisation. See Elisabet‚Äôs article, from which the quote about ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô in our cells was taken:The past year has been a richly rewarding journey of understanding the problem more fully. The six lessons described above represent a cornucopia of requisite mind-shifts before tackling humanity‚Äôs biggest challenge: an operating system upgrade.A valuable lesson I learned during my corporate career is that any complex challenge or project really only has 4 basic steps:Over the past few months I‚Äôve enjoyed stimulating, mind-bending, challenging late night conversations about how a new civilisation could be birthed ‚Äî not your average discussion topic. These conversations have brought in other points of view, and the mutual learning for all of those involved has been extraordinary. What we have learned is that mutual learning must be designed into the DNA of any new civilisation. Since new ways of coming together only happen every few hundred years, no one alive today knows how to design a new civilisation, so there are no experts we can turn to. Instead, we will design for a world in the becoming ‚Äî things will unfold as we learn more. The civilisation we are transcending teaches us what we don‚Äôt want and what is no longer useful. There is not much from the old that we wish to keep for the new paradigm unfolding.Other living systems don‚Äôt turn to experts and gurus and specialists and authorities. Instead there are endless feedback loops where the complex adaptive system responds to consequences of action, rather than consequences of stepping out of line from arbitrarily imposed rules.Another key learning has been that a new civilisation is not only possible, if we turn to evolution, it is inevitable. More importantly, this civilisation will be the result of ‚Äúwe the people,‚Äù as we can no longer afford or expect systems and institutions as we know them to come to our rescue. The biggest institutions on the planet ‚Äî trans-national corporations, government and intra-government agencies ‚Äî simply cannot and will not see a way out of the mess we‚Äôve created. This is a task for all of us working together ‚Äî there simply is no other way.Thus far, an initial group of three have committed to bringing together 100 unique individuals for an event designed to ignite ‚Äúgroup genius.‚Äù The group of 100 will represent a rich mix of known and unknown individuals from many nations, ages, beliefs and ways of finding right livelihood, taking inputs from many different cultures, some who have followed the same traditions for far longer than capitalism has been around. It is the richness of resulting conversations between these individuals and subsequent design work that will enable emergence to breakthrough from many different vantage points. Rather than any one existing solution being adopted, we will constantly refer to and seek out group genius.Group genius is something which cannot adequately be defined in scientific terms, but it emerges at that magical moment in time during a semi-structured group activity when all participants experience simultaneous synapse transmissions and realise the same thing at the same time. That moment opens new possibilities and births different ways of seeing things, and there‚Äôs no going back. The process has been tried and tested over many years and is licensed and practiced in more than 45 countries by a network of consultants and knowledge workers. Sessions have been conducted with multi-national organisations, government and military agencies, NASA and the World Economic Forum. The methodology has been described in a 1997 book called Leaping the Abyss: Putting Group Genius to Work by Gayle Pergamit and Chris Peterson.The 100 individuals will be specialists in the fields of alternative:As complex as each individual field is, the more complex consideration is the meta-contextuality and inter-weavings of how all these aspects work together as one living system. Our existing paradigm and mental framework has attempted to solve problems in each discipline, often to the isolation of others. A life worth celebrating consists of relationships within context and to create a new civilisation, the interplay of each discipline must be at the core of the design.Since designing a new civilisation from scratch can be a daunting undertaking, the objective of the group of 100 is to create a global game which anyone can participate in ‚Äî a real-life game involving real people going about their daily life, while informing the global participants of new ways of doing things. This is the only way we can avoid biases from a dominant culture creeping in. The game itself will result in a solution prototype: a workable example of an entirely new operating system for humanity.The process, therefore, is:Early discussions ‚Üí group genius ‚Üí game design ‚Üí play the game ‚Üí build the prototype ‚Üí birth the civilisation.Some of the features might include:In short, our new civilisation will leapfrog all existing forms of human coordination and organisation by taking advantage of the latest philosophical, ecological and technical breakthroughs our species has created to date. The design of our next civilisation is a necessary stepping stone on the journey of evolving to a higher level of complexity.While it‚Äôs still very early days, the ball has been set in motion and nothing can stop us. We will start a new civilisation. The question is, to what extent will you participate? As a spectator, as an involved participant or as an informed advisor? Either way, our planet needs you!The absolute first step is to start being honest with ourselves. As Dr. Nafeez Ahmed so aptly says¬π:‚ÄúWe first wake up. We wake up to the reality of what is happening in the world. We then wake up to our own complicity in that reality and truly face up to the intricate acts of self-deception we routinely undertake to conceal ourselves from this complicity.‚Äù ‚Äî Nafeez Ahmed, founding editor of INSURGE intelligence.Some of these routine acts of complicity include filling up at the gas station, sending our kids to school, taking prescription medication, voting, submitting tax returns, debating current realities and many others). It‚Äôs no longer sufficient to simply point fingers at what‚Äôs wrong. In fact, doing so just keeps us trapped in the current civilisation. All of the powerful energy we might put into resisting the current system drains us of our ability to build alternative viable systems ‚Äî a new civilisation.If you‚Äôre serious about this, read the following essay to learn about the 3 laws of the effective strategy we will need to adopt:The second step we can take after we‚Äôve woken up to our own complicity in the current system, according to Ahmed, is to‚Äú‚Ä¶look to mobilise ourselves anew to undo these threads of complicity where feasible, and to create new patterns of work and play that connect us back with the Earth and the Cosmos. And we work to connect our own re-patterning with the re-patterning work of others, with a view to plant the seed-networks of the next system ‚Äî a system which is not so much ‚Äònext‚Äô, but here and now, emergent in the fresh choices we make everyday.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs what our task is right now. Not to protest, not to demand justice, not to resist. All we must do is re-pattern our daily lives by making new choices in how we lead our lives. It‚Äôs not difficult, it just requires a decision and a commitment.‚ÄúNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it‚Äôs the only thing that ever has.‚Äù ‚Äî Margaret MeadWe are the power!In 2017, I pledged to absolutely, positively, decisively and consciously commit to working with the brightest and most caring, holistic minds on the planet to define and birth a transcendent civilisation, supported by emerging technology, that benefits the 6.5 billion currently disenfranchised humans, as well as all animals and plants on this earth. The vision is crystal-clear and entirely doable, with the right team.This year, I‚Äôm reaffirming that commitment. It‚Äôs been a thrilling, scary, challenging and emergent journey thus far. I can‚Äôt wait to see what unfolds in the next 12 months.Michael Haupt

Whether we like it or not, each project ends with some kind of a report. May this be a post on Confluence, Readme on GitHub or a Scientific paper. There is no need to copy-paste values one by one from a DataFrame to another software. pandas with its formatting functions can convert a DataFrame to many formats.To run the examples download this Jupyter notebook.To Step Up Your Pandas Game, read:Let‚Äôs create a DataFrame 10 rows and 3 columns with random values.Pandas DataFrame can be converted to HTML with to_html function. This is useful if you need to send automated reports via HTML. You can also make an API on pandas-analytics-server so that you can track the latest values in a DataFrame in a web browser.Note, lxml package is required. You can install it with: pip install lxml.There is even a read_html function that enables you to parse the HTML back to a pandas DataFrame. I haven‚Äôt tried it with a generic HTML ‚Äî It would be nice if it worked.Most of the high-quality research papers are written using LaTeX ‚Äî a high-quality typesetting system. Many LaTeX writers make a screenshot of a DataFrame and then they include it in their paper, others spend quite some time to format the DataFrame values to LaTeX tables.What if I told you there is a to_latex function in pandas that does the heavy lifting for you. Let‚Äôs look at the example.You can use it with print to get a nicely formatted output.Github uses Markdown formatting language for README and Wiki in repositories. A great README makes your project more likely to be used by others. Making a step-by-step example on GitHub is quite common, but it would take a lot of time to format a pandas DataFrame to markdown by hand. Pandas got us covered.Excel is the defacto standard in the business world. With pandas, we can easily read an Excel Spreadsheet. It has a function to convert a DataFrame to Excel Spreadsheet.Note, xlwt and openpyxl packages are required. You can install them with pip.Converting a DataFrame to a string may be useful while writing comments in the code.These were a few pandas presentation tips that I use frequently.

72,Know Yourself More from Your Whatsapp Chat History,https://towardsdatascience.com/know-yourself-more-from-your-whatsapp-chat-history-8ec4b69c12c5?source=extreme_main_feed---------75-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I was suggested to do remote working from home. It‚Äôs been a week and being all day at home bores me, so I randomly thought maybe it‚Äôs the right time to do self-introspection. Luckily, I remembered that I exported my WhatsApp chat not long ago. So I jumped into it and decided to do quick data exploration, to know more about myself and my interlocutor. Let the data speak.WhatsApp exported chat is formatted as .txt. Every line of the message consists of <timestamp> ‚Äî <sender> : <message>. In some cases where the messages has multiple lines, the 2nd and following lines will be represented with only <message> without <timestamp> ‚Äî <sender> . See example below for the structure.Converting the data into a DataFrame allows me to do much more. The beauty of this task is it need pattern matching to separate the timestamp, sender, and the message. Regex will make the job done a lot easier. I combine Python‚Äôs re module with its f-string string formatting and find out it‚Äôs a great combination, especially on a more complex pattern. Here‚Äôs my code to convert the .txt file into a dataframe.Is it enough? No. There‚Äôs a lot more information we could retrieve to help future analysis. Thus, I did more feature engineering in the code below and return the following dataframe.Now that the data is ready, let‚Äôs start by answering several questionsKnowing chat behavior is a must. I think looking into the time when conversations happen the most will describe it quite well. So, in hour frequency, I took an average of:In case you‚Äôre confused with seq and seq_line, assume there‚Äôs a conversation between A and BFrom the chart above, I know at least:I could say that by average, I begin actively chatting on 6 pm, and reaches its peak on 10‚Äì11 pm everyday, and stop chatting until 6 am.I wantto know, who took longer to reply to a text. It‚Äôs quite important to know who‚Äôs responsive and who‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt want to be generally judged by ‚Äúyou reply late‚Äù without any evidence. So, again, this is the moment of truth.I do the average of all text from party-A ant party-B. I took the differences between party A‚Äôs last chat to party B‚Äôs first reply (vice versa), do some data wrangling and have the result in the following:It looks like party A and B are similar. They took ~10 minutes to reply to a message. However, on party B‚Äôs side, the variance is higher, meaning there‚Äôs a greater chance that party B takes longer to reply. I think I know who party B is *sigh.Similar to the previous problem, but now I want to see when is exactly the fastest response occurs. Looking by the mean, on working day (Mon-Fri) party A and have the fastest response at 1 am while party B at 11 pm. On weekend, party A is fastest at 0 am while party B is still at 11 pm.You can see several different peaks for Party A and B, but what I wanted to highlight is this fact supports my previous statement saying that the conversation is more intense at late night.I‚Äôve shown you who‚Äôs faster at giving a reply. But what if the party taking longer to reply uses more words? I took a brief summary of lines, words, and characters used in every party‚Äôs text. Please note that a text or reply could consist of multiple lines.If we see carefully, in terms of the number of lines, party B replies with more line that party A. This might lead to a conclusion that Party A tends to sum up the reply in a whole line, while party B tends to send it in different lines.The number of words and characters that party B sends on each reply is relatively lower than party A, meaning party A writes longer than party B. This is also supported by the duration variable, where party A has more duration in writing a reply than party B. So, party A writes longer than party B.In the previous question, we know that party B takes a longer time to respond. I assume that‚Äôs because party B writes longer than A. In fact, A writes longer. And B even writes faster than A. So there‚Äôs no excuse for B haha.One of the most popular ways to inspect word data is by visualizing its word frequency using a word cloud.I remove several stopwords to remove the meaningless frequent word. Since I use Bahasa Indonesia on my chat, I use Elang to remove Indonesian stopwords. Now, using word cloud, take a look at these wordsThat‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúhaha‚Äù and ‚Äúwkwk‚Äù, Indonesian-considered laughing word. Using regex, I remove the laughing words and here‚Äôs the final word cloud.I‚Äôm sorry if you don‚Äôt understand the words, It‚Äôs Indonesian, and it‚Äôs mostly non-formal words (who use formal words in chat anyway).Previously I discovered that the laughing words take up a lot of my word cloud space. Are we that frequent in laughing (via text)? To find out, I extract all laughing words and compare its number with the number of lines to get the probability.21.7% probability of having a laughing word in one line? That‚Äôs hilarious. I don‚Äôt expect that much. But it is what it is. Maybe I‚Äôm a funny person in-text. Am I?We have an intense conversation late at night, probably talking about each other experiences. We laugh a lot. Party A writes a lot but took longer to write, while Party B writes shorter, but took longer to respond.There are many applications to be done with the data. In future work, I would like to do sentiment analysis for the chat, See if I could use the data to forecast the number of conversations, and do clustering using more than one conversation (multiple people)If there anything you think I missed in this post, please leave a comment below. I would like to hear any form of questions/suggestions too.Full code available on my git repositoryThank you.WRITTEN BY"

Meant to describe what alien civilizations would look like, it labels our own in comparison to what may be in the cosmos.Proposed originally by Russian astrophysicist, Nikolai Kardashev, this scale measures potential civilizations by energy output in 3 stages.He believed that a civilization is measured on a cosmic level by its‚Äô energy usage and the technology it uses. According to Kardashev, these two aspects ran parallel to one another.As more energy is produced, higher levels of technology are needed to produce it. Therefore, a society that has a high energy output must have matching technology.In other words, more energy output = more technologically advanced.Here‚Äôs the sad part‚Ä¶humans aren‚Äôt even on this scale yet.We still harvest most of our energy from dead animals, plants, and the Earth itself. Society as we know it is a Type 0 civilization. Ouch.Current estimates on when we may even be promoted onto the scale aren‚Äôt for another few hundred years. That being said, what does each stage of the Kardashev Scale mean and how is it applicable to our future?This relatively low-level civilization that we have almost achieved is characterized by one that harnesses the complete energy of its‚Äô neighboring star. Basically solar power.Essentially, natural disasters can be converted into energy rather than destruction by civilizations of this caliber. Our energy production would need to be 100,000 times what it is now to achieve this.Yeah, that‚Äôs the low level of this scale‚Ä¶start imagining the rest.A very important characteristic, and perhaps why we haven‚Äôt achieved it, is that a Type I civilization has the ability to store enough energy for its‚Äô growing population.In other words, overpopulation is no longer a problem.The entire planets‚Äô resources would be utilized for energy and the light from our star as well.While it may sound extremely far fetched, energy production is largely exponential and one or two large breakthroughs could help us achieve this stage.This form of civilization is similar to Type I in the sense that a civilization of this rank controls the energy from its‚Äô star. However, it goes beyond just converting solar energy.Type II civilizations have the ability to directly manipulate their star and convert its‚Äô energy to something more powerful than anything we‚Äôve seen.An idea would be a device that can capture the energy released from fusion which powers stars. This energy could then theoretically be transferred back to a home planet for use.If gathered this way, the energy would be far more powerful than any form of solar energy we have seen.Having the ability to actually manipulate a star means that all-natural universal disasters would no longer pose a threat to the planet.The capability of celestial manipulation means that any asteroid on a collision path with us could be vaporized, for example. We are an estimated 1000‚Äì2000 years away from this level of technology, provided we don‚Äôt wipe ourselves out first.Finally, we get to the big dogs of the universe. Advanced civilizations of this level have harnessed all the energy available from their galaxy in a sustainable way.Complete colonization and the energy gathered from hundreds of millions of stars power a civilization of this magnitude. A society this advanced is at least a million years ahead of us in development.One of the only ways society would successfully reach this point is by overcoming light-speed travel, which may entail using wormholes or some other form of travel.The technology used by a society such as this would most likely appear as magic to us at our current level. Truthfully, if beings of this strength came across us they would probably terraform our world due to our low development.It‚Äôs worth noting that in recent years, researches have extended the scale by two notches: Type IV and Type V. Universal and Multiversal civilizations, respectively, these groups would transcend time and space as we know it.Given that civilizations of those types aren‚Äôt even comprehensible, scientists haven‚Äôt officially added them to the scale.The truth of the matter is that we are a Type 0. We‚Äôve wasted centuries fighting one another for resources, attempting to beat one another when we really should have been collaborating.Any hope we have of advancing into the stars and onto the scale requires that we work together. Achieving a Type I civilization would put an end to our resource use and overpopulation problems, but only if we can put our differences aside.The future of our society depends on it. We‚Äôll see how it all plays out.WRITTEN BY"

I am a critical care nurse on the frontline battling this pandemic in one of the epicenters of the world ‚Äî Queens, NY.What does it look like behind the walls of the hospital you may wonder? It‚Äôs hard to explain. But, with every face covered by masks you see the look of anxiety, fear and stress in the eyes of everyone you walk by. The air is heavy and it is tense. Rapid responses can be heard overhead very frequently. A dreaded call that once used to be heard far and few in between is now heard nearly every 30 minutes. Rapid response to room ‚Äî anesthesia stat to room ‚Äî respiratory stat to room ‚Äî and in that moment you shake your head in disbelief. Another one. And, another one after that and another one after that. When will this calm down? Nobody knows.There are rows of patients, all medically paralyzed and vented. 22 to be exact on one particular unit. It looks like something from the movies. Bed after bed, body after body laying silently, completely limp with vents hanging from their mouths. These people lie helplessly as we fight a battle to keep them alive. We want to help these people, we have the brains, we have the power. The only problem? Often times, we don‚Äôt have the means and we certainly don‚Äôt have the cure.The ringing in my ears. My gosh the ringing. Who‚Äôs vent is alarming? Who‚Äôs IV is beeping? Who‚Äôs cardiac monitor is sounding? It‚Äôs hard to tell in a room packed with patients - all in critical condition. In one unit, no doors or curtains dividing the patients. It‚Äôs just one giant room filled with constant ringing, beeping and suctioning. I even hear it in my sleep. I hear it when I‚Äôm standing in the shower after a long day of work. I hear it every time my cellphone goes off. Is someone‚Äôs alarm going off? Are they okay? Oh, it was just my phone.Someone‚Äôs O2 starts to drop, what do we do?! What the heck do we do? They are already intubated and maxed out on oxygen. Think. Act fast. The oxygen keeps dropping lower and lower. This is someone‚Äôs loved one. Someone‚Äôs mother, father, brother, sister, aunt and uncle. Bag them, we have to bag them. Please work. Yes, thank God. If only we got this lucky every time. Next comes the order to prone these patients. Do you know what it‚Äôs like to have 3 maybe 4 nurses, all about average size, trying to flip a paralyzed and limp patient, sometimes 300 pounds or more, from their back to their stomach as fiercely and quickly as possible to keep them alive? We hurt, we ache, we want to cry and scream at how helpless we feel sometimes. But, flip them we must and flip them to their stomachs we do.Home. I miss home so much. One minute I was sleeping next to the man I love. Suddenly, my schedule‚Äôs changed at 7pm for the very next day. And, just like that, I was assigned to a COVID unit. I spent that night after work at a hotel room while I scrambled to find alternative living arrangements. At that time, hotels weren‚Äôt offering deals to hospital workers so I moved into an Airbnb studio apartment alone. I have not hugged the people I love in 3 weeks in order to protect them. At times, I feel just as isolated as these patients ‚Äî alone in their rooms without any visitors. But, I know I am not alone in this struggle.My heart. It aches so much. I will never forget the time a patient was rushed to the unit and a group of nurses handed the patient a phone in their room to say goodbye to the person they love and have created a life with. Their oxygen was dropping and intubating was imminent. Can you imagine having to make a call like that? ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù said through panting breaths. This is the reality. Most of us get through the hardest times of our lives with our families by our sides, and they have to fight this battle alone. Completely alone. My heart goes out to their families. They are hearing and seeing on the news how bad this pandemic is. Death after death. You know they are praying their husband or wife, brother or sister, mother or father isn‚Äôt next. Their loved ones have been diagnosed with this monster and they cannot see for themselves what is happening to the people they love. The doctors and nurses are doing the best they can to keep them informed, but the reality is the more time spent on the phone, the less time we have to care for the emergencies happening endlessly at the bedside. And so, this tug of war continues. If I can give the families any reassurance, just know we are holding your loved ones hands, easing their anxiety to the best of our ability and doing everything we possibly can to keep them alive. We empathize with what you may be experiencing. There is nothing more difficult to swallow than the fear of the unknown and you are facing that everyday your family is in our care. We see you, we love you, and we will never stop fighting for the people you love and call family.Camaraderie. The brotherhood, the sisterhood. We stand together ‚Äî united. We are ALL fighting this battle and it‚Äôs a teamwork I have never seen before. Each patient as critical and heavy as the next, but each nurse volunteers themselves and their precious critical time to help a coworker in need. ‚ÄúWhat can I get you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat can I help you with‚Äù is frequently heard among us. This is not just nurse to nurse. This is nurse to doctor, to respiratory therapist, to housekeeper. Everyone.Flexible. New makeshift ICU‚Äôs are being made all the time. The hospital is evolving and growing with the tides of this virus. We are getting pulled from our comfort zones, our home units converted into ‚ÄúICU‚Äôs‚Äù. The worst part of it all? ICU‚Äôs are special units for a reason. You have all emergency equipment and supplies readily at hand. Not anymore. Floors have been converted to makeshift ICU‚Äôs. Supplies are stacked in buckets on what used to be patient trays. There is no time for order or organization. You grab what you can, for who you can.My body. I have rashes all over my hands from washing so much and my knuckles are starting to bleed. I am developing pressure ulcers above my ears where the mask lays and I have a red mark surrounding my mouth as if an octopus was suctioned to my face. Gosh has it already been 12 hours? I haven‚Äôt eaten, drank or used the bathroom all day. My feet have blisters on them and I‚Äôve already worn down these new sneakers I got just a month ago. I wish I could just sit for a minute ‚Äî oh wait, I have to draw that ABG, oh that patient in bed 5 has to be turned. Suck it up, just go, you can do this. But for how much longer?Awareness. Although there is no way to thank people throughout the world for all the love and support healthcare workers have received, I think it‚Äôs important to remember that we ‚Äî nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists do not stand alone. It takes an army to run a hospital. I want to personally thank all the housekeepers who are working so incredibly hard to terminally clean all the rooms, the nursing assistants, the staff from the kitchen, the transporters, unit receptionist. They are keeping up with the speed of lightning and are working so incredibly hard. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. We could not do this without you.What can we do to help? I cannot even begin to count how many times I‚Äôve been asked this question. Well, I would like to say there are ‚Äúsmall ways‚Äù and then ‚Äúlarge ways‚Äù you can help. ‚ÄúSmall ways‚Äù ‚Äî send protein bars or snacks to your local hospital. Most of us don‚Äôt have time for a lunch break, let alone time to run to the cafeteria for food. You have no idea how helpful that is. You can donate materials to locals who are sewing masks. If you are a parent at home with your kids, have them write cards so staff can read them and smile amongst all this chaos. Now to the ‚Äúbig stuff‚Äù. Do you wanna know what would be extremely helpful? Student loan forgiveness for healthcare workers. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. The amount of money most of us owe could knock your breath away. I‚Äôm not kidding when I say it keeps me up at night. Please advocate to your local legislators. Help us. Please. We will continue to put our lives on the lines for you, please rid us of our debt. Advocate for crisis pay, not just for the nurses and doctors. Everyone is working so incredibly hard. Advocate for the cost of alternative housing a lot of us are having to move into. And, stay home. It‚Äôs really that simple, just stay home.I know I speak for hundreds if not thousands of nurses when I say, we would do this job for free, but if you really want to know what would help us ‚Ä¶ this. This would help tremendously.Just another nurse.All the light & love I have,

76,7 Rules of Using Storytelling to Hook an Audience,https://medium.com/better-marketing/7-rules-of-using-storytelling-to-hook-an-audience-bdc0914a48be?source=extreme_main_feed---------79-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is an event that takes place yearly in Las Vegas, USA. This year is the first time I would be following the event closely.My interest is not really on the electronics, even though I love tech. My interest this time is on the presentations. The consumer electronics companies at the event present on stage their new products and projects. And I was watching closely what they presented and how they did it.Of all the presentations I have seen thus far, I was most impressed with Toyota‚Äôs presentation. The presentation was made by the CEO, Akio Toyoda. Although his English wasn‚Äôt perfect, his presentation was better (in my opinion) than all the others.The reason is simple and obvious. Akio Toyoda was the only person I saw (thus far) who really used the power of storytelling to captivate the audience. He took the audience on a journey. And it was beautiful.The others were just excited to show us the next cool gadget they made. They go right into the product to tell us what it is, what it does, how it works and so on. There was no story to bring us into their world.A few other presentations tried to add this feature but they were concentrated on product features. It was 75% features and 25% story. I think it should be otherwise; 75% story and 25% features. This is because the story makes the audience appreciate the features.There are rules that make storytelling effective when speaking to an audience. I have discovered seven. However, you can still have a great presentation if you are off with one or two.Here are the seven rules of hooking your audience with storytelling:Your presentation can swiftly go off the rails if you do not have a good command of the language you are speaking in. The best is always to be a native speaker. But if not, then the key is to practice, practice, practice.There were a couple of non-native presenters at the CES 2020. And they spoke fairly well. The big secret of presenting well in English when you are not a native speaker is to talk slowly. When you try to rush your words like the native speakers, it becomes difficult for the audience to hear you clearly.When you talk about facts and features in an unclear tone, it would still be easy for the audience to catch up. But if it is a story, the audience gets lost when they can‚Äôt hear a part of it. And you will feel it when you say something they ought to laugh at or clap to, and there is dead silence. That moment can negatively affect your stage confidence going forward.Native speakers ought to pay attention to this also. No matter how small the time you are given, it is important not to rush things. It is better to just reduce how much you‚Äôre going to say.Storytelling involves jokes, punchlines, slang, and so on. The last thing you want is to say something that would be offensive to the audience without you knowing it. A lot of big speakers have experienced this. They said something they thought was funny, only to be told later that it was offensive to the audience.There are some offences that are just people being petty. But there are cultural differences that could be really bad. This is why you need to have a general idea of the cultural background of the audience. Nobody needs a detailed account of every possible thing that could be offensive.You just need to get someone who has a good understanding of the audience to practice with. That person should tell you when you are out of touch with your story or triggering the wrong emotions.You must be aware of the technical level of the audience. There is no point in trying to impress them with terms nobody understands. When presenters fail this rule, they believe they have given a great presentation. However, the audience will have the opposite impression.A presentation is to impress the audience and not oneself. So the terms and descriptions used should be one the audience is deeply familiar with. Simple is always best. But sometimes, the audience is very technical and knowledgeable. And that makes it necessary to use technical terms.Can technical terms be used in storytelling? Yes! Storytelling is not merely about telling a story of yourself and your experience. It is about taking the audience on a journey. And it must be a journey they can all relate to.The audience is either ready for you or they are not. You must know how to gauge their readiness and address their expectations.I was at an event a few years ago. The audience had been seated, listening to speaker after speaker for a few hours. Then my friend who was an invited speaker took the stage. He was the last speaker. He could tell that everybody was tired. He did something usual.He asked everybody to stand up and stretch for about a minute. The energy that simple exercise brought into the room was amazing. He then made his presentation very short. He was probably the favorite speaker of everyone at that event.If your audience is not hot and ready for you, try to find out why, and do something about it the moment you get on stage. In many cases, a little expression that shows you really care goes a long way to prepare the minds of the audience to what you have to say.This is a bit personal I must confess. People who don‚Äôt stick to time piss me off. If you cannot stick to time, it shows a lack of organization. And that not only affects time, but it also affects everything else.Sticking to time is even more important when you are not the main speaker or presenter at an event. Everybody can bear with the main speaker going on for a few minutes more than expected. But when you are eating into the time of a speaker everybody is waiting for (or the break time), then it is not good.You need to be able to make your point in the little time you are given. Your story must be told according to the time you have. You could have a two-minute, seven-minute and 15-minute version of the same story. More time doesn‚Äôt always mean more storytelling impact. In fact, short stories are the best.Your story must have a plot twist or something to laugh about. A story without unexpected turns or hilarious punchlines won‚Äôt stay long in the minds of the audience. And the reason for using stories in the first place is to make a long-lasting impression.In Akio Toyoda‚Äôs presentation, he began with popular futuristic ideas the tech world has been toying with for years. Then he took the audience on a journey with him. He showed what went on in his mind that led to what he came to showcase.Every statement had a vital piece of information and excitement to listen to the next part. I am sure most of the audience is just as captivated as I was. Yes, he was presenting a real innovative idea, but I think most of the other things presented at the event were just as innovative (even though on a smaller scale).There were products I absolutely loved and felt like the presentation was a disservice to the genius behind it. Everybody was coughing out features that make their product unique with minimal storytelling that makes it relevant to a general audience of buyers. The big problem there is that it gets boring very quickly.A reasonable goal for a marketing presentation is to tell a story worth sharing again and again whenever people want to discuss the product.The story must be relevant to the product or service being presented. It could be from any angle. It must drive people to the point you are there to make.The story must not be a clich√© or something everybody knows already. There must be something different about it. And it must lead the audience into understanding your product or service in a more intimate way.This is the most important part of the rules. The story has to matter. Otherwise, it would just be a nice speech and it won‚Äôt result in sales.Storytelling is essential to an effective marketing presentation. When the consumer wants to make a buying decision, they not only ask, ‚ÄòWhich is better?‚Äô, they also ask, ‚ÄòWhich one am I most comfortable with?‚ÄôPeople are most comfortable with things they are connected to. And stories build such connections.WRITTEN BY"
77,Understanding Mathematical Symbols with Code,https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-mathematical-symbols-with-code-5aa0c542644?source=extreme_main_feed---------80-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"For anyone interested in pursuing a career or research in Machine Learning and Data Science, the day will come when it is time to move beyond the python libraries to follow curiosities into the math behind it all. This will typically take you to the vast, open collection of papers detailing how it all works. The deeper you go to understand the core mathematics, the closer you may come to the flash of insight to create a new method. Everything seems to be all right on the first paper until you come across something like this:For anyone who has studied math for years or worked at the math level of Machine Learning, such an equation can be carefully parsed into meaning and code. For many others though, this may look like hieroglyphics. The truth is that it almost seems like the ancient math leaders chose the most interesting looking symbols to describe rather intuitive methods. The result: Equations and variables that look much more complex than they really are.I‚Äôve found that code can be used for more than writing programs, but also a globally agreed upon language to explain the complex. When I was learning the math behind everything Data Science, I always found that the best way to gain a universal understanding of math was to write code snippets to describe equations. Eventually, these symbols become understood to a point that they can almost be read as text in a typical paper. In this article, I hope to share some examples of how simple math can be when described with code!The summation symbol is one of the most useful and commonly used symbols in iterative mathematics. Despite its complex design, the implementation is rather simple, yet incredibly useful.As seen above, all that this symbol represents is a for loop in the range of the number on top, starting from the number on the bottom. The variable set on the bottom becomes the index variable and any result per loop is added to an overall value. Less commonly, the following may be used:Typically called the Product Operator, this symbol functions in the same manner, but instead of adding each result they will be multiplied.Factorial is the ‚Äú!‚Äù which exists on almost any calculator. To many, this one may be a bit more obvious, but it is still worth it to write some code to understand the mechanics.5! would be represented as:Conditional brackets are used to divert the flow of an equation based on a set of conditions. For coders, this is simply the common ‚Äúif‚Äù statement. The above conditional can be represented as:As seen above, the right notation of each row of the bracket dictates what each path should execute. I threw the extra ‚Äúcontains‚Äù symbol into each condition as well to add more insight. As seen above, we checked if the i value was in the y list. Recognizing that it was, we returned the sum of the array. If the i value had not been in the array we would have returned 0 or 1 based on the value.Finally, I wanted to quickly cover the operations which are typically done for any Data Scientist by their favorite language library ‚Äî matrix multiplication. The easiest form to understand is the point wise operation. This is simply written as:Note the first requirement is that each matrix must have the same shape(ie # rows= & #Columns=)The code for this looks as follows:Lastly let's take a look at a typical matrix multiplication process, most commonly used in Machine Learning. In complex terms, this operation finds the dot product of each primary row with each secondary column. The main take away from this is the the following requirement: assume [#rows, #columns] ‚Üímatrices i x j requires #columns(i) == #rows(j) ‚Üí with a final product of shape [#rows(i), #columns(j)]This may seem confusing and my best suggestion would be to take a look at google images for some great visualizations of these requirements.The code for this equation looks as follows(using numpy dot method):This was just a few examples, but the understanding of this simple code can allow any programmer to take on the initially ominous world of mathematics. Of course, these methods can all be consolidated for efficiency and usually have a library method readily available. The point of writing these in simple code is to see how much sense they make when written out in the form of their true operations.Continue the conversation with me on Twitter or LinkedIn!Sources[1]https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pure-mathematics-formul√¶-blackboard.jpgWRITTEN BY"
78,Crack SQL Interviews,https://towardsdatascience.com/crack-sql-interviews-6a5fc90ec763?source=extreme_main_feed---------81-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"SQL is one of the most essential programming languages for data analysis and data processing, and so SQL questions are always part of the interview process for data science-related jobs, such as data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. SQL interviews are meant to evaluate candidates‚Äô technical and problem-solving skills. Therefore, it is critical to not only write correct queries based on sample data but also consider various scenarios and edge cases as if working with real-world datasets.I‚Äôve helped design and conduct SQL interview questions for data science candidates, and have undergone many SQL interviews for jobs in giant technology companies and startups myself. In this blog post, I will explain the common patterns seen in SQL interview questions and provide tips on how to neatly handle them in SQL queries.To nail an SQL interview, the most important thing is to make sure that you have all the details of the given task and data sample by asking as many questions as you need. Understanding the requirements will save you time from iterating on problems later and enable you to handle edge cases well.I noticed many candidates tend to jump right into the solution without having a good understanding of the SQL questions or the dataset. Later on, they had to repeatedly modify their queries after I pointed out problems in their solution. In the end, they wasted a lot of interview time in iteration and may not have even arrived at the right solution.I recommend treating SQL interviews as if you are working with a business partner at work. You would want to gather all the requirements on the data request before you provide a solution.ExampleFind the top 3 employees who have the highest salary.You should ask the interviewer(s) to clarify the ‚Äútop 3‚Äù. Should I include exactly 3 employees in my results? How do you want me to handle ties? In addition, carefully review the sample employee data. What is the data type of the salary field? Do I need to clean the data before calculate?In SQL, JOIN is frequently used to combine information from multiple tables. There are four different types of JOIN, but in most cases, we only use INNER, LEFT and FULL JOIN, because the RIGHT JOIN is not very intuitive and can be easily rewritten using LEFT JOIN. In an SQL interview, you need to choose the right JOIN to use based on the specific requirement of the given question.ExampleFind the total number of classes taken by each student. (Provide student id, name and number of classes taken.)As you might have noticed, not all students appearing in theclass_history table are present in thestudent table, which might be because those students are no longer enrolled. (This is actually very typical in transactional databases, as records are often deleted once inactive.) Depending on whether the interviewer wants inactive students in the results, we need to use either LEFT JOIN or INNER JOIN to combine two tables:GROUP BY is the most essential function in SQL since it is widely used for data aggregation. If you see keywords such as sum, average, minimum, or maximum in a SQL question, it is a big hint that you should probably use GROUP BY in your query. A common pitfall is mixing WHERE and HAVING when filtering data along with GROUP BY ‚Äî I have seen many people make this mistake.ExampleCalculate the average required course GPA in each school year for each student and find students who are qualified for the Dean‚Äôs List (GPA ‚â• 3.5) in each semester.Since we consider only required courses in our GPA calculation, we need to exclude optional courses using WHERE is_required = TRUE. We need the average GPA per student per year, so we will GROUP BY both thestudent_id and theschool_year columns and take the average of thegpa column. Lastly, we only keep rows where the student has an average GPA higher than 3.5, which can be implemented using HAVING. Let‚Äôs put everything together:Keep in mind that whenever GROUP BY is used in a query, you can only select group-by columns and aggregated columns because the row-level information in other columns has already been discarded.Some people might wonder what‚Äôs the difference between WHERE and HAVING, or why we don‚Äôt just write HAVING avg_gpa >= 3.5 instead of specifying the function. I will explain more in the next section.Most people write SQL queries from top to bottom starting from SELECT, but do you know that SELECT is one of the very last functions executed by the SQL engine? Below is the execution order of a SQL query:Consider the previous example again. Because we want to filter out optional courses before computing average GPAs, I used WHERE is_required = TRUE instead HAVING, because WHERE is executed before GROUP BY and HAVING. The reason I can‚Äôt write HAVING avg_gpa >= 3.5 is thatavg_gpa is defined as part of SELECT, so it cannot be referred to in steps executed before SELECT.I recommend following the execution order when writing queries, which is helpful if you struggle with writing complicated queries.Window functions frequently appear in SQL interviews as well. There are five common window functions:In SQL interviews, it is important to understand the differences between ranking functions and know when to use LAG/LEAD.ExampleFind the top 3 employees who have the highest salary in each department.When an SQL question asks for ‚ÄúTOP N‚Äù, we can use either ORDER BY or ranking functions to answer the question. However, in this example, it asks to calculate ‚ÄúTOP N X in each Y‚Äù, which is a strong hint that we should use ranking functions because we need to rank rows within each partition group.The query below finds exactly 3 highest-payed employees regardless of ties:Moreover, based on how ties should be handled, we could pick a different ranking function. Again, details matter!Another common pitfall in SQL interviews is ignoring data duplicates. Although some columns seem to have distinct values in the sample data, candidates are expected to consider all possibilities as if they are working with a real-world dataset. For example, in theemployee_salary table from the previous example, it is possible to have employees sharing the same name.One easy way to avoid potential problems caused by duplicates is to always use ID columns to uniquely identify distinct records.ExampleFind the total salary from all departments for each employee using the employee_salary table.The right solution is to GROUP BY employee_id and calculating the total salary using SUM(employee_salary). If employee names are needed, join with an employee table at the end to retrieve employee name information.The wrong approach is to GROUP BY employee_name.In SQL, any predicates can result in one of the three values: true, false, and NULL, a reserved keyword for unknown or missing data values. Handling NULL datasets can be unexpectedly tricky. In an SQL interview, the interviewer might pay extra attention to whether your solution has handled NULL values. Sometimes it is obvious if a column is not nullable (ID columns, for instance) but for most other columns it is very likely there will be NULL values.I suggest confirming whether key columns in the sample data are nullable and if so, utilize functions such as IS (NOT) NULL, IFNULL, and COALESCE to cover those edge cases.(Want to learn more about how to deal with NULL values? Check out my guide on working with NULL in SQL.)Last but not least ‚Äî keep the communication going during SQL interviews.I have interviewed many candidates who barely talked except when they had questions, which would be okay if they came up with the perfect solution at the end. However, it is generally a good idea to keep up communication during technical interviews. For example, you can talk about your understanding of the question and data, how you plan to approach the problem, why you use some functions versus other alternatives, and what edge cases you are considering.TL;DR:To help you understand how to use these strategies in an actual SQL interview, I will walk you through a sample SQL interview question from end to end in the video below:I hope you find this guide helpful in preparing for your next data science interview.

79,"Key To Driverless Cars, Operational Design Domains (ODD), Here‚Äôs What They Are, Woes Too",https://medium.com/@lance.eliot/key-to-driverless-cars-operational-design-domains-odd-heres-what-they-are-woes-too-a0f1059e0bdb?source=extreme_main_feed---------82-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"Dr. Lance B. Eliot, AI InsiderWhen I got my very first car, I was so excited to be driving my own car that I opted to drive everywhere that I could think of.I drove all throughout my local neighborhood and honked my horn as I drove past the homes of friends of mine. I drove beyond my community and took the freeway to go visit friends that lived in the inner-city areas. I drove down to the beach, parked at the edge of the sand, and took a picture of me and my car, including as a backdrop a dramatic sunset and the rays of the sun glinting off the ocean, adding a picturesque look to my shiny new automobile.The next day, I took some friends up to the snowy mountains. I had made sure to buy snow-chains for my tires and it was my first foray into putting them on and seeing how the car handled on icy roads and in light snowy conditions.Upon returning from the mountains, a good friend suggested we head out to the desert. The mountain trip had involved freezing cold temperatures. Perhaps by going to the dry and hot desert, we‚Äôd be able to unfreeze and gain back our normal body temp. With my still brand-new car, we drove on a somewhat barren highway and headed out to the middle of the desert.Not being content with ‚Äúonly‚Äù having driven in the city, the suburbs, the mountains, and the desert, I decided that the next adventure with my car would be to the forest. So, I packed my camping gear into the car and drove up to the redwoods.As I headed back home, the forest got deluged with quite a rainstorm. Driving out of the woods was a bit tricky as some of the roads began to flood.One other thing that I encountered was a lot of potholes and other marred roadway aspects. Because of the rain on the road, I was not able to readily discern where the cracks and gaps in the asphalt existed.Each of these road trips involved encountering varying kinds of roadway conditions. There are some places that I could drive, and some places that I could not readily drive, often times dictated by the nature of the road or the weather conditions or other factors. And, limited too my own driving ability (I‚Äôm somewhat squeamish about driving on icy roads, which we don‚Äôt get much in Southern California).Let‚Äôs refer to the various roadway conditions as a type of domain, one in which the car and driving is considered operational, and by-design the car ‚Äî and me, the driver, are able to drive presumably under those conditions.You could say that those are Operational Design Domains, usually abbreviated as ODD.Operational Design Domains Defined, Kind OfIn the official parlance of the automotive industry, the way in which you can define the scope and limits of driving are referred to as a ‚Äúdomain‚Äù and commonly indicated as the Operational Design Domain (ODD). Per the IEEE standard known as J3016, here‚Äôs what ODD formally means: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ operating conditions under which a given driving automation system or feature thereof is specifically designed to function, including, but not limited to, environmental, geographical, and time-of-day restrictions, and/or the requisite presence or absence of certain traffic or roadway characteristics.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs a bit of a mouthful.In essence, an ODD is a kind of carve out. Imagine all of the numerous ways in which driving might occur such as in fine weather or bad weather, on bumpy roads or smooth roads, and so on. In that universe of a myriad of driving conditions, you can stake out a subset and declare it to be an ODD.You Can Make Up Your Own ODDsI might define an ODD that consists of smooth roads, absence of rain and the roads must be dry, and there must be high visibility in terms of being able to see around the car. That‚Äôs my declared ODD. It‚Äôs just one such ODD. I might define a second ODD, for which it consists of smooth and bumpy roads, light rain allowed, roads can be wet but not slick, and the visibility can range from high to mediocre.I could continue declaring various ODDs. Each of the ODDs would have some particular set of indicators about what it includes. This might also include exclusions, thus I can probably be clearer about my ODDs by not only saying what it includes but also what it excludes. That being said, the number of exclusions could be rather vast and perhaps exhausting to try and list them all.There is no accepted standard as to what the ODDs are.Think of the number and variety of ODDs that could be declared. By mixing and matching all permutations and combinations of the myriad of factors, you could create an enormous number of ODDs. Besides the roadway aspects, you can state that an ODD is good for daylight but does not encompass night time. Thus, time of day can be a factor. The geographical area can be a factor, such as I might declare my first ODD was intended only for say Los Angeles and no other geographical realm.On and on this can go.Lack of Standards for ODD and AI Self-Driving CarsWhat does this have to do with AI self-driving cars?At the Cybernetic AI Self-Driving Car Institute, we are developing AI software for self-driving cars. For the Level 4 and Level 5 of AI self-driving cars, the nature and use of ODDs is essential. Once the public begins to experience Level 4 and Level 5 AI self-driving cars on the roadways, the ODDs topic is going to hit the big time and be at the forefront of public discussion and discord. Mark my words!I‚Äôd like to first clarify and introduce the notion that there are varying levels of AI self-driving cars. The topmost level is considered Level 5. A Level 5 self-driving car is one that is being driven by the AI and there is no human driver involved.For self-driving cars less than a Level 5, there must be a human driver present in the car. The human driver is currently considered the responsible party for the acts of the car. The AI and the human driver are co-sharing the driving task.Another key aspect of AI self-driving cars is that they will be driving on our roadways in the midst of human driven cars too.Returning to the topic of ODDs, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what they are and why they are going to be so crucial to the advent of AI self-driving cars.Level 4 and ODDs Are EssentialLevel 4 self-driving cars must provide an indication of the ODDs under which they are able to operate.This means that if you are intending to purchase a Level 4 self-driving car, you would be wise to look carefully at the ODDs that the auto maker says are applicable to the automobile you are about to purchase.The reason to scrutinize the ODDs is so that you‚Äôll then know where, when, and under what circumstances your AI self-driving car is going to be able to operate as a self-driving car.According the standard definition for Level 4, once the AI detects that it has reached a point that the driving is no longer within its defined ODDs, the AI is supposed to let the human driver in the car take over or the AI is supposed to pull over, finding hopefully a safe spot to do so, and wait to continue driving until the situation becomes one encompassed by the ODDs of that particular AI self-driving car.Suppose you going along for a spin in your fancy new Level 4 AI self-driving car. It is a wintery day. When you began your joyful journey, the skies were relatively barren of clouds. Sure, it was a cold morning as you got underway, but you didn‚Äôt expect bad weather to occur. Darned if toward lunch time, clouds started coming in fast. With the cold temperatures and the clouds forming, it begins to snow.The AI of the Level 4 self-driving car is presumably able to detect the snowfall, doing so via the sensors of the self-driving car. Because the ODDs indicated the AI is not considered able to drive in snowy conditions, the AI alerts you that you‚Äôll need to take over the driving of the self-driving car. If you refuse or don‚Äôt speak-up, the default will be to pull the self-driving car over to the side of the road at the earliest feasible and hopefully safe spot.Even though you might be able to drive the self-driving car, and you are willing to do in spite of the flakes of snow, and there‚Äôs lots of other car traffic around you that is doing so, your AI is not going to budge one inch. The ODD boundaries have been reached. You would need to take the controls if you didn‚Äôt want to sit there by the side of the road and wait for whenever next the snow cleared up sufficiently that the AI declared it was okay for it to proceed and would continue on the driving journey.I realize you might say that it is a small inconvenience in this case. No big deal, you say, it‚Äôs a minor annoyance that the AI has opted to no longer drive the self-driving car for the moment. For your driving journey, at least it drove you for a substantial part of the time. You can just now take over the driving and finish the trip. Furthermore, if you are able to drive out of the snowy area, you likely can coax the AI to resume driving the self-driving car.But, imagine that you decided to have your Level 4 AI self-driving car take the kids to school that morning. You had put the kids into the self-driving car and sternly instructed the AI to drive them straight to the school. It had done this many times before.Unfortunately, on this particular day, let‚Äôs assume that the snow starts to fall from the sky while midway to the school. The AI announces that it needs either a licensed driver to take over the controls right away or it will pull over to the side of the road. There isn‚Äôt a licensed driver in the self-driving car (you are still at home, awaiting the self-driving car to drop the kids at their school and come back to pick you up to drive you to work). Only your underage children are in the self-driving car. They can‚Äôt legally drive and nor do they know how to drive.Regrettably, they now are going to be sitting in the dormant and roadway-parked AI self-driving car which has found hopefully a safe place to sit out the snow. For most parents, this would be a chilling moment and the time at which they start to have second-thoughts about having gotten that Level 4 AI self-driving car.My overall point is that the ODD‚Äôs of the Level 4 AI self-driving car could consist of a wide variety of inclusions and exclusions. I made things over-simplified by using just the snowy condition. There might instead by a large number of inclusions and exclusions, making it much harder to judge when you might have the AI opt to quit on you. It won‚Äôt be so easy that you‚Äôll readily be able to predict when the exclusions are going to be reached.Ridesharing Impacts Due To ODDsThe other way in which the ODDs will impact you is when you use a ridesharing service.It is predicted that ridesharing services will flock in droves to using AI self-driving cars. This makes a lot of sense for the ridesharing firms to do so.You are getting off work early and decide to take a ridesharing car to get home. Via a mobile app on your smartphone, you summon a ridesharing car, doing so with a company that prides itself on providing all and only AI self-driving cars. A few minutes later, the AI self-driving car comes to the curb and you get into it.Unbeknownst to you, this particular Level 4 AI self-driving car has an ODD that the auto maker and tech firm defined to exclude heavy gusts of winds. Once on the highway, you can see up ahead that the winds are shoving trucks and other carsAll of a sudden, the AI announces that you will need to take over the driving or it will be pulling over to the side of the road momentarily. Why, you ask? The AI responds that the wind speeds are excessive and exceed the defined ODD for this AI self-driving car. Yikes! You had no idea that this ridesharing car had that kind of an ODD. You are irked to no end.Each Auto Maker Can Define Their Own ODDMaking matters murkier, each auto maker can define ODDs in whatever way they might prefer.This means that you won‚Äôt have any apparent or immediate way to determine for any given AI self-driving car make or model what kind of ODD‚Äôs it assumes.It is going to be the wild, wild west of ODDs. A potential boondoggle.There will likely be an ODDs war, perhaps auto maker X says their ODDs are better than auto maker Y. This will go on for quite some time. The usual leap frogging of high-tech and automobiles will of course occur. One year, auto maker X will have a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù ODD set than auto maker Y. Meanwhile, with continued innovation and advancement, the next year the ODD set of auto maker Y might be better than the ODDs of auto maker X. This will continue, over and over.Some Emerging Research Is Helping to Figure Out ODDsIt is handy that some researchers are trying to help us out of this mess, doing so before the mess becomes fully evident.For example, Dr. Krzysztof Czarnecki at the University of Waterloo has been putting together a helpful ontology for ODDs. He organizes the proposed ontology into five key areas, consisting of road structure, road users, animals, other obstacles, and environmental conditions. He defines an Operational Road Environmental Model (OREM), consisting of relevant assumptions about the road environment, and then crafts Operational World Models (OWMs) that consist of OREMs with one or more subject vehicle models. This is the kind of rigor we need to get established for ODDs.If we could get ODDs into a more structured and agreed form and format, it would certainly make the publication and comparison of them a lot easier and more readily understood.I‚Äôll toss another idea out there and see what you think of it.Suppose the auto makers and tech firms were able to compartmentalize their AI systems to correspond to the elements of a defined and standardized ODD. Besides allowing for comparing auto maker X to auto maker Y in terms of their Level 4 AI self-driving cars, we might be able to do something else too.It might be possible to have auto maker X and auto maker Y offer to do a deal whereby there might elements of each of their respective ODDs that they could exchange with each other. Suppose that one has dealt with handling high winds, while the other one has focused on dealing with snowy conditions. They might opt to share with each other, in which case auto maker X now gets the snowy condition added to its ODD and the auto maker Y gets the high winds condition added to its ODD.I say this with a grain of salt. A really big grain of salt.The odds are that the hardware and the software of the AI systems of the auto maker X and auto maker Y are so vastly different that it is unlikely they could just offer up their respective components of handling high winds and of snowy conditions to each other. Instead, they each would have something extremely proprietary that works only on their own setup of hardware and AI software.ConclusionWill we be able to standardize and then possibly amalgamate ODD‚Äôs of Level 4 AI self-driving cars? The jury is still out on this.Admittedly, it is a stretch right now to think that it could happen. There is too much momentum of each auto maker or tech firm doing their own proprietary ODDs and there is little or no incentive to do otherwise. As I‚Äôve mentioned, if things get out-of-hand, it could be that regulators step into the morass and offer some kind of sticks and carrots to get ODDs to become more manageable.I‚Äôve not said much herein about Level 5 AI self-driving cars.In theory, a Level 5 AI self-driving car is a complete set of all of the possible ODDs that would exist in a more scattered manner for Level 4 AI self-driving cars. In other words, the Level 5 is not supposed to have any curtailing limits, other than there is no off-roading capability required and also that the driving task must be something that a human driver could have managed (if a human could not have driven in the circumstance, the Level 5 definition says that there should not be an expectation that the AI could).Some believe that to get to a Level 5, you should first make Level 4 AI self-driving cars. You could then presumably tie together all of the various ODDs over time that you crafted for the Level 4‚Äôs and make your way to a Level 5. There are those that eschew such an approach and say that you should forget about doing any of the Level 4‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt get mired into the itsy-bitsy ODD‚Äôs. Instead, aim for the whole enchilada. Aim for the Level 5.If indeed the Level 4‚Äôs are quickly replaced by Level 5‚Äôs, it would likely lessen the impact of the ODDs wars and fractionalization. People would barely have had time to complain about the confusion over the myriad of ODDs, and presumably be quieted and more satisfied once they rode in a Level 5. For those that believe we are going to have Level 5‚Äôs on the heels of Level 4‚Äôs, the ODD topic is a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù to them. Those ODD‚Äôs will be like yesterday‚Äôs fad that came and went. Forget about it, they would assert.I‚Äôve said and written many times that a true Level 5 AI self-driving car is like a moonshot. I hope you can now see why I say this. The Level 5 has to be able to handle all of the permutations and combinations of all of the ODD‚Äôs that you can think of. That‚Äôs a lot to deal with. I doubt that the time gap between Level 4‚Äôs and Level 5‚Äôs is going to be as swift as some pundits claim.I applaud those that are forging a means toward an ontology of ODDs.We need to do more to get the ODDs matter on-track before it becomes a train that goes off the tracks. For those that are standing on the railroad tracks right now, it takes a lot of vision to see what‚Äôs going to happen miles and miles away, into the future.Imagine if the railroads had not agreed to a common means of laying track, and upon reaching Promontory Summit in Utah on May 10, 1869, they would have not been able to drive that final golden spike into tying together the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific Railroads. That‚Äôs the kind of progress that can occur when you get your standards act together.Let‚Äôs do the same for ODDs.For free podcast of this story, visit: http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/websiteThe podcasts are also available on Spotify, iTunes, iHeartRadio, etc.More info about AI self-driving cars, see: www.ai-selfdriving-cars.guruTo follow Lance Eliot on Twitter: @LanceEliotFor my Forbes.com blog, see: https://forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/Copyright 2019 Dr. Lance EliotWRITTEN BY"
80,Robotics Can Solve The Construction Skills Shortage-If Handled Properly (Part One),https://medium.com/swlh/robotics-can-solve-the-construction-skills-shortage-if-handled-properly-part-one-df9c4fce08c6?source=extreme_main_feed---------83-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"The construction industry is in desperate need of an automated shake-up. With a serious skills shortage, limited resources, and outdated data collection practices, automation and robotics could save the industry from stagnation.But digitization is coming for construction. Already robots are entering development sites, offering new capabilities that are humanly impossible, or simply providing the accuracy and continuity that are so crucial in the industry. Part one of this article will focus on robotics companies that are upgrading on-site capabilities to address the skills shortage that threatens to suffocate the construction industry.Similar to the mining and oil and gas industries, construction has been sluggish when it comes to automation, although advanced technologies such as laser scanners and smart sensors are widely utilized on-site, and digitization is spreading through the industry. But just as these other industries have begun to embrace automation, construction is beginning to transition away from ineffective manual processes towards a more data-driven approach. ‚ÄúThe construction industry is full of information stored on scraps of paper,‚Äù says Stuart Maggs, CEO of Scaled Robotics, ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt learn from previous work because we can‚Äôt compare notes-the ability to learn from data is incredibly valuable.‚Äù Digitization has grown more popular in construction, particularly Building Information Modeling (BIM) used to visualize construction sites and projects in 3D, but there are still simply not enough skilled workers on-site to implement plans effectively.As an industry that consists largely of dangerous, repetitive and unpleasant tasks, robots have a lot of scope to take some pressure off the construction industry and bring further digitization and innovation.Scaled Robotics‚Äô robot collects on-site data for their BIM software, navigating around the construction site using waypoints set in advance to drive semi-autonomously. This data is then dynamically added to a map, classified and color-coded according to its level of completion, and deviations such as warped beams are presented visually in a heatmap. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just impossible to do all this measurement, a surveyor would usually only check 5‚Äì10% of the elements,‚Äù says Maggs, ‚Äúso this [robotics and digitization] allows you to easily verify that what you intended to build is actually being built.‚Äù Robotics in construction then is augmenting human labor by ‚Äúgiving the site manager extra abilities that they didn‚Äôt have before,‚Äù says Maggs, but it is also enhancing the digitization already within the industry, feeding much more granular data into more detailed models. As Maggs puts it, ‚Äúwe either innovate and bring in new abilities or the industry just stagnates and employment becomes even more of an issue.‚ÄùThe crucial juncture between digital models and the construction site is a sticking point however, and translating 3D modeling and data analysis into the real world has its challenges. ‚ÄúNearly three quarters of U.S. construction firms use BIM to resolve conflicts before work begins in the field,‚Äù says Dusty Robotics cofounder and CEO Tessa Lau, ‚Äúhowever, transferring those construction blueprints out into the field still involves several manual steps, each of which introduces more risk of error.‚Äù Simple errors when starting a project can skew an entire building, due to inaccurate analog equipment (measuring tapes and spirit levels, for example), rounding measurements to the nearest whole number, or even ‚Äòeyeballing‚Äô lines and areas when planning or laying foundations. Robots can eliminate these errors by transferring data-driven blueprints directly to the site (Dusty Robotics‚Äô FieldPrinter outlines digital plans on-site in ink, as opposed to hand-drawn chalk) but it also allows skilled laborers ‚Äúto do their jobs more efficiently, with less wear and tear on the human body,‚Äù says Lau.Interestingly, Lau refers to their robot as a ‚Äúpower tool‚Ä¶ just like a forklift or an impact driver,‚Äù which seems to suggest that tools (even if they are powered by data rather than manual labor) are more attractive that pure robotics within the industry-regardless, ‚Äú91% of U.S. builders have difficulty attracting or retaining skilled labor‚Äù according to Lau, and she argues that ‚Äúthe only construction companies that will survive the next decade are those that embrace robotics.‚Äù Working with the workforce is critical then, as the only way for robotics to gain traction is to ensure that those working with the technology understand and accept it. ‚ÄúEvery tech company has a responsibility to think about how the people being affected by this technology will react, and how it‚Äôs going to impact on their lives,‚Äù says Maggs.Perhaps presenting robotics as a (very powerful) construction tool, rather than something that could replace jobs, is the best way to ensure that adoption does not stagnate as soon as robots enter the workforce.Robotics has seen a massive increase in interest in almost every industry that relies on heavily process-driven or manual work. Construction could well be defined by these characteristics, and facing ‚Äúincreasing demand for housing and office space, and increasing building complexity due to environmental concerns,‚Äù means that automation is vital to the industry, says Lau.As the industry warms up to the idea of using automation to augment existing workers, and those working on-site feel that robots ‚Äúgive them super-powers‚Äù says Lau, construction will change dramatically over the next five years. Just as manufacturing is now a completely changed industry from where it was only twenty years ago, the dull, dirty, and dangerous work that makes up a majority of construction could soon be strongly supported by robots.Originally published at https://www.forbes.com.WRITTEN BY"

But they‚Äòre masters at hiding their inner secrets from the outside world, both on- and offline.Oh, the faithful folks who still haven‚Äôt abandoned Windows! Welcome to the world of messy hair, thick tinted spectacles and navy-blue sweaters that look like they‚Äôve been picked up from a nearby thrift shop, bathed in pizza dough and then washed until they‚Äôre clean enough to not lose that pizza attire.Or, in other words, welcome to the world of Notepad++: A lightweight tool for MS Windows which promises to save the environment by making your computer less busy. It‚Äôs true, the users of Notepad++ care about their CPU-space as much as about the environment! There‚Äôs just one thing they care about even more and it‚Äôs ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî pizza.They have no idea which file they put where, or what they called that variable fifty lines earlier in the code. And for reasons that nobody understands, they expect their text editor to take care of all the mess.Welcome to Sublime Text ‚Äî the text editor that cuts through all the clutter. With so many popups and instant switching even between modified and unsaved files, this is the editor that those people use who think their messiness isn‚Äôt only efficient in their heads, but also in their projects.Your typical Atom user is the friendliest person on earth. Always sporting pastel-colored sweaters and bringing breakfast for the whole office, what‚Äôs not to like about them?They‚Äôre always there when a helping hand is needed, but they never ask for praise. Always self-sacrificing, if they‚Äôve achieved something, they let somebody else collect the prize money. But everyone knows that nothing would work without them. They‚Äôre the glue of every team, the knuckle of every book. Welcome to your average Atom-user.Their shoes are squeaky clean, their hair is neatly groomed, and on their desk there is not one speck of dust. They‚Äôre not unfriendly, but they‚Äôre the person who spots the hair in the soup before everyone else. Everything needs to be perfect; there is no space for unwanted debris in their life.The same goes for their style of coding. Never ‚Äî and I repeat, never! ‚Äî would they write their name under a piece of code that contains even the tiniest of bugs. That‚Äôs the user of Visual Studio Code: Debugging is made so easy, you don‚Äôt even need a compiler any more. A must-have for every bug-averse coder.Green beans, coffee beans, NetBeans. The holy triad!Your average NetBeans user is obsessed with code and beans. But especially beans. A day cannot start without a holy coffee bean brew in their favorite coffee shop. After that, they‚Äôll stay for the rest of the day, frantically hacking around on their keyboard.They‚Äôre of the anxious type. Always scared of losing out. Dressed slightly below casual (those jeans really need a wash), always a little jittery and unfocused, they don‚Äôt really need coffee to wake them up. They need coffee to calm themselves down. And code, of course.Some people are born engineers. Do a task once? Boring. Do it twice? Automate!That‚Äôs your average user of TextMate: An engineer with OS X (because that‚Äôs the only system where it runs). The quiet person in the corner of the office.

The person who doesn‚Äôt socialize a lot, but would always help you out on a problem.The only downside? Their work often goes unnoticed. It can take years before they get some recognition. That‚Äôs your average user of TextMate.There‚Äôs always that one person in your group of friends who‚Äôs obsessed about every new productivity hack. Your average user of IntelliJ is that friend.They‚Äôre the one who put butter in their coffee a few years back, practices the extremest forms intermittent fasting and drinks protein shakes at 4 A.

If you offer them a piece of cake, they‚Äôll gladly take it ‚Äî but only to be eaten in five hours, when fasting is over.Their dress style is functional above all, and so is their haircut.

Vim is for those who like to learn a structure, then never let go of it. Vim is for the geeks of geeks.Emacs is the go-to editor for all nerds who haven‚Äôt reached geek status. This is the kind of nerd who has a slight dislike for graphical user interfaces but can‚Äôt go without them. The kind of nerd who likes to code, but still wants their text editor to be capable of more than code.The nerdy person in the corner who always drinks ros√© wine. The person who, when asked a black-or-white question, will answer with an elaborate gray. The person who gets up at 11 a.m., not because they were sleeping before, but because they were too busy thinking about the optimal time to get up.You suck at making decisions? Use Emacs.Your average SpaceMacs user is a teacher in academia. Elegantly dressed in worn-out clothes. With a fresh cactus in a smelly office. A beaming smile with tired eyes. And a laugh that is as weird as it is infectious.They‚Äôre a person who wants to quit with the Editor War. A person who is not as indecisive as an Emacs user, but not as decidedly geeky as a Vimmer.

Then they rose from the ashes.Martyrdom: it‚Äôs a common trope.We‚Äôll set aside the extravagant fees these guys charge. We‚Äôll ignore the fact that many of them don‚Äôt even own the cars they are posing in front of. We can even disregard that they aren‚Äôt living the lives that they‚Äôre selling.Doesn‚Äôt it bother you just a bit that everything they are promoting revolves around wealth? Happiness, achievement, security, contentment ‚Äî everything we seek, suddenly attached to shiny objects. That kind of marketing preys on people‚Äôs insecurities.Do you really want to worship an avatar built on tacky sports cars and jewelry? You already know those things won‚Äôt make you happy.Every flashy car you buy will be one-upped by the guy down the street. You‚Äôll be outshined by the person with a slightly nicer watch. It is an endless game of escalation. But, hey, if you truly need a car that will break the sound barrier ‚Äî have at it, 007.To the rest of you, remember: Seeking status and looking rich is an expensive game to play. Participation isn‚Äôt required.The men and women I know who have all of those fancy things aren‚Äôt any happier than regular folks. Typically, it‚Äôs quite the opposite.Take it from a guy who has nothing to sell you: there are healthier models for happiness and contentment. Skip the status game.We invited our extended family.We had a live cover band, high-end catering, a harpist. In total, we spent more than $20,000 on our wedding. Thousands more were spent on a ring.The wedding lasted one night. Today ‚Äî we are no longer married.The ring is now useless (to me at least). This isn‚Äôt a knock on my ex. We are fine. I wish her the very best. I‚Äôm just pointing out that, in a country with a 50% divorce rate, we might be spending too much on weddings.Not only is it illogical, but it also puts a lot of pressure on couples. Or maybe it‚Äôs illogical for two people to stand in front of a crowd and vow to spend their lives together. Forgive my cynicism.I want you to be happy. I want your marriage to last. If you want your dream wedding, have at it. Just remember: we tend to be most disappointed with the things that we attach high expectations to.Your wedding should be about love. It shouldn‚Äôt drain your soul. You shouldn‚Äôt be crying every day from stress and taking out loans to finance it.If you want to spend a fortune on this endeavor, I‚Äôd spend it on the honeymoon instead. Your money will go much further. And it will be a lot more fun.There‚Äôs a damn good reason that second weddings tend to be less expensive.I have a dishwasher to run. There‚Äôs also a pile of clean clothes that I need to fold (I despise folding).However, I did the important things that needed to be done: I exercised, did lawn work, and I‚Äôm getting my writing in now.Procrastination isn‚Äôt always bad, particularly if it is in lieu of other priorities. But when it‚Äôs things of consequence?

It‚Äôs how you found yourself cornered between either a 15-hour study session or a failed class.Our drive for instant gratification steers us away from being uncomfortable. This is due to deficiencies in our ‚Äúlizard brain‚Äù ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt optimized to perform in the lap of first-world luxuries.A caveman had no reason to break his mammoth meat up into 5 smaller meals to help his metabolism. A beach body was the last thing on his mind. We don‚Äôt struggle for basic survival. This change has put us at odds with ourselves.We let tasks pile up until they become too much. It becomes easier to just flush them all away and start fresh: we abandon the gym plan, take the bad grade, drop the class.If our sense of urgency only kicks in when water is around our ankles, how can we ever hope to stop a leak?Few words are more dangerous than ‚Äúlater‚Äù.Just so that I‚Äôm not being too vague, here is my favorite trick to help with procrastination.It‚Äôs called the five-second rule. If you feel stuck, try counting down from 5 to 0. Then watch, as you bounce out of your couch, roll out of bed, often before you get to 0.The countdown taps into our conscious mind. It creates a sense of urgency. It‚Äôs a time bomb to laziness.WRITTEN BY"
83,How to Cope with the End of the World,https://medium.com/s/how-to-cope-with-the-end-of-the-world/how-to-cope-with-the-end-of-the-world-2520ef9d3dbc?source=extreme_main_feed---------86-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"I‚Äô
m writing this on a train. Looking out the window, I reflexively scout for raised, defensible structures away from main roads. I‚Äôve done this since I was 10, planning for when the time came. I thought a lot, then, about when the time came. I planned how, when the nuclear strike began, my parents, five siblings, and I would initially squeeze into the only room in the house two doors away from the outside, how long we‚Äôd last with a bathtub full of water to drink, and how soon we should strike out for somewhere safer.Imagining the apocalypse is something agreeably drastic and cleansing to do with your fear. But it doesn‚Äôt survive contact with reality. When my school closed for a couple of days because of Chernobyl, we treated the potential wind-borne radiation as a snow day and spent much of it playing in the fields.There‚Äôs something in the air, right now. As the far right are normalized by mainstream media and toxic hard-men consolidate their power, it has become clear that the ‚Äúend of history,‚Äù when capitalist democracy everywhere was just a matter of time, was itself a historic anomaly. And those postwar decades, when states actively and successfully shaped capitalism into something that served people and not the other way around, seem to have slipped from our grasp. Historians and political scientists warn that the tide of history has turned, that the future now flows from the east, and that it is very much like the authoritarian past.Elsewhere, we leapfrog not from agrarianism into the high-tech, high-skills economy, but from feudalism into sleazy oligarchy. Silicon Valley startups are emerging with business models that bake in the assumption that democracy has maybe 20 years left to run, and they are attracting serious backers and serious money. We are collectively losing faith in our future at the precise moment humanity as a whole needs to think decades and centuries ahead.At critical moments, the dark fantasies we indulge in reveal our imagined enemies. In the 1960s, British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss noticed that some English postwar novels featured ‚Äúcozy catastrophes,‚Äù where triffids/endless winter/viruses and the government largely wiped out the working class. Postwar British life, with the National Health Service and expansion of education and the welfare state, had disrupted the class system in ways the already privileged found hard to accept. So some of them just imagined the barbarous masses away. Jo Walton describes the bittersweet aftermath:The survivors wander around an empty city, usually London, regretting the lost world of restaurants and symphony orchestras. There‚Äôs an elegiac tone, so much that was so good has passed away. Nobody ever regrets football matches or carnivals. Then they begin to rebuild civilization along better, more scientific lines.The British postwar cozy catastrophe is the missing link between the zombie movies we love today and early 20th-century high-modernist horror of cities, mass transit, and popular culture. It arcs all the way back to the millenarian thinking that flourished during the Black Death as an ecstatic imagining of impending doom. Millenarianism pops up everywhere humans feel oppressed. It imagines that the religious, political, and social wrongs of the current order will be washed away in a cataclysm that spares only the righteous ‚Äî who then build a new utopia.Pockets of the millenarian disease are spreading, and this time, they‚Äôre coming after democracy. Chris Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower, said Steve Bannon wanted to use far-right propaganda to destroy society before building it up again in the image of the far, far right. In the UK, some ‚Äúlexiteers,‚Äù leftists who support Brexit, foresee an economic and political failure out of which the phoenix of pure socialism will surely rise. Their unlikely allies are the disaster capitalists who usher in nationalist crises, confident they‚Äôll turn a profit on it. After the revolution, it will all be different, and the select few will start again, this time along scientific/socialist/racial purity lines.‚ÄúDrinking the Kool-Aid‚Äù means downing artificially sweetened poison in a ritualistic act of collective suicide.In the Phillipines, Turkey, Russia, Hungary, and Venezuela, the hard men insist democracy is a pretty sham that we use to usher in different flavors of corrupt authoritarianism. Echoing Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs 1980s embrace of finance capitalism, they insist ‚Äúthere is no alternative‚Äù to disaster and no alternative to them. Duterte, Erdogan, Putin, Orban, Maduro‚Äîall offer the dark seduction of Armageddon while holding themselves out as the only thing standing between us and it. There‚Äôs a reason both the old, hard left and the newish hard right believe Putin is the answer to the questions they think no one else is asking.It feels ‚Äústrong‚Äù to think absolutely everything is shit and to imagine smashing it all, going out in a blaze of glory to a background of dawning horror on the faces of everyone who didn‚Äôt enrich you or valorize you or give you sex. But we shouldn‚Äôt mistake this for any more than what it is; an adolescent jerk-off fantasy shaped by criminal politicians into national suicide cults.They want us all to go down with them. We refuse.There is a kind of postapocalyptic fiction that gets how serious this all is but doesn‚Äôt start with an orgasmic death drive that tidies everyone difficult or messy out of the picture. It even articulates a positive potential future.Kim Stanley Robinson‚Äôs novel New York 2140 imagines an Earth where the sea level has risen by a couple of hundred meters, destroying countries and lives and playing havoc with coastal property values. It describes our current future; millions have perished, and the 400 richest people on the planet own half its wealth. New York in 2140 is a hip, woke Venice, full of domestic refugees trying to stay afloat in a sinking world. Its people are inventive and energetic, even though each successive technological mitigation for climate change is gobbled up by financial capitalism‚Äôs metastatic growth.Robinson explains a lot of why this is the way it is. He dramatizes how corporate finance formulae and company accounting rules discount the future and disincentivize action to arrest climate change. Discount rates are like compound interest rates in reverse: The higher we set the discount rate, the less we think our assets will be worth in the future. If you run a country or a planet like a business, the further into the future you look, the higher the risk to your assets and returns, so the less they are worth as time goes on. Or, as Frank Ackerman puts it, high discount rates make it hard to see the costs we are imposing on the future.Capitalism discounts the future as it destroys it. This is as obvious as air and just as hard to see.The sociologist Erik Olin Wright, writing about whether to tame or blow up capitalism, says, ‚ÄúNeoliberalism is an ideology, backed by powerful political forces, rather than a scientifically accurate account of the actual limits we face in making the world a better place.‚ÄùHe‚Äôs right. How we discount the future is a political choice that privileges us, today, over future generations. Our slavish reverence for the peculiar form of capitalism we have unleashed is nothing more than a fairy tale we tell as we feed our children to the big, bad wolf.New York 2140 is no fairy tale; it‚Äôs a counter-story that tells the unshiny truth while casting bread crumbs of hope. It follows a colorful band of characters well placed to influence events. (It‚Äôs a marvelous read, with cheeky urchins tracking Melville‚Äôs ghost, hackers of little clue, engineering accomplishments, doughty public servants, unusual couplings, and polar bears loose on an airship.) A lesser novel would have had its feisty protagonists turn the ship of state. New York 2140 does something much smarter and harder. It shows how we might all course-correct together, eventually, even as we continue to cock things up.Our ability to think clearly about the future is clouded not just by metastatic capitalism underpinned by arbitrary accounting rules, but also by our individual and collective denial of mortality in a culture where dying mostly happens offstage; the end of ‚Äúthe end of history‚Äù and the apparent fact of democracy in retreat, globally; the old saw that it‚Äôs easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism; and the dawning knowledge that the future will be worse than the present, and that it‚Äôs our fault, and that the reasons we can‚Äôt change what we are doing seem fundamental to who and what we are.The future is becoming unbearable. Is it true that all we have left are consequences?The British writer Greg Norminton (whose novel The Devil‚Äôs Highway follows an old Roman road from ancient times into the climate-changed future) says the consolation of feeling rooted in places that will flourish after our deaths is slipping:We don‚Äôt realise, on the whole, how much the continuity of a place matters to us, how consoling it is to feel, as people have for most of history, that however short our lives may be, the world as we knew it will outlast us. Whereas on current trajectories, many if not most of us will have to suffer the psychological dislocation of abrupt changes. I think the intuition of what is coming operates as a kind of anticipatory grief.There is a high psychological cost of our collective eyes-wide-shut despair to the people who truly understand what is coming. David Buckel, the LGBTQ and environmental activist who burned himself to death in Brooklyn‚Äôs Prospect Park, said his ‚Äúearly death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.‚Äù But for most of us, the wrongness and weirdness of climate change are just background buzz on a frequency we can‚Äôt quite tune in to.Glen David Gold, pointing out how the weather just seems broken, says:The sky looks wrong. The wind comes from the wrong direction. The clouds are forming patterns I‚Äôve never seen. We‚Äôve had what sliver of the average rainfall this year? Maybe 4%? I feel that we as a species recognize this. It‚Äôs impossible to be a creature with a heartbeat and not recognize that something that should fundamentally never be out of sorts IS out of sorts. And that we‚Äôve done it. And the response, if you accept this, is a kind of shame and anger and depression and mourning, solastalgia.Perhaps the strength of climate denialism comes from the energy it takes to deny not just evidence, but our deepest intuition. Something is terribly wrong, but many people‚Äôs instinct is to run and hide away in a mythical past.But think about the relief that comes when the deadline is imminent and there‚Äôs no choice but to do the work, or that strange euphoria that broke out in Britain when World War II was finally declared. Nobody loves a phony war. Everyone thinks they‚Äôll be hero in the real thing, once it at last begins.Yet it turns out it‚Äôs not just impending catastrophe, but the idea of heroism itself that‚Äôs the problem.My favorite postapocalyptic novel is George R. Stewart‚Äôs 1951 Earth Abides. In it, scientist Isherwood Williams (nicknamed Ish) survives a plague and eventually starts a new family and community in the ruins of suburban California. His hope for the future is wholly invested in a child who is intellectually curious, like him, and who might be able to revive some of the old ways and technologies. It‚Äôs an observant and reflective novel, full of the ‚Äúhow stuff would probably work‚Äù thinking that makes science fiction the true literature of ideas.Ish starts out as a scientist-savior of humanity, figuring there is just enough time to raise a generation to turn back the clock to before the disaster. But he ultimately has to make his peace with the fact that civilization as he knew it is dead, there will be no heroic rescue, no going back, and the people around him are mostly fine with that.The 1950s may have been the last decade we could complacently believe the Ecclesiastes (1:4) maxim that ‚Äúmen come and go, but earth abides,‚Äù but Stewart‚Äôs basic message is correct.The people who come after us don‚Äôt have to do better than us, or think well of us, for them to be essentially okay. And us all throwing a big ‚Äúlet‚Äôs blow it all up‚Äù hissy fit because we fucked up and we can‚Äôt bear to look at it is just teenage nihilism that we need to grow out of already. Coming to terms with what we have done means dumping the egotistical death drive of the mass shooter or far-right politician and gathering the maturity to look our individual and collective deaths straight in the eye and say, ‚ÄúOkay, we get it now. We get it. It‚Äôs not about us.‚ÄùHave you ever stood in a crowded place like a town square or an airport meet-and-greet and thought, ‚ÄúEvery single person here is going to die‚Äù? Morbid, eh? More of us should do it.I live in an early Victorian terraced house in the UK. It‚Äôs never been a tenement, so probably a hundred people have called it home in the almost two centuries it‚Äôs been standing. Nearly all of them are dead. The people are already born who‚Äôll live there when I‚Äôm dead. The head of this country‚Äôs anachronistic state has already been born who I‚Äôll never see on the throne and to whom I‚Äôll seem as old as someone born in the 1930s seems to me.We‚Äôre all going to die. The morning will come when those who have loved us put on dark clothes and cry and get on with the rest of their lives, seeing movies we‚Äôd have loved, depending on gadgets that now seem to us ridiculously unnecessary. Our deaths matter to us and those who love us, but they don‚Äôt fundamentally matter.Once, while my husband was deployed to Afghanistan, I asked him on the phone if he was doing okay about someone we knew who‚Äôd recently been killed. ‚ÄúOh, you know,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou know,‚Äù and quoted his regiment‚Äôs unofficial mantra:Everything matters. Nothing matters terribly.The soldier‚Äôs death mattered very, very much to him, and (not but) he and others were nonetheless carrying on their shared purpose. Otherwise, what had been the point of any of it?What will outlive us, individually? Plastic. Perhaps some genes. The bacteria that act as a species-level enabler for everything we are. Some ideas, maybe, or songs, stories, pictures, the memories of us others hold, until they go, memorials like a community flower bed or a named scholarship, for a while, anyway. Less concretely: ways of being, a fitness for the world that those who flourish pass unremarked to their offspring via the epigenetics of love ‚Äî the sunny inverse of patterns of trauma and abuse transmitted through the body, even unto the third generation. Predation.And our species? Buildings and bones, maybe. Our nuclear waste and the warning signs we hope people of our deep future, or other species altogether, will decrypt. Snatches of radio-transmitted voices slipping through the vacuum of space. Perhaps some bacterial payload we‚Äôll launch in a decade or so, trying to seed life on other planets, even in other solar systems. Or just the anomalous levels of carbon dioxide and methane in our atmosphere that will reveal, for a time, that complex forms of life were here.Pride and despair are two sides of the same coin. Our collective denial and despair about the future we have built is preventing us from cracking on and sorting it out. We need to get over ourselves. The world we know will end, in both small and big ways. We ourselves will end. But that doesn‚Äôt matter, terribly.Our mortality is the greatest enabler we have of positive, ongoing change, if only we can face it, if only we can understand that we don‚Äôt get to see the end of the movie, because, if what we do works, the movie won‚Äôt have to end. We‚Äôre not the protagonists. We‚Äôre just the foreshadowing. We need to hold the knowledge of our own deaths up to the light and turn it around to see each shining facet, then take the certainty that we are both finite and imperfect deep down inside of us‚Äîand put it to work.Along with pride, we cannot indulge in despair. The duty of hope means despair is unethical.The apocalypse is already here. It‚Äôs just unevenly distributed.Ask a Syrian from Aleppo, a Palestinian child, a refugee at the UK‚Äôs Yarls Wood detention center, a schoolteacher in the Donbass, or a relative of those who perished in Grenfell Tower in West London.Mohsin Hamid‚Äôs novel Exit West, about a Syria-like conflict in a world where portals unpredictably appear and transport people across the planet, shows just how strange and wrong it is that, via the internet, we can see and be seen by almost anyone, but in a world where goods, services, information, and capital flow like water, it‚Äôs people that are trapped.Exit West is the opposite of a 1950s cozy catastrophe that gives the chosen a fresh start. It‚Äôs explicitly about the fact that catastrophe is here, is gathering speed, and that it is pure chance who is caught up in it. As the novel‚Äôs characters disperse around the world via the portals, London and San Francisco must come to terms with an apocalypse that refuses to stay within the confines of the 9:00 news. Hamid‚Äôs novel is neither cozy nor placidly reassuring, but it has within it the stirrings of hope:The locality around Marin seemed to be rousing itself from a profound and collective low in those days. It has been said that depression is a failure to imagine a plausible desirable future for oneself, and, not just in Marin, but in the whole region, in the Bay Area, and in many other places, too, places both near and far, the apocalypse appeared to have arrived and yet it was not apocalyptic, which is to say that while the changes were jarring they were not the end, and life went on, and people found things to do and ways to be and people to be with, and plausible desirable futures began to emerge, unimaginable previously, but not unimaginable now, and the result was something not unlike relief.Those of us lucky enough to have our families and homes intact, minimal health problems, and some kind of political agency do not get to throw up our hands and say it‚Äôs too hard and sooooo depressing. Or to naively trust in there being a ‚Äúright side‚Äù of history that will ultimately prevail.We need to put down our vain and complacent hero stories so we can understand that we are not the heroes of the story of humanity and that the story is not going to end when we do.We are going to die, and not in a blaze of nihilistic glory, and in the meantime there is the work. The work is what we have.‚ÄúI am the green shoot asking for the flower‚Äù‚Äî John HewittHistory isn‚Äôt forged by great men, not by swollen-balled autocrats and peacocking shitgibbons. It‚Äôs made by people, lots and lots of people. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called structural change.One of the greatest novels ever written is about a gifted young woman who yearns for the chance to ‚Äúreconcile self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self.‚Äù In a pietistic, self-abnegating kind of way, the heroine is like adolescents who crave an angry and ultimate truth. But Middlemarch‚Äôs Dorothea Brooke is forced by life‚Äôs merely average-sized woes to put aside her vanity. She is one of the first fictional protagonists to truly learn and grow. Middlemarch famously ends with George Eliot‚Äôs reflection:[F]or the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.That needs to be us. The ones in unvisited tombs who did what was morally essential because it was right and because we were able, no more and no less.There is no getting around this: Obscene inequality is wrecking social and political order. Inequality within societies is an extinction-level event. Capitalism itself must change if democracy is to survive‚Äîindeed, if any basically just and humane civilization is to flourish. Climate change is just as big a ‚Äúsuper-wicked problem‚Äù and deeply linked to our chosen, rapacious forms of capitalism.We need to think and act radically. ‚ÄúSensible centrism‚Äù cannot even see the whole of the problem, let alone fix it.We will succeed at defending democracy by doubling down on it, by offering something bigger and better to believe in than the fear of the power vertical. Fear only motivates people to say no. Social media is okay for negative campaigns but ineffective at building coalitions. We need to do that hard work ourselves, both in person and by putting technology in the service of both deep and nimble ties.We will continue to experience regressive revolutions. We will have to devote whole lifetimes to quelling them.Lessons will not stay learned. China has already forgotten the lesson of dictators who can‚Äôt be removed. Russia, Hungary, Turkey, the Philippines, and others have forgotten that authoritarianism always ends in tears. Everywhere we see the reopening of settled questions: Is racism bad? Do trade wars damage economies? Is the Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement worth protecting? But this time with the added twist that these questions are largely asked in bad faith. We will just have to keep hammering the answers home.Just pointing out bad things will not be enough. Life is not a Richard Curtis movie, where calling out the problem basically fixes it. Problems will not disappear when we articulate them in a beautiful and heartfelt way. (Note to self.) Our shared Anglo culture is not nearly as instrumental as it thinks. Words are just words. Talk is just talk. Journalism is only ever the essential first step.We will need to work relentlessly on evidence gathering, litigation, enforcement of rules, and campaigning to put and keep the corrupt out of elected office. In the United States, the UK, and elsewhere, there are people in office today who need to be in orange jumpsuits tomorrow. This time, there must be no clemency. People of bad faith cashed that check a dozen times over. From now on, it bounces.All of this is the opposite of naive. Naivety is thinking you will win by building walls, reneging on deals, insulting your allies, and going it alone in a volatile, zero-sum game world. Naivety is the denialism that thinks the future will be as you imagine the past.By learning from those a decade ahead of us in resistance, we will hack the power vertical. Our horizontal ties will build trust, make us less fearful, and help others to build courage and resist authoritarianism in every way they can.We don‚Äôt need to cut problems down to size but appreciate their scale, complexity, and wickedness and find nonobvious allies to work on them. Building coalitions is organizationally effective and forces us to see issues the way others do, helping both to find and sell novel solutions and more deeply bed down progressive change. Horizontal power bases change the world, because when you‚Äôre in one, you will never be alone.‚ÄúIdentity politics‚Äù is human politics. There is no zero-sum game of freedoms and rights. And as they keep opening up new fronts in the culture wars, we will keep challenging ourselves to learn and grow and insist on everyone‚Äôs basic equality and worth. It‚Äôs not easy. It‚Äôs a process. But with curious minds and open hearts, ‚Äúwe‚Äù will keep getting bigger and stronger. As Mohsin Hamid has said, each equality expansion helps: ‚ÄúAs you expand each equality, men and women, gay and straight, it helps the other equalities, too.‚ÄùThere is so, so much to do. It will be hard, and we won‚Äôt get there in our lifetimes. The least we must achieve is to pass just enough forward to those who‚Äôll come after us and do things we can barely conceive of. And maybe, this time, the planet won‚Äôt get saved at the end of the disaster movie, but at the very beginning.WRITTEN BYABOUT THIS COLUMN"

85,Window Functions In Pandas,https://towardsdatascience.com/window-functions-in-pandas-eaece0421f7?source=extreme_main_feed---------88-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"S
QL has a neat feature called window functions. By the way, you should definitely know how to work with these in SQL if you are looking for a data analyst job. Pandas (with a little bit of legwork) allows us to do the same things. Let‚Äôs see how.Window functions allow us to perform an operation with a given row‚Äôs data and data from another row that is a specified number of rows away ‚Äî this ‚Äúnumber of rows away value‚Äù is called the window.For example, let‚Äôs say you have 10 days of stock prices:Window functions allow us to perform computations among the values of a specified column. For example, I might want to compare today‚Äôs stock price with yesterday‚Äôs ‚Äî then I would want a window of ‚Äú1‚Äù looking backwards. A window function allows us to do that. If on the other hand, I want to compare today‚Äôs price with the price 1 year ago, then I would want a window of ‚Äú356‚Äù (assuming weekends are in your dataset).Window functions are especially useful for time series data where at each point in time in your data, you are only supposed to know what has happened as of that point (no crystal balls allowed). The good news is that windows functions exist in pandas and they are very easy to use.Let‚Äôs say we want to calculate the daily change in price of our stock. To do this we would need to take each day‚Äôs price and divide it by the previous day‚Äôs price and subtract 1. We get our data as a list:Lists are not very math friendly so we can put our data in a numpy array (I reshape it to be a 9 by 1 array so that it‚Äôs easier to view and display):Cool, we got the returns. No need for dataframes right? Well, not exactly. Dataframes are more versatile than numpy arrays (which are optimized for dealing with numerical data). And the developers of pandas have created all these nifty window methods to make our lives easier ‚Äî they would be sad if we didn‚Äôt take advantage.So let‚Äôs put our stock prices into a dataframe:We can use the shift method to get the previous day‚Äôs price. The shift method is very similar to SQL‚Äôs lag function. The ‚Äú1‚Äù tells it to lag things by one day, giving us the previous day‚Äôs price:Now stock_df looks like this:Cool, now we just need to divide price by prev_price and subtract 1 to get the daily return:We can do a lot more than just calculating returns. For example, say we want to compare our daily return to an expanding window average return in order to see how each return compares to the historical average. You might think, why not just calculate the average of all the values in the daily return_column and use that? The answer is data leakage.In time series analysis, when we are trying to forecast the future, we need to be really careful about what could have been observed and what could not have been observed on a specific date. For example, on day 5 of our dataset, we can only observe the first 5 prices: 100, 98, 95, 96, 99. So if we are testing features in order to make a forecast for day 6, we can‚Äôt compare day 5‚Äôs return of 3.03% with the mean daily change of the entire period because on day 5, we have not yet observed days 6 through 9.That‚Äôs where an expanding window comes in. In case you are not familiar with expanding and rolling windows, the following picture visualizes what they are. With an expanding window, we calculate metrics in an expanding fashion ‚Äî meaning that we include all rows up to the current one in the calculation. A rolling window allows us to calculate metrics on a rolling basis ‚Äî for example, rolling(3) means that we use the current observation as well as the two preceding ones in order to calculate our desired metric.The rationale behind using an expanding window is that with every day that passes, we get another price and another daily change that we can add to our mean calculation. That‚Äôs new information that we should capture in our calculated metrics. We can do this with the following code (I also threw in a 3 day rolling window as well for fun).Calling .expanding() on a pandas dataframe or series creates a pandas expanding object. It‚Äôs a lot like the more well known groupby object (which groups things based on specified column labels). The expanding (or rolling) object is what allows us to calculate various metrics in an expanding fashion. Let‚Äôs see what our dataframe looks like now:Notice that on day 1, expand_mean and daily_return are equal ‚Äî that‚Äôs necessarily the case because we are calculating the expanding mean with only one daily return on day 1. Also, on day 3 when we finally have enough data to calculate our rolling 3 day mean, roll_mean_3‚Äôs first value is equal to expand_mean. That makes sense too ‚Äî on day 3, our expanding mean is also calculated using the most recent 3 days‚Äô returns.Here is the plot (and code) of the stock‚Äôs daily returns and the 2 means that we calculated:We can apply other functions besides the mean as well. Let‚Äôs say our boss comes over and says, ‚ÄúI want you to keep track of how many days this stock has been up.‚ÄùWe can do this using an expanding object and the sum method (for keeping a running total). First we need to add a column to our dataframe to denote whether the stock was up that day or not. We can take advantage of the apply method (which applies a function to each row in the dataframe or series). We can either define a function to give apply or use a lambda function ‚Äî I opted for a lambda function (fewer lines of code) that takes each return and returns 1 if it‚Äôs positive and 0 if it‚Äôs negative.Once we have the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù column, we can apply an expanding window to it and the sum method (since each positive day is denoted by a 1, we just need to keep a running total of the number of 1s):And the dataframe that we would send to our boss looks like this:So as of right now, there are 6 positive days for the stock. But going forward as we collect more prices, our running total will update with it. Nice, our boss should be happy with this.Thanks for reading! Cheers and stay safe and healthy everyone.WRITTEN BY"
86,Summarization has gotten commoditized thanks to BERT,https://towardsdatascience.com/summarization-has-gotten-commoditized-thanks-to-bert-9bb73f2d6922?source=extreme_main_feed---------89-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"Have you ever had to summarize a lengthy document into key points? Or providing an executive summary to a document? As you know, the process is tedious and slow for us humans ‚Äî we need to read the entire document, then focus on important sentences and finally, re-write the sentences into a cohesive summary.That‚Äôs where automatic summarization can help us. Machine Learning has come a long way in summarization, yet there is still a lot of room to grow. Generally, machine summarization is split into two types‚ÄîExtractive summarization: Extract important sentences as they appear in the original document.Abstractive summarization: Summarize important ideas or facts contained in the document without repeating them verbatim. This is what we as people commonly think of when asked to summarize a document.I would like to show you some of the recent results of abstractive summarization with BERT_Sum_Abs ‚Äî the cutting edge NLP summarization model described in Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders by Yang Liu and Mirella Lapata.Summarization aims to condense a document into a shorter version while preserving most of its meaning. Abstractive summarization task requires language generation capabilities to create summaries containing novel words and phrases not featured in the source document. Extractive summarization is often defined as a binary classification task with labels indicating whether a text span (typically a sentence) should be included in the summary.Here is how BERT_Sum_Abs performs on the standard summarization datasets: CNN and Daily Mail that are commonly used in benchmarks. The evaluation metric is known as ROGUE F1 score‚ÄîResults show that BERT_Sum_Abs outperforms most non-Transformer based models. Better yet, the code behind the model is open source, and the implementation available on Github.Let‚Äôs work through an example of summarizing an article with BERT_Sum_Abs. We‚Äôll choose the following story to summarize ‚Äî Fed Official Says Central Bankers Are Aligned in Coronavirus Response. Here‚Äôs the full article body ‚ÄîTo get started we‚Äôll need to get the model code, install the dependencies and download the datasets as follows, you can execute these easily on your own Linux machine:After following the code above, we now execute the python command shown below to summarize documents in /dataset2 directory:the parameters here are as follow ‚Äîdocuments_dir ‚Äî The folder where the documents to summarize are located
summaries_output_dir ‚Äî The folder in which the summaries should be written. Defaults to the folder where the documents are
batch_size ‚Äî Batch size per GPU/CPU for training
beam_size ‚Äî The number of beams to start with for each example
block_trigram ‚Äî Whether to block the existence of repeating trigrams in the text generated by beam search
compute_rouge ‚Äî Compute the ROUGE metrics during evaluation. Only available for the CNN/DailyMail dataset
alpha ‚Äî The value of alpha for the length penalty in the beam search (larger value provides larger penalty)
min_length ‚Äî Minimum number of tokens for the summaries
max_length ‚Äî Maximum number of tokens for the summariesOnce BERT_Sum_Abs has finished the article we obtain the following summary:Another example of summarization Study Shows Low Carb Diet May Prevent, Reverse Age-Related Effects Within the Brain gets us the following summary:As you see, BERT is creeping into all aspects of NLP. This means we are seeing NLP performance approaching the human-level every day while being open-source.The great commoditization of NLP is approaching, where every new NLP model not only establishes a new record on benchmarks but is available by anyone to use. Like OCR technologies some 10 years back gotten commoditized, so will NLP in the upcoming several years. With this commoditization of NLP, many smaller players are being disrupted as their moat in NLP technology R&D evaporates before their eyes.This commoditization of NLP should direct AI companies to switch focus and go into specific verticals, building a moat in addressing domain pain-points and not to focus on the NLP technology as the core value proposition. Specifically, here you can see the summarization as the technology is already getting commoditized as new incoming research is quickly implemented as open-source code while beating prior benchmarks.WRITTEN BY"
87,The Rise of Meta Learning,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-rise-of-meta-learning-9c61ffac8564?source=extreme_main_feed---------90-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"Meta-Learning describes the abstraction to designing higher level components associated with training Deep Neural Networks. The term ‚ÄúMeta-Learning‚Äù is thrown around in Deep Learning literature frequently referencing ‚ÄúAutoML‚Äù, ‚ÄúFew-Shot Learning‚Äù, or ‚ÄúNeural Architecture Search‚Äù when in reference to the automated design of neural network architectures. Emerging from comically titled papers such as ‚ÄúLearning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent‚Äù, the success of OpenAI‚Äôs rubik‚Äôs cube robotic hand demonstrates the maturity of the idea. Meta-Learning is the most promising paradigm to advance the state-of-the-art of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.OpenAI set the AI world on fire by demonstrating ground-breaking capabilities of a robotic hand trained with Reinforcement Learning. This success builds on a very similar study presented in July 2018 tasking a robotic hand to orient a block in a configuration matching a visual prompt. This evolution from block orientation to solving a rubik‚Äôs cube is fueled by a Meta-Learning algorithm controlling the training data distribution in simulation, Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR).Domain randomization is an algorithm to address the data augmentation problem for Sim2Real transfer. The core function of function approximation (and Deep Learning) is to generalize from what it has learned in training, to never-seen-before test data. Although not as surprising as misclassifications do to hardly noticeable adversarial noise injections, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks will not generalize when trained on images in simulation (displayed below on the left) to real visual data (shown below on the right) without special modifications.Naturally, there are two approaches to align the simulated and real data distributions. One such approach, developed by researchers at Apple is called SimGAN. SimGAN uses an adversarial loss to train the generator of a Generative Adversarial Network to make simulated images appear as realistic as possible, criticized by a discriminator classifying images as belonging to the real or simulated dataset. The research reports a positive result on eye gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. The other approach is to make the simulated data as diverse as possible, contrarily to as realistic as possible.The latter approach is referred to as Domain Randomization. This idea is well illustrated in the image below from Tobin et al.‚Äôs paper in 2017:Domain Randomization appears to be the key to bridging the Sim2Real gap, allowing Deep Neural Networks to generalize to real data when trained on simulation. Not unlike most algorithms, Domain Randomization comes with many parameters to be tuned. The image below shows randomizations in the colors of the blocks, the lighting of the environment, and the magnitude of shadows, to name a few. Each of these randomized environment features comes with a lower to upper bound interval and some kind of sampling distribution. For example, when sampling a randomized environment, what is the probability this environment has very bright lighting?In OpenAI‚Äôs original Dactyl study achieving block orientation with a robotic hand, the domain randomization data curriculum is manually encoded prior to the experiment. This domain randomization transcends the visual world, randomizing components in the physics simulator that leads to a policy enabling the robotic hand to move with dexterity and precision. Similarly to the idea of visual randomization, these physics randomizations include dimensions such as the size/mass of the cube and the friction of the fingers in the robot‚Äôs hand, amongst others (See Appendeix B of Solving Rubik‚Äôs Cube with a Robot Hand for more details).The key from Dactyl to the Rubik‚Äôs Cube solver is that the domain randomization is curriculum defining the intensity of randomization is automated rather than manually designed, clearly defined in the following lines of the ADR algorithm:AI that Designs its Own DataOne of the best examples of AI that designs its own data is the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET) algorithm developed by researchers at Uber AI Labs.POET trains a bipedal walking agent by simultaneously optimizing the agent and the environment in which it learns to walk in. POET is different from OpenAI‚Äôs rubik‚Äôs cube solver in that it uses an evolutionary algorithm, maintaining a population of walkers and environments. The structure of having populations of agents and environments is key to structuring the evolution of complexity in this research. Despite the use of Reinforcement Learning to train a single agent compared to Population-based Learning to adapt a group of agents, POET and Automatic Domain Randomization are very similar. They both develop a progression of increasingly challenging training datasets in an automated way. The Bipedal‚Äôs walking environment does not change as a manually encoded function, but rather as a result of the population of walkers performances in the different environments, signaling when it is time to crank up the challenge of the terrain.Research in Meta-Learning has generally focused on data and model architectures, with exceptions such as Meta-Learning optimizers, which seems to still fall under the umbrella of model optimization. Meta-learning in the data space such as Automatic Domain Randomization has been heavily studied in the form of Data Augmentation.Data Augmentation is most easily understood in the context of image data, although we have already seen how the physics data can be augmented and randomized as well. These image augmentations typically include horizontal flips and small magnitudes of rotations or translations. This kind of augmentation is typical in any computer vision pipeline such as image classification, object detection, or super resolution.Curriculum Learning is another data-level optimization concerned with the order in which data is presented to learning models. For example, starting a student off with easy examples such as 2 + 2 = 4, before introducing more difficult ideas such as 2¬≥ = 8. Meta-Learning controllers of Curriculum Learning look at how data is ranked according to some metric of perceived difficulty and the order in which this data should be presented in. A recent study from Hacohen and Weinshall presents interesting success with this (shown below) in the ICML 2019 conference.Neural Architecture Search, or Meta-Learning models generally receive more attention than data-level optimizations. This is highly motivated by the trends in Deep Learning research. There is a clear performance benefit from extending the foundational AlexNet architecture that pioneered the use of Deep Convolutional Networks trained on big datasets on big GPU computing to the ResNet architecture. ResNet was further extended with manual designs such as DenseNet, and then surpassed by meta-learning techniques such as AmoebaNet and EfficientNet. The timeline of image classification benchmark advancement can be found on paperswithcode.com.Meta-learning neural architectures try to describe a space of possible architectures and then search for the best architecture according to one or multiple objective metrics.Neural Architecture Search has employed a wide range of algorithms to search for architectures, Random Search, Grid Search, Bayesian Optimization, Neuro-evolution, Reinforcement Learning, and Differentiable Search. These search algorithms are all relatively sophisticated compared to the technique presented in OpenAI‚Äôs Automatic Domain Randomization. It seems likely that the ideas of Automatic Domain Randomization would be improved with advanced search algorithms, i.e. something like the Population-Based Search proven useful in Data Augmentation by Researchers at UC Berkeley or AutoAugment from Google.One of the limitations of Meta-Learning frequently addressed in Neural Architecture Search is the constraint of the search space. Neural Architecture Searches begin from a manually designed encoding of possible architectures. This manual encoding naturally limits the discoveries possible by the search. However, there is a trade-off necessary to make the search computable at all.Current architecture searches view neural architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and try to optimize the connections between nodes. Papers such as ‚ÄúWeight Agnostic Neural Networks‚Äù by Gaier and Ha and ‚ÄúExploring Randomly Wired Neural Networks for Image Recognition‚Äù by Xie et al. show that constructing DAG neural architectures is complex and not well understood.The interesting question is when will Neural Architecture Search be able to optimize the operations at nodes, the connections between them, and then have the freedom to discover things like novel activation functions, optimizers, or normalization techniques such as Batch Normalization.It is interesting to think about how abstract can Meta-Learning controllers be. For example, OpenAI‚Äôs Rubik‚Äôs cube solver essentially has 3 ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù components, a symbolic rubik‚Äôs cube solver, a vision model, and a controller network to manipulate the robotic hand. Could Meta-Learning controllers be smart enough to understand this kind of modularity and design the hybrid systems between symbolic and Deep Learning systems recently campaigned by Gary Marcus?Meta-Learning data augmentation is very constrained as well. Most data augmentation searches (even automatic domain randomization) is constrained to a set of transformations available to the meta-learning controller. These transformations could include things like the brightness of the image or the intensity of shadows in the simulation. An interesting opportunity for increasing the freedom of data augmentation is to combine these controllers with generative models capable of exploring very unique data points. These generative models could design new images of dogs and cats, rather than rotating existing ones or making the images darker/brighter. Although very interesting, it doesn‚Äôt seem like the current state-of-the-art generative models such as BigGAN or VQ-VAE-2 works for data augmentation on ImageNet classification.‚ÄúMeta-Learning‚Äù is frequently used to describe the capabilities of transfer and few-shot learning, differently from how ‚ÄúAutoML‚Äù is used to describe the optimization of models or datasets. This kind of definition aligns well with the domain adaptation task of Sim2Real solved by Automatic Domain Randomization. However, this definition also describes learning such as transferring from ImageNet classification to identifying steel defects.An interesting result of the Rubik‚Äôs Cube Solver is the ability to adapt to perturbations. For example, the solver is able to continue despite putting a rubber glove on the hand, tying fingers together, and blanket occlusion of the cube, (the vision model must be completely impaired, thus the sensing has to be done by the Giiker cube‚Äôs sensors). This kind of Transfer Meta-Learning is a result of the LSTM layers in the policy network used to train the robotic hand control. I think this use of ‚ÄúMeta-Learning‚Äù is more of a characteristic of Memory Augmented Networks compared to AutoML optimization. I think this demonstrates the difficulty of unifying Meta-Learning and settling on a single definition for the term.The success of the Rubik‚Äôs Cube solver is obviously compelling due to the flashy display of robot hand coordination. However, the more interesting component of this research is the Meta-Learning Data Randomization under the hood. This is an algorithm that is learning while simultaneously designing its training data. This paradigm, described in Jeff Clune‚Äôs AI-GAs, of algorithms that contain meta-learning architectures, meta-learning the learning algorithms themselves, and generating effective learning environments stand to be an enormous opportunity for the advancement of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

I‚Äôve seen all manner of dating advice.Like you, I‚Äôve read the common ones about avoiding temptation, not taking each other for granted, putting in the work, maintaining independence, communication, and trust.But there is one problem that destroys countless relationships, particularly long-lasting relationships and marriages. And dating experts never seem to mention it.It isn‚Äôt cheating. It doesn‚Äôt involve any violence or abuse. Typically, it actually comes from a good place too, a place that should be celebrated and appreciated.I‚Äôll give you an example of someone who exemplifies avoiding this cardinal relationship sin. There are a few others like him, but he is a great, somewhat less recognizable prototype to model after.I‚Äôm guessing most of you don‚Äôt know who this is.His name is Stedman Graham.He is an American Businessman. He is an author and speaker. He is not a celebrity. But he has attained professional success by any reasonable measure, having made his own money and achieved notable status within the business community.This is what he had to say about his partner:‚ÄúI want her to succeed and be as successful as she possibly can.‚Äù‚ÄúI am not threatened by her fame, her money or her success. That‚Äôs not how I define myself.And can you guess who she is?For the past 30-years, Graham has been the partner of one of the most successful people in history and one of the wealthiest women in the world today, Oprah Winfrey.Throughout their relationship, he‚Äôs only visited her studio a handful of times. He has never sought to be on camera or profit off of her fame. Through the decades, he has been the behind-the-scenes rock in her life.He has lived his own focused life, growing his own career in his own lane, not concerning or measuring himself against the metrics of his partner.As of 2020, the modern family has long been constituted by two-career households. Often, when one person‚Äôs career takes off and the other‚Äôs stagnates, it creates a rift in the relationship.Success can be a blood diamond ‚Äî envy, one of its facets.Although this rift happens with both genders, it tends to be exacerbated when the woman‚Äôs career takes off. Men often feel threatened when they are with a woman who is more successful than they are. The weaker sides of our masculinity begin to speak to our insecurities. Our faith in our own abilities becomes questioned. Our sense of self-worth becomes irrationally challenged.In a moment when we should be grateful for our partner's achievements, we become resentful, jealous and angry. We look to point blame at what they did or didn‚Äôt do that hurt our own progression.What I‚Äôm going to say to you next might sound highly cliche but the words aren‚Äôt hollow: it takes a strong man to stand behind a powerful woman. A shocking number of men can‚Äôt take it and torpedo relationships with their behavior.Are you strong enough to stand beside the throne? Or would you destroy it so that neither could sit?I have always respected Stedman for how he‚Äôs stood beside Oprah, rooting for her, while also living his own life too, without clawing to get into the spotlight. There is strength in a show of quiet support. It is a sign of security and love.Be like Stedman. Be supportive. Celebrate each other‚Äôs success.And don‚Äôt commit the cardinal sin of competing with your partner.WRITTEN BY"

ositioning America to take full advantage of the fourth industrial revolution would require us to take a closer look at the trends that are driving it and trends that are unique to America. If the last two presidential elections are any indications, the electorate also believes that we are heading in the wrong direction.So let us explore a few trends that are active in our society that we must take into consideration while we reboot the system.Consumers are at the heart of capitalism, and any trend analysis will be incomplete without analysing what is happening in this space. Every study from the last ten years indicates the following.Census Bureau data indicates that most counties are only growing at 0.7%. The average population growth in previous decades used to be 1% or above. Slowing population growth has a severe impact on housing, city finances, entrepreneurship, and social justice. Numerous news articles about cities using their police department to aggressively fine motorists are just one example of the impact on social justice.Counties across the midwest are experiencing significant outflow in the prime working-age population. Multiple factors are driving this trend, some of which include lack of job or entrepreneurial opportunities, rapid ageing of communities, and lack of supportive regulatory environment. Millennials are finding it easy to move out of these small cities than stick around and make it work. It also does not help that the values that millennials have do not align with these cities.Automation has been a significant driver in productivity improvements across the previous two centuries. The industrial might of the midwest got decimated in the last two decades by outsourcing and global market crash. Automation is the silent killer of standard middle-class jobs. The heart of American economic strength was agriculture and industrial goods production. Both have become highly automated in the past two decades. USDA reports suggest significant consolidation in farming and growth in average farm size. These industrial farms are experiencing a 1.5% improvement in productivity over the last 30 years resulting in a 64 % improvement.Small farms during the same period experienced only 17% improvement. Larger farms can leverage the advances in automated farming tools and the latest in irrigational technologies.Industrial good production also shows similar trends where automated assembly lines have significantly reduced the number of workers required for manufacturing.All these trends have reduced demand for many traditional jobs in society. No amount of governmental course correction can bring back these jobs. Capital will always look for the easiest path for returns. It‚Äôs not naive to look back and long for the glory days of Industrial America, but it‚Äôs naive to think that old jobs can be brought back to serve modern society. The capitalistic system that we follow has never worked in that fashion.The least discussed component of Heraclitus philosophy of change is the effect of change. If change is a constant, then new opportunities must be its partner in crime.So let‚Äôs take a look quick look at what are these new opportunities. Many of it is shrouded in the fog of change. Although if we examine a few of the trends that we discussed in this article, the following areas of opportunities emerge.Health Services for Senior CitizensWe are in the midst of the most significant demographic change. Baby Boomers are retiring (10,000 a day) and millennials are taking over. As part of this trend, the demand for senior care is jumping. The medical expense alone in this segment estimated to be at $2,75,000Further examination of this generation of senior citizens includes the following characteristics.¬∑ Better Health aka longer life span¬∑ Racially Diverse¬∑ Working Longer¬∑ Living AloneThis combination brings unique challenges from Medical (Cognitive decline, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and other age relates issues), Financial and Practical difficulties such as mobility. Being independent also throws care challenges that were traditionally handled by the family. This is going to generate demand for a slew of new services that could create new automated and manual services. Co-living Facilities that cater primary medical care that could be driven by remote medical support and monitoring. We still see only some sporadic development in this area.Smart CitiesMass immigration to the coasts has proved traditional management methods for coastal town and cities to be inadequate. Millennial values are forcing the market to develop new solutions in mobility, connected living and infrastructure management.Platforms are emerging in open-source space such as blockchains with the goal of aggregating data and provide opportunities for citizens, entrepreneurs and organisations to build smart city applications on top of the platform. These data span areas such asMobility ‚Äî Transit, Smart Parking & bike LanesConnected Living ‚Äî Fiber Access, Smart Home/Office, Green Space, Urban Gardens, Data ActivationInfra ‚Äî Building, Energy, Water, LightingLarge cities recruiting chief innovation officer‚Äôs is one example of this trend in government.On a side note, the mismanagement of larger cities has caused a reversal in the flow of people. Many rust belt cities are in the process of reinventing them as tech hubs with an abundance of affordable living spaces. Remote work is increasingly negating the need to be in one central place to be efficient as a team. One way for the American heartland to recover from the economic blight its is suffering would be to take advantage of this trend, but this would require imaginative solution on the part of state and local governments to turn the situation around.These opportunities are not limited to large companies. Many large companies are not in a position to risk leveraging some of these new trends. Small startups are in a place to out-innovate and capture the market.Change has once again brought us the next wave. We should stop looking back and start riding the next wave and discover what new opportunities are waiting for us.This article is part of a series that explores how to revitalise the American economy.1. https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2019/comm/percent-pop-change-county.html2. https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/gov-addicted-to-fines.html3. https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2018/december/productivity-increases-with-farm-size-in-the-heartland-region/4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus5.https://www.debt.org/medical/senior-options-costs/WRITTEN BY"
90,8 Habits of Super-Productive People Who Work From Home,https://medium.com/mind-cafe/8-habits-of-super-productive-people-who-work-from-home-52770f3d8333?source=extreme_main_feed---------93-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"After years of working from coffee shops and personal home desks, there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm sure of ‚Äî working remotely takes a lot of purposeful planning.Working from home is fantastic‚Ä¶ right up until your neighbour starts firing up all sorts of power tools and noisy machinery across the street. Managing your own time and choosing your hours can be incredibly hard if you don‚Äôt deliberately plan your day ahead of time.Leonardo Da Vinci once said, ‚ÄúWhile you are alone you are entirely your own master.‚Äù When working remotely, you are more likely to spend half your time battling procrastination, distractions, or managing energy dips. If you give in to your distractions, you could wind up devoting productive time to fighting off the guilt that comes from giving in to those distractions.In the wake of COVID-19, many people are suddenly finding themselves working remotely, and often in close quarters with young children, partners, and family. So how can you keep your focus regardless of your environment?Rising before the sun is a habit shared by most successful people. In a poll of 20 executives cited by Vanderkam, 90% said they wake up before 6 am on weekdays. This makes sense from a productivity standpoint ‚Äî you will have fewer distractions and a close to a peaceful environment to focus.Believe it or not, one way to work from home productively is to dive into your to-do list as soon as you wake up. Merely starting tasks first thing in the morning before the rest of your family or roommates have woken up can be the key to making real progress.Plus, according to one study, waking up early can also make you happier. Some evidence suggests that morning light exposure, which results in a phase advance of the sleep/wake cycle, improves depressive symptoms in seasonal affective disorder.Work on your high-value tasks first thing in the morning ‚Äî cut the planning and start doing real work when you are most active.Don‚Äôt waste all that mental clarity and energy on planning what to do for the next eight hours. If you are a morning person, you can get a tonne done in the early morning hours. It pays to focus on essential tasks for the day during your morning.A plan from yesterday makes it easier to get started right away when you get up. Kenneth Chenault, the former CEO and Chairman of American Express, once said in an interview that the last thing he does before leaving the office is to write down the top three things he needs to accomplish tomorrow. Then he uses that list to start his day the following morning.When you‚Äôre working from home, it‚Äôs important to recognise when you are most focused and energetic and to plan your schedule around that. Energy is the critical component we all need to consistently produce our best work, no matter where we are.For example, if you‚Äôre a morning person and are most clearheaded, creative, and productive from 9 am to 12 pm, use that burst of energy to get things done at that time.If you are a night-owl and need a few hours to ease into the day, leverage your afternoons and evenings. If you are productive between the hours of 3 pm and 11 pm, plan your tasks accordingly and make those your work hours.The point is that you can increase your energy by working with your body rather than fighting against it and forcing it to fit into anybody‚Äôs clock other than your own internal one. It‚Äôs better to concentrate your energy into a specific period than randomly insert it across chunks of time.To capitalize on your most productive periods, save your harder tasks for when you know you‚Äôll be in the right headspace for them.Planning your day the night before will give you back a lot wasted hours in the morning and lower your stress levels. The first quiet hour of the morning can be an ideal time to focus on meaningful work without being interrupted.Try this tonight. If you‚Äôre happy with the results, then commit to trying it for a week. After a week, you‚Äôll be able to decide whether you want to add ‚Äúnight-before planning‚Äù to your life.When working from home, you manage practically everything ‚Äî calendar, projects, tasks, and breaks. Without a proper structure, you can quickly lose focus or burn out.‚ÄúI make an hour-by-hour contract with myself that basically says, ‚ÄòWhen nap time starts, what are the two things I‚Äôm going to do?‚Äô‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúI write it on a piece of paper. A lot of people like to keep digital notes, but then when I sit down, there‚Äôs no question like, ‚Äòwhat am I going to do?‚Äô‚Äù says Laura Mae Martin, Google‚Äôs in-house productivity expert.To stay on schedule, segment what you‚Äôll do and when over the course of the day. Use an online calendar to create personal events and reminders that tell you when to shift gears and start on new tasks. If your mornings are for writing while in the office, use the same schedule at home.‚ÄúTry to stick to some semblance of your original routine from before you started working from home,‚Äù says Eric Lam, a cross-asset reporter for Bloomberg. ‚ÄúGive yourself a little bit of time before you start to wake yourself up, have a coffee, make breakfast. Especially for those of us ‚Äî like me ‚Äî who are not morning types.‚ÄùYou could even dress the part and remind yourself you are in work-mode. That means comfortable work clothes ‚Äî not pyjamas. ‚ÄúIt makes me feel awake, fresh, productive, and less slovenly,‚Äù says Kristine Servando, deputy head of Bloomberg Asia digital. ‚ÄúIt was part of the mental trick of demarcating between work and the rest of your life.‚ÄùAnd remember to take breaks, refresh and recover. When you live in your office, it‚Äôs easy to overwork. Log off when you‚Äôre supposed to. And resist the urge to come back to your computer after dinner.When you work from home, it‚Äôs easy to curl up in bed with a laptop and pretend that you‚Äôre ‚Äúworking‚Äù.To improve your efficiency, build a separate home office/desk just for work. This sets your brain up for enhanced productivity ‚Äî your brain gets spatially wired to think of the office as the place where work happens.‚ÄúBy working in the same space each day, your brain starts to associate that spot with working. If you work in a different spot every day, your brain has to retrain itself every day to get work done in that spot,‚Äù says Martin.The closest thing to magic for your money when working remotely is noise-cancelling technology. I bought my first pair of noise-cancelling headphones years ago. And I‚Äôve never regretted the decision.Working from home may expose you to sounds that become irritating or unbearable over time: traffic and street noise that penetrate through windows, the tick of a clock somewhere, etc. If you have kids, they probably would be playing close to your workspace.Noise-cancelling headphones or earbuds are great at removing those sorts of sounds almost entirely. They can also dull the sound of talking if you‚Äôre in a place in which other people (like your family or roommates) have to also function.Combined with music, they work even better. The absence of background noise effectively enhances the music, and you can work without the distraction during your ‚Äúfocused‚Äù period.Connecting with other people is needed more than ever to stay healthy, productive, happy and sane. You can hold virtual meetings, jump on a phone call, or send a friend a text. Reach out and support one another ‚Äî and laugh!‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre the kind of person who‚Äôll miss your colleagues when you work from home, build opportunities for socialising into your day,‚Äù says Karen Eyre-White, a productivity coach and founder of GoDo business organisation, who recommends trying to call colleagues rather than using email or Slack messaging.Modern technology has made it insanely easy to stay connected. Use tools like Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp, Facebook Workplace and Trello to stay connected with friends and colleagues at work. Positive social support can improve our resilience in coping with stress. Check-in with your friends, family, and neighbours regularly.Working from home can be challenging for many people. How you choose to face that challenge won‚Äôt just determine your productivity ‚Äî it will determine your mental health and even your happiness.Liked this story?

We‚Äôre joined by Dennis Bushnell, Chief Scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center to discuss robotics, AI, and sustainable, commercially viable solutions for the Earth, Mars & beyond‚Ä¶Dennis, we‚Äôre going to be talking about some pretty speculative ideas, so I want to start with something proven: the Mars Rovers. NASA‚Äôs had spectacular success with rovers working in conjunction with the Mars satellite infrastructure that‚Äôs in place, and even though the focus is on human exploration right now, I‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôve got future plans for more robotic exploration?Mars plans for NASA are set up partially with the National Academy of Sciences, which tells us what we should do in terms of science planning. So far, Mars exploration has been more space science than manned spaceflight, but we‚Äôre trying to use the what we‚Äôve learned from the scientific missions to inform human space flight.The challenge with human Mars missions is making them both safe and affordable ‚Äî because it‚Äôs a problem to do both of those at the same time. One solution is to send robots & AI five years or so before humans arrive, and let them prepared in advance ‚Äîgenerating water, oxygen, habitats, you name it.Keep in mind that one of the main costs of getting to Mars is putting the 900 metric tons of equipage required in low Earth orbit ‚Äî and if we can build robotic systems to make some of that on Mars itself using ISRU, it simplifies things and keeps the cost down. It‚Äôs an solution that offers real benefits, but the current plan is to take a more conventional Apollo-style approach.Now, do you think AI is advanced enough to take on a larger autonomous role in these future missions?The answer is yes. In terms of AI, there are three ways to approach using it. The first is with big-data & neural nets, which is what‚Äôs been in the media since around ‚Äô12 ‚Äî but this isn‚Äôt the only way to do it.Right now, there are several billion-dollar level funded human brain projects around the world that are nano-sectioning the neocortex on replicating it on silicon. This is biomimetic AI, which is an approach that may take it to the human level and maybe beyond.The third possibility is to generate AI the way human acquired intelligence, which is by evolving to solve problems ‚Äî a process of survival of the fittest, as our brains evolved the capability to solve new types of problems. At first we evolved capabilities on a problem by problem basis, but at some point we ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù, which is called emergence.We know the principle of emergent intelligence is possible, because we ourselves are proof that it happened at least once. So there‚Äôs that. Maybe we can make it happen in machines ‚Äî there are some people who think it already is and the internet is starting to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù.In any case, the more data that you give the current approach to AI, the better it is. Even today‚Äôs machines can do brute-force ideation by the system level evaluation of quasi-random combinatorials. It‚Äôs not AI, it‚Äôs brute force evaluations ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still really good. If you combine that with AI, it gives you a serious capability to handle the unknown unknowns you‚Äôll encounter while exploring another planet.Now in terms of the actual machines that you‚Äôd use with this AI, it looks like NASA already has several different experiments in the works. We‚Äôve got rovers which have worked really well, and the humanoid Robonaut 2, & Valkyrie ‚Äî and I‚Äôve read about several designs for Mars aircraft as well. Do you have any idea of what NASA might be leaning towards in terms of actual exploration?NASA starts with ‚Äúwhat do we need to know,‚Äù both for science and for human exploration, and then we figure out the best way to accomplish our goal. What I‚Äôm talking about is really a design & planning process, and it‚Äôs ongoing ‚Äî a work in progress, if you will. In terms of actual plans for our upcoming missions, the best place to find those is on the web.The reason I asked was because despite the variety of proposed machines, the rovers have been truly remarkable. As you know, Opportunity exceeded its expected mission lifespan 55 times over, driving a total distance of nearly 50 miles on the surface. That kind of success seems hard to beat.Well, look, space has almost exclusively the domain of machines so far. I mean, there‚Äôs a few humans up there, but not often, and not many. Space has been automatic, and it‚Äôs becoming autonomous.You know, on the earth or even the Moon, you can tele-operate. On Mars, however, you‚Äôve got a light-speed & bandwidth delays of anywhere from 12 to 30 minutes, so remote control isn‚Äôt an option. The further we go out, the more autonomous our machines will have to become.Yeah. Well, and so that takes us back to the AI part and now in a paper called Frontier Technologies and the Human Future: Sustainability Solutions, you wrote about machines becoming our ‚Äúmind children‚Äù. Can you describe for me how this may shape future space exploration?Okay. First let me define this term: it came out of Hans Moravec‚Äôs book on robots. The idea is that humans are becoming cyborgs. We have cochlear implants for hearing, artificial retinas for seeing, artificial hearts for living, and now we‚Äôre even printing artificial organs. DARPA is working on brain implants for soldiers, and the idea of uploading human minds into machines has gone from being science fiction to something plausible. So maybe the future of space exploration will be done by human-contaminated machines.Human contaminated machines? Are you talking about putting your goals into the machine as a set of instructions or rules for exploration?Well, it‚Äôs more than the goals. In theory you could put in your entire personality into a machine ‚Äîand you are the machine! After all, your brain makes you who you are. The rest of the wet electrochemistry you‚Äôre composed of is simply there to keep the brain working.So this is big picture then ‚Äî you‚Äôre talking about changing the substrate that a human lives on basically.Yeah. That‚Äôs one way of putting it.Since we‚Äôre talking about big picture ideas, let me ask about the singularity. Do you see the singularity occurring, and if so, when would you guesstimate that we would anticipate to see it.The singularity is occurring now, and it continues to happen over time as artificial intelligence and information technology develop.Think about it for a moment: in today‚Äôs world, we do everything remotely: we telecommute, tele-shop, tele-educate, tele-travel, tele-commerce, tele-socialize, use tele-medicine & tele-politics. It‚Äôs tele-everything ‚Äî and it‚Äôs becoming more autonomous with more AI built into it over time.The singularity is where this convergence of digital trends becomes so pervasive that it‚Äôs faster than humans can keep up ‚Äî but in reality, it‚Äôs happening slowly enough, that God, that people are accommodating to it, and largely, they‚Äôre okay. So I don‚Äôt view the singularity as a single event, like seeing a big storm cloud on the horizon and then being inundated with a downpour.I see what you‚Äôre saying. We‚Äôre adapting to it, normalizing to it, the machine is waking up, but it‚Äôs happening slowly enough we don‚Äôt realize it. For us, this is the new normal.Yes.In your papers you‚Äôve mentioned Marshall Brain, who said that we‚Äôre creating an intelligent species to compete with ourselves, and also Dr Steven Thaler for his work in machine ideation and creativity. Can you elaborate for me about creative machines that can outperform us in traditionally human areas of expertise?Thaler was messing around with neural nets decades ago ‚Äî before anybody thought they were worth very much. Anyhow, he trained a neural net, then deprived it of all rational input, and it basically began to dream, just like people do ‚Äî producing new quasi-random combinatorials, new ideas.Thaler took what‚Äôs called a critic neural net that collected all of these streams and evaluated them at the system level for various problems & metrics as solution spaces. This is an area that he‚Äôs refined extensively and literally wallpapered the space with patents over the years ‚Äî but he‚Äôs producing real results.Thaler‚Äôs process has been used to produce better toothpaste for Palmolive, better warheads for the Air Force, and ideate improvements in a lot of other areas. His work is an example of machines getting bigger & better, to the point where the machine is actually able to outperform a human being at creative tasks. The machine knows more, and it solves problems a lot faster.So over here at NASA, we turned the original AI that IBM developed loose on cancer, and within a few years it was doing cancer diagnosis & treatment four times better than a human ‚Äî and it was doing it four times cheaper because the machine can‚Äôt cash paychecks.So AI works for cancer ‚Äî but what about space exploration? Well, by using Thaler‚Äôs approach of brute force generation & evaluation of ideas, at machine speeds and at machine total knowledge, the machines can review millions of ideas in milliseconds, and come up with far better solutions than humans.Keep in mind that Thaler‚Äôs approach is not AI, it‚Äôs just quasi-random combinatorial production with superbly fast & knowledgeable engineering system evaluation.I‚Äôd like to switch gears a bit & touch on the environment. In your paper, ‚ÄúWhere is it all going? Prospects for the Human Future‚Äù, you discussed the challenges with the Earth‚Äôs overburdened ecosystem. Can you tell me about some of the issues & possible solutions you‚Äôve come up with from an environmental perspective?For the Earth‚Äôs ecosystem? Well, we‚Äôve been pursuing an unlimited economic growth mantra in a finite ecosystem. What that means is that we have way too many people asking way too much of the planet. People are just about agreed that currently we‚Äôre short about 50% of a planet now, and we are driving the ecosystem and a deficit each year more. As the rest of the planet tries to come up to Western living standards, we‚Äôre going to be short three or four planets. At some point we‚Äôre going to have to abandon today‚Äôs growth mantra and towards what you could call ‚Äúgreen growth‚Äù ‚Äî something I‚Äôve written about extensively.Now, in terms of the global climate change, after many years of struggle we‚Äôre actually creating solutions now for the climate because technology is finally able to reduce the cost of the renewable energy below fossil carbon cost. Not much happened with renewables until we got the cost down below fossil carbon ‚Äî and now it‚Äôs going way below.Once the price was right, greed came into play renewables are becoming popilar. Currently 33% of all the electricity on the planet is from renewables, the cost of storage & generation has dropped some 80 to 90% in the last few years, and the costs are still dropping.So greed works. What I‚Äôve written about are various ways to avoid the huge losses from damaging the ecosystem along approaches like halophytes ‚Äî salt plants grown on deserts using seawater. These are useful because 44% of the Earth‚Äôs land is wastelands or deserts and 97% of the water is seawater. This is the last natural resource that‚Äôs of any size the humans have not exploited ‚Äî and it would allow us to land, water, food, energy, and climate issues and make build massive new industries in the process.What about electric vehicles? That‚Äôs something we waited decades for, and how they‚Äôre here. Does that factor into your ideas for renewables?Oh yeah. As renewables become a larger part of the electrical grid, using the electricity they produce for transportation will also grow. This is exciting because several types of transportation are now poised to transition to electric ‚Äî and it has a lot of cost & environmental benefits.The efficiency of electric propulsion is a factor of 2. Now in contrast, we‚Äôve striven mightily to get only a 5% improvement in gas turbine engines, and electric is a factor of 2. Okay. There‚Äôs a huge list of benefits to electric vehicles in terms of efficiency, weight reduction, reduced maintence & lower pollution ‚Äî and the bottom line is about a factor of four cheaper energy costs to go anywhere.There‚Äôs another idea that I‚Äôm excited about from the Rocky Mountain Institute. They‚Äôre the best energy conservation group that I know of, and they have designs for buildings that produce energy instead of use energy.I‚Äôve seen estimates that between 30% to 50% of the energy use can be reduced as we go electric. So that could mean we‚Äôll only need about half of the total number of exajoules that we use now because of increased efficiency.I‚Äôve also seen talk about renewables combined with conservation making energy literally too cheap to meter ‚Äî and energy like that will make seawater desalinization possible for a lot more applications. It will also allow us extract the 44 minerals that are in the seawater out instead of land mining, which is one of the worst things we‚Äôre currently doing to the ecosystem.In a way, this brings us back to talking about commercial opportunities, so I‚Äôd like to ask you about space commercialization ‚Äî not just in orbit, but also what you‚Äôve written about colonization & commercialization of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. I‚Äôm wondering when we‚Äôll start to see real ideation for these projects as commercial ventures?The current planning is what you see. It‚Äôs humans back to the Moon after all these years, and humans on Mars along with Musk‚Äôs efforts on that. If he‚Äôs as derring-do and successful as he has been in many of his other endeavors then it will serve to expedite this process.In terms of Mars, you can make just about anything that humans will need on Mars itself, given the energy and In-Situ Resource Utilization. Mars is interesting because it has lots of resources, and as we develop faster transportation, with nuclear rockets and VAZIMR, etc, we can turn Mars in into the Walmart for the inner solar system, and maybe beyond.Ultimately the question for commercialization is making money ‚Äî and even now, commercial space is very successful. We‚Äôre putting up 20,000 to 40,000 LEO satellites to give everybody high speed internet & communications, and there‚Äôs also a large market for positional Earth utilities. The question here is how to commercialize space beyond geosynchronous orbit ‚Äî and there are lots of ideas and even more unknowns for that.For a while it was thought that mining water on the moon was going to be commercially viable ‚Äî but we did a study of SLS LEO access numbers, and it turned out to be cheaper just to bring it up from Earth. There‚Äôs also talk about space mining of asteroids with containing huge amounts of platinum, but if that was done seriously, it would probably crash the market here on Earth and the price would go down.That being said, there are a number of ways to make money in space, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve written about as well. One near-term idea is to use an energized tether to pick up space debris, put into a space junk yard, and then remanufacture & repurpose it. There‚Äôs an awful lot of high quality aluminum and a whole bunch of other materials up there.Dennis Bushnell is the Chief Scientist at NASA Langley Research Center, and is responsible for technical oversight & advanced program formulation.

arlier this month I was figuring out how to code a recurrent neural network (RNN, a common form of neural networks for text generation) to rewrite its own code. The idea was to train the RNN to completion, then to take code it generated (with syntax checks, of course) and run it. The code that the RNN generated would serve the purpose of generating more code to generate more RNNs, and so on, with each new ‚Äògeneration‚Äô of RNN coding the next. I was incredibly excited to see how it would turn out ‚Äîthe idea is exciting to entertain. An AI trained to improve itself will inevitably do so, right?But there was a problem.Where is the data?Anyone who has ever trained any machine learning model knows that a model‚Äôs performance relies heavily on the data it is trained on. Better data not only always beat a better model, data defines a model‚Äôs scope.The goal of a model is to traverse the data realm, looking for some pattern according to the rules outlined by its algorithm such that it can minimize the error. No matter how good the model is, it is always restricted by its data realm.As I tried to train my model, I struggled trying to find data for it. Would I feed it varying recurrent neural network architectures in the hope that it could write an architecture that was extremely efficient? In that case, how could I expect the neural network to just write new code efficiently? In the best case, the recurrent neural network wouldn‚Äôt have a syntax error (probably because it would overfit to the training data). What was the point of training an AI to write its own code if we are spoon-feeding what we want it to write? It‚Äôs not going to output anything with valid syntax that will do anything really ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô, such as loading new libraries or developing its own language.Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî this is not something that humans are superior at. The reason why humans are intelligent is simply because we‚Äôve been exposed to more data. You are also limited by the data you‚Äôve received. If you live in the U.S., you are probably clueless about what life is like in China, unless you‚Äôve been there (collected data).Since a small age, the world has fed you data ‚Äî more than we‚Äôre feeding machine learning models. That‚Äôs the only limit to being intelligent (and perhaps computing power to store it, although we do have enough storage to do a basic level of what I‚Äôm going to describe). If you were only exposed to the finite amount of data we give models, you wouldn‚Äôt be called intelligent either.This is where the solution to a ‚Äòdumb‚Äô AI can be found: on the Internet. Anyone can learn almost anything from the Internet now, with Google connecting us to webpages full of information. AI‚Äôs learning algorithm is much more efficient than ours ‚Äî think, to learn something it takes repeated practice, which can take us a minute per problem but less than a second for AI ‚Äî so the only reason why we might be able to call ourselves ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô is because we‚Äôve had the pleasure of having more training data.Better data always beats better models ‚Äî hence, we‚Äôre on a completely different dimension than machine learning models.By opening up the Internet to AI ‚Äî letting it roam the Internet and learning all of its contents ‚Äî machine learning could possess an ‚Äòintelligence‚Äô far superior to our own. It may even be able to print things like ‚ÄúWhy am I here?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is my purpose?‚Äù into a console, which it may have learned from some psychology site, but which you have no right to deny its credibility, since it is, technically, original.To those that say that nothing a machine spits out can truly be original, I respond with Alan Turing‚Äôs response to the same accusation from mathematician Ada Lovelace: ‚Äúthere is nothing‚Ä¶ [original] ‚Ä¶ under the sun.‚Äù The ideas that you produce are not original at all. They are simply a combined product of your experiences ‚Äî your training data ‚Äî with some noise. Whatever a machine is able to generate is equivalent to what you or I would be able to generate, if both the machine and the human were ‚Äòtrained‚Äô on the same data. In fact, the machine would probably produce results much more satisfactorily and quickly, as its learning methods are much faster than ours.Intelligence and consciousness are defined by knowledge, something that AI can acquire, even if it is not truly conscious. So what if it is not ‚Äòconscious‚Äô in the same way that you or I am? ‚Äî if it is able to produce the same fruits of intelligence and consciousness, what does it matter?Even though a newborn human and a blank AI are trained on different data and go through different processes to arrive at ‚Äòintelligent thoughts‚Äô, does it matter?By isolating ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô to only include our thinking processes, it will never be possible for machines to be intelligent. Machines are not human, but they can be intelligent ‚Äî if only we define intelligence and consciousness not to distinctly human processes but to the direct output to be more inclusive of thinking processes that don‚Äôt seem ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô to us.The biggest problem towards this goal is finding a way to scrape the data from the Internet ‚Äî a downscaled version of this project would be training a deep neural network to learn all of Wikipedia. The site has information on almost every subject, of which, when learned by an AI, could be just as intelligent as you or I proclaim to be.An AI that learned the entire Internet would know more than any one person could know, and be more intelligent than what mankind upholds as their most intelligent human.Whether you consider it or not, an AI trained on the Internet ‚Äî a collection of human experiences, arranged neatly and sorted via Google ‚Äî would be able to possess superhuman intelligence.WRITTEN BY"
93,Analyzing multigraphs in Neo4j Graph data science library,https://towardsdatascience.com/analyzing-multigraphs-in-neo4j-graph-data-science-library-35c9b6d20099?source=extreme_main_feed---------96-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"When times are tough, I think it is essential to focus on our relationships. Some of us concentrate more on social interactions. Others like to play around with neurons, while some just want to look at cute animals. No matter your network preference, I would like to help you reflect on those relationships and find more (positive) insights about them. To do that, we will put on our data science hat and examine a simple network to learn how does the Neo4j Graph data science library deal with multigraphs and how to analyze them. I have to warn you that this will be a longer blog post and focused more on the technical details.What is a multigraph anyway? Let‚Äôs look at the Wikipedia definition:In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges (also called parallel edges), that is, edges that have the same end nodes. Thus two vertices may be connected by more than one edge.There are two distinct notions of multiple edges:- Edges without own identity: The identity of an edge is defined solely by the two nodes it connects. In this case, the term ‚Äúmultiple edges‚Äù means that the same edge can occur several times between these two nodes.- Edges with own identity: Edges are primitive entities just like nodes. When multiple edges connect two nodes, these are different edges.To summarize the definition, the multigraph allows multiple relationships between a given pair of nodes. In other words, it means that we can have many connections of the same type between a pair of nodes like:Or connections with different types between a pair of nodes like:For example, in a knowledge graph, we might run into a combination of both.We will use the above example graph to demonstrate how the GDS library handles projecting multigraphs, what to look for, and what to expect. I have added weights to relationships as we will need them to demonstrate property aggregations, but more on that later.You can expect a deep dive into GDS multigraph projections, and little to no focus on the actual graph algorithms. We will use only the Degree centrality to examine the projected graphs.In the context of the GDS library, relationships without their own identity imply that we ignore the type of relationships in the process of projecting the graph.We will start with native projection examples. If we use the wildcard operator * to define the relationships we want to project, we ignore their type and bundle them all together. This can be understood as losing their own identity (type in the context of Neo4j).In the first example, we will observe the default behavior of the graph projection process.The default aggregation strategy doesn‚Äôt perform any aggregations and projects all the relationships from the stored graph to memory without any transformations. If we check the relationshipCount, we observe that four relationships have been projected. We can also take a look at the relationshipProjection:Anytime you see a type:'*', you can be sure that all relationships have lost their type in the projection process. This also means that we can't perform additional filtering when executing the algorithms. To double-check the projected graph, we can use the degree centrality.ResultsAs we expected, all four relationships have been projected. To have a reference for the future, let‚Äôs also calculate the weighted degree centrality. By adding therelationshipWeightProperty parameter, we indicate we want to use the weighted variant of the algorithm.ResultsThe result is the sum of weights of all the considered relationships. We have no use of this projected graph anymore, so remember to release it from memory.Depending on the use case, we might want to reduce our multigraph to a single graph during the projection process. This can be easily achieved with the aggregation parameter. We have to use the configuration map variant for the relationship definition.We notice by looking at the relationshipCount, that only a single relationship has been projected. If we want, we can double-check the results with the degree centrality.ResultsDon‚Äôt forget to drop the projected graph once we are done.We have looked at the unweighted multigraph so far. Now it is time to look at what happens when we are dealing with a weighted multigraph, and we want to reduce it to a single graph. There are three different strategies we can pick for property aggregation strategy:In our next example, we will use the MIN property aggregation strategy to reduce a weighted multigraph to a single graph. By providing the property aggregation parameter, we indicate we want to reduce the stored graph to a single graph in the projection process.We can observe that the relationshipCount is 1, which means our multigraph has been successfully reduced to a single graph. Let's examine the relationshipProjection.Here we can observe that there are two aggregation configuration options, one on the relationship level and one on the property level. As far as I can tell, you should use the relationships level aggregation when dealing with unweighted networks and property level aggregation when dealing with weighted ones. We will again double-check the results with the degree centrality.ResultsTo validate the MIN property aggregation, let's also calculate the weighted degree centrality.ResultsAs we expected with the MIN property aggregation strategy, the single reduced weight has the minimum value of considered weights. Again, as we finished with the example, don't forget to drop the projected graph.Let‚Äôs recreate the above examples with cypher projection. To lose the identity of the relationships and bundle them all together, we avoid providing the type column in the return of the relationship statement.Similarly to native projection, the default setting in cypher projection is to project all the relationships without any transformation during the projection process.By looking at the relationshipCount, we observe that all four relationships have been projected as intended. Let's also take a close look at the relationshipProjection.Remember, before we said that the type:""*"" indicates that relationships lose their identity (type) during the projection process. The same applies to cypher projection. To verify the projected graph, we run the degree centrality.ResultsWith cypher projection, we don‚Äôt have access to relationship level aggregation strategies. This is no problem at all, as it is very straightforward to reduce the multigraph to a single graph using only the cypher query language. We simply add the DISTINCT clause in the return of the relationship statement, and it should be good to go. If you need more help with cypher, I suggest you take a look at Neo4j Graph Academy.The relationship count is 1, which means we have successfully reduced the multigraph. Remember to drop the projected graph.On the other hand, with cypher projection, we do have access to property level aggregation strategies. We don‚Äôt really ‚Äúneed‚Äù them as we can accomplish all the transformation using only cypher. To show you what I mean by that, we can apply the minimum property strategy aggregation using plain cypher like:However, if we look at the official documentation:One drawback of that approach is that we put more pressure on the Cypher execution engine and the query result consumes additional memory. An alternative approach is to use relationshipProperties as part of the optional configuration map. The syntax is identical to the property mappings used in the native projection.So, to conserve memory, we can use the property level aggregation strategies in the configuration map.The relationshipCount is 1, which confirms our successful multigraph reduction. Just to make sure, we can run the weighted centrality and validate results.ResultsWith everything in order, we can release both projected graphs from memory.We also have the option to retain the type of relationships during the projection process. Among other things, this allows us to perform additional filtering when executing graph algorithms. However, we have to be careful, as projecting relationships with a preserved type is a bit different in the context of multigraphs.With the native projection, it is simple to declare that we want to preserve the type of relationships. All we have to do is specify which relationship types we want to consider, and the GDS engine will automatically bundle relationships under the specific relationship type. Let‚Äôs take a look at some examples to gain a better understanding.From previous examples we already know that the default aggregation strategy does not perform any transformations. By defining the relationship types, we indicate to the GDS library that we want to retain their type after the projection process.As expected, therelationshipsCount is 4. Let's take a closer look at the relationshipProjection.We can see that we have three different bundles or groups of relationships. Each bundle composes of a single relationship type, which is defined with the type parameter. It is handy to look at relationshipProjection to validate what kind of graph we have projected and if the relationship types have been retained. Not much else to do with this in-memory graph.Like before, we can reduce our unweighted multigraph to a single graph with the relationship level aggregation parameter. We have to provide the aggregation parameter for each relationship type separately.Ok, so we reduced to a single graph, but the relationshipCount is 3. Why is it so? The multigraph reduction process works on the relationship type level, and because we have three distinct relationship types, a single relationship for each type has been projected. Let's calculate the degree centrality on the whole in-memory graph.ResultsAs we explained, even though we have reduced each relationship type separately, we are still dealing with a multigraph on the whole. When running graph algorithms, you have to pay close attention to whether you are dealing with a multigraph or not, have you projected multiple relationship types and have you performed any transformations during projection, as all of this will affect the algorithm results.We can now drop this graph.Property aggregation strategies are very similar to before when we were dealing with relationships without identity. The only change is that now the aggregations are grouped by the relationship type.We get 3 relationships projected as we have learned that the aggregations happen on the relationship type level. We will double-check the results with the weighted degree.ResultsI feel like a broken record by now, but don‚Äôt forget to drop the graph :)I skipped the examples for cypher projection with preserved relationship types to shorten this blog post a bit. Basically, all you have to do is to add the column type in the relationship statement, and it should behave identically to the native projection examples.

94,How Will We Prepare for the Future?,https://medium.com/the-ascent/how-will-we-prepare-for-the-future-7470ff14951e?source=extreme_main_feed---------97-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"Anyone can publish on Medium per our Policies, but we don‚Äôt fact-check every story. For more info about the coronavirus, see cdc.gov.‚ÄúBe prepared.‚ÄùSo goes the motto of the Scouting movement. It‚Äôs an instruction that I‚Äôve thought about a lot in recent days as I‚Äôm sure we all have.Is preparedness even a possibility when confronted by circumstances such as those we‚Äôre currently facing? I doubt it somehow.Every third question at the Prime Minister‚Äôs daily briefing here in the UK amounts to questioning the government‚Äôs preparedness. Why wasn‚Äôt our country more prepared to react to a global pandemic? Could our health service have been better prepared to respond to the unprecedented demand? Why didn‚Äôt we prepare better stocks of the essential equipment that now seems lacking?Everyone shuffling around the supermarket, observing social distancing and buying food and supplies for their family hopes to prepare for the immediate future. They hope to prepare for whatever may come, grabbing a few extra items just in case they can‚Äôt get out again.Our financial futures suddenly seem uncertain. We question whether we could have been more prepared for times of austerity or a sudden loss of income. Will the stock-markets and the value of our retirement funds recover? We regret past impulse purchases or indulgences that now seem pointless. Maybe we should have put some money aside for times like this. Yet, who could have foreseen so many losing their jobs and their incomes so quickly.The future is uncertain. At some point though we‚Äôll return to a state of normality ‚Äî albeit one that looks significantly different to our recent past. When that time comes I wonder how I‚Äôll go about preparing better for the future?While the emergence of Coronaviruses such as SARS, MERS and now COVID-19 suggest that such things are becoming a regular occurrence, I‚Äôm not talking merely about preparing better for future pandemics. Instead, I‚Äôm wondering how the way I live will be influenced by what‚Äôs been learned in recent weeks.You don‚Äôt have to delve too far through my past articles to realise that I‚Äôve not always been the best at managing money. As the pandemic plays out I‚Äôm counting my blessings daily for many things. In relation to my work and my income:I know of many people who‚Äôve been immediately thrown into horrendous circumstances where they can‚Äôt pay their bills, feed themselves and their family and where their income looks to be lost, possibly for good. The same is true for employees, the self-employed and small business owners alike. What has been proven as truth is just how many people are just one paycheck away from financial ruin ‚Äî I feel deeply for them all.My focus now and going forwards will be to have as much money stashed away for uncertain times and to provide for the future for me and my family as possible. I‚Äôd reached this realisation already as it happens, but I‚Äôm ever more convinced and committed to enacting the intention than ever. The scale of government bail-outs in the UK and more widely cannot possibly be repeated on a regular basis and I‚Äôm already fearful that the global economy following COVID-19 will be a completely different beast than existed before.More than ever before I recognise money as a tool to provide my family and me with a quality of life, not a means of accumulating more and more consumer junk.Since entering lockdown I‚Äôve recognised the things that are most impactful on my happiness are those that have real utility and which are used daily ‚Äî walking boots and a good coat for my daily hike in the countryside. Exercise equipment for working up a sweat in the garage. Comfortable clothes, my laptop, and a strong internet connection. Books to read and music to listen to. Food for my family and a roof over our heads.That represents a lot, I know. Beyond that list, there‚Äôs very little I actually need to live happily and healthily.In future, I‚Äôll have a hard time convincing myself of the point of spending money on things that don‚Äôt serve a similar purpose, or which don‚Äôt enhance my life in a significant way.The knock-on effects for mental health of the virus and the accompanying social distancing seem as daunting and potentially damaging as the virus itself. We‚Äôre all living with fear of some sort, be that of getting sick, of losing those we love or a fear of missing out on the things we used to do.We‚Äôre all thrust into this strange new way of life from different starting points. How we adapt to the new world order will depend on what we‚Äôre used to.I‚Äôm already an established home-worker and can‚Äôt help but wonder why others are making such a fuss about having to do so. The answer of course is that the peaceful isolation that I treasure and which seems normal to me, is uncomfortable and isolating to those who need the company and the buzz of an office environment.Those who thrive on the pulse of life in a bustling city will be thrown by the sudden lack of traffic noise and the abandoned streets. Someone who lives in the countryside will barely notice the difference.Our emotional preparedness all depends on what we‚Äôre conditioned to handle and how flexible we can be when forced to change.An ongoing practice of meditation over the last few years has helped me to calm my racing mind. I‚Äôve not always found it easy to rationalise my thoughts but I‚Äôm less reactive to them than I used to be. The practice of mindfulness has been an essential part of the toolkit for emotionally adapting to what the future will bring.I‚Äôm also ever-more convinced of the benefit of being equally comfortable alone or in the company of others as a vital mix of skills.My one gripe about lockdown is that I‚Äôve lost the time I used to spend completely alone, when my wife was at work and the kids were at school. A new balance will be found of course, but it brings home to me that time spent alone, completely alone is something that I not only cope with, but thrive upon. It makes me a better husband, father, relative, friend and employee and enriches my relationships rather than making me stand-offish or reclusive.That‚Äôs a trait that I‚Äôll be nurturing in future to ensure I remain as resilient and strong as possible individually so that I can be there for others too. Emotional preparation will follow from that.Ours is a somewhat complex blended family structure and has necessitated some tough decisions over who would isolate where. My daughters from my first marriage are currently in lockdown with their Mum, a couple of hours drive away. I‚Äôm with my wife and step-kids in our family home ‚Äî they won‚Äôt see their Dad for the foreseeable future.This has been agreed by all parents as the right thing to do but it‚Äôs still difficult. We can all video-call each other (and do, frequently) but that‚Äôs a poor substitute for visiting in person.We‚Äôve cancelled plans to visit with my parents and sister who live a few hours away, who I‚Äôve not seen since Christmas. My Mum‚Äôs 70th Birthday celebrations were postponed by the lockdown and many other events have fallen by the wayside too. We live a mile or so from my wife's parents but my father in law is having chemotherapy and with his immune system weakened we have to limit contact with them as well.With less than a week of full isolation done, we all feel pretty optimistic in the face of more of the same but I‚Äôve no doubt that tempers will fray at some point. We all yearn for more contact with a diverse range of people ‚Äî wider family, friends, and co-workers. Their company was a recurring feature of daily life in the not too distant past and of course it will be again.I resolve that in future I‚Äôll be less inclined to postpone family visits or delay social arrangements unless there‚Äôs good reason to do so. COVID-19 has demonstrated that unforeseen influences can strike without warning and have devastating effects in disrupting plans when they do.I‚Äôll never again take for granted being able to meet a friend for coffee. I‚Äôll make more effort to visit with family near and far whenever the opportunity presents itself. I‚Äôll ensure I see friends as often as possible.Social preparation will mean that should restrictions be apply, I‚Äôll have no regrets about ways I could have made more of the time I had with the people I care about.As I sat down to write this piece I was determined it wouldn‚Äôt broach the topic of toilet paper ‚Äî that remains my intent.Nonetheless, there seem to be some lessons to be learned from the current situation regarding what can be done to be better prepared in future in the event of shortages of food or supplies.I‚Äôm not about to become a hoarder of canned goods, nor do I intend to turn our garden over to a vegetable patch. We‚Äôve been lucky that while supermarket shopping has been occasionally problematic, we‚Äôve never had to go short of the food or supplies we‚Äôre used to having.Even so, as a family we‚Äôve focussed a lot more on planning meals, making good use of what we have available to us and minimising waste. It feels good to know we‚Äôve got just enough, and that sense applies to cooking meals that satisfy us all but don‚Äôt leave us groaning in discomfort for having overeaten. It‚Äôs also been a useful opportunity to encourage the kids that they shouldn‚Äôt waste food at mealtimes and then expect snacks later. As a household we‚Äôre getting better at realising that need and greed aren‚Äôt synonymous.The other lesson has been to realise that we have way too much clutter and excessive possessions in our home. It took a full morning to tidy out our garage such that we could locate exercise equipment and make space to use it in the coming days and weeks. When we eventually made space to use the freezer in the garage and powered it up, it turned out that it no longer worked. Such experiences have offered a useful reminder that everything around us should have a useful purpose, should be well maintained and well-used regularly. If these conditions aren‚Äôt true, it should be gotten rid of.We cling on to many possessions out of sentiment, fear of letting them go, or merely to feel the comfort of accumulation. The best test of the worth of anything we have around us comes at times like this ‚Äî if it‚Äôs going to be useful or serve its purpose, it‚Äôll be when we‚Äôre confined to quarters for the foreseeable future.The lesson learned in preparing for the future? We‚Äôll be clearing out a whole lot of stuff that will never be useful. By hanging onto it, we‚Äôre cluttering our lives needlessly, and potentially obscuring from sight the things we might actually use.Decluttering will make space for the things that support us in living a healthy and happy life. The rest of it can be donated to others who might make better use of it.Preparation and planning have their place in many aspects of life. The last few weeks have highlighted many ways in which governments, businesses, individuals and even entire nations were woefully unprepared for what was to come when the Coronavirus began to spread.In months to come there will be reviews and enquiries at every level to figure out what could have been done better.Resolutions will be made to ensure that if the same thing were to happen again then the impact might be minimised.Some of these resolutions will be enacted and others will be forgotten as the years pass.I‚Äôm certain that we‚Äôre not yet through the worst that COVID-19 will bring. As I write this on a sunny Friday afternoon in late March 2020, there are further lessons yet to be learned.What I‚Äôm certain of, is that individually and as part of my family and my community there will be lessons from COVID-19 which shape how I live my life in the future. If these lessons help me to be better prepared for whatever the future may bring, then that can surely only be a good thing?If you‚Äôve enjoyed this article, please feel free to join my email list.WRITTEN BY"
95,FastAI: Classifying Brooklyn Nine-Nine Actors with Deep Learning,https://towardsdatascience.com/fastai-classifying-brooklyn-nine-nine-actors-with-deep-learning-4b06a8ab3cab?source=extreme_main_feed---------98-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"With Season 7 currently airing, there‚Äôs no doubt that Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a popular TV show. I won‚Äôt go into reasons why, but if you still haven‚Äôt watched it and have some time to spare, there‚Äôs no good reason to at least not give it a try.But this isn‚Äôt a TV Show article ‚Äî it‚Äôs a Deep Learning one. To be more precise, the article aims to use the power of deep learning to classify images of actors from the show.Okay, but, where will you get the images?Good question. Basically the idea is to download images from the web ‚Äî it‚Äôs not that my intentions are to sell this model afterward (who‚Äôd even benefit from it?). After downloading we‚Äôll have to do only the basic image manipulation ‚Äî cropping.Essentially, all images were cropped to be squares, and nothing else has been done preparation-wise. The reason why is that a sophisticated Deep learning library will be used to handle the training process ‚Äî FastAI.I‚Äôve previously written about it, and if you want to follow along make sure to have it installed and configured properly. This article might come in handy:Here‚Äôs the list of characters for which I managed to find some amount of decent-quality photos:So no Hitchcock and Scully unfortunately, as they are together in most of the shots and I didn‚Äôt feel like spending a couple of hours in Photoshop. Anyway, for each of the 6 actors mentioned above, 25 decent-quality photos were saved.Not a lot by any standard, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôll be using the ResNet pre-trained network to help us out a bit. If you decide to search for images yourself, and then to make the classifier, here‚Äôs how you should structure the directory:Yes, you‚Äôre reading this right. At this point in time, FastAI library requires this structure ‚Äî or at least I haven‚Äôt managed to get it working otherwise. Let me know if you have.Still following me?Good, now we can proceed with the model training!To start out we‚Äôll need to make two imports ‚Äî and both of those from the FastAI library (refer to the article above if you don‚Äôt have it installed):Let‚Äôs do a bit of preparation now. We‚Äôll create an ImageDataBunch object with the following params:I‚Äôve also set a random seed to 42 so the results can be reproduced by readers. Implemented in code it gives:Let‚Äôs now see how a couple of images from a single batch would look like:Preparation-wise we are done!Now we can instantiate a cnn_learner:Note here how I‚Äôm using the pre-trained weights of the ResNet101 network. We have only a few images, and results are generally going to be better if we‚Äôre not starting from scratch. ResNet101 already knows how humans ‚Äúlook like‚Äù, and it‚Äôs recommended to use it for cases like this.Good, we have everything we need to start training the model. Let‚Äôs train it for 15 epochs to see what happens:In the end, we have an accuracy of around 84%, which isn‚Äôt too shabby for multi-class classification problem with such limited training data.But let‚Äôs dive deeper into model evaluation next.For this type of problem, it would be nice to look at a confusion matrix to see where our model performed well, and where it didn‚Äôt.So, we can make an instance of ClassificationInterpretation to gain access to the confusion matrix:Good, and now the confusion matrix itself:It seems like our model in some cases has problems with these two combinations:I mean, for this limited amount of images it can be reasoned why the model is confused, but it still performs pretty decently ‚Äî if you take into account how little time and effort FastAI library requires.Another pretty cool thing FastAI can do is to show you the images it was most confused with ‚Äî conveniently the method is called .plot_top_losses():Here I can understand everything except the first one ‚Äî it looks like a clear shot to me.And there you have it, with such limited data and with only a few lines of code we can develop a Deep learning-powered multi-class classification algorithm with an accuracy of around 84%.My goal is to spend more time in the future on this problem, collect more images for sure and maybe code the entire thing in PyTorch. Let me know if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like to read.I hope this was fun for you. Thanks for reading.WRITTEN BY"
96,An Introduction to Nanosensors & Nanofabrication,https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-nanosensors-nanofabrication-5646acfe559b?source=extreme_main_feed---------99-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"Nanotechnology is in the midst of becoming an integral part of our future and how we, as a society, get things done. This technology works with objects and materials at a nanoscale.To put it in perspective: a sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometers thick, so a nanometer is pretty small.Though seen as something out of a fiction book, nanotechnology is very much a reality, in fact it‚Äôs being put in practice right now; in medicine, environmental development and agriculture.In our day to day life, sensors are used everywhere: in stores to detect stealing, to determine how fast your car is going on a road, and even to identify your face to unlock your phone.Just as you may have guessed, with nanotechnology comes nanosensors.Nanosensors are super small sensing devices that collect information and data at a nanoscale. They work by identifying changes in the electrical conductivity of active sensing materials.There are two main types of nanosensors ‚Äì mechanical and chemical, both very similar but posses distinct differences that set them apart.Mechanical nanosensors work by identifying changes in electrical conductivity. This sort of nanosensor actually changes it‚Äôs electrical conductivity after physical manipulation of the material ‚Äî this is what triggers a detectable reaction. To measure this response, we use an attached capacitor which measures the capacitance (the ability of a system/body to store electrical charge).For example, using MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) washing machines are able to sense their temperature and water levels often by sensing the change in pressure.Though similar to the former, chemical nanosensors are different in the sense that they are used for detecting chemical changes instead of things like a materials force or temperature.Nanomaterials often have a high electrical conductivity which can lower when molecules are absorbed or bound together ‚Äî this is what creates a measurable change. Chemical nanosensors can be fabricated to where they are either more receptive or immune to different materials.Nanosensors are vital to the progression of nanotechnology.They are ultra sensitive to changes at an atomic level, which makes them even more useful and accurate than the typical sensors we use now.They‚Äôre more efficient as well because of their small size, extreme durability and they require low energy. Nanosensors are fast and more responsive which gives them the ability to transmit real-time data. Overall, they are extremely useful in modern day life.Because of nanosenors‚Äô size everything is massive in comparison which allows them to explore more of a surface area and detect different things at lower percentages and amounts.But what ‚Äòthings‚Äô exactly?Police use trained dogs to sniff out different substances, now scientists are using nanosensors to sniff out different viruses.Nanosenors are helping evolve technology in health care‚Ä¶ and possibly even space exploration. Right now, scientists are developing a way to detect extraterrestrial life using mechanical nanosensors.Nanosensors are not only being used in healthcare but also in food quality control, auto safety and environmental pollution detection.These little machines packs a lot of power in infinite domains!Currently, to create nanosensors we use a process called nanofabrication.There are two main types of nanofabrication; the top-down method and the bottom-up method. Neither are perfect and come with their own set of advantaged and disadvantages.With this approach to nanofabrication, scientists take on the role of a sculpter. The same way Donatello chipped away at marble to create a statue of St. George, scientists remove material until they achieve their desired structure ‚Äî or in this case, nanostructure.Most commonly, to create the nanostructure, material is etched away. Ethinching involes removing the material either physically (with uv lights or x-rays) or chemically (with acids) by using a technique called nanolithography. Nanolithography, by definition, is the science of etching, writing or printing to modify a material surface with structures under 100nm. To preform nanolithography the material is first coated in a chemical substance called photoresist, then, the required material is covered with a mask; the exposed areas of the material harden and get shaved off.This approach is the complete opposite of the former; instead of removing material we‚Äôre adding, or more appropriately, building. Atoms are placed one at a time by scientists to create molecules which later create the desired nanostructure. The traditional bottom-up method is a really time consuming process so a molecular self-assembly technique can be used instead. In short, this is where the nanostructure is able to build itself up thanks to the chemical forces between molecules, simulating a biological occurrence which happens naturally in nature.Now let‚Äôs summarize the advantages and disadvantages tied to these two forms of nanofabrication‚Ä¶The top-down method is fast which makes it ideal for commercial production but there is a lot more room for error as it‚Äôs difficult to convert materials to a nanoscale. It‚Äôs also much more expensive than its counter because the cleanrooms (rooms containing few particles with a sophisticated air filtration system called HEPA) and machines needed to complete the process cost a lot.The bottom-up method is a significantly more tedious process to reach the end goal but it‚Äôs able to create smaller product with fewer room for errors and defects. A major plus? It‚Äôs a lot cheaper.Both nanofabrication methods can be subjected to fouling.Fouling, in a nutshell, is the gathering of unwanted, usually airborne, particles (like dust) coming in contact, gathering or becoming part of the sensor. If there is a case of fouling, the sensor can become easily clogged which makes it less efficient or completely unusable.Nanosensors, nanofabrication and nanotechnology in general are relatively new compared to other technologies but that hasn‚Äôt stopped it from growing and transforming exponentially.Despite it‚Äôs supersonic evolution over the last few years, it isn‚Äôt without it‚Äôs flaws.There is one other pressing issue within the nano-development world ‚Äî a lack of people to develop it! Compared to other technology fields like biotechnology and computer sciences, there is a distinct lack of people involved in the field.I think we should:The future of sensor systems, healthcare and, well, the world will soon revolve around nanotechnology. Regardless of it‚Äôs flaws, this disruptive innovation will soon leave no stone un-turned and change how everything in our quotidian life funtions.Despite how small nanomachines are, they‚Äôll be making a massive impact!Are you ready for the revolutionary change?WRITTEN BY"
97,The (New) Great Depression,https://eand.co/the-new-great-depression-2be6309fe402?source=extreme_main_feed---------100-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"America‚Äôs response to Coronavirus has been, in a word, disastrous. It adds disaster to the catastrophe of a new global pandemic. If you‚Äôve thought something like the above, you‚Äôre exactly right. And yet because the media is doing a fairly poor job of explaining just why, let me.America‚Äôs stimulus program gives a one-off payment of $1200 to people ‚Äî and even that‚Äôs conditional on income. Good enough, right? Wrong.Every other rich country by now has guaranteed incomes, in some form or other. Sweden, to 90%. Denmark subsidizing 75% of incomes. Take the other most capitalist society in the world, Britain Even there, incomes have been guaranteed: Britain, to 80% of income. In Europe, most nations have gone even further, making not just emergency payments to workers for as long as the crisis will last, but mortgages have already been suspended, which is another way to guarantee incomes.By this measure, America‚Äôs paltry $1200 one-off payment looks inadequate ‚Äî because it is. Deeply and profoundly so.Before I come to the other ways, let‚Äôs discuss why America‚Äôs response has been so dismal. The fear is that inflation will wrack the economy if people are to ‚Äúget paid for free.‚Äù But nothing could be more wrong. Inflation, often misunderstood by Americans, because American economics, is to put it kindly, a joke, is really this: spirals in wages and prices.Now think of the average American. He or she is suddenly out of work ‚Äî and facing the prospect of sudden and long-lasting bankruptcy. In other words, the average American is facing a deflationary shock. One so total, the like has never been seen in modern history. Overnight, literally, their income has gone to zero.That deflationary shock will ripple outwards through the economy. It will cause prices to fall, because people won‚Äôt have enough money to buy the same levels of stuff. Prices for what? For everything. For houses, food, cars, and so forth. That deflation probably won‚Äôt make the headlines, because they‚Äôll be full of profiteering scandals. Of course profiteering will take place, but across the larger economy, the effect of deflationary shocks will be what it always is: depression.Depression means: After they lose their incomes Americans will then lose their savings, their homes, whatever other assets they had, like retirement and college and funds and so forth. They will struggle to afford the basics, even more than the already did ‚Äî remember, America was already an economy in which 75% struggled to pay basic bills, like food, housing, and utilities, even before Coronavirus. Now imagine them being even poorer than that.The stage has now been set for a depression. Precisely because idea that a danger from the government supporting people during a catastrophe is ‚Äúinflation‚Äù is backwards ‚Äî the real danger is deflation. That deflationary shock is taking place as we speak, like a mega-earthquake, an extinction level event, which is making millions of Americans go from a relatively paltry income to‚Ä¶zero income.That is why a $1200 payment to people isn‚Äôt nearly enough. Those jobs aren‚Äôt suddenly going to magically come back. Why not? That brings me to the second reason America‚Äôs Coronavirus response is inadequate.Businesses are already going bankrupt. How many can you count? Just take a look down your block. How many small or medium sized businesses are shuttering their doors, or on the verge? Your local bakery, brewer, butcher ‚Äî if you even had one left?America‚Äôs stimulus program offers little real support to the economy. It gives mega-corporations huge bailouts. But for everyone else, it offers little to no real support. Maybe ‚Äî and I stress maybe ‚Äî your average business gets a small loan or a tax break from the government. But what good is a loan or a tax break when the basis of your business has simply fallen apart? Think of a supply chain: it‚Äôs a complex web of businesses. Like an ecosystem, the shock of losing customers suddenly ripples outwards and upwards. Sure, all these businesses can take on loans and get minor-league tax breaks. So what? That doesn‚Äôt solve the problem of no income at all. Those businesses will all still soon fold, as their debt spirals out of control, while their revenues plunge to near zero ‚Äî and no amount of tax breaks can fix that, either.Loans are not really a ‚Äústimulus.‚Äù The Fed doesn‚Äôt give banks ‚Äúloans‚Äù during a crisis ‚Äî it simply throws free money at them. It literally simply puts money in their accounts in the central bank. Yes, really. That is precisely what America should have done for businesses, too. It should have guaranteed their incomes, just as it should have guaranteed personal incomes. That‚Äôs what Italy and Germany did: businesses at risk don‚Äôt get loans, they get grants. And in Spain and France, they get government guaranteed funds, in which ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù means that any debt will probably be written off after the crisis.Just as the sudden loss of income for people creates an extinction level deflationary shock, so too does the sudden loss of income for businesses. That deflationary shock ‚Äî business‚Äôs revenues suddenly falling to zero ‚Äî will rip through the economy, causing mass layoffs, bankruptcies, and the extinction of whole sectors. Again: the stage for a historic depression has now been set.That brings me to the third and biggest reason. What‚Äôs missing from this ‚Äústimulus‚Äù package? Take a look at those brave doctors and nurses. They‚Äôre fashioning masks out of pizza boxes. They‚Äôre desperately trying to get patients to share scarce ventilators. What‚Äôs missing from this stimulus package is‚Ä¶stimulus. As in the real thing.What does that mean? A massive, historic, generational wave of investment in healthcare like America‚Äôs never seen before. Isn‚Äôt it obvious that‚Äôs what‚Äôs necessary right about now? That America‚Äôs barely functional healthcare system ‚Äî and economy ‚Äî can hardly cope with the magnitude of this shock? And yet, on the same day as it announced this stimulus package, the government also proclaimed it couldn‚Äôt spend a billion dollars on‚Ä¶ventilators. Wait, what? Perhaps you see the problem.Let me put it more plainly. This stimulus bill isn‚Äôt really one. It doesn‚Äôt put, say, a trillion dollars towards building new hospitals, clinics, care centers‚Ä¶and another trillions to new labs, research facilities, university research programs. It doesn‚Äôt recruit a million people or ten to do the sudden work of gearing a whole economy towards building the missing resources a society crippled by disease now urgently needs. What kind of work is that?This stimulus doesn‚Äôt create institutions like a Works Progress Administration ‚Äî only this time for people to work in factories suddenly building ventilators and masks, or a million bright young people researching pandemics harder, or an army of everyday people visiting the elderly and making sure they‚Äôre ok, or legions making films about the pandemic, or writing about it ‚Äî things which are the equivalent of digging ditches during a pandemic. Yet think about how much of that is the necessary, crucial work of this moment. Think how much work there is to really do ‚Äî from building the resources we need, whether simple things like ventilators and masks, to doing new research and development, fast, to manning and managing it all, to chronicling this moment in literature and film, to building whole new hospitals and clinics, to creating a whole new sector of crisis planning.This stimulus doesn‚Äôt do any of that. It doesn‚Äôt even have a billion dollars for the scarcest and most urgently necessary resource of all ‚Äî ventilators, for Pete‚Äôs sake ‚Äî let alone new hospitals and clinics, or staffing existing ones better.The result is that America‚Äôs economy is still scarce of the resources it needs most to fight this pandemic, like ventilators and masks. This stimulus isn‚Äôt one because it doesn‚Äôt invest in anything new at all.Let me put all that in more formal, technical terms. A stimulus is not a stimulus when it doesn‚Äôt create any resources, lead to any larger surplus, in society. A stimulus is a stimulus when it suddenly, massively invests in society, so that new resources can be created. Often, whole new institutions must be built ‚Äî like the Depression‚Äôs WPA or Reconstruction Finance Corporation ‚Äî to coordinate and manage those investments.The whole point of a stimulus is to suddenly, rapidly expand society‚Äôs surplus of resources ‚Äî especially desperately necessary ones ‚Äî or it isn‚Äôt a stimulus at all. Those desperately necessary resources differ from crisis to crisis. What are they this time around? Ventilators. Masks. Hospitals. Care workers. Factories. Transportation. Meanwhile, mass unemployment has set in.See the obvious solution? The government can and should ‚Äúemploy‚Äù people who are suddenly unemployed and broke to balance that equation ‚Äî to create those desperately necessary resources. If it needs to create new institutions to do that ‚Äî A Healthcare Crisis Agency, a Pandemic Response Bank, a Reconstruction Finance Corporation ‚Äî all the better: even more people are employed to create another scarce resource, planning and coordinating. That is what a stimulus is ‚Äî when we genuinely take collective action to invest together to create a surplus of critical resources that we suddenly, desperately lack.This bill literally does none of that. As in: zero. And in that way, it‚Äôs not a stimulus at all. What it is is a bailout. It‚Äôs a rescue of corporations and Wall St and the same old. It‚Äôs a bailout of capitalism ‚Äî at the expense of the economy, people, and life itself.What‚Äôs a depression? A society in desperate scarcity ‚Äî whether of money, homes, income, medicine, and so on, the basics ‚Äî usually, as the result of a sudden, catastrophic shock. The correct result is a real stimulus ‚Äî as Keynes discovered a century ago ‚Äî precisely so that society can have a surplus of those critical resources. Otherwise, a deflationary spiral sets in: wages and prices fall in tandem, and people get sharply poorer in real terms, fast. The prices of these few critical resources rise, of course ‚Äî but only amidst fresh and terrible poverty.But that poverty is disaster added to catastrophe. Because depression results from some shock ‚Äî the loss of a war, natural calamity, in this case, pandemic. Poverty is a consequence of inaction, folly, negligence ‚Äî the lack of collective action and shared investment.America‚Äôs response to Coronavirus is as flawed and inadequate as you probably think. Compared to other rich countries, America is essentially doing next to nothing. It sets the stage for depression ‚Äî by being a bailout of capitalism‚Äôs mega-rich, who already have too much, while the average person and his or her small business have long had too little. Instead of massively investing to create a surplus of critical resources, it‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt invest in anything at all.That is why we will go on hearing surreal horror stories about doctors making masks from pizza boxes and nurses dying because they treated the sick without protective gear‚Ä¶even as we lose our own jobs and incomes‚Ä¶while the mega-rich go on laughing all the way to the bank.Don‚Äôt get me wrong. This stimulus is better than nothing. But what it isn‚Äôt is nearly good enough for a society as broken as America to be able to cope with catastrophe ‚Äî much less grow as an improbable result of it.There‚Äôs another, harder, way to put all that. Did you really expect a ruthlessly capitalist society to be able to save itself from a pandemic? Or was it always just going to use it as a way to exploit people even harder? Sadly, the answer, my friends, is one every country but America knows by now.Umair Haque

98,What to Expect From a Post-Pandemic Digital Society,https://medium.com/swlh/what-to-expect-from-a-post-pandemic-digital-society-7db88ca40c76?source=extreme_main_feed---------101-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"Past events shape and inform our present decisions and these events combine to impact our future.The Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic is an event that will be remembered for a long time. The consequences of our decisions will no doubt have a significant impact on the future development of global society. Although we are in the early stages of an outbreak, it's already clear there will be several lasting consequences.In this essay, you can expect to gain an understanding of technologies and concepts that will converge in the near future as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. By understanding this inflexion point, we can better position ourselves for the inevitable future.Here is a simple truth: moving forward, the business that can be done online will be done online. The virus is forcing a societal shift from physical interactions to increasingly digital interactions. This was already happening but the shift will create a gold rush for tools and frameworks for existing in digital life. It will accelerate the Rise of the Global Digital Citizen.Digital Citizens are people that have significant daily interaction with internet communities. They represent a societal shift towards life that is increasingly digital.So what exactly are the characteristics of this new post-pandemic digital society?In physical terms, our ability to congregate en masse will be restricted. In the short term, this means cloistering ourselves in our homes away from large gatherings. As the outbreak subsides and government-mandated restrictions pass, it‚Äôs important to understand that the trauma of a pandemic may, in fact, lead to cultural changes. There is a high likelihood that social distancing will have cultural staying power after the pandemic.We have communications and collaborative work tools that are commonly used but now they will require scale for massive populations.During the outbreak, communications systems will be developed and implemented to support large scale decentralization. These technologies are being deployed at an unprecedented scale. Examples include Zoom‚Äôs video software support of working from, social networking apps like Twitter to support community interactions and Alibaba‚Äôs DingTalk for home education.Assuming the virus is present during November when US Presidential voting is to take place, there will be consequences to our antiquated in-person system of voting. We saw a rather catastrophic attempt at using new software-based apps to vote in Iowa caucuses. In the event the outbreak persists, we can expect local governments to prepare for the wide-scale use of remote voting platforms. These remote-friendly and decentralized voting platforms will inevitably change voting outcomes.MOOCs or Massive Open Online Courses are courses designed to be delivered to an online audience of unlimited scale. Professors prerecord lectures and post them online for students to interact with. MOOCs provide a variety of tiered interactions that a student can have with faculty and in general, this model supports a standardized approach to education.MOOCs were already an educational trend prior to the outbreak.We can expect the pandemic‚Äôs spread and resulting push to decentralization and reduction of physical interactions will provide significant growth for MOOC offerings.Another trend in education is the shift away from standardized systems of education to digital validation through social proof of work. Like a digital style apprenticeship, Social Proof of Work is a method for establishing trust and authenticating abilities in digital settings.As opposed to a traditional credential like a college diploma, social proof of work requires individuals to learn publicly and establish a digital paper trail of experience that is verifiable. Completing amateur style tasks and working up to professional level skillsets, digital citizens will use proof of work to upskill and develop new paths to income.The pandemic will also result in an adaptation of the types of education required by the digital age. What we teach students will change and adapt to the needs of increasingly decentralized and digital life.As an example, curriculums will be adapted to teach network effects, compound growth, game theory, statistics, and black swan events.In our current world, exposure to medical facilities is a risk when they are inundated with infected people. You can expect telemedicine to become commonplace. Technology will increasingly emerge to support remote consultation with physicians including diagnostic and treatment tools.The proliferation of in-home medical devices powered by the IoT revolution will support doctors with remote diagnostic tools to assess patients. Current examples include in-home heart rate monitoring, blood pressure monitoring, and sleep trackers. As digital society embraces telemedicine, there will be a growing need for at-home blood testing solutions to provide deeper diagnostics.During an outbreak, the demand for medical attention far surpasses the available physicians able to perform diagnostic medicine. AI Chatbots will be implemented to support the increased demand for medical practitioners. Chatbots help address the inevitable increase in hypochondria during an outbreak by providing a reassuring voice. Simultaneously, chatbots will provide a trainable algorithm to make diagnostic assessments capable of both diagnosing, providing medical recommendations and escalating cases to human physicians in the event of serious situations.As we move into a post-pandemic digital society, our emphasis will be placed on developing tools to support diagnostic speed and decentralized care to prevent viral contagion.Media institutions and governments no longer have a monopoly on information flow. Social media and alternative digital communication channels have given rise to a reputation based media system.As we move forward, expect new and alternative sources of information to become actionable intelligence. Truth doesn‚Äôt just come from the government or your local newspaper but now can come from ‚Äúin the field‚Äù play by play communications.These types of information sharing are authenticated by social proof of work, i.e., when the person sharing stakes their reputation and credibility. In the event that they prove to be false statements, reputation and influence is lost. Influence is the new form of capital in the digital age.In this system, an individual or institution‚Äôs reputation is a form of digital currency.As an example, Ben Hunt is a writer covering financial sector topics at his website Epsilon Theory. Hunt staked his reputation on the inevitability of a pandemic by gathering and sharing information with his followers on the Covid-19 outbreak.Acting as an early source of information flow, Hunt acted as a filter providing legitimate news and analysis of the growing crisis. Hunt‚Äôs information frequently ran contrary to the government and mass media publication narratives until the pandemic was well underway.Hunt became the filter distributing truth on the coronavirus along the long tail of information that is the internet.In sharing consistent and factual information he became a go-to source of news and growing his reputation. In times past, that would have been the mainstream media or the government's role.Now and moving forward the information flow dynamic that was traditionally monopolized by the media and government has shifted towards the influencer model.A pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home quarantines will put significant stress on telecommunications infrastructure. As we shift to physical decentralization our needs for network access will change. This will lead to an expedited rollout of a 5G network.In a post virus world, we will experience a massive need for remote first technologies. An acceleration in 5G implementation will support a change in societal connectivity demands. This will also support the expedited implementation of exciting VR solutions for remote collaborations and social activities. As a society, we can expect restrictions in social gatherings but humans are fundamentally social creatures. VR represents a solution to this innate need.On the backs of improved network capabilities and the drive for decentralization will be the widespread adoption of IoT. The Internet of Things (IoT) ‚Äî or the digitization of everything ‚Äî occurs when physical objects are manufactured with multi-purpose sensors pre-installed, allowing them to interact with other networked devices.The growth of IoT allows for integrated networks of devices that give increasing levels of control to system administrators.In the aftermath of a pandemic, society will more than likely choose to sacrifice privacy and control to address collective action problems associated with viral spreads. Following the SARS outbreak, China has led the way with Smart City technology to control viral outbreaks. This includes temperature checks at major travel points using thermal scanning cameras to monitor and prevent viral contagion. We can expect to see the adoption of this technology at scale following a major outbreak.IoT implementations can further support Smart Cities by tracking and enforcing quarantine zones, supporting hands-free access transit systems and tracking individuals that may have been exposed to an outbreak.The level of pain and fear inflicted by the Covid-19 outbreak is still unclear but depending on the severity of the outbreak, society may be willing to sacrifice more privacy for preventative technologies.As nations react to their own respective outbreaks, it‚Äôs evident that there are different levels of response. As a direct result of the differences in outcomes from these responses, it‚Äôs clear that a shift to localism will manifest in the wake of the outbreak. Different communities will choose to adopt different smart city solutions according to the needs and desires of their local communities.Localism is an ideological framework that emphasizes taking local responsibility for the needs of the community. This includes emphasizing the importance of local government and local production of goods, services, and supply chains. Localism promotes a macro level decentralization, placing responsibility for communities in their own hands while still being able to fit well within nationalized government systems. Maintaining community autonomy allows for the best decisions to be made at the community level.We can expect nations and large cities to adopt medical reserves. Similar to a strategic petroleum reserve, governments around the world will begin stockpiling pandemic resources as insurance against future outbreaks. Masks, ventilators, medications, and other supplies for frontline workers and volunteers.This will also include more individuals developing in-home pandemic preparations. Bug out bags, quarantine rations, and family planning based on emergency situations.We can expect many societal-level changes from the Covid-19 pandemic. A large majority of the changes were already in the works and will experience an accelerated timeline of adoption. Other unexpected changes will also take place. What is clear, however, is that society is moving further towards the digitization of life. Individuals and governments that embrace these changes will be best prepared for the inevitable future.WRITTEN BY"

Our target query takes about 21 seconds to execute after adding a few extra indexes on the join columns.Using a SQL DB is scalable but old school. We‚Äôll try hipster techniques next.We can scrap the DB overhead and write the data loads and joins directly & tediously in Python:‚Äúmerge()‚Äù is a Nested Loop join without indexes. The loop has to scan the metas and links table for every rating (26m * 50k *2). With 100k reviews, it takes 5min, so 26m reviews will take forever...‚Äúmerge_wmap()‚Äù is a Hash join ‚Äî we build a map for metas and links resulting in O(n*1) performance. Joining 26m rows takes just 3 sec!I did not implement the group-by-filter ‚Äî it would be relatively fast (requires a sort-scan-combine of the 26m row results) ‚Äî I estimate total time to load and process ~ 0:53Raw Python is fast but ugly. Full speed of your local PC and full control of all your bugs.Pandas[2] is the defacto package on Python for data prep. Extremely fast and easy to use, we can do load, join and group with minimal code:Pandas is clever. You do not need to pre-define hashes or indexes, it appears to generate what's needed on the fly to optimize joins. The biggest limit is its existence on a single machine. Processing 26m rows done in ~0:17, with less code and no external systems (DB, Cluster, etc).Pandas file load is way faster than my custom py~ 35sec vs 5sec ! Goes to show don‚Äôt be a hack, use libraries. Pandas is, in theory, its single threaded/process (doesn‚Äôt seem like it on my TaskManager) thus the dataset size is limited by your PC‚Äôs memory.Nonetheless ‚Äî Pandas is the ultimate way to work on small/medium data ‚Äî but we want BIG DATA!SQL is great but limited parallelization and ability to hack with. Python and Pandas are super flexible but lack scalability. Apache Spark [5] is the defacto way to parallelize in-memory operations on big data.Spark has an object called a DataFrame (yes another!) which is just like a Pandas DataFrame and can even load/steal data from it (though you should probably load data via HDFS or the Cloud to avoid BIG data transfer issues):I wrote two Spark join methods. Both run in parallel. The default mode (line 15) will partition your data and shuffle (spread) it around the cluster nodes. The latter ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù mode (line 18) replicates the smaller tables once and only partitions and sends the large table contents. Broadcast mode can be much faster with smaller join tables.Spark divides work across workers nodes (JVMs ‚Äî set to 8 to match my # of CPU cores) ‚Äî to divide and conquer back into an aggregation.

100,Understand and Build FP-Growth Algorithm in Python,https://towardsdatascience.com/understand-and-build-fp-growth-algorithm-in-python-d8b989bab342?source=extreme_main_feed---------103-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"FP-growth is an improved version of the Apriori Algorithm which is widely used for frequent pattern mining(AKA Association Rule Mining). It is used as an analytical process that finds frequent patterns or associations from data sets. For example, grocery store transaction data might have a frequent pattern that people usually buy chips and beer together. The Apriori Algorithm produces frequent patterns by generating itemsets and discovering the most frequent itemset over a threshold ‚Äúminimal support count‚Äù. It greatly reduces the size of the itemset in the database by one simple principle:If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.However, the Apriori Algorithm has a major shortfall. Using Apriori required multiple scans of the database to check the support count of each item and itemsets. When the database is huge, this will cost a significant amount of disk I/O and computing power. Therefore the FP-Growth algorithm is created to overcome this shortfall. It only scans the database twice and used a tree structure(FP-tree) to store all the information. The root represents null, each node represents an item, while the association of the nodes is the itemsets with the order maintained while forming the tree. The FP-tree is concise and is used to directly generating large itemsets. Once an FP-tree has been constructed, it uses a recursive divide-and-conquer approach to mine the frequent itemsets.Let‚Äôs take a look at an example of how to generate an FP-tree. Find all frequent itemsets with support ‚â•2. First, find all items with support count ‚â• 2.Before constructing the FP-tree, reorder the transaction based on their item frequency. When start constructing the FP-tree, we need to create a header table that records the location of all item node with a link list. Each time a new node is added to the tree, it needs to be linked to the last node with the same item. The header table is essential to build conditional FP-tree in the later steps.Now we have scanned the database twice and build the FP-tree. All the transaction information is contained in the tree. The only thing left to be done is to recursively construct the conditional FP-tree to find all frequent itemsets with support count larger than 2. Use the header table we created in the last step and start from the item with the least frequent count to the most(E, D, C, B, A).Finally, we can easily generate all frequent itemsets from those conditional FP-trees {E}, {A, D, E}, {A, E}, {D, E}, {D}, {A, D}, {C, D}, {C}, {A, C}, {B}, {A, B}, {A}.Here is some sample code to build FP-tree from scratch and find all frequency itemsets in Python 3.In conclusion, FP-tree is still the most efficient and scalable method for mining the complete set of frequent patterns in a dataset. Most programming languages including Python, R and even Pyspark have well-supported libraries to generate FP-tree.Thanks for reading and I am looking forward to hearing your questions and thoughts.

101,6 Easy React Tricks That May Surprise You,https://medium.com/better-programming/6-easy-react-tricks-that-may-surprise-you-822f5be43520?source=extreme_main_feed---------104-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"Most of the time I work with React. Over time I‚Äôve come across some simple things that I‚Äôd never thought of before and that gave me real ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments. I‚Äôve also noticed that many people I work with are not aware of these tricks ‚Äî simple things that can make them happy!All the examples below are built around functional components and hooks.Sometimes you need to render multiple components inside lists. If there‚Äôs no need for a container, use React Fragment. Here‚Äôs an example:The code above is totally legit but React will start to complain about keys:You see the error and say ‚ÄúYeah, whatever.‚Äù Then you replace the fragment with a div.Actually, you were on the right track ‚Äî you just missed a tricky point that you may have not have thought about. You can use keys with React Fragment but just not with the syntax you see above. You have to change that syntax with <React.Fragment>, then you‚Äôre good to go:Sometimes you want to create a component that can be a flexible HTML element. Or you may have seen as prop from CSS-in-JS libraries like emotion.Let‚Äôs say that you want to create a <Button> component that can render as a button or an a. What are the options? You could abstract the style and create two different components with it or you could just create a component and use React.createElement with as prop:That‚Äôs fine for a simple component, but what if there‚Äôs another way that looks and feels better? Here‚Äôs the JSX trick:Yes, you can use a string as a component in JSX ‚Äî just make sure that the string component name starts with a capital letter.useState and useEffect are probably the most frequently used hooks. You need to pass your dependencies to useEffect, or expect some bugs or unwanted effects, but, if your dependency is just a state to use with the relative setState, maybe you don‚Äôt need to pass it. Let‚Äôs first see the not-so-good version:There is an easy way to get out of this situation: Using a functional updater form of setState, like this:Here‚Äôs the updated example:This one is a bit of a fun trick that I heard about on Twitter. There‚Äôs no real benefit but it‚Äôs still good to know to understand what useReducer is capable of.If you directly return the action from the useReducer then it behaves almost the same as useState. So you could argue that useState isn‚Äôt necessary. Here‚Äôs the tweet:Here‚Äôs the code that you can copy-paste and try out:Have you ever needed to re-render a component manually? For example, you need to re-render a component but there‚Äôs no state or anything that you can touch to do it. Let‚Äôs say that, for some weird reason, you want to do it when a button is clicked.Here‚Äôs what you can do:That‚Äôs it! You use useState but you don‚Äôt actually need the state itself. You just need the setState function or the rerender function to cause a re-render. The important part is you need to pass a new value every time it runs like an empty object or array.I see this particular mistake pretty often. In order to describe, first, let‚Äôs take a look at the code.The idea is good ‚Äî much better than if/else or switch cases. But there‚Äôs a problem. Every time this component is re-rendered a new cardProps object is created. Even if nothing changes it will cause a re-render for all dependent components.To solve this problem I see that useMemo is used:useMemo solves the problem but everything comes with a cost. If you look at the code carefully you can see that there‚Äôs no reason to put the cardProps object into the component. Naturally, there‚Äôs no need for the useMemo overhead either, because that object doesn‚Äôt have a direct dependency on any props or state. Even if it comes from outside you can still use ...cardProps[types].As you can see ‚Äî no Hooks are needed. Just move things outside if there‚Äôs no need for them to be inside ‚Äî and the same goes for functions.Whenever you think you‚Äôve learned enough you find things that surprise you ‚Äî there is no end to learning.So, keep learning and be surprised!WRITTEN BY"

It‚Äôs about creating a runway and getting a start from which you can build.Once you get your ideas off the ground, then the rest becomes so much easier.So, with that, the remainder of this article will explore how you do it.Here we go:‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to create work that both matters and pleases everyone.‚Äù -Seth GodinOf course, Facebook started out as just a platform designed to connect Harvard students with one another.Indeed, it was not Zuckerberg‚Äôs original plan to create a product that would attract more than 2 billion active users, but rather, to simply get all his classmates to sign up.Mailchimp was born as CEO and Co-Founder, Ben Chestnut couldn‚Äôt be bothered to individually design email newsletters for a stream of clients who wanted them.Thus, he created a tool that would take care of the process for him. Fast-forward to today, and Mailchimp is now an email newsletter service worth over 4 billion dollars.The lesson?Focus on creating a product that scratches the itch for a small group of people, and if it‚Äôs truly worth caring about, then more people will come.For example, I write my articles to the person I was 2 years ago. The one who was addicted to video games, had no real direction in life, and simply needed some encouragement.I‚Äôm not trying to force out any topics that I don‚Äôt agree with myself, and thus, it often resonates.Hence, if you‚Äôre not seeing the results you want, perhaps it‚Äôs time to look for a different and smaller audience. However, don‚Äôt also forget to have a long term vision. Which takes us to the next point:‚ÄúBefore you ever reach a goal, already have the next mountain or two in mind.‚Äù -Benjamin P. HardyIn his book, Zero to One, Peter Thiel explains that when Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, Zuckerberg didn't even consider it. Instead, saying that it was merely a formality.Hence, Peter Thiel further wrote:‚ÄúMark saw where he could take the company, and Yahoo! didn‚Äôt. A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random.‚ÄùIndeed, no matter where you currently are. No matter how good or bad your business is currently doing, you must have a vision of something more.You must see where you want to go in your mind and heart and then work towards it in the here and now.Hence, my frequent recommendation is to ‚ÄúThink Big, Go Small.‚Äù Start with a crazy vision of who you are and where you want to be, and then bring your actions back to reality.It is small, consecutive steps that lead to big success.‚ÄúMost people would rather make a million dollars in their head every night than $100 dollars in cash every day.‚Äù -George Horace LorimerMost people will continue to read about how to make a thousand or a million dollars online and then continue to wonder why they aren't getting anywhere.However, the solution is simple: Make the steps smaller! Of course, Brain Tracy has said,‚ÄúAny goal can be achieved if you break it down into enough small parts.‚ÄùIndeed, it shouldn‚Äôt be about making $1,000 but your first dollar, and the one after that and the one after that ‚Äî each success leads to the next.They say simply getting a rocket off the ground is the hardest part, and making money online is the same.Once your ideas start taking off, then nothing becomes impossible.Like this article?

103,6 Freaky Facts About Flying That Airlines Don‚Äôt Tell You,https://medium.com/refinery29/6-freaky-facts-about-flying-that-airlines-dont-tell-you-c808a7b89eff?source=extreme_main_feed---------106-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"By Allison HopeAs a former airline industry employee, I‚Äôve seen and heard a lot of things that the general flying public, for better or worse, is in the dark about.You may be sitting in the airport waiting to board and see airline employees donning reflective vests and looking harried, while communicating via walkie-talkie, but have no clue what it means (including whether something might be wrong with your plane). You might order a cup of coffee or tea on your flight, ignorant to the fact that it could be crawling with bacteria. You might even be sitting near a dead person (or above one ‚Äî cadavers are common cargo), and never even know it.Ahead, six freaky things airlines don‚Äôt tell passengers that might surprise you.1. Don‚Äôt consume coffee, tea, or prepared food on board.
The water sourced for in-flight hot beverages comes from tanks that are hard to clean and have a higher likelihood of bacteria and other contaminants. In other words, steer clear of anything that requires tap water ‚Äî coffee, tea, etc. ‚Äî and drink only bottled water. Also, don‚Äôt eat the food on board unless it comes in a sealed bag from a specific brand. LSG Sky Chefs, one of the largest contractors providing meals to airlines, frequently gets slapped with health violations, and the conditions under which it prepares food are often less than savoury. (Of course, that doesn‚Äôt go for all airlines, as some international carriers, like Emirates and Singapore, are known for their excellent food.)2. Airlines retire numbers that are bad luck.
The majority of airline employees, especially pilots, are the most level-headed, pragmatic people you‚Äôll ever meet. But they also tend to be incredibly superstitious about certain things. That‚Äôs probably why flight numbers go into retirement once they‚Äôre associated with a negative incident. Among the grounded numbers of routes past are American Airlines flight 77, which crashed on 9/11; Malaysian Airlines 370, which disappeared over the China Sea last year; and Pan Am flight 103, which came down en route from Frankfurt to Detroit, in an incident now known simply as Lockerbie, the village where the plane crashed following an explosion.3. Think twice before using the seat-back tray.
That seat-back tray you eagerly lower for beverage or snack service or to rest your laptop on may come with some unwanted surprises. Like, say, fecal matter. Passengers often use the trays as their own private diaper changing tables, and sadly, they are cleaned far less than you‚Äôd be comforted to know. Next time you fly, bring antibacterial wipes for the seat-back tray before you touch it, let alone eat off of it.4. No one seat is safer than any other.
There‚Äôs an ongoing debate about where to sit on a plane to increase your odds of surviving a plane crash. Analyses have even shown that, on average, more people have survived sitting toward the back of the plane behind the wing than in the front. But if you ask any industry professional, they‚Äôll tell you something different. If the plane is nose-diving from 30,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean, sorry, but you‚Äôre out of luck no matter where you sit. If the mid or back sections of the plane are ground zero for impact, sitting in the back actually puts you in harm‚Äôs way more than say, if you‚Äôre in the cockpit. Airplane crashes are incredibly rare, but your chances of survival will depend on the circumstances of the emergency.5. Virtually every plane has something wrong with it.
Much like how you may know that your car is due for an oil change but make a calculated decision to wait until next week to deal with it, airplanes have routine scheduled maintenance, and certain problems might not be dealt with until that time. The formula that determines whether and when a problem is addressed takes into account both severity and risk, whether there are backup systems for that functionality, and when the plane is scheduled for maintenance (or to land at an airport where the airline has the capacity, parts, and people to fix it). But don‚Äôt worry: If it‚Äôs a big enough problem that it poses a real threat to safety, they will take the aircraft out of service for repairs.6. Gross things happen on planes all the time.
Life happens ‚Äî and for some reason, it seems to happen more intensely on airplanes. Blame it on the altitude, but people tend to do crazy things when they‚Äôre flying. They have sex (including often with themselves); they drink cheap chardonnay on a 6 a.m. flight to Fort Lauderdale and barf all over the place (in fact, seats are the most swapped-out equipment on planes). And people bite the dust mid-flight more often than you might think (usually it‚Äôs older people with heart conditions). When someone dies in-flight, a plane will often divert to the nearest city, but sometimes, people slip away so quietly that no one notices until they don‚Äôt get up from their seats upon landing.

104,The Complete Guide to Proper Marketing Automation,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-complete-guide-to-proper-marketing-automation-4710dfb38fc3?source=extreme_main_feed---------107-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"Marketing Automation (MA) historically has been perceived as a magic solution for most businesses' growth problems. Many business and marketing ‚Äúexperts‚Äù are obsessed with automation, preventing them from strategically thinking about their customers and instead relying on tools to automate as much as they can without a clear or realistic goal in mind.Regardless of all the noise made by mainstream media and marketing technology companies, marketers still struggling with their jobs.According to Hubspot, 40% of marketers have issues proving the effectiveness of their efforts to their bosses.Why are they struggling? In simple terms, their approach is wrong. Most marketers lack a strategic approach to marketing automation and instead focus their attention on tools.This rather common approach leads businesses to automate their customer journey without context, forcing automation through the funnel with arbitrary touchpoints and irrelevant content, generating friction points, jeopardizing customer relationships, and increasing CAC in the long run.This guide will teach you how to use marketing automation to acquire, convert and retain users and distills the overwhelming world of marketing automation into something easily actionable. By executing the concepts in this article you will have the apparatus to focus your attention on long term results while saving money on tools that aren‚Äôt contributing to your bottom line.To make this guide a complete reference for marketing automation, I‚Äôve spent a few months fine-tuning it to include case studies and software reviews.Interested? Good. If you aren‚Äôt willing to spend one to two years paying for tools/courses to get results with MA this guide is for you.Before we dig deeper into marketing automation as a concept and its implications, it is important to define it:Marketing automation (MA) is an optimization process of the user journey through the application of technology to monitor, control and deliver meaningful marketing activities (automation). It aims to easily connect and map customer interactions across multiple touchpoints, in order to direct or influence the end-to-end experience.Before we get to specifics on how to effectively use marketing automation, I‚Äôd like to briefly cover three important concepts:According to HBR, most businesses go through four phases:Everything you do should be prioritized based on your business phase.CLTV is a metric aiming to measure the profit your company can make from a customer over time. It is crucial for service-based economies as businesses increasingly generate revenue from the creation of long-term relationships with their customers. The whole purpose of marketing should be maximizing customer lifetime value and customer equity.CAC is a calculation of the total cost of acquiring a new customer and it must include the total marketing cost over the actual number of acquired customers. CAC will help you identify profitable marketing channels and activities.Now that you understand the above concepts, let‚Äôs determine whether or not you should start using marketing automation in your businessAs a rule of thumb, you should not invest in marketing automation if your business hasn‚Äôt achieved the following milestones:First of all focus on audience needs. Remember, your audience is your business judge, jury and executioner. Every user within your audience is unique, but you can use certain attributes and behavioral triggers to predict what their pain points and expectations are.Use the Jobs To Be Done framework. for categorizing, defining, capturing, organizing all your customer‚Äôs needs, and tying them up with customer-defined performance metrics.A customer journey map is a visual representation of every experience your users have with your business regardless of the channel or device. Building a comprehensive customer journey map will help you assess your overall business experience from a customer‚Äôs perspective.‚ÄúThe end goal of a CJM is to improve customers experience at each touchpoint‚ÄùMarketing automation can be used throughout the whole customer journey, from building awareness to cultivating a dedicated user base. It is especially powerful in the conversion stage, helping you boost revenue.Goal: Acquire as many qualified users as possible at the lowest possible CACIn early acquisition stages, marketing automation can help you identify successful marketing activities and content ideas/types that attract your audience around the product or service you‚Äôre offering.Once you are aware of effective marketing methods and content ideas, the distribution and optimization of these messages can be easily managed with marketing automation. Things like relevant posts on Facebook, the right blog post in the specific period of the month or a delivery method that fits the customers‚Äô lifestyle could be a detail that makes a difference.Goal: Generate active engagement from acquired users before they‚Äôve reached the point of buying intent (increase users‚Äô probability of becoming a high-quality sales opportunity).Websites and products activate users by providing value. Marketing automation helps you address customers‚Äô needs and expectations by easily delivering the right message to the right people at the right time. Make sure you always give your audience a reason to read your emails or visit your web pages, so your engagement metrics are good and customers don‚Äôt lose interest in your product over time.Generally speaking, a metric like TTV (Time to Value) will help assess your activation process ‚Äî A short TTV normally means customers get a return on their investment of time faster ‚Äî and that means they are more likely to stick around!Goal: Once you activate your users, you need to make sure users continue to use your product or service.Marketing automation uses customers' attributes and behavioral information to deliver personalized content/messaging (Follow-up email campaigns, A/B testing, etc) and optimize marketing operations. In short, everything is automated based on specific segments.Your Retention Rate depends on your business model and the product/service you‚Äôre offering, in general businesses with high ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) tend to have the lowest Churn Rate (a business with high churn rate would by default have a lower retention rate).Goal: User MonetizationThere are multiple monetization models (see image below), however marketing automation will help you monetize your audience regardless of the model. With marketing automation, you can automate cross-sell, upsell and promotions activities based on user behaviors by defining triggers and workflows ‚Äî triggers are key events in the customer and business lifecycle and workflows are a series of automated actions that you can trigger to occur based on a person‚Äôs behaviors or contact information.Goal: Encourage existing customers to drive their friends, colleagues, and family members to buy from you.Positive word-of-mouth can significantly drive your business growth when leveraged through a systematic rewards program for fans, customers, influencers, and affiliates. MA helps you optimizing the user segmentation process and automate the incentivization process via emails, landing pages or chatbots.We have created an interactive checklist to help you find out whether or not marketing automation is a good idea for your business:‚ÄúMarketing automation historically has really focused on static experiences while requiring the business to create every unique experience. ‚Äú ‚ÄîJason VandeBoom, Founder and CEO at ActiveCampaignNowadays every website collects lots of customer data through user interactions like emails, website visits, app usage, etc. This data is the lifeblood of a business and it is used by marketing automation tools to easily streamline the journey for multiple users providing a unique experience based on their attributes and behaviors. Here‚Äôs how marketing automation techs work:‚ÄúMarketing automation‚Äù as a concept was first introduced by John D.C. Little in a presentation at UC Berkeley in 2001. The concept initially referred to an automated marketing decision-making process supported on the internet and solving one essential problem: ‚ÄúWhat do we tell retailer X to do when customer Y arrives on Monday morning?‚ÄùHe suggested businesses need to analyze the digital footprints of customer Y and use appropriate models to come up with meaningful managerial touchpoints across the whole purchase funnel. Such an automated marketing decision support promises enhanced productivity, better decision-making, higher returns on marketing investments, and increased customer satisfaction and loyalty through customization of marketing activities.Marketing automation has been a growing trend for the last two decades. According to Google Trends, the interest over time around marketing automation has grown exponentially around the world.As Scott Brinker pointed out in his 2019 research on the marketing technology landscape, even though the landscape has grown by double digits year on year it seems like the industry is plateauing as the overall growth for 2019 was 3%. This isn‚Äôt the case for Marketing Automation Platforms, where over the last four years we have seen more and more evolving and tools entering the market (most traditional email marketing platforms now offer marketing automation solutions).As shown above, the future of marketing automation looks promising and it is expected to be adopted for more and more businesses as the industry evolves and prices decrease over time. But if you‚Äôre not familiar with MA, you might not be convinced that it‚Äôs worth your time or money. Here are some interesting stats highlighting the key benefits it offers your business.Some general benefits are obvious in the long run, and these are:Here are more specific examples across different types of business and how they are using marketing automation to grow:Today, you can find an endless number of marketing automation tools, but there are only a few of them that are reliable according to the users.

It‚Äôs one of the city‚Äôs landmarks, a concert hall opening onto the main plaza.Every day, I get to watch construction workers pick at it, little by little: they first gutted it out almost entirely, demolishing everything but the outside walls, a few internal walls and the main pillars of the construction. What was once the place where my parents came to see me in dancing shows (I had a dancing moment as a teenager), was now a bare concrete structure.They then slowly started rebuilding, at first roaming inside, moving cables and reinstalling pipes, then adding a bit of height and putting in new window frames.One day, as I was journaling about my own slow progress towards my dreams and looking over the messy construction site, it hit me.There‚Äôs this thing I never thought about that‚Äôs part of the process of rebuilding a building, and it‚Äôs part of the process of rebuilding a life. A thing that a lot of people just won‚Äôt do to themselves, myself included.Think about this for a moment.You can slap on a fresh coat of paint on your life, but if you want it transformed in a massive way, you can‚Äôt do it without demo day. It‚Äôs in all interior design shows that are now so popular. The first thing they do is swing a hammer at what was to create what will be.‚ÄúIf you want to fly in the sky, you need to leave the earth. If you want to move forward, you need to let go the past that drags you down.‚Äù ‚Äî Amit RayHammers hurt, so if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre afraid of them. What would this mean? What exactly has to be removed from you and what gets to stay? Will you ever be yourself again if you go this far?It‚Äôs an irreversible process, so you have to decide now.You don‚Äôt know what you have to give up.When I was young, I thought to achieve the things I wanted to achieve, I had to give up having a family. Then I had a family.Since then, a tiny voice inside me was telling me that I‚Äôd missed my chance in making it big. That it was too late for me, that I didn‚Äôt have the freedom anymore to make the necessary decisions.A few nights ago, I watched Dark Phoenix and at the end Jean Grey, the main character, who‚Äôs always been told that her emotions make her weak, said‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong. My emotions make me strong.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not the best screenwriting in the world, I know, but it was an aha moment for me. Your emotions could make you weaker or stronger, depending on how you deal with them. Your family could make you weaker or stronger, depending on how you see it.Until that moment, I saw my family as one of the things I had to remove to succeed. In turn, I saw myself, my confidence and my deep-seated knowledge about how the world works as the foundations of my life and the reasons behind everything meaningful I‚Äôve achieved.I was wrong. My family is now the foundation of my building. The love and support I receive from them make me stronger, not weaker. Remove that and I‚Äôll collapse in on myself.The things that have to go are my self-sufficiency, my desire to compete with everyone around me, my inclination to listen not to hear, but to respond and to impress.That‚Äôs the first step. We all know it intellectually, but emotionally, we stick to what we are. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been since we were kids, and we‚Äôve been building on top of it for years and decades, to the point where it feels like if you pull at one thread, the whole thing will unravel.But the people you look up to, they‚Äôve pulled at that thread. They were scared to do it, but they did it. It was difficult, but they did it. They saw all the positives of remaining who they were, and yet they knew it wouldn‚Äôt be enough for the next level, so they adapted.It starts with awareness. First, you must realize that you do need this, that you can‚Äôt build your new life on top of things that don‚Äôt serve you anymore.Then, you must do a lot of inner work to identify what must go and what must stay. Whether you choose to do it on your own, through journaling, meditation, prayer or get professional help from a life coach or a therapist, it‚Äôs your call. You know best what‚Äôs best for you.‚ÄúIn the process of letting go, you will lose many things from the past, but you will find yourself.‚Äù ‚Äî Deepak ChopraSome of the things you‚Äôll have to change will be internal, some will be external. Plan them all carefully. Consider how they‚Äôll affect your life, consider how difficult implementing each change will be and start small. It‚Äôll get you going.Then cut the umbilical cord and don‚Äôt look back. It‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs done. There‚Äôs a void there now, I know, but it‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs what you needed.Give yourself time to reset your focus on what you want. Be careful not to fill this void with the expectations of others, or with your imposter syndrome. Fill it instead with what matters. What matters? What matters enough to give you the strength to do this?Now you have it. The one skill of successful people that no one talks about ‚Äî being able to swing a hammer and demolish you.You‚Äôre only at the beginning, but the beginning is the hardest part. If you did this, you‚Äôre ready. Good luck on your way up.WRITTEN BY"
106,Alien Appetites,https://medium.com/predict/alien-appetites-2b62fc2306a1?source=extreme_main_feed---------109-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"The idea that the alien life forms we may someday make contact with will want little more than simply to rip us limb from limb and devour our flesh to satiate their interstellar appetites isn‚Äôt new. It‚Äôs definitely been one of the most basic notions about extraterrestrial life since the early 20th century and Orson Welles‚Äô War of the Worlds radio broadcast.However, aliens weren‚Äôt always the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù. In the earliest days of thought regarding potential alien life, after the Copernican Revolution began and the invention of the telescope and proof that there were many other celestial bodies, the idea that some of those places might indeed harbor life of the alien variety began to be taken seriously by the scientific community. These versions of extraterrestrial life were often seen as possibly much like life on Earth: living in a natural order of their own and created by the same God (for those who believed). The very notion that they were so distant wasn‚Äôt quite developed by that point ‚Äî we could hardly conceive of interstellar distances at that point ‚Äî but this new knowledge definitely kindled the imaginations of centuries‚Äô worth of scientists, philosophers and writers.Much of the focus early on was on the planets in our own Solar System, particularly Mars and the gas giants. Giordano Bruno, an Italian philosopher of the 1500s, thought that every single star system was extremely similar to our own, an infinite universe where planets with life abounded. Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita, a 17th century Czech astronomer, supposed that Jupiter‚Äôs inhabitants, if it had any, would be taller and appear more resplendent than we humans on Earth ‚Äî because, of course, the inhabitants would reflect the appearance of their planet, would they not?By the early 1900s, Mars had taken over the popular and scientific imagination when it came to the discussion of alien life, following the telescopic observations that showed ‚Äúcanals‚Äù on the Red Planet. H. G. Wells had written his War of the Worlds novel, kicking off what would become a common theme regarding alien life throughout the next 100+ years. Astronomer, businessman and founder of the Lowell Observatory in Arizona believed that the canals were evidence of a long-lost Martian civilization. Before the 1910s, though, improved telescopes and spectroscopic analysis ruled out the canals as being built by some advanced Martian people, as well as the possibility that Mars had a life-sustaining atmosphere.The hopes for Martian life never died out completely, though, and ideas that Martian civilization had either fled the planet long before or moved into underground cities flourished. Jules Verne, Garrett P. Serviss and Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote about life on Mars and in other seemingly inhospitable places like the ‚Äúcenter of the Earth‚Äù during this time as well. The mid-20th century became a time of vast potential for life in the cosmos as science fiction grew into a strong genre across all forms of media.Our collective desire to look for life outside of Earth became known as SETI ‚Äî the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. This began with telescopic observation and progressed to monitoring for radio signals as the 20th century wore on. Astronomer Frank Drake‚Äôs Project Ozma was perhaps the first focused use of radio telescope technology as he looked specifically at Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, both relatively close (10‚Äì12 light years) and fairly good candidates at the time for exoplanets. Despite finding nothing interesting, radio astronomy became the primary tool for SETI scientists. It is reasoned that any intelligent life that has been around long enough will at some point develop radio technology, and we will therefore be able to detect their presence.Despite the optimistic drive behind much of this research, the idea that our interstellar neighbors might not be very friendly continued to persist. There were 3 notable peaks of this point of view in the 20th century: War of the Worlds, Day of the Triffids, and the Alien/s films. All of these representations have the aliens killing us humans in one way or another for various purposes.The alien invasion trope grew to huge proportions and to this day consumes nearly half of the entire science fiction genre. Aliens want to: get rid of humans and live on Earth in our stead; interbreed with humans; kill all humans to prevent us from becoming a spacefaring civilization; use us for Mengele-like experimentation; or treat the Earth like a giant smorgasbord.Indeed, sending our own radio signals and probes out into space might amount to us announcing the arrival of a new fast food chain to a host of hungry aliens.The idea that aliens might want to eat us is actually not grounded in science at all. We would need to have compatible biochemistries, which is unlikely given the probable differences in ratios of elements on alien worlds. Even if water is a prerequisite for life, that in itself would not dictate biochemical suitability. Sure, there is almost definitely alien life that would be hostile to us ‚Äî whether because they see us as a threat or simply because that is how they react to anything that might resemble their prey ‚Äî but after those creatures get one taste of us they will simply spit us out or possibly even die when the iron in our blood poisons them.There are more reasons why an advanced alien species probably wouldn‚Äôt want to do us harm. For instance, if they were masters of interstellar travel it would also be likely they would be able to see the efficiency of mechanization over enslaving another species to do their work for them. Why go through all that trouble when you could just create robots that can do all the work for you ‚Äî including making more robots? Interbreeding wouldn‚Äôt work for the same reason that aliens probably won‚Äôt be able to eat us: a mismatch of biochemistry.Would aliens want our natural resources? Again, if your species can cross galactic-scale distances they wouldn‚Äôt have a need for petrochemicals or coal. Water is available in greater quantities elsewhere beyond Earth ‚Äî even in our own Solar System there is far more water on Europa, and E.T. won‚Äôt have to fight anyone to procure it. The same goes for valuable elements like helium, iridium, tungsten, gold and platinum. Those can be found in gas giants and the asteroid belt.Even if all life really does need water and for their homeworld to be located within a star‚Äôs habitable ‚ÄúGoldilocks‚Äù zone, it would be doubtful a technologically superior race would bother traveling so far to colonize Earth when they could probably use some of their vast know-how to terraform planets much nearer to their original location. In fact, we‚Äôve discovered hundreds of such worlds that might be good terraforming candidates.Based on these ideas, the most likely reason why some alien intelligence might visit our Solar System might be to just visit us on some mission of exploration. Looking at ourselves, our trajectory into the near future seems to be one of building orbital bases and eventually settling a large population on Mars. By the time we have the tech to reliably reach our nearest stellar neighbor (Proxima Centauri at 4.23 light years), we will be well on our way to turning Mars into a sister-Earth. The main reason for us to make that journey would be to see what‚Äôs there‚Ä¶and who‚Äôs there.We won‚Äôt be going into deep space to find food or to blow up anyone we find. We‚Äôll be going there with open minds‚Ä¶not open mouths. In all likelihood, the same logic will apply to our cosmic cousins.Thank you for reading and sharing!WRITTEN BY"
107,Roadways‚Ä¶ in the Sky?,https://medium.com/swlh/roadways-in-the-sky-e0db39a6b1a4?source=extreme_main_feed---------110-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"Remember those busy high school hallways when everyone was in transit between classes? Ever wondered why they were so painfully congested? The problem was that everyone used the same hallway, but had a different purpose and use for the space. Some people were busy at their lockers, others navigated to their next class, on occasion, teachers pushed carts down the hall, and many people stood around in groups blocking all the flow.These inefficiencies are present on our modern roadways.For example, the commuter driving to work shares the same road with; the mailman who is trying to find a spot to park, the delivery truck trying to negotiate tight streets, the city bus that stops every block, and millions of other vehicles.Everyone shares the same road system, despite using it differently with unique objectives. Consequently, the same congestion present in high school hallways is prevalent in our roadway system. Clearly, this system is not ideal.What if, instead of depending on the same two dimensional road system for all our transit needs, we used three dimensional airspace to revolutionize transportation? Through the use of drones, deliveries can be conducted in the air, alleviating stress on road systems by eliminating diverse road uses.Companies such as FedEx, Amazon, and Uber are all developing drone systems for delivery and are showing potential. This interest proves there is promise in the idea; however, without a standardized framework, commercialized drone usage can not be scaled and fully leveraged.Currently, airspace for drones is like driving cars without roads. They can be operated, but due to the lack of a structured framework to follow, there is a heightened risk of accidents as volumes increase. Consequently, there are strict restrictions in place on drone usage for the sake of safety that limit the opportunity to scale their widespread use.By creating an ‚Äúartificial‚Äù (virtual) road system for drones, operators will have airways to follow as a way to control and regulate air traffic, allowing more drones to be in the air.Faculty at UC Berkeley have identified an opportunity to implement this framework and have created a prototype drone air traffic control system. Their framework has three key components that are each crucial in ensuring the system works practically in the real world.Through their cloud-based platform, UC Berkeley can catalogue all buildings, spaces and landing areas in order to define airways. Above each building, the owner has rights to the parcel of air above their land. Owners can register the height of their building and deny access around their building to create a no-fly zone (represented by red buildings in the figure).Berkeley anticipates that insurance companies will incentivize owners to register their buildings so that all liability falls onto the operator not the building owner. This incentive will quicken the process of filling the database.With this database, the system can design airways, and can calculate flight paths for drones. Overall, this platform works similar to Google Maps.2. Drone classification and law enforcementThe airway framework will allow drones to fly in more structured patterns, meaning more drones can be in the sky; however, even if one person breaks the rules, the result could be catastrophic for the system. Therefore, it is crucial that a) all drones in the air are registered and are using the framework, and b) drones are following the rules set by the system.To ensure all operational drones are registered and are using the framework, real-time identification is necessary so law enforcement can intervene. Legally operating drones will be able to transmit position and heading information through a server in real time, whereas unregistered drones won‚Äôt. The transmitted data will match up with information provided to law enforcement that shows the expected air traffic in an area. Drones in the air that don‚Äôt match the dataset can be identified and safely terminated as result.To ensure all drones are following their provided airways and rules, flight data will be sent to a server that automatically checks for violations, and can charge fines accordingly.Overall, this two levelled system will optimize safe travel in the air.3. Control functions and collision avoidanceSince drones share similar low-altitude airspace with helicopters, there is upmost importance that drones do not conflict with manned vehicles. Having a system that actively avoids helicopters, while mitigating changes to flight paths will ensure seamless transit for drones and helicopters alike.The FAA mandated that all aircraft flying in the US are required to be equipped with an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), which is just a fancy name for a device that allows aircraft to communicate. This device allows for cooperative avoidance between drones and helicopters.As the unmanned vehicle, it is the drone‚Äôs responsibility to avoid the helicopter. The helicopter cooperates by transmitting its position, heading, and velocity through the ADS-B, so drones can calculate the optimal avoidance maneuver and prevent conflicts.UC Berkeley‚Äôs work is an important first step, but there are still many limitations of the technology. For example, as drone volumes continue to increase, there needs to be more rigid enforcement to eliminate unregistered drones from being in the sky. As well, the system can get drones from point A to B, but when drones begin to intersect paths, traffic flows will need to be regulated, similar to traffic lights and road signs.Overall, current technologies are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the possibilities of drone travel.As technologies continue to advance, both with drones and air traffic control, the sky is (literally) the limit when it comes to the realm of possibilities.Three main areas of opportunity are layered drone networks, autonomous drones, and providing the ability to transport people in drones.Layered Networks:Currently, drone airways are similar to current road systems, and those unbearable high school hallways; they are fixed on two dimensional planes. A layered airway system would be an effective way to go three dimensional, allowing for the maximization of airspace, and also separate drones that have different purposes in the air.Different altitudes of airspace can be used for unique purposes, similar to how different radio frequencies represent unique stations. For example, lower layers can be for slower, short distance flights, whereas higher layers can be for faster and longer flights. This system will increase efficiency across each layer due to higher consistency of usage, so there will be less congestion.Autonomous Drones Networks:While drones have the ability operate autonomously, they do so independently. Beyond the ADS-B that prevents imminent collisions, there are no frameworks in place to coordinate networks of drones.By communicating with each other, drones can optimize traffic flows, and proactively anticipate the situation of all other drones around it. For example, if one drone needs to slow down to make a turn, the network will know in advance since the drone would already be in communication with the system. As a result, all other drones could proactively adapt so that the system does not get backed up behind it.This network would also lead to a greater airway capacity, allowing for increased drone volumes, and an optimization of airspace.Human Transport:If parcels can be transported via drones, why can‚Äôt humans? There are several risks involved with human drone travel, but with the right system in place, the outcomes are incredible.Uber as already been preparing for their 2023 launch of Uber Air, a drone ride-sharing service. Particularly beneficial for intercity travel, with Uber Air, a nearly 2 hour drive from San Francisco to San Jose would be cut to a mere 15 minutes.Due to low volumes of drone traffic, in the short term, Uber Air will be relatively safe. However, as airways get more crowded, risks will increase. Therefore, with the integration of the previous two measures, namely layered airways and autonomous systems, safety for human transport will be optimal.Overall, with the advancement of drone air traffic control, transportation will finally be able to graduate from the halls of high school.WRITTEN BY"

Just like you want to feel appreciated and wanted, so does your partner.Whether you‚Äôve been married for years or freshly swiped right on each other, romance is always the answer.And while there are romantic things you can do for your partner, there are also romantic things you can say. Gestures go a long way, but for some people, words mean a lot more.And you don‚Äôt need to be Shakespeare or write poetic love letters to do this. You just need to know a few phrases to let us know we matter to you:This phrase is a lot better than ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù While giving thanks has its time and place, ‚ÄúI appreciate you‚Äù feels much more personal.Showing appreciation lets your partner know that everything they do for you isn‚Äôt going unnoticed. Sometimes, all anyone needs is a little appreciation.Let me be clear here: I‚Äôm not saying to throw around apologies.But sometimes, people get a little too high on our horses. And while you might want to stay up there, it‚Äôs detrimental to a relationship to do so for too long.If you yelled at your partner or did something to upset them, an apology can diffuse the tension and remind them you care.All too often, I hear about couples arguing like they‚Äôre on opposing teams.But in a partnership, the goal should always be to fix problems to benefit the relationship and each other.And if that‚Äôs the case, then there‚Äôs no need to yell or fight. Remind your partner you‚Äôre on their team. You‚Äôre not against them; you‚Äôre in this with them.People talk about their problems or interests in a way that other people can‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs hard to realize when you‚Äôre talking at a high-level about something so close to you.So instead of pretending like you understand, ask your partner to explain things to you. Not only will you better understand what‚Äôs going on, but your partner will also appreciate that you care enough to ask questions.It seems like a small phrase, but the implications behind it are far more.When someone anticipates your needs and cares enough to take the initiative, the result is a whole lot of romance. You may just be handing her a glass of water, but you‚Äôre also letting her know you care about her well-being.In an argument, people usually jump to trying to fix things or shutting off completely.This is why it baffles me that more people don‚Äôt simply say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù Because that‚Äôs usually the case.If you find yourself in an argument, try saying this to your partner. Tensions will ease, and perhaps you can come to a solution together.Your partner comes home and relays to you how shitty their boss treated them.What do you do? Try to tell them how to fix it? Or tell your partner to let it go?Both are actually unhelpful. Most of the time, people just want to be heard. Letting your partner know you understand how upsetting that situation was validates their feelings; most of the time, that‚Äôs all anyone wants.If you want to let your partner know you want to help, this phrase will do just that.Chances are, you don‚Äôt know what will help them at that moment. Instead of trying to guess, simply ask your partner if there is anything you can do for them.Only say this phrase if you actually feel this way.Often, romance is focused so much on the love aspect. But the friendship part of a relationship is just as important. Women want to know they mean something to you, to the extent that you enjoy hanging out with them.It‚Äôs one thing to get someone flowers. It‚Äôs another to be out and about and see something that reminds you of your partner.If that ever happens, I suggest taking a photo or buying the thing. Your partner will be so happy, even if it‚Äôs the silliest gift or sign you saw. The simple idea that you were thinking of them throughout your day is great to know.And if you don‚Äôt see anything that reminds you of them, this phrase is totally acceptable to send sporadically.When you‚Äôre both busy at work and focused on your days, a little reminder that you think of your partner will make her feel special; I guarantee this will put a smile on her face, no matter how stressful the day.Compliments that aren‚Äôt focused on her physical appearance are going to go a long way.Growing up, women mostly hear comments about their looks. While I still suggest letting her know she‚Äôs beautiful, also make sure to comment on her other qualities. She‚Äôll appreciate knowing that you admire her for many qualities.And of course, the ultimate romantic phrase is giving away the last cheesy slice of pizza.You want it. We know you want it. But the fact that your willing to give it up is the ultimate sacrifice. What‚Äôs more romantic than that?If you‚Äôre looking to let your partner know how much you mean to them, try incorporating these phrases into your life more.Remember, romance is always something to keep up in a relationship. Everyone wants to feel special.Want to stay up to date with our top-performing posts each week? Sign up for email updates by following this link.WRITTEN BY"
109,I Worked Out Every Day For 30 Days‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää& This Was The Biggest Thing I Learned,https://medium.com/refinery29/i-worked-out-every-day-for-30-days-this-was-the-biggest-thing-i-learned-1d1af9f19498?source=extreme_main_feed---------112-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"By Jessica ChouPretty much everyone knows someone who is constantly going to the gym, training for a marathon, or eating a kale salad for lunch after an intense morning workout. Unfortunately for my health, I am not that person.I am the person who loves to sleep in, considers stretching to be legit exercise, and refuses to buy a pair of running shoes (why bother, when they‚Äôll never get used?). I‚Äôll eat the kale salad, sure, but forgo the morning workout.But I don‚Äôt want to be this way. As most adults know, exercise is an important part of being alive and healthy ‚Äî and even my lazy ass can recognise that my sedentary lifestyle isn‚Äôt ideal. So I decided to try the lowest of low bars and see if I could work out for seven minutes, every day, for 30 days straight.The ‚Äúseven-minute workout‚Äù first made news back in 2013, when an article in the American College of Sports Medicine‚Äôs Health & Fitness Journal claimed a short, high-intensity interval training- (HIIT) based workout with 12 varying movements could be just as effective as a longer, less-intense session. The New York Times Magazine picked up the concept and branded it ‚ÄúThe Scientific 7-Minute Workout,‚Äù and a short-workout movement was born. Proof: the endless amount of HIIT fitness DVDs and classes out there today.Back then, my exercise ambitions peaked at a ballet class I made it to every other week, and truthfully, I didn‚Äôt give working out a second thought. Nowadays, however, I‚Äôm feeling less invincible than I used to. After a trip with my friends where they bribed me with gelato to do a daily five-minute workout with them, I was finally intrigued enough to try it on my own. After all, even I should be able to exercise for less than 10 minutes. And that‚Äôs the idea.‚ÄúA lot of the time when you think about exercise, you think of a class that‚Äôs going to be an hour long, and an hour is intimidating,‚Äù Brett Klika, a personal trainer and the author of 7 Minutes To Fit, tells me over the phone. His book ‚Äî and method, which draws upon the ideas posited in that now-famous ACSM article ‚Äî is meant to make working out feel slightly more accessible.Of course, seven minutes isn‚Äôt technically enough exercise, even if you do it daily (sorry to burst your bubble): The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, per week for overall cardiovascular health. So 49 minutes a week, even at high intensity, is hardly going to cut it. But if you‚Äôre a total non-exerciser like me, starting with something small and manageable helps you ease in, Klika says, and that can lead you to bigger and more intense workouts.So did it work? Here‚Äôs what I learned during my 30-day quest to becoming a little more fit and active.This is how Klika‚Äôs book takes on the seven-minute workout: Each chapter focuses on strengthening sections of your body (upper body, lower body, abs, or whole body). Every page within the chapter gives you a full workout of 10 movements (planks, lunges, push-ups, sit-ups, etc.). You do as much of one movement as you can for 30 seconds, then take a 10-second break before moving on to the next one. If timed perfectly, the entire thing should take 6 minutes and 40 seconds.The first couple of days of my experiment, however, I spent more time thinking about working out than actually working out. Instead of randomly choosing a set of exercises and getting it over with, I would pore over Klika‚Äôs book to find a page that didn‚Äôt include anything I felt silly doing, like shadow boxing or worm walkouts.I eventually had to face the fact that sometimes I would feel dumb, and that‚Äôs fine ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also totally fine to swap those exercises out for something I can do without cringing. When I felt silly running agility circles (what exactly are those good for, anyway?), I would half-ass the movement and get even less of a workout ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt that great when you‚Äôre only getting seven minutes of exercise a day to begin with.At first, 10 seemed like so many exercises for someone who doesn‚Äôt know a barbell from a dumbbell. (Seriously ‚Äî my editor added that. I don‚Äôt really know what those terms mean.) So I decided to start with just five movements and repeat the set to get up to seven minutes total.After one week of repeating 5 exercises, however, I realised I was zoning out 3.5 minutes in, right after the first set.Turns out, there‚Äôs a reason why the book offers 10 exercises. Not only is repeating a set boring, it also means doing the things I hated (like, you guessed it, shadow boxing) not just once, but twice. Instead of trying something new, I had to spend another 30 seconds punching aimlessly at the air.One week into the experiment, I switched to doing a full set of 10 exercises ‚Äî and powered through the movements that made me feel silly for a mere 30 seconds before moving onto something else. It made the moderately embarrassing exercises less embarrassing, and made the entire routine more palatable. You only have to do this for 30 seconds, I would tell myself, before starting a round of burpees.There are some things workout buddies are good for ‚Äî holding you accountable for going to the gym; telling you you‚Äôre doing push-ups wrong; maybe even spotting you a few bucks for a coconut water at the end of a particularly gruelling workout. But while my boyfriend at the time did decide to join in on a few workout sessions, I found myself committing more to the workout when he wasn‚Äôt there.Why? Being around people, especially while exercising, makes me feel extremely self conscious ‚Äî and it‚Äôs even worse when I know the people around me. I can go to a barre class and feel stupid but still not care because I don‚Äôt know any of these people. But with people I care about? Well, let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm a little insecure ‚Äî and that insecurity would often get in the way of a perfectly effective workout.I confess, just going from zero exercise to 7 minutes of it made me sore for three whole days. It‚Äôs embarrassing, but true.‚ÄúConsidering all of the different movements in the workout, it will probably make you sore for the first week,‚Äù Klika told me over email, noting that he typically tells clients to take a break in between days when they‚Äôre first starting off. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid to take a day off.‚ÄùOf course, I didn‚Äôt listen, and instead half-heartedly attempted the workouts for the following two days. I still wonder if I would have recovered more quickly, and been able to work out more effectively, if I had just let my body rest.I did end up doing a workout every single day, but I know there were days when I should have just skipped it. Day 10, for example, ended with me having a bit too much wine with dinner, but I powered through a workout only to have a searing headache after jumping jacks. ‚ÄúSome of the workout was hell ‚Äî do not recommend,‚Äù I wrote in my daily notes. My editor later told me that exercising under the influence is actually really unsafe, so I repeat: Don‚Äôt work out while drunk. The bragging rights are not worth it.Despite the fact that 49 minutes of physical activity a week is not nearly enough exercise for a grown woman, I still experienced noticeable results. I never had a magical moment when I found myself waking up and jumping out of bed every morning, but after the first few days of soreness, I found myself getting stronger and pulling off strength-building moves more easily. I also felt a bit more energetic, and on Day 24 I walked home from Whole Foods with a heavy watermelon in my arms and didn‚Äôt even break a sweat. That‚Äôs progress!Of course, as Klika said, the seven-minute workout is a starting point. ‚ÄúYou could even do it for 15 minutes a day and you might see some improvements in cardiovascular fitness, but this is mostly a gateway,‚Äù Klika said.I wish I could say that this experiment made me a 6 a.m. morning run, smoothie toting, yoga-pants loving exercise guru, like those Instagram stars who always seem to have their shit together. I wish I could even say that it inspired me to renew my Classpass membership. None of those things happened, obviously. Instead, it just made me realise that exercise isn‚Äôt really that bad. Sure, I‚Äôm going to look awkward and goofy and I won‚Äôt always like it, but that‚Äôs okay.The experiment also hammered home for me that you can exercise literally anywhere, and you don‚Äôt need a gym. I worked out in my friend‚Äôs apartment in Portland, shutting myself off in the guest bedroom for 10 minutes. I worked out after a wedding in my hotel room. I worked out at 1 a.m. in another hotel room after a flight home from said wedding was cancelled.It also made me wake up and stop making excuses. As a fully-functioning adult, I have all I really need to be healthier. I can choose to work out if I want, or choose to take the day off because I had a little too much wine. And if I don‚Äôt exercise? That‚Äôs a decision I make ‚Äî not something that‚Äôs entirely dependent on how expensive classes are, or how intimidating the gym is to me.The ‚Äúright‚Äù ending to this story would be that I now work out every day, religiously, for at least seven minutes. But I‚Äôm only human ‚Äî on day 30, I decided to try shadow boxing one last time, felt dumb as ever, and decided to celebrate by taking a week-long break. Just this week, however, when I was feeling particularly lethargic and tired, I pulled out the book for another seven-minute set before work. It was easy, and really, not a big deal at all.More Fitness Content From Refinery29 UK

110,The future of creativity and invention lies in loss,https://medium.com/swlh/the-future-of-creativity-and-invention-lies-in-loss-e9b830cf064d?source=extreme_main_feed---------113-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"An edited version of this can be found at Nesta.org.ukIn the run up to FutureFest colleagues at Nesta asked me to blog on the future of creativity and invention. Here, I point to three key themes that I think will dominate the way we create and invent in the future;When thinking about the future of invention and creativity, it‚Äôs easy to think about the near-term and the reciprocal relationship between creative endeavor and technology. Nesta published a report last year looking at just that ‚Äî and emphasising the growing need for creative technologists in both business and the arts.We also published a report on emerging innovation methods, such as generative design to rapidly cycle through variables and design options, or AI to analyse and interpret vast amounts of clinical research to produce new insights. If you‚Äôre looking for systematised approaches to invention that move beyond accelerator programmes and design sprints, this report is for you.Many of the approaches in it may not yet be mainstream but they are methods which are available to us now. I want to look beyond the 10 year horizon, where it is harder to model or produce robust evidence for a certain direction of travel. Instead I‚Äôm drawing on the broader context of the worlds we live in and the implications this has for public mood and trends within creativity. This means moving beyond looking at the future through the lens of what is technologically possible and thinking instead about the ideas and events that will define the future state of mind.From this there are three things that I believe will shape how we create and invent in the future.We tend to think of creation and invention as a productive, generative activity: making new objects, designing new materials. Creativity is an idea that is associated with abundance. Invention is associated with objects and outputs. In the West we have lived through nearly a century of prosperity where land and natural resources have been explored and exploited for our comfort, convenience and entertainment. But while we were inventing at a faster pace than at any other time in human history, we were also rapidly destroying the existing ecosystem we enjoyed. A report found 60% of the world‚Äôs animal population has been wiped out in the last 50 years. The UN estimates a further 1m species are at risk of extinction over the next few decades.We are, belatedly, catching up with this mess. Or perhaps, more accurately, it is catching up with us. Even if we take drastic action, we will still inevitably see environmental loss on an unprecedented scale.So creativity in the future will have a different flavour to it. Rather than the abundance of the past it will be grounded in scarcity and loss. In preservation rather than progress and putting greater value in what we already have as opposed to that which could be. Frivolity will come under scrutiny and we will seek greater connection with the things that surround us and the spaces between. It will involve what Johann Wolfgang von Goete referred to in 1790 as ‚Äúdwelling in the phenomena‚Äù and Donna Harraway today calls ‚Äústaying with the trouble‚Äù. This is a recognition that we need a relationship with loss to be able to understand this new context and invent within it.We‚Äôll start to see creation for mitigation and amelioration, not just an unstoppable march towards growth. It is creativity that is conscious and conscientious and it‚Äôs not just about having new constraints. In fact it dismantles the idea of constraints, redefining them from something you have to work within to something you have to work with.I see hints of this in organisations like A New Field, experimenting with how anyone can make everyday objects like toothbrushes from crushed mussel shells. It‚Äôs also in evident in designers and technologists in the UK government and their #onegreengov work, or the Masters courses in Design for Social Innovation and Sustainable Futures at the London College of Communication and the focus on ecology in Leeds Arts University‚Äôs Illustration course. We are already training a new generation of artists and designers how to explore this future.Alongside this sense of environmental loss comes a renewed appreciation of it. We return to the use of the word ecosystems in its truest form ‚Äî the ecological systems that human beings are embedded in are part of. In his last two books Timothy Morton makes the case for deeper coexistence of people within the environment, alongside other animals, insects and bacteria, relegating human exceptionalism to a more level footing with the natural world.In October, the team at Nesta‚Äôs Centre for Collective Intelligence Design invited artist Heather Barnett to deliver a session working with slime mould ‚Äî a single cell organism which ‚Äúwhilst it has no brain or central nervous system, demonstrates primitive intelligence and an impressive capacity for collective action.‚Äù Heather works with slime mould to explore how groups of people engage with non-human forms of collective intelligence.In a similar vein, Holly Herndon is a musician who has pioneered collaboration between humans and AI. She named the musical AI trained on choral singing ‚ÄòSpawn,‚Äô refers to it as her ‚Äúinhuman child‚Äù and names it on tracks on her album PROTO. One of the most intriguing tracks on the album, Extreme Love, offers a vision of life beyond humans, where bacteria ‚ÄúThriving in extreme conditions, proved more fit, better at taking the next leap,‚Äù and where human beings are just one part of the complex and often hidden ecology of the universe. They‚Äôll be painting their own self portraits next.William Meyer has documented growth in the field of biodesign ‚Äî where artists, designers and even builders move beyond biomimicry and start to incorporate living organisms and ecosystems into their work. Koen Vanmechelen uses chickens as a mirror for the human race, highlighting the benefits of cosmopolitan diversity through cross-breeding and producing a ‚ÄòPlanetary Community Chicken‚Äô, which farmers can introduce to increase diversity in the coop. He credits the chickens at the end of this short film.In the future we‚Äôll see more and more unlikely collaborations across species ‚Äî natural and artificial ‚Äî opening the door to a better appreciation of the creativity and capacity for invention amongst human and non-human beings.Listening to PROTO for the first time, I found parts of it hard to listen to ‚Äî uncanny in places and uncomfortable in others. On later listens, the brief moments of uplifting familiar sounds started to feel boring in comparison. Working with new materials opens new possibilities. Exploring the full potential of a material means being experimental, open to unusual outcomes or sensations.Design as a profession often leads to systematising processes ‚Äî coming up with methods that are replicable and repeatable. Thus we have a wealth of innovation methods and frameworks to help us package up creativity and invention. But anyone who‚Äôs been through a less-than-inspiring design sprint will know, you can‚Äôt always simply trust the process.That‚Äôs not to say there‚Äôs not a place for standardised methods. Tried and tested methods can scale, speed up and democratise the process of invention. It‚Äôs more recognising that as we enter a new era of creativity and the balance of power shifts from human beings as all-powerful to us as participants in ecosystem collaborations, we will have less control over the creative process and this will be, by its very nature more scrappy and experimental.As we redefine our relationship with creativity and invention, we have to play with the new and the unknown. Creativity and invention have always a critical role in leading us into the future. Art and technology work closely together to first imagine and then make possible, and then imagine again and again make possible, the worlds we‚Äôll exist in tomorrow.These three ideas will shape how we approach creativity and invention over the coming decade. For what it‚Äôs worth, I don‚Äôt think they stop with art, design and innovation either. I expect we‚Äôll see this sentiment seeping into our politics as we try to work our way out of a crisis in democracy.If you‚Äôre doing this kind of work, or you see other great examples of it, drop me a line. I‚Äôd love to hear more.WRITTEN BY"

orecasting is one of the main tasks in time-series analysis. In a state space analysis, the time-series observations are assumed to depend linearly on a state vector that is unobserved and is generated by a stochastic and dynamic process. The observations are further assumed to be subject to measurement error and independent of the state vector. Therefore, two main components which make up state space models are an observed data and the unobserved states.A time-series is described probabilistic by a stochastic process (Yt; t = 1, 2, . . .), that is, by an ordered sequence of random vectors with the index t (time). For simplicity, we will think of equally spaced time points (daily data, monthly data, and so on). The target is to make forecasts about the value of the next observation [yn+1 having observed data up to time n, (y1 = y1, . . . , yn)].barChart(NG)This series looks clearly non-stationary and in fact quite irregular and volatile. The data is on daily level since 2007 till date. We can see that, price drooped significantly from nearly $20 to close to $1 during 2008/2009, before being going up till around $15 during 2010/2011; however, a highly volatile state since can be seen all across as on date and last price recorded as $8.61.We will do a uni-variate analysis; so, let us extract the monthly ‚ÄúClose‚Äù prices from the data-set. Monthly data was taken for computational ease. Depending on available computational power, data can be taken on hourly, daily or weekly as well.Following data processing are important to convert the data to data-frame and further time -series for future analysis.Here, our data-set is now processed and we are ready to perform further analysis.Most statistical models rely on a normal distribution, a distribution that is symmetric and has a characteristic bell shape. Probability distributions are usually (not entirely) represented in charts whose abscissa axis represents the possible values of the variable and whose ordinal axis represents the probability of occurrence.The distribution plot comprising density and normal Q-Q plot above clearly shows that data distribution is not normal and reflects non-Gaussian characteristics.Output from the above stationarity tests show non-stationary characteristics of data.Normalize the time series using mean & stdWe see here that:Therefore, it can be concluded that the ACF signal is stationary. But, the trend signal is not stationary. The stationary series has a better variance around the mean level, and the peaks are evidence of the interventions in the original series. We will further decompose the time series which involves a combination of level, trend, seasonality, and noise components. Decomposition helps to provide a better understanding of problems during analysis and forecasting.Decomposing a time series means separating it into its constituent components, which are often a trend component and a random component, and if the data is seasonal, a seasonal component.Non-seasonal time series consist of a trend component and a random component. Decomposing the time series involves tying to separate the time series into these individual components. A seasonal time series, in addition to the trend and random components, also has a seasonal component. Decomposing a seasonal time series means separating the time series into these three components. Let's estimate the trend, seasonal, and random components of the Natural Gas TS.plot(decompose(df1), yax.flip=TRUE) # Decompose time-seriesThe above plot clearly shows that trend is non-stationary which we can see from the trend signal plot in the normalization section. The seasonal component exists for a brief period of time every year most likely during the winter session. Overall, the price is highly volatile with random walk movement.Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted notation for state space models. However, the most commonly used notations in statistical and econometric applications can be found in the work of Harrison & Stevens (1976) and West & Harrison (1997). The main focus is on Bayesian analysis is maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of unknown parameter. We will start with a local level model to introduce the methodology.We will develop the prediction with a Base Level Model followed by ARIMA and Dynamic Linear Model to compare the prediction output.State-space models are based on the idea that the time series (Yt) is an incomplete and noisy function of some underlying un-observable process (Œ∏t, t = 1, 2, . . .), called the state process.A structural approach to time-series analysis is facilitated by the state space framework. In this approach, different unobserved components responsible for the dynamics of the series. These are trend, seasonal, cycle, and the effects of explanatory and intervention variables are identified separately before being put together in a state space model. Let us understand the mathematical intuition for local level model.A time series is normally considered a set of observation y1,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶, yn ordered in time. Here, the base model for representing the time series is additive model. The formula can be written as:To develop suitable models and Œºt and œít, we need the concept of random walk. We can consider a simple form of model in which Œºt = Œ±t, where Œ±t is random walk, no seasonal is present and all random variables are normally distributed. We assume that Œµt has constant variance œÉ2Œµ. This gives the model:for t = 1,‚Ä¶..,n, where Œµt‚Äôs and Œ∑t‚Äôs are mutually independent and independent on Œ±1. There are two parameters, and œÉ2Œ∑. It is an ARIMA(0,1,1) model, but with restrictions on the parameter set. This is called local level model and provides the basis for our analysis. It exhibits the characteristics structure of state space models where there is a series of unobserved values Œ±1,‚Ä¶.,Œ±n, which are states and represents the development over time of the system under study together with a set of observations y1,‚Ä¶.,yn, which are related to the Œ±t‚Äôs by the state space model. This is suitable for both Classical and Bayesian analysis. Where Œµt‚Äôs and Œ∑t‚Äôs are not normally distributed we obtain equivalent results from the standpoint of minimum variance linear unbiased estimation.Initially we assume that, Œ±1 ~ N(Œ±1, P1), where Œ±1 and P1 are known and that œÉ2Œµ and œÉ2Œ∑ are known. Since, random walk are non-stationary, the model is non-stationary and the distribution of random variables yt and Œ±t depend on time t.The local linear trend model, type = ‚Äútrend‚Äù, has the same measurement equation, but with a time-varying slope in the dynamics. The basic structural model, type = ‚ÄúBSM‚Äù, is a local trend model with an additional seasonal component.All significance tests in linear Gaussian state space models ‚Äî and the construction of confidence intervals ‚Äî are based on assumptions concerning the residuals of the analysis. The residuals should satisfy independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. The independence and normality of the residuals can be diagnosed using the Box-Ljung test statistic. Homoscedasticity can be checked by testing the variance of the standardized prediction errors.Below plot shows the predicted Close price data for 12 months, together with 50% and 90% probability intervals.plot(forecast::forecast(fit_level, level = c(50, 90), h = 12), xlim = c(2016, 2021))pred <- predict(fit_level, n.ahead = 12)Auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model can be put into state space form.In auto arima is able to decide whether to use or not a seasonal arima (SARIMA) model.# recommended setting
auto.arima(df1, trace = T, stepwise = F, approximation = F)# Arima
arima <- Arima(df1, order = c(0,1,0))
checkresiduals(arima)We can see from the first and last graphs that, the residuals don‚Äôt appear to be white noise. The ACF plot shows no significant correlation exists among the residuals.# Forecast of 12 months
pred_arima <- forecast::forecast(arima, h=12)
plot(pred_arima)This prediction is similar to structural time series. However, we will check further Dynamic Linear Model in below section.Dynamic linear models are a special case of state space models where the errors of the state and observed components are normally distributed. DLM can be specified by means of two equationshere, Gt and Ft are known matrices and the (vt) & (wt) are two independent white noise sequences (i.e., they are independent, both between them and within each of them), with mean zero and known co-variance matrices Vt and Wt respectively.The general state space model for a uni-variate time series (Yt, t = 1, 2, . . .) is the so-called random walk plus noise model, defined by:with arbitrary functions gt and ht which is more flexible. The error sequences (vt) and (wt) are independent. The linear state space models specify gt and ht as linear functions, and Gaussian linear models add the assumptions of Gaussian distributions.A polynomial DLM (a local level model is a polynomial DLM of order 1) , a local linear trend is a polynomial DLM of order 2). You may find more details of dlm model here.The arguments dV and dW are used to specify the diagonal of the observation and evolution covariance matrices respectively.The main purpose of the Kalman filter is to obtain optimal estimates of the state at time point t, only considering the observations {y1, y2, . . . , yt‚àí1}. The key property of the predicted state and its related estimates is therefore that they are only based on the historical values of the series. The objective of filtering is to update our knowledge of the system each time a new observation yt is brought in.# applying kalman filter
model_filter <- dlmFilter(df1, modelfit)
plot(residuals(model_filter, sd = FALSE), type = ‚Äúo‚Äù, ylab = ‚ÄúStandardized prediction error‚Äù)
abline(h = 0)The Kalman smoother allows to compute the densities of Œ∏t|DT , starting from t = T‚àí1, in which case Œ∏T|DT ~ N(sT = mT , ST = CT ), and then proceeding backward for computing the densities of Œ∏t|DT for t = T‚àí2, t = T‚àí3, etc.forecast$fHere, we can see from the above plot that, the model has been able capture the trend quite well. Filtered and smoothed lines are moving together in the series and do not differ much from each other. The lines of forecast series for next 12 months has been picked up from where the original series endsIf we compare the three predicted results, we find that, DLM model has been able to capture the trend better than other two.Similar approach can be applied to analyze and forecast for both uni-variate and multi-variate time-series. Here, the structural time series computes the maximum likelihood estimates of the variance parameters and the filtered means of the state vectors for a basic structural model, i.e., a constant DLM consisting of a random walk plus noise, a local linear trend. we have used the same data-set in all three models to maintain consistency. Interestingly ARIMA & Structural Models are not been able to pick up on the seasonal component like the dlm model. We have not considered the seasonal component in case of dlm modeling. However, the seasonal component can also be added for better prediction.DLM is quite an interesting package and I would like to further use it for multi-variate analysis in future.I can be reached here.References:WRITTEN BY"

We don‚Äôt want to expose data that we don‚Äôt want the outside world to view, and we want our data structures to be defined in a way that‚Äôs easy to reuse.In this article, we‚Äôll look at how to organize our data in a way that‚Äôs easy for us to use.We should use classes instead of constructor functions. It‚Äôs much clearer and inheritance can be done much more easily.They‚Äôre the same underneath. Class syntax is syntactic sugar for the constructor function syntax.For example, we can define a Person class as follows:We can see that our constructor takes in name and age as parameters and set it as values of instance variables.Where it shines is when we need to extend the class. We can create an Employee class that has the instance variables of the Person class and extends it as follows:All we have to do is to call the superclass‚Äô constructor with the super call, and then we can set the instance variables of the Employee class in the constructor.Getters and setters are good for hiding the actual data that‚Äôs being accessed. We can have computed properties, which means that we can abstract way the implementation of those computed properties so that we don‚Äôt have to worry about changing the code that uses them when we change the implementation.Also, setters let us validate before setting the data rather than setting them directly.Likewise, error handling and logging can also be added easily into them.We can also lazy load object properties with getters.For example, we can use getters as follows:As we can see, we can use it to create a computed property to get the area of a rectangle.Then we can use it as follows:We can add validation into setters as follows:Note that it‚Äôs also a good idea to define getters so that we can access the properties‚Äô values.There‚Äôre no private variables in JavaScript classes, so we should define private variables in block scope so that they won‚Äôt be exposed to the public with let and const .Chaining methods make calling a series of functions less verbose. We can define a function that can be chained by returning this .For example, we can write the following:Then we can use it as follows:Then when we log person , we get:This is a common pattern that‚Äôs used in many libraries like jQuery and Lodash.We should leave a class inheritance for ‚Äòis-a‚Äô relationships only. An is-a relationship is a subset of some bigger entity. For example, an employee is a person.Otherwise, we should use composition instead. For example, if we want to keep the address for a Person, we can create a class called Address and instantiate it in the methods of the Person class and use it there instead.A Person has a ‚Äòhas-a‚Äô relationship with Address , so we shouldn‚Äôt use inheritance in this case.For example, we can write something like the following code:The class syntax is much easier to understand than the constructor function syntax, especially when we need to do inheritance. Therefore, it‚Äôs time to move away from the constructor function syntax as fast as we can.We should only use class inheritance in ‚Äòis-a‚Äô relationships. Otherwise, we should use composition instead.Also, we can use getters and setters to keep the implementation of the members underneath private. We can use getters for computed properties and setters for running code before setting values to a member. For example, we can run some validation code before setting the value with a setter.Chaining methods is also a commonly accepted way to clean up code by making calls less verbose.WRITTEN BY"
113,How to Predict the Future(s) and Create Resilient and Effective Societies and Organizations,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-predict-the-future-s-and-create-more-resilient-balanced-and-effective-societies-and-a70817e19867?source=extreme_main_feed---------116-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"Jeremy Pesner is a multidisciplinary technologist, policy analyst and current PhD student in technology and public policy. He focuses on Internet & ICT policy, innovation policy and technology forecasting. You can read more about him and reach out to him on his website. Carbon Radio caught up with Jeremy, nearly 3 years after his TEDx talk on futurism, to learn more about the field and how his insights have developed.Like many broad, interdisciplinary fields, there is no single clear, concise definition that is universally accepted. To try and give a succinct explanation, futurism is the practice of contemplating, exploring, discussing and suggesting what will happen in the future. But that alone isn‚Äôt a complete answer. What‚Äôs likely more important than any particular futurism method or practice is the mindset that a futurist adopts; this is what distinguishes a futurist from an average person who is considering the future. Several futurists have described their take on this mindset, from Andrew Hines & Peter Bishop to Paul Saffo to Cecily Sommers, but generally speaking, it involves thinking in a nonlinear, broad and interdisciplinary fashion that looks at not only the future but how a given event or pattern might fit in the larger picture of history. This may not sound difficult, but it takes a good deal of practice to truly adopt this mindset, especially in a field that you lack expertise in. This allows for a conception of future events that is not path-dependent from our present state but instead can move in a number of different directions depending on high-level trends and events.It is important to distinguish between ‚Äúfuturism‚Äù and ‚Äúforecasting.‚Äù The former explores the range of possible futures that can emerge, usually at a fairly high level, while the latter is focused on attempting to anticipate specific developments and timelines in given domains based on trends and data (e.g. technology forecasting). Like everything in this field, there are no bright lines between them, and some less exacting practitioners will use the terms interchangeably, but the distinction does serve to clarify the different purposes that this field can serve. In this context, forecasting is usually focused on the change in precise details of a particular object or forum (e.g. how many transistors will fit on a microprocessor in 2025?). This is certainly useful for targeted applications in which the factors and limitations can be readily identified, but when we expand out of narrow focuses and into the more general questions of what our world may look like, the question of prediction becomes a lot less cut and dry. For example, the World Future Society did predict that terrorists might attack the World Trade Center, but the details of the attack itself still took the organization‚Äôs president by surprise. In this broader context, futurism is more useful for understanding the broad contours of tomorrow than the precise details of what, when, where and why.There is no question that we need to consider the long-term future when making decisions in the present. The evidence is overwhelming that human activity over the past two centuries is bearing consequence today, and that ignoring the long-term future today will result in significant consequences then. Climate change is the most often cited example of this, but McKinsey analysts have concluded that a lack of long-term thinking hurts the profitability of businesses as well. Not only does our present directly affect the future state of our society and planet, but many people look to futurism to get some sense of comfort and security about the future, even if the particular prognostications don‚Äôt pan out. Clearly, futurism fills a deep need and desire within humankind to look ahead and imagine what is coming. But because the future is inherently unknowable, the field of futurism itself is useful for this purpose because it provides a wide berth of flexibility in exploring it. The large array of methodologies under its tent are connected in purpose ‚Äî exploring and understanding the future ‚Äî but diverge wildly in structure and execution. Whether through using hard quantitative data, gathering expert opinions or imagining a future through narrative, the field accommodates just about any kind of future-oriented practice. Rafael Popper‚Äôs Foresight Diamond demonstrates this nicely:The term was coined by Nicholas Nassim Taleb in his eponymous 2007 book. Black swans are large-scale events that are highly improbable, very difficult to anticipate and change the world as we know it. These events often cause a major shift in worldviews: consider that until the discovery of Australia, people believed that all swans were white, and all it took was one sighting of a black swan to undo centuries of preconceptions. In that context, black swan events are not simply events that an average person wouldn‚Äôt anticipate ‚Äî these are the occurrences that no one seemed to see coming, that little of the data pointed to and the causes of which are usually only clear in hindsight. Many historical major events can be characterized as black swan events, because people at the time likely didn‚Äôt anticipate them, and even when we study them we likely don‚Äôt possess all the pieces to perfectly understand how the event came about. Taleb uses this phenomenon to assert that humankind has fundamentally overestimated what it can possibly know and understand. Therefore, rather than trying to better predict such events, he advises that organizations become more robust ‚Äî in other words, more humble and open to errors in any kinds of predictions they make ‚Äî so that they can recover from black swan events more quickly.The turkey example has all the qualities of a good parable: it‚Äôs short, direct and demonstrates a clear lesson. The story was initially told to demonstrate the logical fallacy of inductive reasoning: a farmer feeds his turkey every day at the same time, and it soon becomes accustomed to the pattern, soon believing that because it was fed the previous day, it will be fed today as well. Then one day, instead of feeding the turkey, the farmer kills it and serves it for dinner. Obviously, it wasn‚Äôt in the turkey‚Äôs interest to expect that day to be like all the ones before it, but it had no way to expect such a change. This notion effectively translates to the black swan context: people are often so used to the way things are every day that they don‚Äôt ‚Äî or can‚Äôt ‚Äî anticipate how easily their situations could suddenly and dramatically shift with little to no warning. It‚Äôs also important to note that the concept of a black swan is relative: what was a black swan to the turkey was not necessarily one to the farmer. The farmer had his own set of circumstances and events that led up to him making that turkey dinner, and to him killing the turkey may have been a clear and logical consequence. There are different arguments as to how precisely to apply this to futurism, but it‚Äôs clear that no one will successfully plan for the future by imagining it as a linear and gradual extension of the present. A graph of the turkey‚Äôs well being shows this very viscerally:This is an interesting question. In some ways, the two fields are very similar: they were both developed in part through research at the RAND Corporation, they were both birthed from nonlinear systems perspectives, and they are both interdisciplinary fields that allow for broad interpretations and different methods to undertake research. But there are also significant differences: futurism as a field has evolved in a more professional context ‚Äî there are only two academic programs in the US focused on futurism. Complex systems, by contrast, largely developed in academia, and while not a very prevalent field, there are academics, departments and institutions throughout the world (most notably the Santa Fe Institute) that focus on social network analysis, agent-based modelling and other dynamic systems approach. (It is worth noting that Nassim Nicholas Taleb is co-faculty at the New England Complex Systems Institute.) Research in futurism is also more topic-driven (a futurist can employ a number of different methods to explore a single topic, such as the future of biotechnology) while that of complex systems is more method-driven (complex systems researchers often build similar types of models to study a wide variety of phenomena). Because of all this, the two are not often used in tandem, although there is no reason that they couldn‚Äôt be. Futurism is more likely to give a sense of possible futures in the context of lived experience, while complex systems models can provide insight into the underlying structures and relationships that give rise to such futures.Futures studies have actually been applied to this issue for quite a while now. The US Coast Guard has undertaken regular scenario and strategic foresight development since 1998, in an initiative called Project Evergreen. It‚Äôs considered to be one of the strongest government foresight programs, and its members are often fixtures in the Federal Foresight Community of Interest (see next question). Because it‚Äôs an ongoing project and was not conceived as a one-off ‚Äústrategic update,‚Äù its results are taken seriously within the organization and are combined with other factors to influence the Coast Guard‚Äôs ongoing strategy. This practice has inspired the Federal Emergency Management Agency to undertake their own strategic initiatives, and while not explicitly disaster-related, the UN has published a report on using foresight to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The Center for Homeland Defense and Security has even put together an entire educational module on the topic. Within academia, there is some literature on the topic, but perhaps the best example is a special issue in the academic journal Technological Forecasting and Social Change published in 2013. You can even give the process a try for yourself if you like.There are a variety of organizations in the futures studies field, although they‚Äôve developed from different contexts and in a fragmented fashion. The field of futurism initially emerged in the 1940s in the context of anticipating geopolitical events as the Cold War began. The earliest research on the topic was conducted at the RAND Corporation, which grew out of Herman Kahn‚Äôs work on game theory and systems analysis. The World Future Society was founded around the same time as a way to bring people who were thinking about the future together. This organization has evolved significantly in the last few years and has made a conscious effort to encourage younger and more diverse additions to its membership community. There are also futurist organizations that have developed for more specialized purposes. The World Future Studies Federation grew out of similar initiatives in Europe and is more tied into governance bodies like UNESCO and the UN. The Federal Foresight Community of Interest is a group for employees of the US government and adjacent organizations who are interested in using foresight to help improve government decisionmaking. The Association of Professional Futurists is an organization specifically for those who make their living as futurists. Employees of futurist consulting organizations such as Toffler Associates (founded by famed futurist Alvin Toffler), Kedge and Forum for the Future are often involved in this community.As fellow futurist Travis Kupp and I recount, it isn‚Äôt always easy for who are new to the field to simply join one of these groups and immediately know what is going on. I personally became gradually more involved with the World Future Society over a period of years, and that was only after I had already taken a class in the subject. A meetup community called Speculative Futures, and the resulting nonprofit Design Futures Initiative and conference PRIMER, has emerged from grassroots organizers in various cities over the past few years. It has been largely centred around designers and encourages participants to make ‚Äúfuture artefacts‚Äù (conceptions of what particular objects in the future might look like and how they might function), rather than only discussing theoretical ideas and concepts. But the community is open to different ideas and perspectives ‚Äî this was clearly reflected in the theme of PRIMER‚Äôs 2019 conference: Futures for All. That motto is apt for the entire field, as anyone who wants to learn more about the field and find their place in it will ultimately be able to do so, whether through one of its many communities or even through their own individual exploration. The upside of a field as broadly-defined as this one is that it‚Äôs easy for people to chart their own path within it.This question is asked a lot, although my answer may be less exciting than some would hope for. Ironically, when we examine how the field has evolved to today, it hasn‚Äôt really departed very far from its origins. Many of the same methods that were created when the field was first developed, such as scenario planning and delphi polling, are still used today in the same fashion they were then. I think there are a couple of reasons for this: first, the process by which we can imagine a broad future can only get so specific. While individual practitioners may have their own take on how to apply these methods, there is no clear and objective way for the practice to evolve. But I believe another reason is because of what I mentioned in the previous question: the field has traditionally been insular and not actively recruited to grow its community, so it was largely composed of older white men. When I first became aware of the World Future Society in 2012, I found it to be a bit troubling that its website hadn‚Äôt been updated since the 1990s. Recent leaders of the organization have made active efforts to bring a wider base into the group, so I hope that between this increased diversity of WFS and the greater diversity of groups I mentioned in the previous question, the next 50 years of futurism won‚Äôt be like the last 50.One prediction I‚Äôm fairly confident about is that machine learning and related techniques will come to play a much more central role in forecasting. I have worked on some technology forecasting at the Georgia Institute of Technology, which relies on datasets of academic publications on various science and technology research topics. The implications of this kind of analysis are fairly short-term, in the 3‚Äì5-year timeframe, but it‚Äôs entirely possible that these data-driven models could lead to more generalized models ‚Äî such as complex agent-based models ‚Äî that could be used to anticipate the longer term.I discussed the broad importance of long-term thinking to our society in Question #3, so I will give a more focused response here. Dwight Eisenhower once referred to a college president who said ‚ÄúI have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.‚Äù Stephen Covey, A. Roger Merrill, and Rebecca R. Merrill operationalized this dichotomy in their 1994 book First Things First with the Eisenhower Matrix, which identifies the proper actions to take for different types of tasks:Although this book was written to guide people in managing their own personal and professional lives, the framework is very applicable to how and why we practice future thinking on a larger scale. The long-term future is decidedly important, but because it‚Äôs far away from our immediate concerns, it is not urgent, and thus belongs in Quadrant #2, which the authors call the ‚Äúquadrant of quality.‚Äù Unfortunately, it‚Äôs precisely this class of tasks that we are most likely to neglect. We spend a lot of time on tasks we believe are urgent, whether they are important or not. This is not just because the tasks seem so immediate, but because of the adrenaline rush and exhilaration we often feel when working on them ‚Äî the authors call this ‚Äúurgency addiction.‚Äù However, this usually means that long-term important tasks are not addressed unless and until they become urgent.There are certain tasks that are both urgent and important, and therefore Quadrant #1 does demand a solid chunk of attention. However, those operating with an ‚Äúurgency mentality‚Äù will drop into Quadrant #3 when the tasks in Quadrant #1 dwindle, while those operating with an ‚Äúimportance mentality‚Äù will move to Quadrant #2, which gives them more time to anticipate and structure plans that will ultimately assuage Quadrant #1 tasks. These concepts can be effectively applied to any problem or level of society, and in just about every case spending time in Quadrant #2 will lead to more resilient, balanced and effective societies and organizations.WRITTEN BY"

At least Apple is marketing it in this way.Despite Apple calling the iPhone 11 to be a huge success, there‚Äôs a little doubt that it did ‚Äî especially when compared to its predecessors.While Apple did revise its strategy with the iPhone 11 series by positioning the least expensive phone as a flagship model contrary to the X series, it did very little to expand its market.Apple‚Äôs sales have been on the decline over the past few years and arguably the failure of the iPhone 11 in reviving it will play a huge role in the inevitable success of the soon to be launched iPhone 9.iPhone 9 might be Apple‚Äôs biggest sell-out product in recent years with history and timing being in its favor. The affordable price would only make it more popular than ever.iPhone SE though dated, was the most sold and unarguably the best iPhone ever at one time.During the years when Apple was pushing the screen size, a considerably compact phone took everyone by surprise.History teaches us that whenever Apple has offered an iPhone in the mid-range segment, be it the SE or XR, the world has embraced it.In both cases, Apple has made some smart sacrifices to pave the way for a budget iPhone. Be it the absence of image stabilization and the 3D touch on the iPhone SE or the missing dual camera in XR(compared to iPhone XS) and the lower resolution display. Instead of going after the fancy features, Apple focused on longevity with better battery life and the latest iOS support.We‚Äôd expect no less from the iPhone 9, which would only bring back the nostalgia of the SE phone. Expected to have a launch price of around the XR phone today, the iPhone 9 would have quite a few features of the iPhone 11 with the A13 Bionic chip almost a guarantee. But then, expecting the Face ID and Triple Camera would be too much for the reasonable price it‚Äôs aiming for.History shows us that like iPhone SE was a 6S disguised in a 5S body, iPhone 9 would be similar to iPhone 8 in design, sprinkled with a few iPhone 11 features.A less expensive iPhone supporting the features of the premiere ones is Apple‚Äôs historical formula of success.iPhone 9 scheduled to arrive by April 2020 and the timing couldn‚Äôt be better. With Samsung shifting its focus to the expensive segment, especially with their latest offerings‚Äî foldable smartphones, the market in the mid-range has an opening.It‚Äôs the right time for Apple to capture that market which it once lost to the influx of new Android smartphones. The market that the SE phones used to own.The timing is right for another reason as well. Apple has been investing in its subscription services like Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade amongst other things over the past year. An affordable iPhone would only bring more users to its ecosystem and boost the sales of these services.Instead of focusing on innovation, Apple for once is doing the right thing and playing to its strength. They‚Äôve always been consistent in marketing and bringing iPhone 9 at this stage instead of competing with the new foldable technology is an ace move.A product‚Äôs growth is defined by the number of new users adopting it.Apple has been sitting like a hungry lion for a while now. Holding their cards and waiting to pounce back on the market they once owned.iPhone 9 is just what they needed at this hour. A mid-range powerful phone to boost their sales and bring new users ‚Äî especially from Asian markets and countries like India, where a majority of smartphone users are skeptical to buy the new iPhones that are significantly expensive than a laptop.It‚Äôll bring back the nostalgia of classic iPhone SE at a time when a lot of people are missing it.iPhone 9 won‚Äôt be cheap. But it will be the cheapest iPhone at launch in a long while and possibly the most popular of the lot. Yet.Thanks for reading.WRITTEN BY"
115,"I Did a 24-Hour Dopamine Fast and I Felt Everything, Not Nothing",https://onezero.medium.com/i-did-a-24-hour-dopamine-fast-and-i-felt-everything-not-nothing-d4e15f1b49c0?source=extreme_main_feed---------118-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"Welcome to Bad Ideas, a column in which we examine the practical limits of technology by considering the things you could do and then investigating exactly why you shouldn‚Äôt. Because you can still learn from mistakes you‚Äôll never make.ver the past few months, dopamine fasts have cycled through the wellness media hype cycle. First introduced on Reddit in 2016, then refined and popularized by psychologist and venture capitalist Dr. Cameron Sepah this past summer, the dopamine fast ‚Äî a practice in which you abstain from certain actions associated with hits of dopamine, the ‚Äúfeel-good neurotransmitter‚Äù‚Äî was trend-pieced, explained, and seemingly debunked as yet another ill-conceived fad amongst the Silicon Valley elite before the year was out.Though we can‚Äôt control the release of chemicals in our brains, we can ‚Äúfast‚Äù on the actions that cause dopamine hits: looking at social media, eating junk food, playing video games, and so on. Take a break, it recommends.And so, the dopamine fast persists. People mock it on Twitter just as much as YouTubers celebrate it. There‚Äôs a Reddit community for dopamine fasters to discuss the nuances of their dopamine fasts between their dopamine fasts. There are also a handful of writers who have recounted their experience of doing nothing.I do not subscribe to Silicon Valley‚Äôs idea of wellness, which arguably makes me a kind of ideal subject for dopamine fasting. If dopamine fasting truly is hacking your brain chemistry, as the name suggests, then it should work on me regardless of my own biases, right? I decided to give it a shot for 24 hours. At best, I would experience levels of joy I had never known possible. At worst, I‚Äôd be bored for a day.Sepah‚Äôs guidelines make no specific recommendations for what you should fast from, so to make things as uncomplicated as possible I would fast from just about everything save for simple foods and water. No phone. No computer. No music. No television. No junk food. No human interaction. For 24 hours I would have nothing more than a glass of water, a bowl of oatmeal, a kale salad, and my thoughts. Unlike my previous quest to reach screen time zero, my goal wasn‚Äôt to do more with less, but rather to just do less. Just how much stimulation could I avoid, and how would that make me feel?I woke up on the morning of my dopamine fast with a powerful urge to look at my phone. Instead, I just lay there, letting myself feel nothing else but the tension of resisting that urge. Like holding a pose in yoga, I could feel the ways that habits led to imbalances in my mind. I felt both empowered ‚Äî ‚ÄúWow, I‚Äôve never really felt this way about my phone before!‚Äù ‚Äî and also suspicious, ‚ÄúAm I really altering my brain chemistry here, or am I just trying to convince myself that I feel different?‚Äù Either way, I could tell the dopamine fast was ‚Äúworking‚Äù and forcing me to reconsider behaviors I otherwise considered ‚Äúnormal.‚ÄùFifteen minutes into my fast, things were genuinely off to a good start.The fundamentals of dopamine fasting, as devised by Sepah, are based on an accepted cognitive behavioral therapy technique known as ‚Äústimulus control.‚Äù If you feel like you‚Äôre trapped within cycles of checking your phone, stress eating, or other kinds of compulsive behavior, dopamine fasting asks that you stop doing those things over a set period of time ‚Äî as little as one to four hours a day, or as long as a week. By making an intentional choice to not indulge the actions, there‚Äôs an opportunity to become more mindful of those compulsory behaviors, and, hopefully, break the cycle of doing something we hate in search of dopamine.Dopamine fasting, however, has a branding problem. Or more accurately, dopamine fasting is branded perfectly for a capitalism-driven wellness industry that demands a procession of new and exciting ways to hack our bodies into health and happiness. ‚ÄúAttach a ‚Äòneuro-‚Äô prefix or a brain chemical to your field of interest, and the world beats a path to your door,‚Äù psychiatrist Steven Reidbord wrote in his debunking of dopamine fasting in Psychology Today. ‚ÄúI recently joked that if we recast psychotherapy as ‚Äòverbal neuromodulation,‚Äô the field would enjoy newfound popularity and research funding. This is essentially what the advocates of dopamine fasting did.‚ÄùFor 24 hours I would have nothing more than a glass of water, a bowl of oatmeal, a kale salad and my thoughts.Sepah acknowledges this. ‚ÄúYes, [the name] helps get clicks and makes it seem cool. My LinkedIn article on the topic has got 125,000 views, so if it helps more people learn about it and practice it, I‚Äôm all for it,‚Äù he told MEL magazine. ‚ÄúThe term is technically incorrect, but ‚Äòstimulus control 101 for dealing with addictive behavior‚Äô just doesn‚Äôt have the same ring to it.‚ÄùIt did not help that the subjects of the New York Times profile of the trend, a trio of twentysomething startup founders, hewed closer to the original Reddit-devised dopamine fast ‚Äî a more ascetic, unscientific version in which you attempt to deprive yourself of feeling any sort of emotion ‚Äî rather than Sepah‚Äôs more informed and controlled approach.Having only seen dopamine fasting within the context of misguided, albeit relatively harmless, tech bros, I was surprised to find that within minutes my own fast seemed to be working. I wasn‚Äôt convinced I was hacking my brain into a higher plane of consciousness, but I couldn‚Äôt deny that it felt good to spend an entire day devoted to understanding myself a little better.As I got up to make breakfast, I felt a sort of astonished peace ‚Äî relishing the ability to get lost in my thoughts while simultaneously wondering if I was just deluding myself. I felt equally stupid and enlightened as I marveled at the simplicity of sitting down at my kitchen table and doing nothing else but eating a bowl of oatmeal.I spent the next few hours enjoying the pleasures of just sitting and thinking in silence. I would get up to brush my teeth, or put the dishes away, then sit down and let myself linger ‚Äî staring off into space, sometimes thinking, and sometimes not thinking. I would feel urges to snack, to open my computer, to kill time making a cup of coffee, and I would sit there and let them pass. Instead of doing things, I would just listen to the ambient noise of my apartment, appreciating the amount of sound that existence produces.By the afternoon it felt like I had flipped my brain into a low-energy mode ‚Äî processing and registering stimuli but without any real emotional response. It‚Äôs not that I was numb to the world, but that I was making a conscious choice to avoid investing too much emotional energy into things. At one point I dropped my keys, but it didn‚Äôt elicit the standard flash of mild frustration.Eventually, I stopped feeling urges to do anything. I was riding an emotionless high, looking for new ways to not feel too strongly. I ate my kale salad not out of hunger, but as a defensive mechanism: getting hungry would derail my current state of mind. For one day, I stopped swearing, I stopped judging, I tried to limit my internal monologue to the simplest of observations. ‚ÄúMy water bottle is empty, it‚Äôs time to refill it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have to put my shoes on if I‚Äôm going to go outside.‚ÄùIt was a Panglossian detachment that I had never considered. I wasn‚Äôt focused on avoiding things: I was focused on doing nothing.I can‚Äôt realistically spend every day avoiding activity. But as much as I hate to admit it, the dopamine fast was the right sort of shake-up I needed. I‚Äôm still using my phone, but it‚Äôs no longer the first thing I look at when I wake up. I sit with my thoughts a little more instead of drowning them out with more tweets. When I‚Äôm feeling stressed or stuck, I afford myself a little break and try to recapture the peace I felt during my fast.I‚Äôm aware of how stupid this all sounds. I know how embarrassing it looks to admit that you‚Äôre on a dopamine fast. Still, the appeal is clear. We spend most of our days yearning for control over our lives while simultaneously feeling stuck within systems larger than ourselves. It can feel liberating to just tap out.Like choosing to not pick up my phone earlier this morning, I could choose to let this little break untangle the knots of my brain, without making it a part of my identity. I didn‚Äôt need to become a Dopamine Faster in order to enjoy its benefits. A silly little Silicon Valley wellness trend was actually leading to my own self-actualization. I was happy but also in disbelief.I think this is what is so baffling to me about dopamine fasting: It works despite the purposefully misleading branding, despite its most visible advocates not doing it right, despite the fact that it‚Äôs ultimately in the service of increased productivity. It is nothing more than just taking a break, and yet somehow it still feels like a revelatory experience. ‚ÄúThis idea is noble, healthy, and worthwhile, but it‚Äôs certainly not a new concept,‚Äù writes Harvard physician Peter Grinspoon.Dopamine fasting offers nothing new and something revelatory. Before our devices monetized and quantified every single moment of our working hours, people had plenty of time to sit and be alone with their thoughts. Today, it‚Äôs difficult to escape the feedback loops specifically designed to keep us ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù So, I understand the need to call taking a break something else, give it more purpose than just idle time, brand it in a way that fits into the cult of productivity we‚Äôve all been drafted into.It‚Äôs not ideal. The worst part of dopamine fasting isn‚Äôt the fasting, but rather how performative it can feel. Fasters post about their experience and shape it into a competition. They look at themselves as an RPG character that can be min-maxed into some sort of god-tier build. ‚ÄúBro, you dopamine fasted for 24 hours? Well, I fasted for a WEEK, and my dopamine receptors are PURGED.‚ÄùYet most of us justify taking time off in terms of work. We come back from vacation with so many ideas. We take sick days so we can rest up and get back to work quicker than if we try to suffer through it. The dopamine fast is just a fun-house mirror version of this, a maximal version of rest.Our tech era is trapped in a habit of reinventing things that already exist ‚Äî and dopamine fasting fits neatly into that narrative. The name sounds like a number of other body-hacking wellness fads like intermittent fasting and digital detoxing. It‚Äôs not rest, it‚Äôs a period in which we actively avoid compulsive behaviors we don‚Äôt like. But in practice, dopamine fasting is refreshingly practical and painfully obvious. All you have to do is convince yourself that you need a break.WRITTEN BY"
116,How to Go from Junior to Senior Programmer,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-go-from-junior-to-senior-programmer-29d53f3edd27?source=extreme_main_feed---------119-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"A software developer classified by levels of experience can be something like this.¬∑ Junior: 2‚Äì3 years of experience¬∑ Senior: 10+ years of experience¬∑ Medior or ‚Äúmid-level‚Äù: in between junior and seniorThis years-of-experience has a problem. It doesn‚Äôt say anything about the quality of software development. How much experience and skill did you gain in those years? This is why job interviews for developers are so complicated. It‚Äôs a hard to measure skill, so we end up giving difficult tests to developers during interviews. But these tests are at best, an approximation and cannot gauge the work or the expertise required while doing the job.That brings us to the next question.Once you‚Äôre not a junior anymore, when do you become a senior?Do years of experience automatically make you a senior? Not quite.Take my case for example. When I was a young junior software programmer, I thought I knew it all. I was brash, cocky, and independent. I considered myself as the ‚ÄúGod of code‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt like collaborating with others and I thought writing great code was the only thing that mattered.I was wrong. Yes, coding is important. At the end of the day, a programmer has to write working code. But writing code is not the only thing that matters.I learned this the hard way when I was working for my first customer. I spoke to the customer for ‚Äú15‚Äù minutes, gathered the ‚Äúgist‚Äù of the requirements and assumed that I know exactly what the customer wants. I started furiously working on the code like a madman, enjoying the act of writing pure code. I delivered the application in 3 days flat and then the customer rejected it. That was not what he was expecting.Needless to say, I was hurt. My ego was bruised and I blamed the customer for not providing enough information. It was my immaturity speaking at that point in time. The customer never at fault. Had I devoted more time to analyze the customer‚Äôs requirements, the situation could have been far different. I learned this the hard, hard way.That said, a programmer isn‚Äôt a programmer because he can code. He is a programmer because his job is to analyze everything before starting anything. The analysis has to be done at multiple levels.¬∑ Self Analysis to perform better¬∑ Analysis of customer requirements to deliver better¬∑ Analysis of the overall project to help everyone perform better.And if you want to go from a junior to a senior developer, you need to cultivate these analysis skills to metamorphose into a really good senior developer who is known for his expertise than the years of experience put in.A good senior developer is like someone who‚Äôs grown up, become an adult, and can take care of himself. His life is no more erratic, spontaneous and experimental. He has learned from his mistakes and has created a rock-solid foundation of expertise in his life, that he can look back and be proud of. He can be still ‚Äúyoung‚Äù, but what he has, is an abundance of pragmatism and effectiveness that will be far more valuable than his actual years of experience.And here are some ways to go from a junior to a senior programmer.The Dunning-Kruger effect is a type of cognitive bias in which people believe that they are smarter and more capable than they really are. Essentially, low ability people do not possess the skills needed to recognize their own incompetence and this leads them to overestimate their own capabilities.And as a junior programmer, this is a sure-shot recipe for disaster. You may assume that you are a rock star programmer and know everything but the reality is that you know very little and still far from achieving excellence. This is a trap you need to avoid falling in.The difference between a junior programmer and a senior one is that a junior thinks he knows everything and a senior knows he has still a lot to learn. Junior programmers tend to overestimate their own knowledge and ability and are unable to recognize the skill and competence levels of other people, which is why they consistently view themselves as more capable, and more knowledgeable than others.As David Dunning rightly states.‚ÄúIn many cases, incompetence does not leave people disoriented, perplexed, or cautious. Instead, the incompetent are often blessed with an inappropriate confidence, buoyed by something that feels to them like knowledge.‚ÄùDunning and Kruger suggest that as experience doing a job increases, overconfidence typically declines to more realistic levels. As programmers start deep diving in their areas, they start recognizing their own lack of knowledge and ability. And as they gain in knowledge, their expertise increases and their confidence levels begin to improve once again.They suggest the following ways to overcome the overconfidence.¬∑ Keep learning and practicing Once you gain greater knowledge of a topic, the more likely you are to recognize how much there is still to learn. This can combat the tendency to assume you‚Äôre an expert, even if you‚Äôre not.¬∑ Ask other people how you‚Äôre doing. Asking others for constructive criticism can provide valuable insights into how others perceive your abilities.¬∑ Question what you know. Keep challenging your beliefs and expectations. Seek out information that challenges your ideas. The more you question, the more you learn.Remember, feeling wise is pleasant. But you need to always raise your standards. And for that, you need to dig deeper in order to understand a particular topic better. It allows you to recognize how much there still is to learn.In the book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, Mark Manson talks about the importance of maintaining an identity that is defined by as little as possible. That‚Äôs because when we get our identities involved ‚Äî when we decide that certain behaviors or events represent our worth as a human being.In simple words, we often decide to do something based on how well it satisfies our ego or childish fascination for thrills rather than the real need to do the same. Manson tells us that the best decisions are made when we keep the ‚Äúself‚Äù out of the decision because most likely, it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúyou.‚Äù Simply ask yourself, ‚ÄúIs this a good thing to do?‚Äù Yes? Then go do it.This applies to programmers too. In fact, most programmers are magpies by nature, always collecting shiny things, storing them away and looking for connections. If you‚Äôre not aware of this phenomenon, the shiny-toy syndrome is typically characterized by wanting to own the latest toy, often irrespective of the practical or functional need, or being hooked on the intense but very temporary high of ownership before moving onto something else.If you are aiming to be a senior programmer, you need to avoid this disease at any cost. The best senior programmers know precisely when not to do something. They know that rewriting a library from scratch just to make it more readable, or switching to the newest framework from the older one are not always good decisions. The purpose of the code should be clear enough to grasp within minutes or even seconds. Navigating through the code should be easy, even without sophisticated wizardry.The key is not to be risk-averse but just careful in picking the right battles.Have you ever wondered what the word ‚Äúapplication‚Äù means?Why do we call those little icons on our smartphone applications? It‚Äôs because they apply a given workflow or algorithm to a problem we have and help us to solve our needs.That said, if you are building something, you are bound to make mistakes. Reflecting on your work and improving it continually leads to innovation and at the root of innovation lies curiosity to find out how things work. Remember it is an important clog in the whole cycle of self-improvement.Mistakes->insights->curiosity->innovation->mistakes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. repeat‚Ä¶‚Ä¶If you want to move ahead and be a good senior programmer, you need to be insanely curious to get into everything you do. Curiosity is a tool that gets better the more you use it, and that‚Äôs exactly what people expect in an excellent senior programmer. Good senior developers channelize their curiosity in a structured manner so they can use the information accumulated during crunch situations.And here are some ways you can stroke your curiosity and build your brand.¬∑ Never stop learning. Pick up a course, a book, an online degree, and use it to enrich the ideas you already have, and to get new ideas.¬∑ Focus on the fundamentals. Make sure you understand how they work, so you can use it as the basis for your work.¬∑ Don‚Äôt tell your ideas. Show your projects. Ideas are overrated anyway. When your ideas are used and spread, you can build your brand.¬∑ Strike a balance between new and established ideas. Don‚Äôt blindly accept ideas about what you ‚Äúshould‚Äù know. Challenge the status quo.¬∑ Don‚Äôt just make it work. Make it extensible, reusable and pluggable. That is how you build your expertise.Everything starts with curiosity. If you‚Äôre not curious, you might as well quit. As Albert Einstein said:‚ÄúI have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.‚ÄùAbout the author:Ravi Rajan is a global IT program manager based out of Mumbai, India.

117,Don‚Äôt use SQL for your Big Data ELT pipelines,https://medium.com/swlh/dont-use-sql-for-your-big-data-elt-pipelines-a1f6681120a2?source=extreme_main_feed---------120-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"The time of coding data pipelines with high-level programming languagesETL pipelines have been made with SQL since decades, and that worked very well (at least in most cases) for many well-known reasons.In the era of Big Data, engineers and companies went crazy adopting new processing tools for writing their ETL/ELT pipelines such as Spark, Beam, Flink, etc. and started writing code instead of SQL procedures for extracting, loading and transforming their huge (or little ‚Äî sic!) amount of data.Since ETL/ELT pipelines can now be implemented as (a sequence of) jobs written in high-level programming languages like Scala, Java or Python, all your processing steps are expressed as pieces of code that can be structured, designed and, most of all, fully covered with automated tests in order to build robust development and deployment pipelines. In fact, data engineers can now take advantage of working in an environment that includes common tools like git, pull requests, automated tests, builds and even deployments saying goodbye to visual tools embedding huge SQL queries that are almost untestable, unreadable, unmaintainable and hated by any developer (people being involved in traditional DWH development can relate).The most underrated benefit of this new way of doing ETL/ELT is that automated testing is now a real thing for data pipelines exactly as it is for any other piece of software around the world.For the sake of clarity, let‚Äôs make an example with a piece of pseudo-code (similar to data processing frameworks like Apache Spark) representing a simple pipeline:Altough the pipeline is very simple, real jobs aren‚Äôt far away from this structure and one can immediately see that:In brief, the whole project can be build around clean, tested and reusable code making your data pipelines robust, easy to maintain and deploy.If you imagine to write the pipeline above with SQL, the result would be a very long query performing lots of case when statements, string manipulations, joins and type conversions all putted together in a single unmaintainable job.Even when things and responsibilities would be wisely separated by splitting the job in multiple parts, still SQL wouldn‚Äôt benefit of having a robust automated testing framwork. Moreover, things like type safety, compile-time errors, coding best practices, test-driven approach and so on wouldn‚Äôt be possible at all.Being honest, some commercial ETL and data integration tools offer some way to test your jobs (altough they are rarely used ‚Äî but that‚Äôs another story). The problem is they are proprietary, sometimes not-free and limited solution that offer data and schema validation relying on pre-built operators and may vary a lot based on the tool of choice.Intead, performing unit and integration testing with an high level language like Scala or Java is based on the same practices and rules as always and may vary very little from framework to framework with the advantage of giving you unparalleled robustness and coverage.While developers and data engineers got exited with the new trend (since the beginnings of Hadoop-centered solution to newer cloud-based-and-serverless data platforms) many companies didn‚Äôt appreciated the amount of new technologies and code the new Big Data ecosystem brought in and started soon to suffer from (at least three) common problems:Plus, since many Big Data technologies focused on providing ‚Äúfast‚Äù SQL engines for querying and managing data stored on HDFS, filesystems and cloud blob storages, many companies started adopting tools like Hive, Drill, Impala, etc. not only for data exploration and analysis but as the core of their new ETL/ELT pipelines.This architectural choice is mainly endorsed by companies who don‚Äôt have (and don‚Äôt want to hire) data engineers with the right skillset for dealing with these technologies or, instead of training their current employees, just prefer relying on their old-fashioned SQL experts for constructing and managing their brand new data lake.Unfortunately, when I worked as consultant, I‚Äôve seen more than one company implementing complex ETL/ELT pipelines with tools like Apache Hive embedding SQL queries within data integration tools offering classical GUIs with blocks-and-arrows and ‚Äúbig data connectors‚Äù. Under these circumstances, even a solid and rigorous data model didn‚Äôt prevent them of having an untested and unmaintainable system where every change is a painful development and is guaranteed to break something, somewhere (maybe in production).These GUI-and-SQL with no-need-of-coding-skills solutions is a trend that will bring more harm than good.I just covered the batch data processing use case, but with the need of implementing streaming solutions I feel these tools aren‚Äôt mature enough for solving newest challenges of data processing.Obviously not. SQL is a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration even in the Big Data ecosystem and it‚Äôs ok if your ETL/ELT jobs use pushdown for executing simple queries against a SQL-based engine when reading data. Moreover, there‚Äôs not a one-for-all solution: if all you have to do is (very) simple ETL and data integration, maybe you can still rely on some blocks executing dummy SQL queries onto your engine of choice.However, when it comes to do complex data transformation and processing, it is a better option to use in-memory and distributed processing engines like Spark, Beam etc. writing your business logic in a high-level programming language within a rock-solid development ecosystem supported by the best practices of writing good code.The result would be a robust, scalable and maintainable technology stack that both company and engineers would benefit from.Not having the right technical skills should not be the reason for not using the right tools.Cross-posted on Linkedin at this linkWRITTEN BY"

xperts differ widely in their predictions about how technological innovation will change the labor market, but they all see a need for changes in education,‚Äù write British professors and Phillip Brown in a recently published article, Rethinking the Race Between Education and Technology. While experts don‚Äôt generally agree on much, hey‚Äôre pretty much of one mind when it comes to the growing importance of skills and education in our 21st century digital economy.Every past technological transformation ultimately led to more jobs, higher living standards and economic growth. But, as a number of recent studies concluded, to ensure that this will indeed be the case, our emerging knowledge economy should be accompanied by the expansion of educational opportunities for everyone.While noting that this is the most likely scenario for the next 10‚Äì15 years, Keep and Brown also consider two potential longer-term scenarios. Perhaps AI will lead to even more pervasive and fundamental transformations in the nature of work, making it difficult for even those with a college or higher education to find a good job. Beyond that, some have suggested that in the more distant future we might see an even more radical, science-fiction-like transformation: the end of work as we‚Äôve long known it.The authors argue that considering such a spectrum of possibilities will help us better prepare for what‚Äôs essentially an unpredictable future. In that spirit, their paper discusses three different labor market scenarios: labor scarcity, job scarcity, and the end of work.Labor Scarcity‚ÄúSupporters of this scenario expect that as in the past, new positions and professions will emerge and create new jobs to replace any eliminated by new technology. Although there may be a challenging period of transition, especially for those displaced by automation, technological innovation will require new skills and create employment opportunities.‚ÄùInvestments in the skills required to meet these technology and workforce challenges are the key source of individual opportunity, social mobility, and economic welfare. This is especially important for workers without a four-year college degree who‚Äôve disproportionately borne the brunt of automation. Post-secondary education and training venues‚Äî e.g., community colleges, apprenticeships, online education, industry-specific training programs‚Äî are likely to be most relevant and accessible to these workers.However, existing education and training programs won‚Äôt be enough given the demands for life-long adult learning.‚ÄúWhat makes these arguments consistent is the idea of a race between technology and education to develop more advanced skills if people are to remain employable in tomorrow‚Äôs labor market. The fundamental challenge remains the reform of education systems to prepare the future workforce to take advantage of new opportunities emerging within a technologically advanced economy‚Ä¶People will need to adapt continuously and learn new skills and approaches within a variety of contexts.‚ÄùIn addition, new skills will be required to keep up with the increased digitalization of the economy. The article references the Essential Digital Skills Framework , a tool developed by the U.K. Government that defines the skills needed to benefit from, participate in, and contribute to the digital world. The framework includes five categories of skills: communicating, collaborating and sharing online; handling information and content securely; buying, selling and managing transactions; finding solutions to problems using digital tools; and being safe and legal online.Job ScarcityAutomation fears have understandably accelerated in recent years, as our increasingly smart machines are now being applied to activities requiring intelligence and cognitive capabilities that not long ago were viewed as the exclusive domain of humans. Previous technological innovation always delivered more long-run employment, but things can change. As a 2014 Economist article noted, while the majority of economists wave such worries away, some now fear that a new era of automation enabled by ever more powerful and capable computers could work out differently.‚ÄúThe job scarcity view recognizes that new technologies may enhance the skills of a relatively small proportion of the workforce, but the general direction of technological innovation is toward the redesign of existing jobs.‚Äù In that world, ‚Äúmuch of the knowledge content is captured in software that permits a high level of standardization and potential to deskill or automate a wide range of occupations, including technical, professional, and managerial roles.‚ÄùThis scenario reminds me of Software is Eating the World , a 2011 essay by Marc Andreessen, which predicted that software was poised to take over large swathes of the economy. Entrepreneurial companies all over the world are disrupting established industries with innovative AI-driven software solutions. An increasing number of businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services.‚ÄúJob scarcity points to a significant mismatch between an expanding supply of educated and skilled workers and a scarcity of high-quality job opportunities, primarily resulting from the routinization and segmentation of job roles rather than technological unemployment.‚ÄùA relatively small number of highly skilled, educated professionals and managers will develop the necessary algorithms, digital systems and business models, while a much larger number of less skilled workers will be needed to implement the procedures and managerial tasks which have been captured in algorithms and software.The End of WorkIn a 1930 essay, English economist John Maynard Keynes wrote about the onset of ‚Äúa new disease‚Äù which he named technological unemployment, that is, ‚Äúunemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.‚Äù Keynes predicted that the standard of living in advanced economies would be so much higher by 2030 that ‚Äúfor the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem ‚Äî how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure,‚Äù and most people would be working a 15-hour week or so, which would satisfy their need to work in order to feel useful and contended.Such an end-of-work scenario assumes that decades from now, most economic activity will be handled by super-smart machines developed and supervised by small groups of highly skilled professional and technical workers.‚Äù It would represent a profound dislocation for the education and training system‚Ä¶ where for the past three decades or more the focus has been on the role of education in equipping individuals to perform effectively in a changing labor market.‚Äù Instead, the aim of education ‚Äúwould be to help people gain the skills to live fulfilling lives, with the judgment and knowledge to be capable of addressing the complex problems that humanity will face.‚Äù‚ÄúAll three theories acknowledge rapid technological change, even if there is disagreement about its impact on labor demand and job quality,‚Äù write the authors in conclusion.‚ÄùThey all acknowledge the need for digital skills and an even greater focus on social skills. These skills are seen to be more important because people will need to be flexible and adaptable within rapidly changing labor markets and work contexts.Moreover, although the technical and knowledge requirements of what people do for a living may change, the social context in which people interact, network, and produce will remain, and social skills are more difficult for smart machines to develop.‚Äù Finally, ‚Äúall three theories see a need for educational reform and a greater focus on lifelong learning.‚ÄùOriginally published at https://blog.irvingwb.com.WRITTEN BY"
120,5 Things You Need to Know If Your Partner‚Äôs Love Language Is Physical Touch,https://psiloveyou.xyz/5-things-you-need-to-know-if-your-partners-love-language-is-physical-touch-53785ea788b9?source=extreme_main_feed---------123-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"According to Dr. Gary Chapman, pastor, counselor, and author of The Five Love Languages, people prefer to give and receive affection/love in one of five ways:The purpose of Dr. Chapman‚Äôs theory is simple: if we know how our partner prefers to give and receive love, we can better help them feel loved.If you and your partner have different love languages, you can find yourself in a bind if you don‚Äôt know what your partner‚Äôs love language is. You or your partner may end up feeling neglected and unloved.Let‚Äôs say you prefer to receive compliments, but your partner prefers to receive acts of service. Gift of the Magi-style, you keep telling them how great their butt looks like while they just want you to carry in the damn groceries every once in a while. You are DYING to hear a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù once in a while from them while they keep taking your car through the car wash.Both you and your partner are showing your love to the other, but it‚Äôs not translating. You‚Äôre speaking a different language. See the problem?Beyond showing your partner that you love them, you may also need to know some things about their love language for the why of it. ‚ÄúPhysical Touch‚Äù is the most misinterpreted love language, and it may be harder for you to understand if it‚Äôs not also your own.When I‚Äôm around other people, I want to touch them. Touch is how I connect with another person, how I acknowledge to them that I‚Äôm listening or that I care. ‚ÄúLove‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to just be romantic; it can be about just being a person relating to another person.Touch, when meeting someone can be as easy as shaking someone‚Äôs hand or hugging them, but it can also be continual. If I‚Äôm chatting with someone and I sense I don‚Äôt have their attention or they‚Äôve made me laugh, I might place my hand on their arm.Sometimes my touching someone else has triggered my more insecure partners.One of my partners lit into me because I‚Äôd touched a man‚Äôs arm twice. I‚Äôd known this man for a few years, and he was the husband of my friend. I was ‚Äúobviously‚Äù expressing sexual interest in him, my partner told me. I‚Äôd ‚Äúcrossed‚Äù the touch barrier. The ‚Äútouch barrier‚Äù being a term to describe the untold boundary between two people that once crossed can lead to‚Ä¶other forms of physical touch.My partner‚Äôs reaction was very much about him and not me. He had been cheated on in his most recent previous relationship, so he was hyperaware about anything that might seem like pre-cheating.Regardless of his issues, it still made for a not fun evening, and it took him some time to come to terms with hey, I‚Äôm just being a nice human and this is how I show it. It did also help that I reserved some specific types of public touches just for him (such as my hand on his waist or side).You might think ‚Äúphysical touch‚Äù would equate to your partner enjoying lots and lots of sex, but physical touch is much more than that. Sex alone is not going to fill up your physical touch partner‚Äôs ‚Äúlove tank‚Äù (as Dr. Chapman calls it). It‚Äôs much more about intimacy.You could fulfill your partner‚Äôs needs by holding their hand, laying your head on their shoulder, hugging, kissing, giving light massages, or even giving them a quick shoulder or hand squeeze. It doesn‚Äôt have to be excessive enough to make other people uncomfortable, but it does have to be recurrent.If ‚Äútouch‚Äù is not your love language, it REALLY may feel like too much. Think of having your hand on another person all of the time, and you have a pretty decent idea. Whenever my husband is touching me, I feel calm and centered, so the more often he can and does, the better.Whenever we are walking somewhere, I want my husband to hold my hand, or touch my back or shoulder. We hold hands in the car or he puts his hand on my neck. I want frequent hugs, back rubs, and massages. Cuddle sessions while we watch TV or talk. I want him to hold my face while he kisses me, and bring on the make-out sessions.While it may feel like too much, those little touches add up to make for you a very happy and satisfied romantic partner.Touch equals love, assurance, and care to us. It‚Äôs that simple. When we‚Äôre stressed or tired or upset or at odds with you or someone else that we care deeply about, we need assurance, and we get it through your touch on our bodies.Whenever I am struggling, I seek out my husband to get a good long hug. He‚Äôs my anchor, and even if he‚Äôs the person I‚Äôm mad at, I still want and need his touch to know that he still loves and cares about me.When I was single, I got my touch needs met by having a core group of friends who hugged whenever we saw one another. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but when I was feeling sad or lonely or neglected, I‚Äôd text or make a phone call and set up plans. I knew as soon as we saw each other, we‚Äôd hug, and I felt safe in those relationships.But I‚Äôve also been in romantic relationships where a partner would withhold physical contact from me every time he was angry. It felt, every time, abusive and purposefully neglectful.One of my exes would punish me by withholding touch from me for days. He‚Äôd recoil if I tried to hug him or touch his arm, and he‚Äôd sometimes take a few steps out of his way just to make sure our bodies wouldn‚Äôt brush against each other in the event we were walking past one another. As someone who feels loved and cared for when I am touched, I felt‚Ä¶hated and reviled by him.If that‚Äôs not how you want to make your partner feel, then don‚Äôt be cruel. It would be reasonable for you to need an hour or two to take a breather, but not days. If this is a pattern for you and your partner, it‚Äôs not healthy and it‚Äôd be time for you to consider seeing a couples‚Äô therapist.While ‚ÄúPhysical Touch‚Äù can be the most misinterpreted love language, it can also be the easiest. What could be more simple than reaching out to hold someone‚Äôs hand? It doesn‚Äôt require coming up with a thoughtful gift or taking time out of your day to plan something special.

If I‚Äôm angry only while the sun shines, then I can eat my dinner, watch shitty TV to get my mind a foot or two away from thoughts of the coming New Depression, and then go to bed in relative peace. But of course, all it takes is one reminder ‚Äî from someone else in the house, or from me reflexively opening Twitter and regretting it, or from my mind going astray ‚Äî for the anger to bare its teeth again.‚Äú[If] we have between 100[,000] and 200,000, we all together have done a very good job.‚Äù That was the president on Monday. If you thought the president wouldn‚Äôt see this moment as a chance to practice a little bit of indirect genocide, well, then you‚Äôre probably one of the lemmings who voted for him and will do so again. There‚Äôs no one to stop him. I would tell you to pay attention and be properly outraged. I would tell you to RESIST, indulging in a bit of spiritual Poe Dameron cosplay. But that accomplishes roughly as much as, if not less than, actual cosplay. What is resistance anyway? It means you TRY to fight back. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you succeed.And now it‚Äôs clear that you haven‚Äôt. Nor have I. Resistance was futile and perhaps always was. You now live in a nation that has been conquered from within. More than 3,000 people have died here from this virus, with multiples beyond that to come. And you‚Äôre supposed to be optimistic about it. If America lived up to its horrifyingly inflated self-image, our leaders would have reacted to the threat of this disease swiftly, compassionately, and effectively. Instead, both Republican and Democrat leaders alike saw an opportunity to loot and pillage at will, and they‚Äôre going to indulge as long as you‚Äôll allow them to, which probably means forever.We‚Äôre long past the realization that Democratic passivity is a feature and not a bug. As with the GOP, they‚Äôre all bought and paid for, which means YOU are bought and paid for. These people don‚Äôt serve you. They rule you. And now they‚Äôre gonna deprive you of oxygen until you have no choice but to submit to their collective will. Once you do, they‚Äôll clean out the joint and take the last can of Who hash with them.Republicans are poisoning the world online, and Democrats are busy telling you that What‚Äôs Happening Online Isn‚Äôt Real. It‚Äôs a perfect formula for rendering your voice worthless.Because what can you do about it right now? They have you right where they want you. You are trapped at home, and even that provides little sanctuary if you‚Äôre sick, or abused, or mentally ill, or in dire need of work. You can‚Äôt go out and protest. You can‚Äôt vote. You can‚Äôt fight back, because they already spent your tax dollars a billion times over on a military that could vaporize you in a millisecond. You can write to your representative, but those letters get printed out and thrown into a fire burning on a Koch brother‚Äôs dining room hearth. They don‚Äôt have any interest in saving you. Themselves? Most certainly. You, not so much.You, of course, can tweet if you like. Lord knows I do. It‚Äôs all useless. If they‚Äôre smart enough to siphon trillions of dollars from the treasury to only the richest among us, they‚Äôre smart enough to know how to use a mute button. And the most sincere pleas online are easily drowned out by the legion of trolls and bots whose only interest is in saying awful shit so loudly and so grotesquely that it stays in the cultural bloodstream far longer than actual sentiment can. Republicans are poisoning the world online, and Democrats busy telling you that What‚Äôs Happening Online Isn‚Äôt Real. It‚Äôs a perfect formula for rendering your voice worthless.You can go insane. I know I have. But that just means you suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. [alt-right voice] AWWWW WIDDLE BABY IS MAD HIS GWANDMA DIED BOOHOO!You can look to Barack Obama, who now exists mainly as a traitor to his own lofty rhetoric. You can say, ‚ÄúNothing but respect for MY president,‚Äù while conveniently ignoring the fact that Obama is now a fucking deadbeat who only takes a break from hanging out with rich admirers to tweet out the kind of supposed-to-be-heartwarming-but-actually-horrifying shit that gets CNN ratioed every other hour:You can hope journalists will save us by speaking truth to power. Oh, but sorry. You see, the only journalists left working now are themselves powerful access merchants whose pride and penchant for whitewashing basic truths under the guise of objectivity have left them openly truthering credible experts (even fucking virologists!) the same way our president would. So it‚Äôs only fitting that they would calmly watch a slow-motion holocaust play out rather than dare speak up about it.You can read history and perhaps take comfort in knowing that mankind has been through such turmoil before ‚Äî and worse! ‚Äî and still managed to thrive and build. But you‚Äôll excuse me if that doesn‚Äôt ease the sting of having to live through this in real time. The most powerful country in the world is also the stupidest. All it takes is for one famous person to beat the virus ‚Äî thanks to the kind of early testing and treatment NO ONE else here can get ‚Äî for certain Americans to wave off the situation as no biggie. I mean, if we can deny global warming, what chance does a pandemic stand? If you explain the virus in great detail to a baby, is the baby gonna get it? Or is that baby gonna just shit all over its own bib?You are ruled by such babies. Your president is a butcher. He is a man so uninterested in the human experience and so utterly unable to identify with any part of it that he may as well be a fucking space alien. And his unapologetic disregard for you has become contagious among those around him. Anyone standing within five feet of the president should be giving him the fucking DDT. But look at them standing next to him on your TV screen: senators, cabinet members, judges, generals, officials, CEOs. They do nothing. They tell him you‚Äôre doing a great job, sir, and we‚Äôre so thankful we have you while everything around them dies. The economy has died. Entire sections of industry, particularly small businesses, are about to go extinct. The body count will rise ‚Äî by the president‚Äôs own gleeful admission! ‚Äî into the six figures. They do nothing. They WILL do nothing. And your alternative to this come November is a man who believes that doing nothing is a fucking PRINCIPLE.Leaders like Biden are all scrambling to return us to a place of normalcy when, as you already know, normal has not been at all normal for years now. And the normal before that was a form of societal complacency that, in 2016, allowed a shitty used-car dealer to become the leader of the free world. What do you think happens to you if and when we get back to this fabled Normerica? Do you think they‚Äôll improve anything? Or do you think they‚Äôll look back upon the wreckage and tell you that your request for universal health care was just a silly fad? I know the answer.There‚Äôs no way out of this. You are living through a Great Sealing of the American people. This is a country that has pioneered and exploited so many of mankind‚Äôs worst addictions, and so it only stands to reason that we would eventually arrive at a place where our rulers would seize upon a serendipitous disease outbreak to practice a form of ultimate segregation. If they can keep you at home for just a little bit, with few options but to consume consume consume and without a chance to fight back against the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù making our horrific inequality everlasting, that‚Äôs perfect. Your delivery boy is acceptable collateral damage in this transaction.Just as the virus renders people alone in death, you will soon grow penniless and angry all by yourself, with no one to comfort or aid you. Thanks to the internet, you might even catch a nasty case of racism to exacerbate matters further. And then, once you‚Äôre finally able to walk back out into the daylight, you‚Äôll be roaming an America that‚Äôs been left fallow for you and for your descendants.I would tell you that we‚Äôre all in this together, but we‚Äôre really not. We‚Äôre not unified. We‚Äôre not friends. We can‚Äôt even be neighbors anymore. That‚Äôs always been the con: that America is the light at the end of its own tunnel. That the inherent goodness of America is what will always see it through hard times. But where is the goodness here, I ask you? What chance does good have when the forces of evil ‚Äî and evil is the right word to use now for what‚Äôs happening ‚Äî are so firmly entrenched and well stocked?My wife comforted me the other night by telling me that the best way to avoid feeling helpless is to help others. I took those words to heart, because they‚Äôve proven true for me so many times over the years. The next day, I gave $200 to NYC Health and Hospitals to help provide meals, scrubs, and beds to health care workers risking their lives and their mental health to flatten the curve. After I made my donation, I saw this:My chest is caving in.WRITTEN BY"
122,Guess Who Has the Most Power in a Relationship?,https://medium.com/personal-growth/guess-who-has-the-most-power-in-a-relationship-5746b7859c5c?source=extreme_main_feed---------125-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"We
had been to their apartment twice in the last two months. This was the third time. As before, the neighbors called, no doubt tired of the loud arguments that echoed through the thin apartment walls.She opened the door. Her hair was messy and eyes red from crying.‚ÄúHi Lisa,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Officer John Weiss. We met last month.‚Äù‚ÄúOh, yeah. We‚Äôre fine, just arguing. My husband, Steve, can be a jerk sometimes,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúOkay, well, my partner and I just need to talk to you and your husband separately to make sure everyone is okay,‚Äù I said.My partner and I determined that no crime had occurred. Lisa was a stay at home mother. Steve was a mechanic who liked to hit the pub with his buddies after work. Their infant child, miraculously, slept through all the yelling.Their arguments centered around Lisa feeling taken for granted. Steve made the money. Steve hung out with his buddies after work.It was obvious, despite her frustrations, that Lisa loved Steve. ‚ÄúSometimes he brings me flowers. He works hard, and he‚Äôs a good Dad. It‚Äôs just that sometimes I feel a bit invisible to him,‚Äù she once told me.My partner and I dealt with a lot of couples and situations like this. Some turned into domestic violence incidents, but many were the kind of common arguments that spouses have.Money, sex, and children are often the issues that couples fight over. But beneath the surface, unmet expectations and diminished self-respect can be the real problems.The late Gordon Livingston, M.D. was a graduate of West Point and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Awarded the Bronze star for valor in Vietnam, he went on to become a psychiatrist and writer.In 13 months, Dr. Livingston lost one son to suicide and another to leukaemia. He deeply understood the human condition and tragedies of life, and poured wisdom into his eloquent, succinct books.One of my favorite books by Dr. Livingston is ‚ÄúToo Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now.‚ÄùIf this book had been published in the early 1990s, and I had read it as a rookie cop, I would have had some valuable advice for Lisa. Specifically, chapter five of Dr. Livingston‚Äôs book, which contained the following title:‚ÄúAny relationship is under the control of the person who cares the least.‚ÄùIt was clear to my partner and I that Steve had taken his wife Lisa for granted. He was the income winner. He had the freedom to socialize with his buddies after work. Lisa was home all day with their child. She made dinner for Steve when he came home.Steve wasn‚Äôt a bad guy. He was always polite and apologetic with us. But whether intentional or not, he seemed to care less about his marriage than Lisa.It isn‚Äôt supposed to be this way. We all dream of falling in love and entering a relationship built on mutual love, respect, and admiration.Maybe the problem is in how we approach relationships? Instead of accepting our partners the way they are, perhaps we foist too many expectations on them?Listen to Dr. Livingston as he describes how most people find a partner:‚ÄúThe ways in which people come together and choose each other place a great emphasis on the potent combination of sexual attraction and a sort of enlightened self-interest that evaluates the other person on a series of qualities and achievements: education, earning potential, shared interests, trustworthiness, and philosophy of life. Each person‚Äôs assessment of a prospective mate using these standards creates a certain set of expectations. It is the failure of these expectations over time that causes relationships to dissolve.‚ÄùSo what do you do when expectations are not met? How do you right the ship if your partner cares less than you do about the relationship?Good communication is important. You have to broach difficult issues and feelings with your partner. Lisa did that in her relationship with Steve. She knew he held the power and she felt taken advantage of. Steve promised to change, but somehow things always slid back to the same old problems.Psychologist Esther Ghijsen noted in the article ‚ÄúLove Hurts‚Äù for United Academics Magazine the following:Research shows that the more power someone has in a relationship, the less committed he is to it (Grauerholz, 1987).If you‚Äôre the one without the power in a relationship, what should you do? Here‚Äôs what Dr. Ghijsen advises:In order to gain back control, you need to acknowledge your fears, and then toss them aside. A new study shows that the one who‚Äôs in power in a relationship also has ‚Äòhigher quality alternatives‚Äô in life ‚Äî which means his family, free time, friends and other dating partners are of greater value to him. Here lies the key to solving your problem: start building those alternatives yourself. Go out with friends, start that new course or class, host a dinner party for your family ‚Äî invest some time in people that are not your lover.A lot of marriages risk the slow march towards alienation. Eventually, one ends up showing and/or expressing less respect and affection for the other.According to Dr. Livingston, the person who cares less ‚Äúappears to be a bid to seize control of the relationship.‚Äù Dr. Livington goes on to note the following:‚ÄúThat this effort has been successful can be seen when one spouse has a greater investment in reconciliation and is much more upset at the prospect of ending the marriage. When I point out to people that much of the distress they are feeling is not shared by their partner and that this is the source of their feeling ‚Äòout of control,‚Äô they are usually quick to recognize their predicament. While it takes two people to create a relationship, it takes only one to end it.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs possible to reinvent yourself. You are not defined by who you are today or the status of your relationship. People can improve themselves, and their relationships.Consider the story of Joseph Pilates. He was sickly as a child, and studied various self-improvement systems. He examined Eastern practices like Zen Buddhism and admired the ancient Greek ideal of man perfected in body, mind, and spirit.An article about Joseph Pilates in VeryWellFit.com noted:‚ÄúGerman-born Joseph Pilates was living in England and working as a circus performer and boxer when he was placed in forced internment in England at the outbreak of World War I. While in the internment camp, he began to develop the floor exercises that evolved into what we now know as the Pilates mat work.‚ÄùJoseph Pilates, against great hurdles, changed who he was. From a sickly child to a self-confident, physically fit man.Even with meager resources, it‚Äôs possible to change your life. That‚Äôs precisely what Lisa did.Several months went by after our last domestic disturbance call involving Lisa and Steve. I worried that maybe things fell apart and they divorced. Then one day while on duty, I bumped into Lisa at a coffee shop.‚ÄúHi Lisa, how are you?‚Äù I asked.‚ÄúOfficer Weiss, hello. I‚Äôm good. Real good,‚Äù she said. There was a radiance about her and she looked fit and happy. I noticed she was wearing exercise clothing.‚ÄúBeen working out?‚Äù I said.‚ÄúYeah. I found a Pilates class here in town awhile back. It‚Äôs been great. I met these two girls there, and we became great friends. They have kids too, and we hang out a lot.‚ÄùLisa went on to tell me that the Pilates class saved her marriage. She got physically fit and gained new friends. Her self-esteem and self-confidence grew. And, it didn‚Äôt hurt that her fitness attracted the admiration and glances of other men.‚ÄúAt first it drove Steve crazy. Every time he saw some guy looking at me, he got jealous. But then he noticed my new circle of girlfriends and the life I was creating for myself. Since then, Steve has been great. He‚Äôs home right now with our daughter, so I have to run.‚Äù Lisa smiled and thanked me for helping her out.‚ÄúEverything is within your power,
and your power is within you.‚Äù
‚Äï Janice TrachtmanJust like Joseph Pilates, Lisa was in a difficult situation, but she marshaled the resources she had, and transformed herself into a strong, independent woman.She invested in herself, and changed the power dynamic in her relationship. As a result, her husband Steve saw her differently, and stopped taking her for granted.This is how you avoid becoming a victim. You invest in yourself. You refuse to put your happiness at the mercy of another‚Äôs attention or approval. You give love and respect but expect both in return.There are no guarantees in life, and some relationships are unhealthy despite best efforts. But for many, taking an approach similar to Lisa‚Äôs can rebalance the power in a relationship.Invest in your fitness, find good friends, and show your significant other your independent, self-confident side. Doing so could change your relationship for the better.I‚Äôm John P. Weiss. Writer, artist, and retired police chief. Get on my free email list here for the latest writing and artwork.WRITTEN BY"
123,What Your Resting Heart Rate Tells You About Your Health,https://elemental.medium.com/what-your-resting-heart-rate-tells-you-about-your-health-e6cf071c3d59?source=extreme_main_feed---------126-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"ould human lives be extended by slowing down our hearts? Triggered by the observation that mammals with a higher heart rate live shorter than those with a slower one, this is the question that Dr. Herbert J. Levine, an eminent cardiologist and professor emeritus at Tufts University School of Medicine, asked in his 1997 article ‚ÄúRest Heart Rate and Life Expectancy.‚ÄùTo this day, his question has not been fully answered. But several recent studies have found important links between slower hearts and longer lives, elevating resting heart rate to the level of an important health indicator.With the increasing popularity of smartwatches and other tracking devices, people are more aware than ever of their own resting heart rates, a measure defined by the number of heartbeats per minute while at rest, like when you‚Äôre sitting or lying down, no sooner than two hours after exercising. But how exactly to interpret that number, and what to do with that information, might not be so clear.To complicate things further, resting heart rates can widely vary from person to person, as much as 70 beats per minute, according to a new study that looked at the largest dataset of daily resting heart rates ever collected.The most established fact about resting heart rate is that it‚Äôs inversely associated with a person‚Äôs level of physical fitness. In other words: The fitter you are, the lower your resting heart rate (elite athletes, for example, tend to have notoriously low heart rates). This happens because, as you exercise, your heart muscle becomes stronger and requires fewer heartbeats to pump blood.When trying to figure out the reason why people with lower resting heart rates seem to live longer, researchers assumed that there wasn‚Äôt a direct, causal association. The main assumption among scientists was that people with a slower heartbeat just happened to be fitter and physical fitness is what made them live longer.‚ÄúIn general, when we talk about resting heart rate, there is pretty good evidence that lower is better.‚ÄùThat assumption was put to test by a study led by Dr. Magnus T. Jensen, head of the department of cardiology at the Copenhagen University Hospital Amager & Hvidovre. His team analyzed data from almost 2,800 middle-aged men followed for 16 years in Copenhagen. ‚ÄúEvery individual had had an assessment of VO2 max, which is a measure of fitness level,‚Äù Jensen says. That data allowed them to conclude that there was in fact a direct association, independent of physical fitness, between having a lower heart rate and a lower risk of mortality.‚ÄúIn general, when we talk about resting heart rate, there is pretty good evidence that lower is better,‚Äù says Barry A. Franklin, PhD, director of preventive cardiology & cardiac rehabilitation at Beaumont Health.So what‚Äôs considered a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range for a resting heart rate?According to the American Heart Association, a normal resting heart rate ranges from 60‚Äì100 beats per minute. Most experts agree with that statement, although it is not an absolute consensus, particularly on the higher end. ‚ÄúI respectfully disagree with calling 95 or 100 beats per minute normal,‚Äù Franklin says, adding that this range might already be linked to a lower life expectancy.This week‚Äôs comprehensive Scripps Research study published in PLOS, showed that what is considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for one person may be abnormal for another. Individuals‚Äô average resting heart rates were found to be as low as 40 and as high as 110 beats per minute. The researchers took data from wearable devices worn by more than 92,000 people over a median of 320 days.The study also highlighted that an individual‚Äôs resting heart rate is pretty much consistent over time, and so deviations from the typical rate could be an important sign that something is wrong. ‚ÄúThe variability of the resting heart rate may provide additional information, not only for cardiovascular health but also for pulmonary status, infectious disease detection, reproductive health, and possibly more,‚Äù says Giorgio Quer, first author of the study.One of the limitations of the research is that it only tracked the participant‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù heart rate, without looking at their actual health. We do not have information on the health condition of the individuals, so we cannot say that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù also means healthy, says Quer.There are things you can do to slow it down to a healthier rate. One of the most important is exercising regularly. ‚ÄúEven a brisk walking program can lower the resting heart rate in 10‚Äì12 beats per minute,‚Äù says Franklin.If your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats per minute, with or without symptoms, you should be evaluated by a doctor.While there are drugs, such as beta-blockers, that can lower your resting heart rate, healthy people with a high resting heart rate but no actual symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain, shouldn‚Äôt take them unless advised by their health care provider. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if intervening on heart rate with a drug would prolong these people‚Äôs lives. But we do have an astounding amount of information to prove that lifestyle interventions ‚Äî weight loss, increasing fitness, lowering blood pressure ‚Äî are associated with both a lower heart rate and longevity,‚Äù Jensen says.If your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats per minute, with or without symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, you should be evaluated by a doctor, said Dr. Matthew Martinez, chair of the American College of Cardiology‚Äôs sports and exercise cardiology section.You should also pay attention to sudden changes. ‚ÄúYour heart rate will vary during a day, after caffeine ingestion, a stressful moment, and even from walking down the hallway,‚Äù says Martinez. ‚ÄúBut rapid changes ‚Äî of more than 20 beats per minute within a minute at rest ‚Äî should be brought to the attention of a health care provider.‚ÄùAlthough having a lower heart rate is generally considered a good thing, there are a few exceptions, Martinez notes. If you are neither an athlete nor a regular exerciser, and your heart is beating under 60 beats per minute (a condition called bradycardia), that may be a sign of specific medical conditions such as thyroid disease or a problem caused by abnormalities in the electrical conduction system, especially if symptoms such as dizziness and lightheadedness are present.Experts find it positive that people are more familiar with their heart rates. ‚ÄúIt means that people are getting more engaged in their health,‚Äù says Seth S. Martin, director of the advanced lipid disorders program of the Ciccarone Center, Johns Hopkins Medicine. ‚ÄúBy being better informed and taking a more active role in their health, they can prevent downstream problems.‚ÄùTracking your heart rate could also be useful for detecting certain heart rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation, which can be asymptomatic, according to Dr. Nino Isakadze, a clinical cardiology fellow at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. A recent study funded by Apple, the Apple Heart Study, concluded that an Apple Watch app was able to identify atrial fibrillation with an 84% accuracy.But it‚Äôs important not to get overly focused on the tracking. ‚ÄúThere is a risk of information overload,‚Äù says Martinez. ‚ÄúI often advise patients about the anxiety that comes with that information and how to handle that data. It is an important indicator, but a fixation on the actual number is sometimes harmful too.‚Äù He advises his patients to check their resting heart rate no more than three or four times a week, always choosing different times of the day and no sooner than two hours after exercise and one hour after caffeine intake. Many tracking devices, such as the Apple Watch, show the average daily resting heart rate, which provides a more reliable picture of the speed of your heartbeat than checking it at any given moment of the day.‚ÄúThere is certainly a risk that tracking heart rate can create anxiety which can sometimes lead to elevated heart rate and unnecessary doctor visits and testing,‚Äù said Isakadze.Interpreting the data can also be challenging. ‚ÄúThere are lots of reasons why your heart rate can be abnormal, either high or low. Devices can identify abnormalities, but accuracy and utility are still yet to be determined. Identifying all this information without understanding what to do with the data can be potentially harmful,‚Äù Martinez said.Jensen shared an anecdote of how people could use that information productively in their daily lives. When he asked his Uber driver in London if he was enjoying the heart rate feature of his Apple Watch, the man told him he had noticed an increase in his beats per minute after starting his own business and going through a high level of stress. That made him think about his well-being and lead him to take a few days off.If it is true that ‚ÄúGod has given each of us just so many heartbeats,‚Äù as the late Dr. Levine was fond of saying, then the slower we play them out, the longer we may live.WRITTEN BY"

he last time I saw my mom, I dropped off groceries and household goods for her to get through at least a few weeks of social distancing. I thought she understood that the world was changing and we‚Äôd all have to stay home for a while. In fact, I told her that my five year old daughter and I would be hunkering down at home too.A few days later, after my daughter‚Äôs school closed for coronavirus concerns and I reiterated my plans to stay home, my mom texted me to say she needed groceries but couldn‚Äôt afford them. What she meant was that she wanted other food, different food.I guess I was confused. Why was she acting like nothing in the world had changed? Hadn‚Äôt we already prepped for this?As it turns out, my mom didn‚Äôt want me to face the ‚Äúhassle‚Äù of shopping for her, but not for fear of catching or spreading the virus. Instead, she insinuated that I simply don‚Äôt like running errands for her and so she expected me to pay for her groceries on Instacart.Don‚Äôt worry. I went ahead and paid for my mom‚Äôs order. She got those extra groceries she wanted. But I‚Äôm going to be honest that the whole thing rubbed me the wrong way and I felt a wave of emotions hit me as soon as we finished talking.It was frustrating to see that she expected my help when I‚Äôd just been there trying to make sure she was set for at least a few weeks. And it was frustrating that she was behaving as if life would go on like usual.For a woman who has spent my entire life preaching preparedness for the end of the world, she sure isn‚Äôt taking the coronavirus seriously.T
he fact that I ever write about the difficulties with my mom has led to people accusing me of being the worst kind of daughter. From what other folks tell me, it doesn‚Äôt matter what my mom has done. Many people seem to think I owe her complete and utter loyalty simply because she ‚Äúgave me life.‚ÄùOur culture has this weird fixation with children honoring their parents despite the fact that it doesn‚Äôt really value motherhood much at all. It‚Äôs a strange reality I‚Äôve tried to grasp ever since I became a mother myself.At one end of the spectrum, strangers judge every move a mother makes. But at the other end of it all, people push this myth of the perfect, saintly mother who can do no wrong.There‚Äôs still a lot of stigma for coming out and talking about the abuses committed by our mothers. Many people seem to think that by talking about those things, or simply admitting that your relationship with your mother is complicated somehow makes you a traitor to your kin.F
or a long time, I contested the notion that I am an awful daughter. It didn‚Äôt seem fair that children could suffer so much from unfit parents and then grow up expected to stand by those same faulty caregivers no matter what.Relationships are complicated, I‚Äôd argue. Especially those relationships with the family you didn‚Äôt choose. You and I never asked to be here. We had no choice in how we got here or how our mothers shaped us.I always thought it seemed silly to expect grown children to coverup for their parents' wrongdoing. And even worse to pretend that your honesty about a family member made your love any less true.The expectations for any child to keep ugly family secrets has always bugged me. Even back when I was under great duress to keep them as a kid.R
ecently, I‚Äôve turned a corner in my relationship with my mother. Internally, at least. I‚Äôve realized that maybe I am an awful daughter, and maybe that‚Äôs perfectly okay.I am, after all, the daughter my parents raised in an enormous amount of dysfunction. Maybe I don‚Äôt owe my mother (or my deceased father) the loyalty that some folks insist I do.Perhaps there‚Äôs something to be said for parents who do a shitty job of passing down family values, and then expect their children to want to spend the rest of their grown years together.Some parents may never own up to the fact that they didn‚Äôt treat their children right. And they didn‚Äôt teach them well either.That‚Äôs not the child‚Äôs fault (not even as they grow up), and I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs our responsibility to teach our parents to do better. Our biggest responsibility is to develop ourselves, move past the pain, and learn how to do better for our kids if we become parents ourselves. We have to do better so we can build healthy relationships outside of our toxic families.For instance, as the mother of a young child, I put the onus on me to foster a healthy relationship with my child. Not her. I can‚Äôt even imagine raising my daughter into adulthood and then expecting that she be responsible for the quality of our connection.If I never took the time and energy to know my child? If I never let her spread her wings or see a healthy relationship in real life?I hardly think I‚Äôd have the right to demand she respect me and give me her loyalty.I
t‚Äôs okay to challenge the conventional wisdom that says you must ‚Äúhonor your parents‚Äù regardless of what they do to you. You don‚Äôt owe your mother your undying loyalty just because she birthed you or raised you.That doesn‚Äôt mean you need to be cruel or dismissive. Honestly, I am going to keep helping my mom out, but I‚Äôm also not going to break my back living up to her expectations, either.And I‚Äôm done worrying about being a ‚Äúgood‚Äù daughter. The reality is that my parents broke my heart, broke my spirit, and wounded me in ways that few others can. I don‚Äôt say that to point myself out as a victim, nor to find pity. Plenty of people have had terrible parents.But I‚Äôve learned that we don‚Äôt need to live in that painful place where we allow ourselves to be controlled by people who use and abuse us. Not even when they do it in the name of love.My mother berated me for most of my life. Called me crazy in the name of love. Told me I needed ‚Äúdeliverance from demons‚Äù in her twisted view of love. She did everything she could to knock me down and keep me from interacting in the ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù She wanted to keep me in her evangelical bubble where Jesus heals and she talked to angels.She still wants me to believe that she hears directly from God.If I bought into the notion that I owe my mother my loyalty to the point where I cannot be honest about what we‚Äôve been through, I would have stayed stuck. A voiceless victim.Instead, I‚Äôve found the freedom to talk about my parents and childhood in a way that‚Äôs allowed me to heal, move forward, and even help other folks heal from their trauma.So, if that makes me an awful daughter, I‚Äôm okay with that. Despite anything my parents thought about how they raised me, they didn‚Äôt offer the tools we needed to be close.Being an awful daughter keeps me sane. And I even think it helps me grow as a mother.I suppose that's not so awful after all.WRITTEN BY"
125,The Future of Humanity Is Interplanetary,https://onezero.medium.com/the-future-of-humanity-is-interplanetary-e9bd32de2f5f?source=extreme_main_feed---------128-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"It‚Äôs easy to imagine we‚Äôre coming to an end.We are, after all, facing a warming planet, ocean acidification, impending mass extinction, and immense resource depletion. It‚Äôs not such a leap to suggest that humanity has hit its peak and is now poised for a great unraveling.But in taking that apocalyptic view, you‚Äôd miss something important. There‚Äôs a path leading out of the despair. Amid the Sturm and the Drang is another, very different kind of future. To find it, all you have to do is look up. That future is the solar system, and if we get things right, that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre headed.limate change is just one aspect of much broader planetary transformation. Ten thousand years ago, when the last Pleistocene-era glaciers melted, our planet entered the geologic epoch scientists call the Holocene. Earth‚Äôs air, water, rock, and life were in a stable state that was mostly warm and mostly moist (with not too much ice). Now, human activity has driven Earth out of the Holocene and into a new epoch scientists call the Anthropocene, a planetary change in which humanity now dominates how the planet‚Äôs systems function.The advent of the Anthropocene is often depicted as a battle between one kind of politics over another: Republicans versus Democrats or business interests versus environmentalists. That view is flawed.Over the past 50 years, humans have explored the solar system and all its worlds. The understanding we‚Äôve gained from those journeys shows us that the Anthropocene is a predictable transition. It‚Äôs a change that inevitably occurs when any species builds a world-spanning, energy-intensive civilization like ours. From an astronomical point of view, the Anthropocene is a kind of planetary adolescence. You can‚Äôt stop your kids from becoming teenagers. Instead, you can only hope they come out the other side with maturity, wisdom, and compassion. In a similar way, to survive climate change, we need to grow into new kind of cooperative relationship with the rest of the biosphere and the rest of the planet.There is evidence that it‚Äôs already happening.This year marks the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong‚Äôs first steps on the moon. Five decades after that epic voyage, there are signs that we are, finally, about to take the high frontier seriously. From rocket billionaires to robot asteroid explorers, a new scenario for the future is emerging. The next few hundred years don‚Äôt have to be a grind down to extinction. Instead, they may become a grand drama played out on the many stages of many new worlds.Up until the start of the 21st century, common wisdom held that NASA was stuck. Rather than sending astronauts on bold missions beyond our planet, the space agency had become hostage to the whims of successive administrations, leaving it underfunded and rudderless. By the end of the space shuttle program, in 2011, NASA was hitching rides for its astronauts on Russian rockets.Then came the ‚ÄúNew Space‚Äù movement. Private enterprise jumped into the exosphere, and, working with NASA, the future of space travel was reenergized.Leading most famously with Elon Musk and the founding of SpaceX, a new generation of moneyed entrepreneurs are working to slash the cost of heaving material and people into orbit. Along with SpaceX, Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos‚Äô Blue Origin have all developed working versions of their spaceships. Branson has kept his focus on space tourism, while Bezos and Musk are developing new classes of reusable rockets for space exploration and commerce.But Musk, Bezos, and Branson are just the start. A small army of new companies are entering space enterprise. As of today, that global space economy is already valued at $350 billion, with predictions it will rise to $1 trillion dollars by 2040. Last year alone, space companies received $3.9 billion in private investment.But the New Space era is about more than just rockets. Companies like Planet Labs and Spire Global are seeking ways to offer space-based continuous monitoring of the agricultural, environmental, and industrial state of the planet. Space manufacturing represents another frontier, with companies like Made in Space already exploring 3D-printing techniques for zero gravity.Most of these endeavors, however, remain tethered to Earth. If humanity‚Äôs long-term future is to be interplanetary, what will take us far outward?Figuring out how to make it in space may be a turning point in helping us understand how to make it on Earth.Our growing understanding of the richness of the solar system‚Äôs other worlds is providing much of the motivation. While no human has ventured beyond the moon since the era of Armstrong, our robot emissaries have been fruitful travelers.Our space probes have now visited every planet in the solar system. More than 20 missions have visited Venus. Mars bears the tire tracks of four different rovers. And it‚Äôs not just planets that we‚Äôve visited. Our robot spaceships have targeted every kind of solar system body: asteroids, comets, and even thousand-mile-wide dwarf planets. What we‚Äôve learned from these missions is that the solar system is a whole lot more interesting than Apollo-era scientists ever gave it credit for. And most important, our explorations have shown us that the solar system is very, very wet.Beneath the frozen surface of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, lies a 60-mile-deep ocean that contains more water than rests on Earth. Many of the bigger moons of Jupiter and Saturn host subsurface oceans. And while Mars is a dry desert now, scientists have firm evidence that it was once a blue world with vast lakes or oceans where hip-deep torrents rushed across its surface. At least some water remains on the red planet in the form of ice at its poles and below its surface. Just last year, evidence revealed a liquid subsurface Martian lake spanning more than 10 miles.Water is needed for more than sustaining human life and growing food‚Äîit‚Äôs also the basis for making rocket fuel. Finding a wet solar system means the raw materials are out there to help build a long-term human presence among the planets. Even a small asteroid orbiting the sun can contain as much as $50 billion in rare metals like platinum. That‚Äôs why interest remains high in investigating technologies that may one day form the backbone of a robust space-mining economy.Even so, none of our solar system explorations have revealed anything like a turnkey world ready for humans. There is still no place in the solar system, other than Earth, where you can walk around without a spacesuit.What our explorations have shown us, however, is that with the right kind of imagination and technology, we might succeed at carving out new domains for human settlement, commerce, and culture. This is a project that will without a doubt take generations. Building a human civilization beyond Earth will require more than machines. To thrive in artificial environments, we need to probe what exactly an environment is. Giant domed cities on Mars that populate the imaginations of science fiction writers and Elon Musk will need their own ecosystems. There will be plants. There will be microbes. There will be soils and an atmosphere. How do life, air, water, and rock function together to maintain stable conditions?In order to survive the Anthropocene, we are asking these same questions. Becoming interplanetary will demand the same sensitivity to ecosystems that future climate scientists need to save Earth. In other words, figuring out how to make it in space may be a turning point in helping us understand how to make it on Earth.So, what does the next 1,000 years hold for humanity? We tend to imagine warp-drive engines taking us to the stars √† la Star Trek or Star Wars. But if we take the laws of physics seriously, then the finite speed of light and the vast distances between stars may make interstellar civilization unlikely. Even with the best technologies we can imagine today, it would still take at least 100 years to cross between the stars. Barring a scientific miracle, the next 1,000 years will probably not involve humanity building an interstellar empire.But with technologies of far lesser capacities that we can imagine right now, crossing the solar system might take just months. Jupiter, for example, is really not that far away. If we can make it through climate change and navigate the Anthropocene transformation, then the solar system could be where the drama of human culture‚Äôs next millennia plays out. All the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets could become our stage, Earth included.The good news is that the first act has already begun.WRITTEN BY"
126,The Future,https://medium.com/@ralvarez_67008/the-future-10ac32ec6a59?source=extreme_main_feed---------129-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"A new year has begun ‚Äî 2020, in case you still need to adjust your watch ‚Äî and brought with it a myriad of predictions, forecasts, bets and guesses on 2020, the decade and beyond. I had a chance to review some of those and come up with my own insights ‚Äî also informed by my work and the conversations I had over the years with people working in technology, business and policy around the globe. Here, you will find a compilation of highlights on several predictions I‚Äôve read and my insights on the years ahead.To get started, I listed some of the most interesting documents and thought pieces I‚Äôve seen around. I hope such inventory can be a resource for those who are interested in knowing more about the topics (the links to the documents are included in the text), but also support future checking and assessment.Most of the things I read and the sources I follow are about (or at the intersection of) technology, business and global issues. On the one hand, these are the topics that excite me and get most of my attention professionally; on the other hand, I sincerely believe that we need to combine those perspectives (and others) to grasp on and be capable to minimally understand and improve today‚Äôs increasingly complex reality.The list below includes a diverse set of reports and opinion pieces. It is not extensive, nor was developed with the intent to follow any particular directions ‚Äî it is just a list of readings that I found interesting. It combines different types of things, from long and well-prepared reports to short collections of opinions, from documents resulting from global surveys to others created out of the mind of the authors. They were published by global think tanks, banks, research companies, media outlets, individuals who work in business and technology.Peter Diamandis and his team mapped 20 technology-enabled megatrends that will dominate the decade. The continued increase of global abundance is the overarching trend and many of the others are related to health, expanded longevity and the augmentation of human (and humanity) capabilities and possibilities. I found particularly interesting the idea that advertisement will be disrupted ‚Äî we shall all keep one eye on this; better, keep an AI on this.For the third year in a row, CB Insights has created a map of the startups that can potentially change the world in 2020. Such map is organized in 12 hard technology (I borrowed this terminology from you, @Pedro) categories ‚Äî e.g. photonics, quantum, genetics etc. The underlining message is clear: deep scientific knowledge and research (in other words: investments in science) are behind the ‚Äútransformational‚Äù potential of the ventures highlighted in the report ‚Äî sorry Brazilian friends, digital entrepreneurship is great, super important and on a steep rise in our country, but it is not enough to fundamentally change the world. The list of companies presented is worth of checking and following.Deloitte released a series of predictions on technology, telecommunications and media for 2020. They signalize towards digitization, increased abundance, the democratization of access and the eminent disruption of certain industries and business models ‚Äî like paid TV, for instance. It was curious to note that cycling was included in the report. In spite of depicting a general trend, it marks that the ways through which people access networks and consume content will continue to vary significantly across the globe.Gartner presents a series of strategic (why strategic? don‚Äôt ask me‚Ä¶) predictions for 2020 and beyond. Those are at the intersection of technology, business and consumer behavior. The focus on individual and collective behavior stands out. Gartner predicts that corporations will find it increasingly hard to succeed in digital transformation ‚Äî my personal saying: ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù is essentially analog, it is about mindsets, human build systems, beliefs, behaviors, protocols and institutions. It is easy to talk digital transformation, but very hard to implement it if you think it is about tech. For those interested, I suggest Tony Saldanha‚Äôs book.Forbes invited 25 thinkers to contribute ideas that will shape the 2020s. It called my attention that many ideas are about the participation of women in society, business and governance ‚Äî we have data to support the idea, for sure. Some of the predictions are about specific technologies (e.g. the end of the internal combustion engines), but the most important message in this piece is that ideas shape the world and we should not neglect their power ‚Äî and a new set of ideas is emerging and replacing some of today‚Äôs predominant lines of thinking. Stay tuned.Mark Minevich, a friend and GFCC fellow, tells a story about the Workplace of 2030 . It is an interesting depiction of a scenario that combines different technologies already around or announced to be under development. It is a good reminder that a positive future scenario arising from the combination of several new technologies is very plausible, but many challenges lie ahead in society ‚Äî the transition will not be an easy one.David Schwab foresees the future of Influence in a piece published at Forbes. It could also have a title like ‚Äúthe future of marketing or ‚Äúthe future of how to make people want things‚Äù. Fame has been democratized ‚Äî influencers and celebrities seem to come from every and anywhere now ‚Äî it‚Äôs the influencers‚Äô age, I agree with you Mauricio. It called my attention how technology will enable consumers to have personalized access and engage with influencers ‚Äî or their digital avatars, also becoming part of real-time creation processes.Inc published a list of 25 tech predictions for 2020. Most of them are about how businesses will use technologies like AI and 5G, or the new things that will attract investment. Nevertheless, what called my attention were the predictions related to customer/citizen behavior: a backlash against mass media and fake news and an increased emphasis on privacy can be expected. The emergence of new organizational forms and the disproportional risks that cyber-crime poses to SMEs are also worth of noting.Omidyar Network identifies 5 emerging trends that will drive change in big tech in 2020 and beyond. They are mostly related to the emergence of new expectations, types of demands and a reconfigured power balance between users and digital companies, governments and big corporations ‚Äî I imagine this is related to your work Agustin. The narrative highlights the importance of and suggests the need (and demand) for a more diverse digital landscape, not solely dominated by behemoth digital platforms. Tough game. It will get tougher.Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Imagine 2030 is a thought-provoking document ‚Äî one of my favorites. I like the diversity and richness of the ideas, which can even be contradictory, and think it is the most creative document listed here. Technology is central for many of the predictions but the thoughts on the emergence of new dynamics and demands in society must be highlighted ‚Äî the return of labor unions, the end of high corporate profits, tensions between generations and the return of social sciences. Naturally, it also covers finance and Europe.The European Council on Foreign Relations foresees 10 (plus one) foreign policy trends that will occupy the attention in Europe. I was particularly interested to see that clean energy policies are perceived as potentially divisive topic in Europe, to the same degree that immigration has been for some time. The theme of succession in several countries should also be noted, as those processes will inject additional uncertainty to an already complex world.WEF‚Äôs Global Risks Report was first launched in 2007 and results from a survey with global decision-makers. Climate-related issues grew in importance over the years and became indisputably dominant in its 2020 edition ‚Äî the underlining message is that sustainability should be the priority topic for all of us. Other relevant topics are related to technology risk and/or result from the interactions among other issues. Arguably, the risks we are likely to face in the years to come are increasingly connected and systemic ‚Äî for instance: climate change is very likely to fuel social rage.Kearney, which started 2020 with a re-brand, presented 10 predictions for 2020 that reinforce several of the others here commented, particularly in relation to geopolitical challenges ‚Äî on Earth and space. One distinctive aspect is that it provides visibility to some emerging opportunities for business: the disaster economy, water, the halal economy. In addition to that, it comes with a check in relation to what was predicted for 2019. Good job!So‚Ä¶ this is how I read all the above trends and predictions. This is my take on the issues, challenges and opportunities in front of us, right now, at this very moment..1. The world is increasingly complex. The emergence of new types on actors and demands in society, increased volatility in political systems, global connectivity, the exhaustion of political representation systems (including Western democracies) and, especially, the proliferation of new themes and topics we need to address (e.g. privacy rights, gene editing, space exploration, loss of biodiversity, terrorism etc.) make all aspects of life, business and governance much more complex than in any previous time in history.2. Tech growth became mainstream. The fact that technology grows exponentially has become widely accepted. In the Age of Disruption, it is not a mere strategy/operations decision area, but the dominant factor shaping the trajectories of companies and even nations. It has to be at the core of strategies in business and national policy. Nevertheless, saying is much easier than doing and most countries lack institutions and capabilities to positively leverage technology potential ‚Äî they may remain at the margin.3. Reality and truth died. The notion that reality actually exists was always debatable from a philosophical point of view ‚Äî but that is a different story. Now, complexity and technology make it extremely hard for people to make sense of what is real or not ‚Äî because of the variety and intricate relationships among issues, social media manipulation and deepfake. Narratives matter more than facts and shape society and the economy; they are powerful. Get ready for the next elections and the times ahead.4. The global economy has new commanding heights. Dominance in critical technologies may give the ability to command the global economy. As I wrote in A New Manufacturing Era, countries are pursuing strategies to (1) accelerate the adoption of new technologies and business models and (2) to build an edge in key technology domains. There is a profound distance between those that understand that difference and those that don‚Äôt. Science is the basis for the second case, a premium league game where the fiercest competition lies. What game is your country playing?5. The human-machine marriage (or merge) comes with challenges. It is already happening, we are merging (maybe sooner than we think), we have always been ‚Äî we live with and in technology. While it has allowed us to live better and better, new challenges arise with today‚Äôs speed of change ‚Äî the most visible is related to work: many jobs may disappear in the short term and transitioning people to new occupations will be tough. The lifespan of companies in shrinking and businesses may struggle to transform and we are just learning about the impacts of online life in youth. People, businesses and societies have a lot to learn. Can that be accelerated too? Are we ready?6. We will see balancing feedbacks in action. For every action, there is a reaction, said Isaac Newton. Society and the economy are complex systems and feedback loops will act to control some of the effects of technology growth ‚Äî like the loss (end?) of privacy. Expect to see advocacy groups gain strength and activism to build in relation to privacy, jobs, the power of big tech corporations, inequality, consumer rights, voice in democracy, equal access to opportunities, policy decisions and machine autonomy. We will see a revigorated social dispute for the ideas that shape the order of things.7. A renaissance of humanities may come. As decisions, including life and death ones, will be increasingly made by algorithms (yes, they will), ethics will assume renewed relevance. We may also feel the need to be more connected, to connect with our humanity and assure ourselves as creators, a phenomenon that would boost interest in arts and humanities and build demand in business for people with well-trained creativity skills. But stay alert: competition will come.8. Human systems constrain prosperity. In the past, companies and institutions had time to adjust to technology change, they don‚Äôt anymore. Old business, policy and thinking frameworks are being challenged and transformation became a major topic across sectors. However, corporate immune systems resist to change and, in government, some statistics say that more than 80% of transformation initiatives fail ‚Äî my experience suggests it is much higher than that. Transformation at all levels is about institutions, the rules of the game, believes, power, mindsets. At the end, it is all about people.9. There is a non-evident space for new businesses. It is hard to understand faraway and/or emergent realities, but many opportunities lie at the edge of business as usual. As some predictions above point out, there opportunities in the Islamic world, the digital platforms space ‚Äî new players want to be alternatives to Amazon‚Äôs business dominance and startups are creating solutions to enable merchants to compete ‚Äî and to respond to fast-developing pressing global situations. Look beyond, think differently.10. Consumption, production and influence are blurring. Consumers are increasingly engaging with companies throughout product lifecycles. Influencers are changing commerce in the digital economy and we are likely to see ourselves directly engaging with them or their avatar and becoming ourselves nano or micro influencers; taking part in the design of personal consumer products may become an part of consumer experience. Community engagement capabilities will be key for everybody.11. Climate change changes everything. Greta Thunberg is mad and we should all be ‚Äî climate change may render the planet uninhabitable and, ceteris paribus, we are denying future generations the right to experience nature. The good news is that youth is increasingly vocal and young consumers are driving change in global brands ‚Äî it is coming from the bottom-up. To address the biggest challenge we ever faced as a species, we will need innovation. It is easier for new businesses to be green or carbon neutral than for corporations ‚Äî as seen before, transformation is tough, as companies have huge footprints, sunk costs and immune systems, but needed and doable (even going carbon negative is at reach ‚Äî Microsoft will a great case to follow). Climate crisis will reshape finance and everything else ‚Äî imagine the opportunities for new products, processes, energy sources, business models, supply chain configurations, infrastructures and more. Hopefully, climate change will turn to be the greatest opportunity of all time. We will need to re-imagine a lot of things ‚Äî more to come on this, stay tuned.WRITTEN BY"
127,Building Production-Ready Machine Learning Models,https://towardsdatascience.com/building-production-ready-machine-learning-models-adc68754bcf4?source=extreme_main_feed---------130-58--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"by Monte Zweben & Ben EpsteinWith the quality of machine learning packages being developed today, testing and creating models couldn‚Äôt be easier. Data scientists can simply import their favorite library and have immediate access to dozens of cutting edge algorithms. But creating machine learning models that are production ready requires more than just effective algorithms. It takes experimentation, data exploration and solid organization.Data scientists need an environment to freely explore the data and plot different trends and correlations without being handicapped by the size of their dataset. With Splice Machine‚Äôs MLManager 2.0 platform, it couldn‚Äôt be easier to build, test, experiment and deploy machine learning models seamlessly into production.Here is a summary of data science functionality that is available in the latest release of ML Manager.As part of ML Manager 2.0, we have built Jupyter notebooks directly into Splice Machine platform with BeakerX support. Jupyter Notebooks are the most popular tool for data scientists to work and share data along with code. They are easy to work with and allow the workflow to be modularized by separating parts of the data science process into different cells.In ML Manager 2.0, we went beyond providing access to the generic Jupyter Notebooks. With ML Manager 2.0, data scientists have custom notebooks with added functionality from BeakerX. We‚Äôve worked with the open source BeakerX project and custom built it for Splice Machine. One of the most important features of this customization is polyglot programming. This programming paradigm allows data scientists to write code in a number of different languages all within the same notebook. Each cell can be defined using a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù that tells Jupyter how to interpret the code.Data scientists have the flexibility to define the language for an entire cell using %% or just a single line using %. This allows you to write SQL code in the same notebook as your Python, Scala, Java or R code.On top of separated polyglot programming, we also allow for cross kernel variable sharing. What this means is you can define a variable in one language, and share it with another language using the underlying BeakerX variable. This gives data scientists unprecedented access to their SQL data. For example:There are a number of other great features from BeakerX that are built directly into Splice Machine.Jupyter notebooks also come with great built-in visualization tools such as matplotlib and plotly for 2D and 3D plots:Data scientists also have access to interactive Pandas tables where you can both filter and sort results as well as add visualizations directly into the tables:A serious problem in data science in overfitting. Overfitting can result from a number of different factors. These include creating models that are too finely tuned to training data, making biased splits in your dataset, and even picking the wrong algorithm for the problem. All of these issues can be overcome however.Another problem that has been challenging data science teams is the issue of data size. The hardest form of bias to overcome is that of a skewed dataset. Many data science teams run into issues building their model on a subset of data and then training it on the entire dataset. This has the potential to introduce massive bias into the models.It is therefore crucial to train the model on the entirety of the available data, and with Splice Machine this is no longer an issue. Because our Jupyter Notebooks are deployed co-resident with our database, data scientists have direct access to the scale-out capabilities to access the entirety of their datasets instantly. More importantly, data engineers and data scientists use a different programming pattern than application developers. They manipulate Spark and Pandas DataFrames. Now Splice offers this pattern as well with a full CRUD API. Using our Native Spark Data Source, you can query your entire table, no matter the size, and immediately work with it as a Spark Dataframe. In milliseconds and with one single api call, you can move all of the data from a table into a Spark Dataframe and display it to the screen. Even more powerful is the ability to insert or even upsert a DataFrame into Splice with full ACID transactionality. This level of data access and manipulation makes model building and data exploration easier than ever before.Imagine being able to update real-time feature stores transactionally for multiple models to use in real-time. For example, these feature stores can have tens of thousands of columns tracking customer behavioral patterns that could be instantly turned into a feature vector in a dataframe for a model pipeline to test. Imagine being able to update this feature store in real-time. Models then test features in the moment. What was the transaction that occurred seconds before a call center call? What was the last line item added to an order before an abandonment? What was the last click on a website? With a real-time feature store and a Native Spark DataSource, ML becomes more valuable.Modeling on the Splice Machine platform is just as easy. With Spark, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, H2O, and PyTorch, you can work in your favorite library. For Scikit-learn, we can utilize skdist to train many scikit-learn models simultaneously on Spark (think cross validation models). Future work will include TensorflowOnSpark.All of these great features bring with them lots of complexity. Now that you have total access to your data and modeling efforts, how do you build a team around this? How do you organize your work? How do you maintain governance? How do you deploy your models? These questions and many others have brought the term MLOps into view. MLOps is the process of operationalizing the data science workflow for production ready teams. Data Science is different from other engineering efforts in that it‚Äôs an experimental process, and requires a different approach to its structure and organization.If you‚Äôve ever seen a spreadsheet like this, you know the horror of its creation. This is a typical data science run book spreadsheet. Different experiments, runs, parameters, datasets, metrics, and everything else that may be necessary for a data science experiment all stored in a single excel spreadsheet.This is unusable for any serious data science team. It takes a long time to create, it requires redesigns for every new project and it‚Äôs prone to user error as different versions are flying around people‚Äôs inboxes as attachments. The data scientist in you may be looking at this sheet and asking ‚Äúwhat if I want to tune another parameter, or try a Random Forest, how would that fit into this spreadsheet?‚Äù You are correct in your fears, and the answer to those questions are ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt‚Äù and ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù This is where MLManager comes inSplice Machine‚Äôs MLManager took the popular open source project, MLFlow, and added functionality that we think ‚Äúcompletes the ML Lifecycle.‚Äù With MLFlow, you can easily and dynamically track everything and anything that pertains to your model attempts: Parameters, metrics, training time, run names, model types, artifacts like images (think AUC charts), even serialized models. With Splice Machine‚Äôs MLManager, all of those metrics, parameters, and artifacts are stored directly into the database with no need for any external storage mechanism.You can easily build a multitude of models, track everything you need, and compare them numerically or visually in the MLFlow UI. For example, above we can see the metrics of a number of different runs created within an experiment, and below we dig into three of those runs and see how the number of trees in our Random Forest relates to our F1:Data scientists can even post the notebooks that they have used to build their models to the Github gists in order to share code, notes, and snippets for peer review and transparency. Given an MLFlow run_id, you can trace a model back to its origins. For a production ready data science team, this is crucial to maintaining control over which models get deployed and when.Our straightforward API makes this incredibly easy and reusable, where just a few function calls can give you full traceability, no matter what modeling process you are taking. Three key functions we offer are:Once models are compared and tested and your team is ready for deployment, the next major hurdle is introduced. Model deployment is a largely discussed topic in the data science world because it is complicated, non generalizable, and difficult to oversee. Popular deployment mechanisms like AzureML and Sagemaker are difficult to build into your pipeline and are hard to maintain governance.Who deployed the model? Who is allowed to call the model? Who has made calls to the model in the last 24 hours? How is the model performing? How do you integrate new models into an application? What if we don‚Äôt want to deploy to the cloud for security concerns?These questions are important ones, and ones without straightforward answers. With Splice Machine‚Äôs MLManager, we remove the complexity with the use of in DB model deployment. Our platform allows you to deploy models directly into the database, so every time a new row is inserted into a table, your model is automatically and immediately run, prediction stored, and tracked back to the model in use. On top of all of that, it‚Äôs blazing fast, both to deploy and to utilize. Deployment takes less than 10 seconds (compared to the near 30 minutes for Sagemaker/Azure ML deployment). And all model triggers are fully ACID compliant.In DB Model deployment, security and governance is also easy for your DBA‚Äôs to learn, because your model predictions are just in a table like any other table in the database. Want to revoke access to the model? Revoke access to the table. Want to gather statistics on the model? Just a few SQL queries. Want to substitute one model for another in an application? Change the table name in the query. There is no learning curve because there is no new technology in use. Plus since this is just persistent data you can architect microservices around the model as wellHow is this done? Our MLManager determines the type and structure of your model‚Äôs pipeline, and creates tables and triggers specific to your dataset and model, and deploys them to the table of your choosing. The Trigger is generated on the fly and runs immediately when new records are inserted in the chosen table. The Trigger calls a generated Stored Procedure that deserializes the model and applies it to the new records, and writes the predictions to a prediction table. Data scientists and data engineers don‚Äôt have to learn RDBMS triggers and stored procedures because they are generated automatically. For example, here is the generated trigger and function for a model deployment:If however, your team still wants to deploy to Sagemaker or AzureML, MLManager supports that too, both with a Deployment UI and API calls.AI is becoming ever more prudent in business success today. Without it, your company will be left behind by more agile and market ready competitors. Injecting AI has been the biggest roadblock to success because of serious risks and implications of poor model development environments and time-to-deploy. You cannot risk putting a bad model into production that is making mission critical decisions. With Splice Machine, however, governance is fully integrated, experimentation easier than ever, and behind the scenes plumbing a thing of the past.For example, consider an insurance company. How does Splice Machine ML Manager helps you comply when a regulator starts questioning the model you use in underwriting? You time-travel back to a ‚Äúvirtual snapshot‚Äù of the database that existed when you trained the model and you show the features that went into the model and the statistical distributions of the data on those features AT THAT TIME. Splice enables the data scientist to log the Snapshot Isolation timestamp of our MVCC transaction engine as meta-data in MLFlow at the time of training. With time-travel, you can prove your compliance in minutes.Build models you can trust with our pin-point governance architecture and access to full, unbiased data, deploy models with ease and in seconds, and utilize them in your mission critical applications without latency and with the same ACID compliance of all of your other tables. Integrate your models seamlessly without needing to learn any new architectures or platforms, your model is just a (superpowered) table. Monitor your model the same techniques you monitor any other table, and when a new model is ready to replace it, redeploy in no time. Stop re-creating the wheel for every application you want to modernize.For a hands-on look at Splice Machine and ML Manager 2.0, watch a demo video that highlights its powerful functionality and how it enables you to build production-ready ML models.WRITTEN BY"
128,How can Europe win the global startup war?,https://medium.com/swlh/how-can-europe-win-the-global-startup-war-3999fe2567aa?source=extreme_main_feed---------131-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"Originally published at https://rossysheil.com on February 1, 2020.Since the ‚Äô60s Silicon Valley has acted as the epicentre of innovation for startups across the globe home to the world‚Äôs largest technology companies and an established asset class of venture capital which has served as it‚Äôs driving force. As an ecosystem, it has had the equivalent of a multi-decade monopoly and head start on other geographies which continues to compound sitting on top of the global startup ranks decades later.I often think of Y Combinator as a symbol of the success the US has experienced with startups and a yet to be replicated jewel of any other ecosystem taking global talent from across the world and producing 100 companies valued at over 150 million USD and 19 companies valued at over 1 billion USD.These are the top @ycombinator companies of all time, based on valuation #startups #venturecapital

Puente (@jepuente_telco) October 3, 2019If Y Combinator is to Silicon Valley what Silicon Valley is to the rest of the world, nowhere else has this feat been emulated so consistently in a single entity but the tides are changing and this super hub model is evolving to a globally distributed one with different blueprints being adopted around the globe from the government-driven Chinese approach to the corporate-driven one made dominant by the USA.It is clear that both approaches are working with China and the USA now home to 80% of the world‚Äôs 206 Unicorns and 75% market share of all venture capital invested. However, what is most impressive is the timeframe in which China has been able to achieve this only eclipsing Europe as a destination for venture capital a mere 6 years ago. Up until 2014, both regions had similar patterns of investment and growth but that has shifted by orders of magnitude recently with China investing 294 billion USD and Europe only 105 billion USD over the same timeframe.Comparison is the thief of joy and the answer to Europe‚Äôs challenge is not as simple as increasing the amount of venture capital available nor Europe becoming a China or USA clone but it begs the question just what is the approach of Europe; how do we plan to compete globally and when will we hit escape velocity?Europe presents a huge opportunity with the largest economy in the world with a GDP per head of 25,000 EUR for its 500 million consumers. Moreover, its countries are of the most sophisticated in the world with internet commerce as a % of GDP the highest globally in markets like the UK at 13%. This scale translates to sizable trade relationships serving as the world‚Äôs largest trader of manufactured goods and services and a top trading partner to 80 countries vs the USA mere 20 countries. Europe also dominates the global innovation index with 8/10 countries (incl Israel) placing in the top 10.So, looking at Europe with all of its potential, it seems illogical that it receives just 20% of venture capital compared to our friends across the Atlantic but it isn‚Äôt as binary as venture capital received. The challenge is more of a structural problem in converting the scale and potential of Europe to a homogenous border-free market for technology companies to create increasing returns to scale in a single favorable regulatory market for startups. I‚Äôll reflect on some broken windows that need fixing in Europe later but first want to touch on how the pendulum is beginning to swing in Europe‚Äôs favor.There is more capital available in Europe than ever before for entrepreneurs. Analyzing 2019 data European growth in institutional venture capital continues to grow at 41% YoY vs decreases in Asia and USA of 2% and 47% respectively. Europe is also creating super scalers on the path to Unicorn status with 50+ 100M rounds and 6 rounds of 500M+.5 years ago these milestones were unattainable for Europe but the funding gap is now rapidly closing to the point it is a function of global ranking vs entrepreneur availability with abundant smart institutional capital available. Moreover, the experience of that capital is compounding with funds now on their 7th or 8th + fund building out dedicated operator-driven teams to support entrepreneurs as they move through the venture lifecycle.Analyzing data from Dealroom it estimates there are 3,000 VC funds in Europe and these funds are able to compete at every stage from Seed ‚Äî Series D with Atomico counting 2,604 unique investors participating in a venture round in 2019.It‚Äôs the worst kept secret in London that US firms are scoping out expansion to Europe and going by their increased investment activity the gauntlet has been thrown down by US investors. Europe has yet to see Investors compete aggressively at an early stage with all seed and Series A investments comfortably owned by European investors. However, looking at later stage funding we can see that 90% of all deals > 100M USD involved an American or Chinese investor.Amazed people aren‚Äôt talking about this more.Valley VCs are coming to Europe en masse.Why:üíµ Better pricingüíª High quality engineers: fraction of SF cost.üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶ Competition: divided by 4.üåç Europe doesn‚Äôt want to sell for $100m anymore, we have global ambitions.- Harry Stebbings (@HarryStebbings) September 26, 2019VCs are catching on that Europe presents a tangible opportunity on multiple levels around geographic portfolio diversification, culturally lower valuations and increased ROI. Looking at 2019 large investments from Kleiner Perkins in Evervault, Y Combinator in Monzo, Softbank in OakNorth its clear that US VCs are winning cap tables at every stage from A ‚Äî D and indicating a willingness to invest in the early-stage European ecosystem where overall 20% of funding rounds included a US investor.From the vantage point of startup founders it‚Äôs also a compelling proposition where US VCs possess a clear advantage on go-to-market best practices and networks for US expansion and the ultimate pinnacle of all for founders; how to IPO successfully. For regional ecosystems, the long-term consequences of this are not clear.The problem is that when increased ownership shifts overseas so too does the propensity for future geographic investment and the second-order effects expected from achieving exit velocity locally both at VC and startup level. This will be a watch-point and increasing point of contention for European VCs over the next decade.Historically Europe has suffered from stigma on selling out early for pre-mature exits due to M&A from large US tech companies, specific examples of companies like Deep Mind, Bloomsbury AI or Magic Pony Technologies being acquired by Google, Facebook and Twitter. However, this phenomenon is decelerating with many founders now going the distance in later stage rounds on what is typically the main signal for IPO which is exactly the medicine Europe needs.This persistence is beginning to yield dividends for the European ecosystem creating exit value of $107 billion in 2018 almost exceeding US exit-value. Most importantly these exits are triggering second-order effects and compounding with second-time entrepreneurs tackling big categories with ex-Monzo, ex-Skyscanner, ex-Deliveroo, ex-Draft Kings, ex-Revolut, ex-King teams and more launching startups in the last year.Huge potential for second-order effects. IPO will free people to start their own company or invest. It will also provide a playbook for starting cos in Europe (dev in a cheaper city > move to US when there is deep PMF). On top of the inspiration to the next gen of founders.- Victor (@Victor_Patru) September 11, 2019Successful liquidity events for Europes leading scale-ups like Improbable, Deliveroo, Monzo, Revolut, N26. Graphcore, LetGo, Dark Trace and more will be crucial in creating rejuvenation.Europe is starting to deliver on its promise of becoming a Unicorn machine and will very shortly hit 100 unicorns with key competencies in fintech and enterprise SaaS and deep tech maturing as a business model in the background. The salient point is that these companies are distributed across Europe with over 20 unique countries creating a Unicorn including emerging ecosystems like Romania, Poland, Austria and the Czech Republic. Most importantly these companies are not being acquired, the vast majority of Unicorns created during the 2010s are still private and going the distance.The old story of Europe was a small group of dominant cities with a monopoly on the digital transformation of Europe; namely London, Stockholm, Berlin, and Paris. That picture has transformed since 2016 to create self-sustaining, vibrant ecosystems across all of Europe not dependent on super-cities and countless ecosystems emerging across Europe.France is now almost at parity with the UK for early-stage investment with upcoming hubs including Cluj-Napoca, Tallinn, Barcelona, Dublin, Lisbon, Minsk. Equally these communities are the most active startup communities globally with over 170 cities in Europe hosting 100+ tech-related meetups and London leading all other cities in Europe with meet-up activity at 2x Berlin.What I am most interested in is the future growth of emerging hubs in Europe which are largely under-invested in. This is where all of the growth is coming from at community and talent level, similar to the rise of the top 4 of London, Paris, Stockholm, and Berlin in the early 2010s. The top growing countries at community level are all CEE based the majority of which sit outside the top 20 geographies in Europe for investment in 2019 so are clear growth markets.It‚Äôs crazy how CEE founders (esp. Romania, Ukraine & Poland) unbundle their companies geographically.- Hire in their home country
- Incorporate in Delaware
- Fundraise in the US
- Sell to the whole world
- Pretend they live in SF/NYCe.g. @Grammarly, @UIPath, @brainly, etc.- Hugo Amsellem (@HugoAmsellem) October 24, 2019It‚Äôs also possible to spot the same trends looking at the intersection of developer talent and capital invested in these countries. The UK is by orders of magnitude very mature, future development in the UK will be slow incremental growth but Germany, France, Russia and CEE present all the markers of outsized growth potential as these talent hubs start to receive more capital.On the whole, Europe has more developers than the USA, it is unrivaled in talent density with 6.1M developers as compared to 4.1M in the USA which has been flat for the last two years. Moreover, there are more developers in London than there are in NYC whilst the top computer science schools of the world are in Europe with 4/10 listing in the global ranks every year.London still reigns supreme as a stomping ground for high-potential VC-backed startups (producing more than any other city) with the need to incubate developer talent centrally but is increasingly being challenged by new cities like Berlin and Paris attracting remote startups and lean teams who do not need or desire the London blueprint for growth.Lack of innovation in governmental frameworks is a significant barrier to a homogenous market in Europe. There are early symptoms of the environment changing in this regard with the introduction of a ‚Ç¨100 billion EU Commission future fund to back sectors across the EU where the region is a laggard globally. The European Commission and the European Investment Fund also announced a ‚Ç¨1.6 billion VC fund-of-funds program to increase fund sizes and lure in larger institutional investors to the European market.Startup-friendly environments exist in different guises across Europe from the SEIS-EIS tax breaks for investors to back entrepreneurs in the UK to Macron‚Äôs ‚Ç¨5 billion startup fund and an advanced regulatory environment for startups in Estonia but the structural problem of Europe still exists. Much is to be done in delivering on the promise of the single-market and enabling true cross-border relationships. The biggest lever at the disposal of the European Union is in finding a way to reduce ( or eliminate) the friction borders create as this still presents multiple regulatory hurdles for startups launching in new EU countries, multiple incorporations, and multiple go-to-market approaches.It is clear Europe presents so much potential and is starting to deliver on its promise but there are challenges and broken windows to fix which are holding Europe back and enabling other regions to accelerate and compound; namely funding, policy and fragmentation.Venture capital has accelerated dramatically in Europe over the last decade but it is still lagging behind compared to the USA and Asia. A key driver of this is the low-risk appetite large European institutions such as pension funds have for VC as an asset class despite strong returns at EU level.European Venture Capital is a deep and profitable Asset Class with 50 funds returning more than 20% Net IRR and 3rd quartile funds of recent vintages being in positive territory #UglyDuck19 @EIF_EU pic.twitter.com/Fx9tPRxMtN- Nicolas Perard üá™üá∫ (@NicolasPerard) September 25, 2019This differs from markets like the US where pension funds apportion patient capital to venture as an asset class and are comfortable with the risk and long-term returns it will provide over a 10-year lifecycle. Diversity in LP base is required to solve this as the bulk of LP funding in Europe still comes from governments, fund of funds, corporate investors, family offices and banks. Where there is less patient capital it also impacts valuations with more capital being available in the USA it drives the value of startups 3x greater than Europe.The technology industry is growing 5x faster than the rest of the economy but still, in over 20 + years into the existence of the EU, there is no clear Industrial policy for startups or the digital sector. The single market only benefits goods manufacturers and the financial sector whilst the technology sector languishes country to country in Europe with challenging legal and regulatory frameworks.Tribalism still exists in Europe and the reality is many of the powerful initiatives I‚Äôve outlined exist at country level only to ensure entrepreneurs stay in-country which limits the EU‚Äôs ability to generate network effects and a coefficient of their investment in startups. European incorporation is non-existent, speedy access to financial infrastructure is elusive, Europe‚Äôs density of talent remains unleveraged and tax for startups is a political football.Imagine a Europe where startup hubs in Europe are integrated through physical and digital infrastructure, talent, real cross-border commerce and a favorable regulatory environment designed for startups. This is the ultimate nirvana for Europe and the most impactful area where policy-makers can invest time. Glimpses of this are beginning to manifest across Europe in the private sphere with the ambitious project to link Estonia and Finland creating a super startup hub (albeit funded by a private Chinese investor) but this innovation is limited by the lack of a clear industrial charter from Brussels. More of this innovation is needed to think of Europe as an interconnected clusters of cities to ensure all hubs benefit from increasing returns to scale.In every booming startup ecosystem, there is usually a messy middle before generating escape velocity and I believe we are at the tail-end of this in Europe. Europe has had successful startup exits but examining the growing collection of European unicorns about to hit 100 in total Europe has not been through a real multi-year cycle of fund returning exits yet. As venture capital invested continues to grow and companies stay private longer the lack of liquidity for shareholders becomes problematic.Venture capital is an asset class and whilst the goal is to enable great founders to build it is also to generate ROI. Investors need to realize gains, employees have bet their careers on a future outsized reward and the ecosystem needs the benefits of the first order and second-order effects an exit creates. China is the perfect storm for second-order effects post-exit as Chinese unicorns (BAT) start to expand horizontally, pay it forward and are now invested in 30% of Chinese startups.Europe also has some cracks at Series B +, more and more US and Chinese investors are winning Series B deals and dominating later stage rounds at 100M+. This creates challenges for the average Series B company seeking to take their business to the next level when the US or Chinese don‚Äôt want them. This so-called Series B gap needs increased attention from VCs and the government to ensure there is a local path to resolution for founders.Europe of course has later stage funds but the reality is that it is not as accessible as the early-stage market. Meanwhile, VCs like Balderton alleviate some of the pain with their liquidity fund on the secondaries market which is offering a path to liquidity for some shareholders. In the medium-term, this issue will disappear as Europe benefits from the end of this cycle and starts anew but in the interim, there is a delicate challenge to be solved in opening up more Series B funding to entrepreneurs.In the short, to medium-term Brexit presents a new challenge for entrepreneurs building businesses in Europe, primarily due to the ambiguity surrounding the consequences as right now everything is conceptual. The UK will gradually untangle itself from EU policies and present a new regulatory framework for European businesses seeking to access the UK market. Moreover, the extent to which the UK can continue to exist as a benefactor of the Digital Single Market remains uncertain.For tech-forward businesses the UK will become a ‚Äòthird country ‚Äò under Europe‚Äôs data protection policy forcing startups to create contract-based legal structures as opposed to the free flow of data, it benefited from in the EU. This will impact how entrepreneurs build and use products particularly in data-intensive industries where the UK is gaining dominance like deep-tech.Whilst London contains the most software engineers of any city in Europe it is unknown how Brexit will impact this in practice when freedom of movement ceases. It will be more difficult for software engineers to access new visas and for high growth startups to draw on the EU talent pool, thus creating questions on whether London will attract new US companies setting up their European HQ which may now defer to Dublin or Berlin. Brexit also ensures UK startups lose the ‚Äò country of origin ‚Äò principle which allows UK startups to base European compliance on UK law forcing entrepreneurs to now become compliant with the laws of each European country they operate in.Notwithstanding all of this is conceptual at this point and needs to be negotiated between the UK and Europe. Long-term it is difficult to not be bullish on the UK as the leading tech economy in Europe. The economies of scale on talent and capital are vast.The majority of funds at early stage and late-stage are domiciled in the UK serving European markets. Boris Johnson is proposing to remove the cap on tech visas leaving it in theory unlimited to talented software engineers and the government is offering up billions of patient capital for the tech sector. Much depends on how well the UK and EU handle the separation and the perception of the pound in global markets over the medium ‚Äî long term but it is hard to see London lose its startup crown. This sentiment is also reinforced in Atomico‚Äôs State of European Tech Report with the majority of founders viewing London as the best place for launch a startup in Europe even with Brexit in play.Stock options are central to attracting to talent to high-risk startup industries where much of the reward is placed on the future value of the company. Startups can usually not compete on the same salary incumbents offer and need to offer up ownership of the company to incoming employees and is a proven model in the UK.The regulatory environment of Germany, Spain, Belgium, and other European countries is not favorable for domestic high-growth or foreign high-growth companies where the tax burden means offering up excessive comp plans so it reaches table-stakes for employees but many companies struggle with this.‚ÄúThe financial winners of the German tech boom are mostly foreign investors. The employees only get the crumbs of the pie.‚Äù @JohannesReck of @GetYourGuide does not mince his words on why stock option laws are failing German companies: https://t.co/f00bqHdgH5- (((Maija Palmer))) (@maijapalmer) May 28, 2019Europe needs to bring its incentives at European-level to parity with what is taking place in competing global hubs in order to ensure this does not become a self-fulfilling prophecy of Europe‚Äôs inability to compete.The US has been successful in building a culture of entrepreneurship around its universities with many of its Unicorns coming from Ivy League colleges. More recently China has also implemented the same approach aligning accelerators with key universities in Beijing. Innoway the government-backed startup village has incubated 3k startups raising greater than 1.3 billion USD in partnership with the top universities in Beijing. Europe lags behind in this regard; there is some progress and many European students have gone on to build successful startups particularly out of Oxford, Cambridge, and Berlin but the extent to which it is structurally enabled is minimal. More incentives and safety nets are required to ensure domain experts and computer science graduates can launch startups into a buoyant and well-funded European market.Go-to-market is a double-edged sword in Europe as due to the fragmentation European companies quickly become experts at operationally launching in new territories but sometimes lack the sales and marketing polish of our peers across the Atlantic. This is an issue which consistently arises in many conversations I have with VCs and founders; the pay it forward mentality is growing stronger in Europe ( but still weaker than Silicon Valley) so inexperienced founders are in a position where they can benefit from mature founders who have expanded globally but there is still a hangover in many ways around the cultural approach Europeans have to sales and marketing relying more heavily on product innovation than complimenting with a sales and marketing strategy. The build it and they will come mentality must evolve for European entrepreneurs to succeed.Ultimately I am very bullish on the European ecosystem. Let‚Äôs acknowledge that Europe is already delivering sector-leading businesses. It possesses all of the necessary ingredients and momentum to deliver world-beating startups and thriving diversity but the reality is a fragmented Europe is a weakened one when competing with large global regions.The technology sector needs an open and favorable regulatory market that every country can drive, champion and benefit from in Europe. The funding challenges are real but acknowledging the speed at which this gap has been closing is promising. Lastly, Europe needs some exit fuel to push past this messy middle and enter the next cycle of high growth startups. Over the next decade, I believe the gap between Europe and its peers should begin to close somewhat but a real step-change improvement in delivering a single industrial policy for the startup and scaleup sector is required for Europe to hit this escape velocity.If you‚Äôre interested in chatting further reach out to me on Twitter I‚Äôd love to discuss.Originally published at https://rossysheil.com on February 1, 2020.WRITTEN BY"

So let‚Äôs start at the top with‚Ä¶Oh, if you decide you‚Äôd rather be a faceless icon and not share your camera, just know it‚Äôs much easier to ignore a pulsing still image and click away to my email than look someone in the eye when they start speaking.... yes, we can hear you typing emails‚Ä¶It doesn‚Äôt matter how good you look if you sound bad.Wear a headset with a microphone. The earbud & microphone headset that came with your mobile phone is fine.Turn off all other sounds in your house: no radio, no TV, no barking dogs or playing children. If you‚Äôre out and about, find someplace quiet to pull up with your phone.Mute the video conference app when you‚Äôre not speaking. In the app, find the microphone icon in the program and click it until there‚Äôs a line through it. Don‚Äôt turn down the sound on your phone/computer as that won‚Äôt help. In Zoom, turn the mic off/on by hitting the Shift+command+A keys (on MAC).There‚Äôs a maxim in film-making that says people will watch a film with great sound and poor visuals but they will NOT watch a film with GREAT VISUALS & BAD SOUND.‚Ä¶or my eyes are up here‚Ä¶Put the device (laptop, phone, tablet, aka the camera) at eye level.Set your laptop or phone up on some books or boxes so the camera is level with your eyes.I‚Äôm pretty sure your neck is not the best part of your face, so avoid the view your cat sees when she‚Äôs looking up from the floor, demanding dinner.Trust me, your chin and neck will thank you.I will thank you too.‚Ä¶hopefully I can see a bit more of you tho‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Tilt your screen(which is your camera) to adjust your composition.Try to get your eyes in the top third of the frame. Then tilt down a bit so you don‚Äôt cut off the top of your head.Your camera is the blinking light at the top of your screen, so try to look at it straight on and make a connection.A Trick (above): I resize the video conference window to make it smaller and put it at the top of the screen. That way it seems like I‚Äôm looking (almost) directly into the camera and people feel engaged....I‚Äôll start from the back‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Make sure there are no bright lights BEHIND you or anywhere in the background (unless you‚Äôre in the witness protection program).There should be more (soft) light on you than on the background. Try to have some soft light shining on your face (we call this a key light in and it‚Äôs designed to make you look good).Since I‚Äôm spending a LOT of time in these online conversations, I bought a 100-watt daylight LED bulb (color temperature 5500K ‚Äî it‚Äôs written on the box) so the color of the bulb will be the same color as my window light.I have the lamp bouncing the light off the wall behind my computer because bouncing it off the wall makes the light softer than aiming it directly at my face. You can also drape some thin white material over a light to diffuse it‚Ä¶just make sure it doesn‚Äôt touch the bulb and catch on fire (LED lights don‚Äôt get hot so they‚Äôre safer).‚Ä¶I‚Äôve known you for so long and only now I am seeing your space‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Check the background. For a film interview, I‚Äôm always trying to place my subject as far away from the background as possible to give a sense of depth. Some people like being against a plain wall. If you like the plain wall, try to be far enough away so distracting shadows don‚Äôt fall directly behind you.Just be aware that people are going to obsess on what‚Äôs in the background so be careful what ‚Äôs back there. Avoid trees sprouting out of your head.Hard to tell the difference, right?Happy video conferencing and stay safe. And please feel free to share your thoughts and tips.Bob Sacha is a film-maker.

130,Comparing different ways to make HTTP requests in Javascript,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/comparing-different-ways-to-make-http-requests-in-javascript-39ab0f090788?source=extreme_main_feed---------133-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"Recently I had to decide what technology to use for a large javascript project to make ajax calls. If you are using JavaScript, you have different chances to make call requests.In the beginning, there had been some methods to pull data from a server without a page refresh, but they often relied on clunky techniques. Microsoft developed XMLHttpRequest for a browser alternative to their Outlook email client. XMLHttpRequest became a web standard in 2006.The Fetch API was introduced in 2015 with ES6. The generic Request and Response interfaces provide consistency while Promises permit easier chaining and async/await without callbacks. Fetch is clean, elegant, and simple to understand, but there are other good alternatives, and we will see them briefly in this article.To keep it simple, I will focus on what they are, their syntaxes, and some pros and cons of each option.The following code shows a basic HTTP GET and POST examples using different alternatives. Let‚Äôs start then.The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server. It Is the oldest method of this comparison, and although other options surpass it, it is still valid and useful for its backward compatibility and maturity.GetPostProsConsLibrary widely used until a while ago to make HTTP asynchronous requests.All of jQuery‚Äôs Ajax methods return a superset of the XMLHTTPRequest objectGetPostProsConsQwest is a simple ajax library based on promises, and that supports XmlHttpRequest2 unique data like ArrayBuffer, Blob, and FormData.GetPostProsConsSuperAgent is ajax API created for flexibility, readability, and with a low learning curve. It also works with Node.jsGetThe .query() method accepts objects, which, when used with the GET method, will form a query-string. The following will produce the path /dataserver/search?name=Manny&lastName=Peck&order=desc.PostProsConsHttp-client lets you compose HTTP clients using JavaScript‚Äôs fetch API.GetPostProsConsPromise-based HTTP library for performing HTTP requests on both Browser and Nodejs.GetPostProsConsFetch is a native browser API to make a request that replaces XMLHttpRequest. Fetch allows making network requests easier than with XMLHttpRequest. The Fetch API uses Promises avoiding XMLHttpRequest callback hell.GetPostProsConsFetch is the new standard and is supported by new versions of Chrome and Firefox without using any additional library.It is recommended to dedicate some time to look at the characteristics of Axios, SuperAgent, or the rest of the libraries as they all have proper documentation, are easy to use, and their learning curve is not too large. For some instances, they offer features that do not have Fetch.In my case, I will use Fetch because I don‚Äôt need special features, and Fetch is native in JavaScript and enough for my project.Thanks for reading. I hope this helps you two know the different ways of dealing with asynchronous code in JavaScript.WRITTEN BY"

132,Inside a Secretive $250 Million Private Transit System Just for Techies,https://onezero.medium.com/only-the-elite-have-nice-commutes-in-silicon-valley-8b2761863925?source=extreme_main_feed---------135-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"This article is part of Into the Valley, a feature series from OneZero about Silicon Valley, the people who live there, and the technology they create.2004, in the Glen Park neighborhood of San Francisco, an unmarked employee shuttle bus rolled up to the curb in front of a group of employees. The crowd was likely dressed in the uniform of tech workers: blue jeans and sneakers, with backpacks slung across their shoulders and headphone cables dangling from their ears. Onboard, the small group of tech workers would have settled down for their 80-minute journey to Google‚Äôs Mountain View headquarters, plugging cables into outlets and connecting their laptops to the in-bus Wi-Fi. The bus averaged 155 Googlers a day that year.Thus began the era of the Silicon Valley tech shuttle bus. At the time, the BlackBerry was the hot handset, YouTube would soon be launched from a Menlo Park garage, and Gwen Stefani‚Äôs ‚ÄúHollaback Girl‚Äù topped the Billboard 100. Google was the first of many tech giants to launch tech shuttles. The following year, Yahoo and Electronic Arts introduced their own shuttle bus services from San Francisco to the peninsula ‚Äî ‚Äúthe Pepsi to Google‚Äôs Coke,‚Äù jeered a reporter. Ebay introduced shuttle buses in 2007, Juniper Networks in 2008, and so on.The buses improved employee quality of life, the companies said, and that of local residents; they eased congestion and were better for the environment. By 2008, 1,600 Googlers boarded 150 buses around the Bay Area daily, with drop-off points stretching from the foggy oceanside town of Santa Cruz to the city of Concord, located toward California‚Äôs hot and dusty Central Valley. ‚ÄúWe are basically running a small municipal transit agency,‚Äù Google‚Äôs security and safety director told the New York Times in 2007.In retrospect, this was peanuts. By 2014, more than 750 buses carted some 37,000 employees into the valley and back each day. Those buses covered approximately 25 million miles of tarmac a year, at an approximate operating cost of $249,000 per bus per year to employers.Today, there are an estimated 1,020 private commuter shuttle buses in the Bay Area, according to unpublished data from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). Add that up and you have a private transportation system worth more than $250 million ‚Äî the seventh-largest transit system in the Bay Area, ahead of the ferry network, the County Connection buses, and the Marin Transit Network. Even back in 2014, almost as many people traveled by private shuttles as they did on Caltrain, the commuter train that runs from San Francisco to San Jose.A source of protest and poetry, these shuttles constitute a vast commuter network that has affected the basic infrastructure of the region. They have reshaped the modern geography of the valley, and their stopgap existence has disincentivized transportation officials from updating their own networks, say public transit activists in the area.‚ÄúWe are basically running a small municipal transit agency.‚Äù‚ÄúWe have a major lack of accountability for regional mobility in our region,‚Äù says Ian Griffiths, policy director of Seamless Bay Area, a public transit nonprofit. Organizations like Seamless want to see the region‚Äôs fragmented transit agencies integrated, with a new transit body to oversee standardized fares, handle tickets, and implement a regional bus network with dedicated highway express lanes in Silicon Valley and beyond.But the private shuttle network tailored for tech workers is sapping energy from efforts at a regional transportation revolution.acebook and Google don‚Äôt want to be in the transportation business. But it‚Äôs an onus that they‚Äôre bearing,‚Äù says Arielle Fleisher, transportation policy director at SPUR, the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association. Fleisher is standing in the lobby of SPUR‚Äôs headquarters, a 14,500-square-foot four-story building in downtown San Francisco. Designed to be ultra-sustainable, the building‚Äôs carpets, cabinetry, and countertops are made from industrial scrap, sunflower husks, and recycled newspapers, respectively.In February 2019, SPUR‚Äôs atrium featured an exhibit titled, ‚ÄúHow We Move: From Camels to Cable Cars.‚Äù Photographs of reindeer sleighs and horse-drawn carriages were classed as ‚Äúdomesticated transport‚Äù; Employer shuttles and vans were classed under ‚Äúflexible buses.‚ÄùBefore it was a tech hub, Santa Clara Valley was a rich farming community. As the valley‚Äôs commercial engine shifted from agriculture to defense to manufacturing and, finally, to tech, the area developed into a series of interlinked, sprawling suburbs tied together by freeways. Land-use clauses capped the height and densities of new developments. ‚ÄúA lot of Silicon Valley is really built for the car,‚Äù Fleisher says.The region dragged its feet when it came to regional public transit. Chicago opened its subway in 1892; New York City followed in 1904. But the Bay Area launched its subway service, BART, only in 1972. Instead, communities in the area spent much of the 20th century tearing out existing light rail to make room for cars.‚ÄúThese private shuttles, [which] basically received no public money at all, carried significantly more people than public agencies that have budgets of millions of dollars a year.‚ÄùThe tech industry, and the millions of new workers it brought with it, flooded a system that was unprepared to handle a population that grew from 5.1 million in 1980 to 7.8 million in 2018, a 52% increase in just four decades. Meanwhile, the greater area lacks even basic public transportation networks.All public transport in the Bay Area falls under the purview of the MTC, a state-funded agency that focuses on transportation planning and financing. The organization‚Äôs remit spans nine counties, from the vineyards of Napa to the suburbs of San Jose, encompassing some 7.8 million people. Twenty-seven transportation agencies operate in this area ‚Äî bus companies, ferries, and rail and light rail operators, all running without a strong unifying force. (Though the MTC provides research and guidance and distributes federal and state funds, it does not dictate spending.) The result is a snarled system of transfers, transit cards, and impossibly long commutes.I live in the northern end of San Francisco. For me, using public transport to get to Apple‚Äôs Cupertino campus for a 10 a.m. meeting is quasi-impossible. My quickest commute would start at 7:06 a.m. and consist of four buses, one train, and a 12-minute walk. That would add up to a one-way journey of two hours and 29 minutes, priced around $16.25.Based on unpublished data, we can estimate that some 52,000 tech workers shuttle to and from the tech campuses in and around Silicon Valley each day. For them, public transit just isn‚Äôt feasible.egional employer shuttles in the Bay Area date back to the 1980s, when companies such as Intel, IBM, and Hewlett Packard shuttled people from nearby rail stations to campus. In the 1990s, these same companies started modest intercounty vanpools. They were efficient and environmentally friendly and boosted employee retention. But they were nothing like the end-to-end shuttles that emerged in the mid-2000s.By 2011, more than 55 buses rolled the streets of San Francisco, collecting some 2,000 employees each day. In 2012, that figure ballooned to 473 buses across the Bay Area, carrying 6.6 million workers a year. Data from 2019 collected by the MTC estimates there are now 1,020 buses in operation.Many of the tech shuttles run on biodiesel, reports Katie Fehrenbacher at GreenBiz, and are black, blue, white, and gray, with no visible logos on the outside. They stand nearly 14 feet high and are equipped with plush reclining seats, air conditioning, power ports, onboard Wi-Fi, tinted windows, and toilets. Some serve snacks; Google and Facebook in particular are known for stocking soft drinks and Kind bars.When the shuttles first emerged, the knock-on effect of shuttle stops was startling. Prices for apartments within proximity of a shuttle stop skyrocketed. A 2011 report by the SFMTA valued local spending from 2009 near the San Francisco stops at more than $1.8 million a year. (That‚Äôs closer to $3 million now with inflation.)‚ÄúParts of San Francisco are functioning as bedroom communities for suburban corporate campuses,‚Äù noted Jason Henderson in his 2015 book, Street Fight: The Politics of Mobility in San Francisco. Shuttles were advertised as a workplace perk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to recruit nonlocal candidates when companies have shuttles,‚Äù says Silicon Valley recruiter Kinh DeMaree. ‚ÄúShuttles matter more to employees earlier in their career, when they care a lot about their social life.‚ÄùIn 2013, Alexandra Goldman, a community-based city planner in San Francisco, published a paper outlining the shuttles‚Äô effect on rent. Using data from PadMapper, she concluded that the shuttles were inextricably linked to a housing shortage.Goldman‚Äôs paper coincided with a growing public unease with the buses. Rolling through city streets, their riders cloaked behind tinted windows and bathed in filtered air, the riders seemed cartoonishly aloof. Employees were characterized as alien overlords by residents and activists railing against rising inequality.Activists blocked streets to stop buses and tried to rush onboard. Windows were smashed, tires slashed, and the nonplussed and confused employees accosted and harassed at shuttle stops. ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of Oakland,‚Äù read flyers. ‚ÄúWarning: Two-Tier System,‚Äù read one banner.The responses were reactionary, and even violent, but protestors had some valid points: In San Francisco, the shuttles stopped at municipal bus stops without permission from the city. They often blocked traffic and slowed city buses. Cities and counties began to grapple with the fundamental trade-offs of tech shuttles. San Francisco launched a voluntary pilot program to gather fees, but the results were underwhelming to say the least, with fees capped by state law.William Bacon, a transport analyst for the MTC, says the rise of the full scale of the shuttles‚Äô impact eluded planners for years.‚Äú[They] had flown under the radar for a lot of people,‚Äù Bacon says, sitting in his San Francisco office. ‚ÄúYou saw it out there, but you didn‚Äôt really know.‚ÄùIn 2014, Bacon was charged with getting a full accounting of the shuttles. Despite constituting the seventh-largest transit network in the Bay Area, shuttle usage was not factored into transportation planning, and companies were extremely secretive with ridership data.After much negotiation, Bacon was able to source high-level 2012‚Äì2014 data from many of the tech companies on a strictly anonymized basis. He was astounded. In 2014, 9.6 million people rode up and down the peninsula aboard 765 shuttles, which averaged 34,000 people a day.‚ÄúIn reality, shuttles are likely an even larger part of the transportation system,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThese private shuttles, [which] basically received no public money at all, carried significantly more people than public agencies that have budgets of millions of dollars a year.‚ÄùSitting at his desk, Bacon boots up a demand modeling program, a complex piece of software that planners use to analyze the flow of commuters.‚ÄúIf you took the buses away, people would be forced to use another mode,‚Äù he says. In all likelihood, that would mean more cars and an immediate increase in congestion. For him, the buses provide a net good, even as they‚Äôre indicative of the region‚Äôs failings.‚ÄúEmployers feel that they need to provide this private service,‚Äù Bacon says. ‚ÄúBecause the decades of transportation infrastructure that have been built in the Bay Area are not adequate.‚Äùuan Hern√°ndez says tech shuttles are ‚Äúa great perk ‚Äî just not for him.‚Äù Hernandez works a 40-plus-hour week as a contracted janitor at Facebook. As such, he doesn‚Äôt have access to the company‚Äôs shuttles.Most days, he sets his alarm for 3 a.m. and is on the road by 4:00 for a 40-minute drive from San Francisco‚Äôs Bernal Heights neighborhood to Facebook‚Äôs Menlo Park headquarters. His shift used to start later ‚Äî which was better for his family, Hern√°ndez says ‚Äî but because of traffic, his commute took twice, sometimes three times as long.At least 8% of Hern√°ndez‚Äôs income is spent on transit costs. Like 96% of full-time Silicon Valley janitors surveyed by Goldman in 2015, he would ride the shuttles if allowed, but they‚Äôre accessible only to full-time employees. (Google, Apple, and Facebook did not respond to a request for comment for this story.)Hernandez says he‚Äôs not angry at the tech companies ‚Äî they pay a good wage, he says. But he resents that the region hasn‚Äôt developed a public transit route for workers like him. He pays taxes, he says, shouldn‚Äôt his needs matter?For decades, transportation agencies in the Bay Area have failed to adapt to a growing population. Extensions to BART and Caltrain are regularly discussed and delayed, and even when initiated, regularly fall prone to problems. In 2018, six weeks after opening, San Francisco‚Äôs $2.2 billion Transbay Terminal public transit hub was forced to close due to cracked beams. Reports of flooding, overheating, and safety issues with the Muni and BART rise each year.The public transit investments that do happen are inequitably allocated. A 2012 report found that the Santa Clara Valley bus system received one half of the funding allotted to Caltrain, despite similar ridership. ‚ÄúMost of the users of bus systems earn less than $40,000, but buses receive far less subsidy than rail systems, which carry more high-income earners,‚Äù noted researchers Vu-Bang Nguyen and Evelyn Stivers.San Francisco‚Äôs bus system deals with regular cuts ‚Äî in 2010, 313,000 service hours were nixed from its schedule, causing riders to wait 10% longer for public transit. In 2008, almost $10 billion in bond proceeds was approved for a statewide high-speed rail network, to launch in 2020; today, the project is $44 billion over budget and scheduled for 2033.Then there‚Äôs the area‚Äôs housing crisis, tightly interlinked with transportation systems. ‚ÄúFor me, the problem is that land use and transportation aren‚Äôt reinforcing each other,‚Äù Fleisher says.San Francisco added an average of 1,500 units per year since January 2000, despite adding 100,000 people to the city‚Äôs population. In an ideal world, people would live close to transit hubs, and that would solve the area‚Äôs transportation problems. But most proposals to develop the land near these areas have met with huge community opposition.Cities welcome job creation but resist building housing for those workers. In the meantime, the area‚Äôs tech industry has pledged to improve the housing shortage through billion-dollar developments and spent millions on private transportation to make up for a failed public transit infrastructure.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the awkward teenage years of transit. It‚Äôs going to be uncomfortable.‚ÄùThat approach may have backfired. The existence of the tech shuttles from 2004 onward has created a nonpermanent solution that enabled public authorities to outsource some of their responsibilities to provide accessible public transit.In 2014, Google donated $6.8 million to fund free bus rides for low-income youths, a cost normally absorbed by San Francisco. Tech companies aiding city programs is a great philanthropic gesture, but it‚Äôs not a long-term institutional solution.‚ÄúThe Google buses popped up because we have this hodgepodge of transit services,‚Äù Fleisher says. ‚ÄúPublic agencies are operating in a world of constraints, and they don‚Äôt have the flexibility to be agile on their planning and processes.‚ÄùIn 2018, San Francisco‚Äôs transportation task force identified a $22 billion funding gap for city transit projects from 2019 to 2045. ‚ÄúThe city really needs to invest in transit,‚Äù says Danielle Day, a mobility programs manager for Oakland. But thanks to the shuttles, they lack the ‚Äúeconomic incentive‚Äù to do so.ctivists across the Bay Area are organizing for a holistic approach to transit. In 2017, Ian Griffiths founded Seamless Bay Area, a nonprofit with plans to unify the region‚Äôs transit. He‚Äôs calling for centralization of the region‚Äôs transit networks, a system in which riders people can use one pass for every network in the region.Other public transportation activists are calling for extensions to the BART, linking Millbrae to San Jose and connecting communities in between. They want the city to invest in express bus networks, ideally double-deckers, routed from multiple pickup points in San Francisco. Those buses would carry residents up and down the peninsula for a reasonable fee. One or more lanes of the main highways could shift to bus-only, boosting interest in this mode of transport. Highways would be widened with more off-ramps and access points for travelers. Tech companies could still run shuttles, but they‚Äôd be last-mile solutions for people dropped off in Mountain View and Menlo Park.Elsewhere in the Bay Area, change is coming, albeit slowly. The MTC has committed $9.5 million to promote vanpooling, as well as subsidizing carpool startups like WazeCarpool and Scoop. Then there‚Äôs the ReX proposal from social justice group TransForm Bay Area, which wants to build a city-funded version of the Google buses that connect people to work hubs via express lanes. The MTC is considering the proposal now.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the awkward teenage years of transit,‚Äù Dai says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be uncomfortable.‚Äù She sees the most potential in bus networks. ‚ÄúThe beauty of bus infrastructure is that it‚Äôs really flexible,‚Äù she says. People could see changes in their commute immediately, not 10 years down the line.The key thing transport activists are working toward is a unified, transparent system that offers regional bus networks and reduces emissions.To make these improvements, tech companies will have to be more forthcoming about existing shuttle routes. Some of their concerns around data sharing is tied to safety and protecting workers who previously felt assaulted and attacked. But the companies‚Äô secrecy around shuttles and stops is extreme: In 2012, Dai had to find shuttle stops by trawling Craigslist for apartment listings that highlighted their proximity to the shuttles. For a recent Protocol article, reporters had to comb the area in the wee hours of the morning to find stops.And companies aren‚Äôt withholding ridership data from just protestors and reporters. In 2018, the tech companies failed to provide the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) with requested data about shuttle routes and ridership numbers. As a result, the VTA had to sift through hidden-camera footage to ascertain shuttle use on its highways. ‚ÄúThe best we can do is spy on them in video cameras,‚Äù Adam Burger, the VTA‚Äôs transport planner, told his board.It‚Äôs estimated that Santa Clara will add an estimated 550,000 new residents and 445,000 new jobs by 2040, a 38% growth in population and a 62% increase in employment.The tech shuttles have proven to be a good short-term solution, but with an estimated 2.1 million new residents coming to the Bay Area by 2040, the region has to confront the crisis head-on.There‚Äôs a sense that maybe officials are finally coming around to that reality. In February 2020, San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu proposed a bill to unify all Bay Area transit.WRITTEN BY"
133,Are you using Python with APIs? Learn how to use a retry decorator!,https://towardsdatascience.com/are-you-using-python-with-apis-learn-how-to-use-a-retry-decorator-27b6734c3e6?source=extreme_main_feed---------136-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"People often describe Python as a ‚Äúglue-language.‚Äù The term ‚Äúglue-language‚Äù to me entails that a language helps to connect systems and makes sure that data gets from A to B in a desired structure and format.I have built countless ETL-scripts (Extraction Transformation Load) with Python. All those scripts essentially are functioning according to the same principle. They are pulling data from somewhere, transform the data, and then run a final operation. This last operation would typically mean to upload the data somewhere, but could also be a conditional deletion.An ever-increasing proportion of a typical company‚Äôs infrastructure is moving to the cloud. More companies are shifting towards a micro-service approach. These paradigm shifts away from local to cloud-based means that you probably also have faced a situation where you had to pull data from somewhere or write data somewhere that is not your local computer.On a small scale, there rarely are problems around that. If some extraction or writeback fails, you would typically notice that and would be able to remedy the mistake. But, as you move towards larger-scale operations and potentially hundreds of thousands of transactions, you don‚Äôt want to get screwed over by a temporary drop of internet-connection, too many concurrent writes, a temporarily unresponsive source system, or god knows what else.I found a very simple retry-decorator to be a saving grace in countless situations like that. Most of my projects, at one point or another, end up having the retry decorator in some util module.In Python, functions are first-class objects. A function is just like any other object. This fact, among other things, means that a function can be dynamically created, passed to a function itself, and even changed. Take a look at the following (albeit silly) example:It is good to know that we can wrap a function with another function to fulfill a particular need. We could, for example, make sure that the function reports to some logging endpoint whenever called, we could print out the arguments, we could implement type checking, preprocessing, or postprocessing to just name a few possibilities. Let‚Äôs take a look at a simple example:Both functions fail when being called with the string '2'. We could throw a type conversion function in the mix and decorate our first_func and second_func with that.This convert_to_numeric wrapper function expects a function as an argument and returns another function.Now, while previously failing, if you wrap the functions and then call them with a string number, all works as expected.So what is going on here?Well, our convert_to_numeric takes a function (A) as an argument and returns a new function (B). The new function (B), when called, calls function (A) but instead of calling it with the passed argument x it calls function (A) with float(x) and therefore solving our previous TypeError problem.To make it a little bit easier for the developer, Python provides a special Syntax. We can also do the following:The above syntax is equivalent to:This syntax makes a little clearer what exactly is happening, especially when using multiple decorators.Now that we have covered the basics, let‚Äôs move to my favorite and heavily used retry-decorator:Wrapping a wrapped function. That is some inception stuff right there. But bear with me, it is not that complicated!Let‚Äôs walk through the code step by step:Alternatively, a little bit more specific:Calling the decorated function and running into errors would then lead to something like this:Here we have nice logging, we print out the args and kwargs and function name, which should make debugging and fixing the problem a breeze (should the error persist event after all the retries are used up).There you have it. You learned how decorators work in Python and how to decorate your mission-critical functions with a simple retry decorator to make sure they will execute even in the face of some uncertainty.If you are curious about how to speed up your code, check out:WRITTEN BY"
134,(How to Build) The Organizations of the Future,https://eand.co/how-to-build-the-organizations-of-the-future-f2c6aefd33b6?source=extreme_main_feed---------137-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"Perhaps you think, as I do, that the world is in a troubled place these days. If so, then maybe you‚Äôve observed what I have.Something‚Äôs going badly wrong in our organizations. At every scale. Whether they‚Äôre countries, corporations, cities, towns, governments, parties. They seem to be rife with a peculiar set of strikingly similar problems. Inequality. Inopportunity. A lack of meaning, purpose. A deficit of truth. Unfairness. Predation. An empty place where dignity, truth, and vision should be.Why is that? It seems, to put it bluntly, as if our organizations empower and reward the worst among us ‚Äî worse yet, not for creating anything of real value, whether products, services, ideas, art, science, literature, but for allowing the most ruthless, cunning, and unscrupulous to take from the decent and humble. Take what? Pretty much anything you can think of. Consider the example of America: life expectancy is now declining for the poorest, and will do so soon enough for the middle, since healthcare is unaffordable ‚Äî life itself is being taken, and given to the richest. Income, opportunity, savings, safety, security, stability ‚Äî all these are being taken, too.So. Here‚Äôs a tiny principle for creating the future, for those who really wish to be innovators, explorers, rebels, and usurpers. The organizations that we build must be models of the world we want to create.(Think of compasses as you read this. I‚Äôll come back that metaphor. First‚Ä¶)What do I mean by that strange little phrase? Consider how the organizations we build aren‚Äôt models of the world we want to create. Facebook‚Äôs gotten rich by creating nothing of real value ‚Äî it makes us unhappy, lonely, mean, and it corrodes democracy, trust, and society. And yet it‚Äôs putative purpose is to ‚Äúconnect the world‚Äù. Ironic, no? It‚Äôs a broken compass.Most of our organizations have similarly noble, wonderful aims. Google, Uber, Tesla. Every venture capital fund in the universe. Every blue chip company, government, political party. But their net effect on well-being appears to be if not negative, then zero ‚Äî that much is obvious, because life itself is going into reverse along nearly every dimension. Why is that? Is it just because they‚Äôre not trying? Because it‚Äôs all a cynical game? I think there‚Äôs a deeper reason ‚Äî they are not modelling the world that they want to build.Our organizations often say that they want to do noble and wonderful things. Build a more prosperous, thriving, and explosively better world. One overflowing with happiness, meaning, and purpose. But take a clear-eyed look inside those very organizations. What do you see?You see overwork and stress being the biggest factor in a falling a low quality of life. You see people a total lack of meaning and purpose ‚Äî people working on utterly trivial things, like new flavours of deodorant. You see ‚Äúperformance systems‚Äù that measure how many hours are worked, or how politically successful people are ‚Äî not whether they‚Äôve contributed to creating better lives. You see ‚Äúboards‚Äù that appear not to care or even know when democracies are being hacked. But that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg.You see the same old hierarchies and the same old glass ceilings. You see CEOs earning hundreds of times what workers do. You see women and minorities and anyone different, really, systemically discriminated against. You see ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù equalling tokenism. You see noble statements of grand innovation and breakthroughs ‚Äî but hard dollars spent on lowest-common-denominator stuff. You will see a lack of investment in people, society, trust, meaning, purpose, in elevating and expanding quality of life ‚Äî and destructive activities like share buybacks, lobbying, more ad campaigns, and bigger bonuses for all that.In short, if you look at organizations today, whether big or small, corporate or entrepreneurial, you see a great contradiction. Our organizations say that they want to build a better world. But they are rife with inopportunity, unfairness, stagnation, discrimination, meanness, pettiness, cruelty, and spite. It‚Äôs no surprise, then, all that is what‚Äôs happening in economy after economy. After all, organizations are what economies are made of. But the result of economies like that is that people turn to authoritarianism, extremism, and scapegoating. Broken compasses take us in circles, don‚Äôt they?Do you see the link? Our organizations are like little ships trying to sail to a new world. But they are still being run and organized like the old one. How can they really go anywhere? Broken compasses. Circles.So. Our organizations must be models of the world that we want to build. Not just examples of the old one. What kind of world is that? You tell me. Perhaps it is a more inclusive, just, gentle world. Then the challenge for your organization is modelling all that, first ‚Äî you must reward, motivate, and inspire people to really see each other, instead of hoping that the world will be a better place, while you impel people to be unfair, hard, and cruel, with winner-take-all structures and systems, which recognize no one‚Äôs dignity, humanity, or purpose. You‚Äôre nothing but a broken compass that way.Perhaps it is a more prosperous, thriving world. Then you must be one, too. Instead of paying CEOs hundreds of millions, and workers mere thousands, you must redress the gap. You‚Äôre going to have to stop issuing mega-bonuses for useless financial engineering, and start rewarding people for really making a difference. You‚Äôre going to have to build cultures, values, and whole structures and systems for a razor-sharp higher purpose. How can the world be a more prosperous place if the very organizations that should make it one themselves aren‚Äôt?See what I mean by being a compass? Let me zoom out so it‚Äôs clearer.What does ‚Äúorganizational leadership‚Äù really mean? We think that it means ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù and ‚Äúhiring the best talent‚Äù and all the other buzzwords. It doesn‚Äôt. All that‚Äôs quite pointless now. Obsolete. Useless. Organizational leadership today means building an organization that is a model for the world it hopes to create. That models ‚Äî demonstrates, displays, shows, exemplifies, for all to see‚Äî the better world that it hopes to spark. As exactly and precisely as it can. It‚Äôs not just about your products, services, goods ‚Äî but the marrow of your very organization itself, how it works, what it does, whom it benefits, why it exists.A leader is a model. Someone that blazes a trail. Others follow. They imitate, taking the same footsteps. But the leader goes first. But our organizations are not modelling the world that they wish and hope to create. They are still reflections, vessels, systems of the old world ‚Äî the one they themselves often are frustrated by and weary of. It does no good to cry ‚ÄúI want a new world!‚Äù ‚Äî and then go on every day simply living in the old one. Such organizations have not become a compass.To be an organizational leader today means stepping forward and modelling the better world that you want to create. Building a little version of it. That can set a true north. That says: ‚ÄúHere is the new world that we want to build. Fairer, more prosperous, truer, more meaningful, full of purpose ‚Äî better in all these ways. That new world exists here already. We are a model for everyone to follow. A compass towards the future.‚ÄùThat will not be easy. It will require those who really wish to innovate to turn it all upside down. To throw out many of the old rules. Of ‚Äúboards‚Äù, of ‚Äústructures‚Äù, of ‚Äúrewards‚Äù, of ‚Äúroles‚Äù and ‚Äútitles‚Äù and ‚Äúbosses‚Äù. What good do they really do now? Is a company like Facebook that has textbook organization ‚Äî a stellar board and rock-solid structures and skyrocketing compensation ‚Äî any better run than one that doesn‚Äôt? You see my point. That is the way that we must walk if we wish to be leaders.We must build organizations that are models of the world we want to create. Or else we are not really creating the future at all ‚Äî just recreating the past. Be the change you want to see in the world, a great man once said. It has never been truer than now.

135,We‚Äôve Been Pooping Wrong All Along,https://elemental.medium.com/weve-been-pooping-wrong-all-along-7a1c5f788a62?source=extreme_main_feed---------138-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"mong the unforeseen effects of the coronavirus pandemic, bidet sales in the U.S. have skyrocketed as people face toilet paper shortages across the nation.But even prior to the pandemic, alternative toilets were entering the conversation in the name of wellness. Inspired by our ancestors and international neighbors, ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù like the Squatty Potty and bidet toilet attachments alter and supposedly optimize the way we poop.‚ÄúI think the United States is ass-backwards, always,‚Äù says Dr. Evan Goldstein, a proctologist and anal surgeon at his own New York and Los Angeles practice, Bespoke Surgical. ‚ÄúWhen you look at Europe, you look at the trends of bidets and appropriate hygiene from an anal perspective, the U.S. has always lagged behind.‚Äù‚ÄúI think the United States is ass-backwards, always.‚ÄùIn colonial America, going to the bathroom was a seated affair. Privy pits ‚Äî circular brick-lined wells ‚Äî and outhouses with round holes cut from wood planks serving as a seat were precursors to the modern toilet. Elsewhere in the world, like China, squat toilets were commonplace, requiring a user to squat to floor level to reach the toilet opening. Just as popular outside Western culture were bidets, a basin for washing the nether regions.Only recently did these previously foreign aspects of bathroom tradition trickle into American homes. In 2011, a Utah man and his parents debuted the Squatty Potty, a seven-inch footstool meant to replicate the experience of squatting while using the toilet. Marketed as a device that straightens out a kink where the rectum meets the anus, called the anorectal angle, allowing for a more productive and less strainful poop, the Squatty Potty quickly became a pop culture fixture and has inspired a number of similarly designed competitor stools.Before the coronavirus pandemic, bidets never really managed to crack the American market. When American soldiers witnessed their use in European brothels during World War II, the basin was long associated with debauchery. Though Americans first combined a bidet with a toilet seat in the 1960s, these attachments are still catching on. Brands like Tushy and Brondell, which sell bidet toilet seats and toilet attachments, tout specific health benefits, such as preventing urinary tract infections.ong before the privies of early America and the eventual invention of the modern toilet, the only way to move your bowels was to find a spot and squat. With history in mind, the Squatty Potty is branded as a more natural way to poop. ‚ÄúI have two kids, and you watch them poop, especially on an adult toilet, how they engage themselves to defecate is in this squatted seated position,‚Äù Goldstein says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just natural. That‚Äôs just a tendency.‚ÄùThe squatting position has been shown to reduce the relative strain of pooping as well as the amount of time needed to achieve a full bowel movement, according to a 2003 study. More recently, a 2019 study of defecation posture modification devices (the scientific term for items like the Squatty Potty, which enable users to adjust their body position while pooping) showed the footstools reduced strain, cut down on time spent defecating, and allowed for increased bowel emptiness.‚ÄúThis is a simple physics problem,‚Äù says Dr. Rajeev Jain, a patient education adviser for the American Gastroenterological Association. ‚ÄúIf the angle becomes too acute, there is resistance and difficulty in passing stool.‚Äù And Squatty Potties do help open the anorectal angle, he says.However, there are plenty of other factors contributing to a painless poop, Goldstein and Jain agree. One person‚Äôs rectum may naturally kink at a slightly different angle than the next person, and they may be able to achieve an ideal pelvic angle for defecating simply by leaning forward while on the toilet, Goldstein explains. Diet and lifestyle also affect bowel movements. A lack of fiber and exercise can cause constipation, and making healthier lifestyle changes may be more efficient than a step stool at the foot of your toilet, Goldstein says.Currently, there are no studies suggesting bathroom step stools may reduce hemorrhoids like the Squatty Potty purports to do. The cause of painful hemorrhoids ‚Äî swollen veins in the anus and rectum ‚Äî may not be sitting itself but sitting for too long, Goldstein says. Instead of viewing pooping as a respite from reality, the process should be quick since our bodies direct blood to the rectum and anus when we poop, he says.‚ÄúBlood goes to a hemorrhoid, and it acts like a cushion so you don‚Äôt tear anything because there‚Äôs so much force generated when you go to the bathroom,‚Äù Goldstein explains. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre done, the blood is going to leave, but if you‚Äôre sitting for too long, more blood goes there. You‚Äôre swelling these hemorrhoids, and they become symptomatic.‚Äùhe act of pooping is only half of the equation. Going number two has long been associated as an uncleanly act, and within the last two decades, Americans have embraced bum sanitation.Wet wipes, previously used on babies and messy children, were rebranded as Dude Wipes and Stall Mates. While many view these wipes as a more sanitary alternative to toilet paper, they may be causing more harm than good. A small 2010 study found that a preservative in wipes can act as an anal irritant. ‚ÄúIt wipes away the good bacteria,‚Äù Goldstein says. ‚ÄúAnd now it‚Äôs wet and it‚Äôs moist. I see people coming to me all the time with tears, dermatitis. It totally wreaks havoc.‚ÄùInstead of viewing pooping as a respite from reality, the process should be quick since our bodies direct blood to the rectum and anus when we poop.Water itself is more than effective at cleansing the area, Jain says. Bidets, long used elsewhere in the world, never quite caught on in America, but bidet toilet attachments are helping to popularize the practice of bum cleansing. However, don‚Äôt expect the washlets to have disinfecting powers as brands like Tushy claim. ‚ÄúThe water will dislodge solid material, but I doubt it will eliminate bacteria,‚Äù Jain says.A 2017 study suggests that regular bidet use may heal hemorrhoids and genital irritations, perhaps only because people with such irritations may simply prefer to use a bidet toilet anyway, researchers noted. Another study, from 2011, concluded that bidets could help reduce anal pressure due to the spritz of warm, low-to-medium pressurized water from the bidet. However, other research condemned bidet use as the cause of anal fissures.Since overwiping can cause irritation, Goldstein suggests using a bidet immediately after a bowel movement to cleanse the rectum, then use toilet paper or a towel to blot the area dry. Just as keeping all areas of the body clean and dry is essential to avoid rashes, so is maintaining a dry bum. ‚ÄúIf someone has a rash in the perianal region, a bidet cleansing technique would make the area wet, which could aggravate some skin conditions,‚Äù Jain says.Ultimately, the rise of toilet tech stems from Americans‚Äô ignorance of healthy poop habits, Goldstein says. Devices meant to create a more pleasurable, cleaner experience simply showcase how an ideal bowel movement should occur. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taking away your lack of knowledge for you,‚Äù Goldstein says, ‚Äúand supplementing it with something that is healthier, and you potentially may not even know it.‚ÄùWRITTEN BY"

These quizzes can be fun, but maybe they left you feeling like you are not a serious scientific professional. Well. Here is a fun in-between for data science learners: a catalog of ML model types that I have anthropomorphized and described as personality types for amusement, which ideally could also help you understand the pros and cons of each one. Sorry, I mean strengths and areas for improvement.You have a classic style about you (maybe BuzzFeed said that if you were a font you would be Times New Roman). You are the type of person who teachers like to use as an example, and you probably take a little pride in that. Whenever people at work ask you questions, you excel in your detailed and easy to follow answers, but sometimes you are not correct. You find that people are generally good at reading you and figuring out how you work ‚Äî you‚Äôre not complicated, but there is beauty in your simplicity.Unfortunately, people may tend to mistreat you and not give you the time and attention you deserve. And you, to your part, tend to make lots of assumptions of others.You are a self-diagnosed people person. You love connecting others as well as matchmaking, and it gives you joy when you introduce a new person into your social group and they fit right in. You are pretty great at this, but if you are not careful, it will become cumbersome to balance all of your different social cliques. Another one of your strengths is peacemaking ‚Äî if there is a conflict you take a democratic approach and allow everyone to have a vote towards what the group should do.Sometimes your people-pleasing tendencies can leave you paralyzed: constantly calculating and struggling to reach a good decision. Also, you hate to admit it, but some of your friends would describe you as lazy.You were voted homecoming king/queen, you are a high achiever, and/or you pride yourself on always being right. You are popular with a variety of different people, and are often the center of attention at a party. One thing people always admire about you is how flexible you are ‚Äî you can adapt to almost any situation quickly and even excel in tough circumstances. You also tend to overshadow your younger siblings.Sometimes your friends complain that they do not fully understand you, but in close relationships you are able to explain yourself for the most part. However, your highly complex nature forces you to withdraw from others on occasion, and take lots of time to yourself to recharge, plan, and make good decisions.Sometimes your life is a bit of a cluster f***. You move quickly from task to task. Because of your speed, you prefer when requests at work or in the home come to you in easy to understand, standardized format that you can absorb with ease. Like your buddy K Nearest Neighbors, you also love being able to connect friends and place them in fitting social groups. You, however, are even better than he is at this, as you typically need a little less information and you can potentially get better results. Your ultimate strength: being able to make order out of chaos.Your ultimate weakness: dealing with very complex individuals.My goal with this article is to get the question ‚ÄúIf you were a machine learning model, which would you be?‚Äù trending and eventually having it land on one of the many Top __ Data Science Interview Questions lists.

137,10 Signs You‚Äôre More Than Just Friends,https://medium.com/the-life-mission/10-signs-youre-more-than-just-friends-cc665727b6ea?source=extreme_main_feed---------140-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"Have you ever questioned if you and another person might be more than friends? Well sometimes, there can be many signs that subtly tell us of the possibilities. It could be from the emotions we feel to how we behave around them and also the things we do (Givens, 1978). In this article, I will be covering with you some of the signs that you and a friend might be more than just friends.Whether it‚Äôs once or twice a week, you find yourself wanting to hang out with them more and the feeling‚Äôs mutual. It could be that both of you just genuinely enjoy each other‚Äôs company as a friend or perhaps it could be something more. Turns out, it can actually be both. While it is natural for us to want to spend more time with the person we like because it makes both people happy, it could be a sign that they have feelings for each other.So, you guys just hung out a day ago but you already miss them. Although it is usually normal to miss people we haven‚Äôt seen in a while, missing a particular person you‚Äôve seen recently is most likely a sign of something more than friendship. With relation to the first point, it also makes you want to see them more. If the other party seems to be in a similar position as you, it could be that they view you as more than a friend. Then again, it is difficult for either party to find out unless one informs the other.Do you find yourself thinking about them a little too much? Or have they told you that they are thinking about you a lot? Unless something memorable has happened between either of you, thinking of each other a lot may probably involve some form of genuine feelings. Additionally, people tend to get butterflies when they think of someone they adore. So, if you have someone in your mind a lot or vice versa, it‚Äôs probably more than a sign of friendship.No, not literal butterflies. Instead, it means to get that nervous feeling when a person is around another person. According to Scherwitz & Helmreich (1973), interpersonal attraction varies from behavior such as eye contact and interactions. If you find yourself behaving slightly differently, it could be that you are attracted to them in some manner. Furthermore, if you notice a friend who appears to have the butterflies around you, they might be viewing you as more than a friend. In the end, it also depends on how either party responds to the situation.Our attention is usually captured when we see something or someone that we perceive as attractive which can be subjective (Koranyi & Rothermund, 2012). This can be a sign of wanting to be more than friends as we are putting in more effort to make ourselves appear more attractive to the other person. However, individual intentions and situations do vary as well. What‚Äôs your reason for wanting to look more attractive? Are both parties mutually attracted?What is meant by this is you get jealous easily when you see them with someone else. According to White (1981), jealousy in relationships occurs because people perceive the other person as a potential rival that might lead to an involvement with a third person. People may try to downplay their jealousy as they could be trying to hide their true feelings for that ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. Thus, jealousy could be a sign that the interested individual(s) wants to be more than just friends.Instead of seeing them as a good friend, the individual may begin to see the person as something more. The way they feel about them starts to grow as well. Interactions with them and others start to be different. They end up wanting to be more than just friends with them (Deitz, 2020). If the other party receives it with mutual feelings, then it is a sure sign of more than friendship.Whether it is having deeper conversations or talking all day, the bond between two individuals ends up growing. Although good friends are close to each other, it can also be a sign that they are close to being more than just good friends. However, it also does depend on how both parties perceive the situation and each response may vary.Flirting is probably one of the bigger signs of being more than friends. This is because it can be a way of gauging interest to see if the opposite party shares mutual feelings for them. I mean do normal friends flirt with each other? Maybe. However, if they both share mutual feelings for each other, it might be time to discuss those feelings and maybe take the friendship to the next level.So, what do I mean by this? It depends on what kind of physical contact, to be honest. Some friendships have more physical contact than others. However, actions like holding hands, kissing or cuddling, is a pretty big sign of being more than friends. If it‚Äôs a pat on the back or a normal hug, it could be just a friendly gesture. Then again, who knows? It can be difficult to tell.What do you think of these signs? Were you able to relate to any of them? Once again, some signs can be pretty clear that the situation has gone beyond friendship. Other signs may be more subtle that require more action or communication. Despite all these signs, it is still better, to be honest, and communicate your feelings.Givens, D. (1978). The Nonverbal Basis of Attraction: Flirtation, Courtship, and Seduction.

138,Time to Question Everything You Know About Milk,https://elemental.medium.com/time-to-question-everything-you-know-about-milk-12c08b13e98a?source=extreme_main_feed---------141-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"t‚Äôs perhaps the most widely advocated nutrition recommendation of the last half-century: For strong bones and overall health, consume three servings of reduced-fat milk a day.The USDA‚Äôs ‚ÄúChooseMyPlate‚Äù dedicates a corner of their icon for milk and equivalent dairy products (Figure 1).Schools must offer fat-free or 1% low-fat milk at lunch and other meals. To get kids to drink it, the government allows chocolate and other sugary varieties ‚Äî but not plain whole milk!And celebrities from Jennifer Aniston to Taylor Swift have donned the milk mustache, assuring us that milk does a body good.To comply with this recommendation, Americans would need to double their intake (now averaging one and a half glasses a day), which would amount to billions of extra gallons a year. However, my colleague Walter Willet at Harvard and I examined over 100 studies and we conclude, in a new article in New England Journal of Medicine, that the evidence in support of this long-standing recommendation is surprisingly thin.The most common health reason for drinking milk is to strengthen bones, to create a ‚Äúbank‚Äù for calcium throughout life and prevent fractures. None of this seems to be true.Because the natural purpose of cow, goat, or sheep milk is to help young animals grow quickly and avoid predators, it contains all essential nutrients, including protein and calcium. For this reason, milk can provide a nutritionally balanced alternative to the sugary drinks, chips, and other low-quality, processed foods that have flooded our diets.Milk also contains a variety of growth-promoting factors. But today, the milk supply has increased levels of hormones like estrogen and progestins, because industrial dairy cows are pregnant for most of the time they are milked. In fact, children who drink a lot of milk, even those with good overall nutrition, tend to grow an inch or two taller. As we‚Äôll consider below, this can be a mixed blessing.The most common health reason for drinking milk is to strengthen bones, to create a ‚Äúbank‚Äù for calcium throughout life and prevent fractures.None of this seems to be true ‚Äî at least for the general population.Above age three, the suggested intake of calcium in the United States varies from 1,000 to 1,300 milligrams a day ‚Äî amounts that for all practical purposes require daily dairy consumption (or a regular dietary supplement). However, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests barely half that amount, 500 milligrams a day. So, who‚Äôs right?Systematic reviews of all studies done on the topic show no relationship between the hip fracture rates for calcium intakes ranging from about 500 milligrams to more than 1000 milligrams a day. Similarly, milk intake ranging from virtually none to more than four servings a day was unrelated to hip fracture in men or women.Remarkably, countries with the highest milk consumption, like Sweden, tend to have a higher risk for hip fracture than those with the lowest consumption, like China (Figure 2). While international comparisons such as these can be ‚Äúconfounded‚Äù (meaning influenced by other factors including genetics and physical activity level), they show that high intakes of dairy products are not required to keep our bones from crumbling.Even among the young, there is no evidence that milk protects against fractures later in life, and if anything, the opposite may be true. Among almost 100,000 adults studied in middle age or older, each additional glass of milk a day consumed in adolescence was associated with a 9% higher risk of hip fracture in men ‚Äî a relationship apparently explained by height (there was no relationship in women). That is, milk may not strengthen bones, but children who drink lots of it tend to be taller. And as the proverb aptly states, ‚Äúthe bigger they are, the harder they fall.‚ÄùDespite widely advertised claims to the contrary, clinical trials show no overall effect of dairy products on body weight or the success of obesity treatment.The amount of fat in dairy products does seem to influence weight over the long-term‚Ä¶ just not in the way experts had thought. In studies involving young children, adolescents, or adults, consumption of full-fat milk was associated with less weight gain or a lower risk for obesity compared to the same amount of reduced-fat milk.Remember the first Food Guide Pyramid? During the low-fat diet craze of the late 20th century, Americans were told that eating fat makes you fat, and that carbohydrates were the healthiest nutrient. Of course, things didn‚Äôt turn out well, with skyrocketing obesity rates over the last 40 years.We now know that many high-fat foods are not only healthy, but also highly ‚Äúsatiating‚Äù ‚Äî helping us to feel full after eating. Consider a child in the 1960s who, for an after-school snack, had a glass of whole milk and two cookies. Today that typical child might have fat-free milk and, because she felt less satisfied, four or five cookies ‚Äî a bad trade-off for metabolism, weight, and general health.In addition to the (mistaken) belief that it would promote weight loss, reduced-fat milk was recommended out of concern for the high saturated fat content in whole milk. Saturated fat is known to raise LDL (‚Äúbad‚Äù) cholesterol and, in population studies, is associated with heart disease.However, saturated fat also increases HDL (‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol) and lowers triglycerides in comparison to carbohydrates. In addition, all saturated fats are not alike, with those in dairy having some potentially beneficial effects.As with weight, a critical and often overlooked question is how dairy foods fit into an overall diet. Specifically, what other foods might be eaten in place of dairy products, or dairy fat? If the replacement is sugar and other processed carbohydrates, the impact on your waist and heart will probably not be good.Since dairy products contain growth-stimulating factors, could high levels of consumption increase risk for cancer, a disease of uncontrolled cellular growth? Despite extensive study, the answer remains‚Ä¶ maybe.Milk consumption is linked to prostate cancer in men and endometrial cancer (but probably not breast cancer) in women. In contrast, milk consumption may protect against colorectal cancer. However, as with other studies of associations involving cancer, it can be difficult to prove cause and effect. Furthermore, most studies focus on adults in middle age or later, whereas risk factors for cancer may extend back to childhood.Many populations around the world have lactose intolerance, limiting the amount of milk that can be consumed. For some people without symptoms of intolerance, regular consumption may predispose to allergies and allergic conditions, such as eczema and asthma.Beyond the direct health effects, dairy consumption also impacts the environment in which we all live. In contrast to traditional integrated farming methods ‚Äî with grass-fed animals that may help recycle carbon into the soil ‚Äî high-intensity industrial milk production produces large amounts of greenhouse gases, water pollution, soil degradation, antibiotic resistance, and other environmental disruptions.There is no human requirement to drink the milk of other animals. All the nutrients in milk can be obtained in the necessary amounts from other dietary sources. For calcium, alternative sources include kale, broccoli, nuts, seeds, beans, sardines, and other whole foods.Milk and other dairy products may provide health benefits for those with poor diet quality, especially children. For people following a healthy diet, high intakes of dairy might cause harm. Furthermore, there is no evidence for health benefits of reduced-fat over whole milk.1. The currently recommended three servings a day of milk is excessive. Consider zero to two servings a day as a reasonable range.2. Avoid sugar-sweetened milk and dairy products.3. If you consume dairy, enjoy the full-fat versions!WRITTEN BY"

the 90s, supermodel Linda Evangelista caused a media kerfluffle when she famously told Vogue, ‚ÄúWe have this expression, Christy [Turlington] and I: We don‚Äôt wake up for less than $10,000 a day.‚Äù Backlash ensued and in later interviews, Evangelista mused that the quote would probably be etched into her tombstone. You didn‚Äôt talk about money, especially if you were a woman owning your worth. Especially if you baldly announced it as Evangelista did, free of the cowering deprecation women of my generation were preened to practice.Unlike the slew of editors who labeled her entitled, selfish, and elitist, I admired her moxie until I realized she never diversified, didn‚Äôt have a long-game strategy. We all need one lest we face financial extinction.For years, I practiced tunnel vision. Commanding five-figure project rates because I was worth it. And if you had any doubts, I had the case studies, accolades, experience, and expertise to prove it. It was until the last few years did I realize how rigid my model had become. My services weren‚Äôt agile enough to form affordable products that gave prospects value but still kept my business profitable. And I was limiting streams of potential income.Now, we‚Äôre not talking about prospects who believe fair pricing is a race to the Fiveer bottom. You know the nickel-and-dime type. Interrogating you on every line item like they‚Äôre a CIA operative and you‚Äôre the criminal pulling all the fast ones. Telling you they can get a kid out of college for a fraction of what you cost (you do that, buddy, and come back to me when you want the mess cleaned up).We‚Äôre talking about people who are unfamiliar with your industry and standard rates. People who believe you‚Äôre worth it, but they genuinely don‚Äôt have the budget (this excludes startups that spend thousands a month stocking their fridges and mini-bars but can‚Äôt pony up a project fee or corporations that constantly feed you their budget sob stories when they know they‚Äôre saving more on hiring you than staffing a full-time employee with benefits. I‚Äôve been in this game for a long time and I‚Äôve heard everything).And we‚Äôre also talking about people who are cautious ‚Äî they like what you‚Äôre selling, but maybe they want to buy a little of you instead of the whole kit and caboodle.At the end of last year, I mapped out the services I wanted to offer (i.e., brand platform development, story strategy, customer sleuthing) and then I devised creative ways I could package that offering that gave clients equal value but at varying price points. While also ensuring I wasn‚Äôt losing money or devaluing my worth.When selling the varying tiered services, I make it clear what clients should expect in terms of the degree of time, money, and resources they‚Äôll need to invest, which will shift based on their point of entry. More affordable products mean you do more of the work, while premium tiers give you the benefit of saving time but at an incremental cost.Never make the mistake of selling a DIY product or a DIY/DFY hybrid and then doing the work for them. You‚Äôve devalued your work and worth and have made it clear that you‚Äôll do more for less.I mapped out three tiers and all the possible product and service permutations ‚Äî from low energy, low cost to all-in, premium pricing ‚Äî and then I assessed and analyzed which made sense for my business.I also considered: ‚Äúpick my brain‚Äù hourly consults, paid challenges, community offers, and online boot camps, but determined they weren‚Äôt right for me.Result: I decided that I‚Äôd start with eBooks & a resource library in 2020. I‚Äôve already had two successful eBook launches, have gathered learnings from each, which will help me retool my offering in 2020. People can easily buy-in for as low as $20 because I believe in making knowledge accessible for most.Result: This took me months to figure out. Not only did I have to consider what I had the energy for, but I also had to prioritize what would be profitable in the context of my other revenue sources.People also forget that teaching and doing are two distinct skill sets, and just because you can do something doesn‚Äôt mean you have the natural ability to teach what you know. When I was getting my MFA at Columbia, I often found that famous authors didn‚Äôt teach as well as their midlist counterparts.And while I excel at making the complex simple, I had to step back and create a framework that could easily explain what I know without overwhelming people with information. Because I have a tendency to overwhelm others and myself.I ended up going with a 1:1 coaching and a 2-day brand intensive model in 2020, and I‚Äôve already sold three of each in the first quarter.I‚Äôm pricing my 1:1 coaching in the $3-$7K range (depending on the length of the engagement and what we cover) and my 2-day at $2500 + travel. And yes, I believe in being transparent about money. It‚Äôs not bragging if it‚Äôs giving you context and information.Result: In lieu of the new projects I‚Äôm pursuing this year, I‚Äôm dialing down the retainer work and being more selective with the projects I take on because balance and work diversification is important to me. It makes me creative, sharp, and full of verve.My 1:1 work is my most premium offering and prices could range, based on the engagement, from $6K-$50K.I‚Äôve been a working professional for twenty-three years and a consultant for seven. Over the course of my career, I‚Äôve learned that I love building things, but I also love teaching people how they can be the architect and artisan for their own businesses. I‚Äôve found that sweet spot in that Venn diagram you‚Äôve probably seen online of what I like to do, what I‚Äôm good at, and what clients want.I‚Äôve also learned that I can‚Äôt only rely on a single source of income practically and creatively. From a pragmatic perspective, I‚Äôve got debt hovering, bills to pay, and a cat to support. On the flip side, playing different parts in the brand development and storytelling process has made me agile. Not only does the work fuel me, but the variety of people with whom I work is the reason for getting out of bed in the morning.If what you do makes you constantly curious, you can find unlimited ways to nurture that curiosity. You don‚Äôt have to be tethered to one type of work if you‚Äôre hungry enough to climb out of the box you‚Äôve built for yourself to build another.WRITTEN BY"

Then we will teach you step by step how to implement your own 3D Convolutional Neural Network using Keras.A 3d CNN remains regardless of what we say a CNN that is very much similar to 2d CNN. Except that it differs in these following points (non-exhaustive listing):3d Convolution LayersOriginally a 2d Convolution Layer is an entry per entry multiplication between the input and the different filters, where filters and inputs are 2d matrices. (fig.1)In a 3d Convolution Layer, the same operations are used. We do these operations on multiple pairs of 2d matrices. (fig.2)Padding options and slides step options work the same way.2d Maxpool Layers (2x2 filter) is about taking the maximum element of a small 2x2 square that we delimitate from the input. (fig.3)Now in a 3d Maxpool (2x2x2), we look for the maximum element in a width 2 cube. This cube represents the space delimited by the 2x2x2 zone from the input. (fig.4)Note that the number of operations (compared to 2d CNN layers) is multiplied by the size of the filters used (regardless of the layer being Maxpool or Convolution) and also multiplied by the size of the input itself.So how does a data point for a 3d CNN look like?One way to picture it is by using the following image (fig.5):Other existing datasets that you can use for your CNN are:You can try for yourself the code on this dataset from Kaggle that we are using.The required libraries to import are as follows:To begin with, since the dataset is a bit specific, we use the following to helper functions to process them before giving them to the network.Plus, the dataset is stored as h5 file, so to extract the actual data points, we are required to read from h5 file, and use the to_categorical function to transform it into vectors. In this step, we also prepare for cross-validation.Finally, the model and the syntax for 3d CNN are as follows: (the architecture was picked without much refining since that is not the point of this article)Note that the numbers of parameters will be a lot higher for the same number of layers compared to 2d CNN.For your information, after a small sample training, we got the following accuracies and losses. (fig.6)There happens to have many applications for a 3d CNN that are for instance:Alright, that‚Äôs pretty much all. I hope you will try this technology out!

You know these 2020 chat rooms when you see them: They‚Äôre often dubbed something like #random or #funny, and are home to foolery like Cardi B tweets and discussions about the weirdos on Tiger King. Back in February, folks would hop into my org‚Äôs #chit-chat channel and trade memes about the coronavirus ‚Äî not quite anticipating that it‚Äôd grow into a pandemic that has upended every aspect of life in countries around the world.Of course one of the first major American cities hit hard by Covid-19 was Seattle, where I work and live, so things are pretty much shut down out here. Fortunately, my team is able to work remotely ‚Äî though that‚Äôs been an adjustment, to say the least.The perks of working from home are clich√© at this point: There‚Äôs zero commute time, casual Friday has been replaced by wearing sweats seven days a week if you want, and you can take a quick 20 minutes to exercise or de-stress with video games during workday lulls.But there are some weird aspects, too. For one, my anxieties about expectations in this remote circumstance. If I haven‚Äôt responded to an email or Slack in an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù amount of time, is that being tracked? Will there be a passive-aggressive email sent to the whole team about responsiveness? I‚Äôve been on top of things, but it just feels like the stakes are higher, and I can imagine myself starting to overcompensate.It took a few days to find a rhythm and flow for being productive, and figure out how to keep work and leisure separate within one space. I‚Äôve had to keep my laptop out of the bedroom altogether ‚Äî things got to the point where I‚Äôd wake up, roll over, shoot off some morning check-in emails, and then go right back to sleep for another 30 minutes. And without a change of location after the close of the business day, it became easy to keep working well into the evening.It‚Äôs all about boundaries, and that extends to the ways I connect with my co-workers, too. A running gag in the #chit-chat channel is people showing off their morning outfits. One guy sent a photo of himself wearing a robe and holding a coffee mug. A supervisor, joking about how long it‚Äôs been since he‚Äôs shaved, posted a photo of himself in a caveman outfit he probably copped from a party story three Halloweens ago. It‚Äôs funny and good for team morale, because everyone‚Äôs feeling different emotions right now. I wear silly shit around the crib to entertain myself, too. You just won‚Äôt see it on Slack ‚Äî that‚Äôs too personal for me.Same goes for Zoom. For my multiple weekly meetings, we have the option of doing video or audio calls. I stick with audio. I could be wearing a Chewbacca mask for all my co-workers know, but they‚Äôll only see my smiling headshot profile picture when I‚Äôm sharing updates on the call.I can imagine folks on the calls seeing this painting of a Black woman that‚Äôs hanging in my room and thinking, ‚ÄúOh, wow, he‚Äôs really‚Ä¶ cultural.‚ÄùAs one of only a few people of color at my job, I‚Äôm intentional about the corporate-friendly persona that I present when I step into the office. I‚Äôm just not interested in putting on that same front while I‚Äôm within my own personal space ‚Äî at least not visually. Sure, I‚Äôll gladly FaceTime with the homies outside of work, but these Zoom calls can feel like going live on Instagram. Like you‚Äôre being watched, you just don‚Äôt know by whom.Plus, I‚Äôm conscious of my colleagues seeing my home. The few times I‚Äôve gone on video calls, I‚Äôve kept my background nondescript: just a white wall. It‚Äôs not that I have anything to hide. I‚Äôm just not ready to invite my co-workers to see the other sides of my personality ‚Äî my DJ equipment, Jeezy vinyls, and the lush, snaking plants. It‚Äôs a privacy thing. There are a few other folks of color at my job who will sometimes go audio-only, too. I wonder if they feel the same way.Of course, I could be overthinking things. I just know where my attention goes during these boring calls once they exceed 30 minutes. You just start looking between frames and noticing shit, from family life (the toddler toys in the cut) to the subtle flex (that marble kitchen countertop). I assume other people do the same. I can imagine folks on the calls seeing this painting of a Black woman that‚Äôs hanging in my room and thinking, ‚ÄúOh, wow, he‚Äôs really‚Ä¶ cultural.‚ÄùIt just goes back to the idea that I‚Äôm here to give my insights and get my deliverables done ‚Äî not potentially feed preconceived notions or subconscious biases my co-workers may have. Just because I‚Äôm bringing work into my home doesn‚Äôt mean I need to bring my home life to work.WRITTEN BY"
143,6 Bizarre Life-Hacks to Reboot Your Mind,https://medium.com/mind-cafe/6-bizarre-life-hacks-to-reboot-your-mind-a331d5f186ca?source=extreme_main_feed---------146-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"‚ÄúAlmost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes‚Ä¶including you.‚Äù ‚Äî Anne LamottI found myself in a complicated position last year and felt uninspired. A friend said to me, ‚ÄúMaybe you just need to hit the reset button.‚Äù‚ÄúHow do you do that?‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different for everyone. Just adopt a few opposites in your life and stay clear of activities and things you find addictive or tempting.‚ÄùHis advice seemed simple enough. I began the process of looking for opposites and thinking about what I was addicted to. What resulted was a list of bizarre life-hacks that helped reboot my mind. Here they are.My girlfriend watched The Game Changers documentary and that led her to read up on the best foods to consume.The one lesson she got from the many books she read was to cut out processed foods and refined oil. Refined oil, to my surprise, included olive oil too. My energy levels over many weeks changed. My mind felt clearer.To live without a phone is unlikely if you have a family or earn an income. You‚Äôre stuck with your phone.A life-hack I tried, thanks to Megan Holstein, was having my phone permanently set to black and white mode. Since then, my phone has stayed that way.My mind needed rebooting because I‚Äôd become addicted to social media. The colours of the icons and the placement of the LinkedIn app on my phone was working against me and my desire to think, not consume all the time.I found myself in a dark place.Over the years I‚Äôd connected with many LinkedIn leaders and noticed they appeared one way in their social media posts and another way in person or via direct messages. Their egos had been tied to their social media stats. My ego was also tied to social media stats.There were days where these leaders pretended to be winning. The hope was they could start a business thanks to social media. I can remember being told by one leader who made going viral look like child‚Äôs play that my work had offended her. She told me to be more careful ‚Äî like crossing her and the massive following she had amassed was going to be very bad for my life.A dude I met through Facebook even admitted to cheating on his wife because of his newfound fame online. His social media profile started out with the best of intentions and then became a magnet for attracting beautiful women and attempting to seduce them in private messages. When he told me this, I felt sick. You would never have guessed this from reading his Facebook posts.The difficult days were hard enough. At the peak of a challenging career moment, a group of trolls found their way to my work. They made it their full-time job to make up lies about me and sprinkle them in the comments section of my work. There were days where it was hard to wake up and not feel ashamed.My mind had become consumed by social media. The reboot started when I turned my phone to black and white mode. Things got a little better. Then I decided to tone down and even stop reading comments altogether. Removing social media apps from my phone was the next natural progression.Before long, my mind healed from my phone and from too much social media.Email is a full-time job. If you check your email in your spare time, you can become a slave to it.I find too many unread emails to be stressful. A colleague at work suggested scheduling time in my calendar for opening emails. Rather than check emails as they come in, I only checked them twice during the day at pre-determined times. Twice a day seemed to be just enough to keep up without missing anything urgent.Reboot your mind with less time checking email.The typical workday can be exhausting. One way I found to reset and reward myself was to schedule ‚Äòdark chocolate time.‚Äô It‚Äôs a tiny little reward that gives you something to look forward to after work.Peace of mind thanks to architecture ‚Äî who knew.As a kid, my mother loved to watch this tv show called ‚ÄúGrand Designs.‚Äù I used to think it was a waste of time. Then last year I started watching it on Youtube. It helped me reboot my mind.I thought renovating houses was about materialism. Watching Grand Designs taught me that it‚Äôs about so much more than that.The design of a building is about symmetry, peace, and the surroundings. The way a building is designed and lived in speaks to you in another language. A finished building after the madness it takes to build it is a work of art. Seeing how a building sits on the land and blends into its environment can be stunning to watch.Architecture can help you reboot your mind and reconnect you with your environment.To truly disconnect, I found you have to unplug from technology and its constant stream of information desperate to enter your mind.Sunday is a day to relax and explore. You can have one day a week with no internet connection or tech.Life-hacks that are unconventional help you to see alternate realities. In those realities, you find ways to reboot your mind. Your mind is a program and at times, the pattern needs to be interrupted.Switch off so that you can reset and return to the world ready to think abundantly again.You‚Äôre not broken; your mind just needs a reboot.Join my email list to stay in touch.WRITTEN BY"
144,Make Land Great Again,https://medium.com/swlh/make-land-great-again-6c08db9d3a3?source=extreme_main_feed---------147-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"By 2100, predictions show world population will be around 10.9 billion. Naturally, this places enormous pressure on agriculture and food production to feed 3 billion more people. This is especially challenging because it needs to be sustainable.Food production remains a major contributor to both global greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Intensive farming and inefficient practices cause significant decreases in soil quality, which has a knock-on effect on the quality of the food produced, potentially leading to nutrient deficiencies.Our current food system is broken, causing a strain on both human and planetary health. Globally, over 800 million people are undernourished, with two billion falling into the overweight and obese categories. These numbers are insane when we consider that over a quarter of all food produced is either lost or wasted.The World Economic Forum say that food loss and waste cost the global economy $936 billion each year while also accounting for 8% of all greenhouse gases. Estimates even show that ‚Äúfood systems cost society $12 trillion in health, economic and environmental costs ‚Äî 20% more than the market value of food systems.‚ÄùThe IPCC‚Äôs Special Report on Climate Change and land suggested that over a third of all carbon emissions can be sequestered by land, but widespread testing, teaching, and deployment of nature-based solutions are required to implement plans at the scale required.Researchers propose a three step transformation to a more efficient food system.:2. Build national models by collecting data and developing tools to inform policies. This should cover carbon stocks, soil and water resources, food waste, consumption patterns etc. High-quality data collection allows greater opportunity to accurately predict future scenarios.3. Create a global network. Once national models are implemented, it‚Äôs necessary to coordinate them internationally. Members of networks should collaborate to identify gaps and share knowledge and best practices on these issues, including developing and implementing new policies.The Food and Land Use Coalition (FOLU) proposes ten critical transitions to transform food and land use. They fall into four categories: nutritious food; nature-based solutions; wider choice and supply; and opportunity for all. Opportunity for all, which consists of transitions in gender and demography, stronger rural livelihoods and the digital revolution, forms the foundation for which the other transitions can build upon.FOLU believes that a unique opportunity exists over the next decade to take significant action. Enormous inequalities exist in our current system and reforms across all groups are vital. While government action is fundamental, civil society, businesses and farmers, investors, financial institutions, and multi-stakeholder partnerships will all play their role in the delivery of these changes.Across the ten transitions, the report finds that annual investment of $300 to $350 billion is required up to 2030. While these figures are large, they are thought to be around a third of the economic benefits that would come with such investments. Estimates show that the economy could gain $5.7 trillion by 2030 (and $10.5 trillion by 2050) by avoiding hidden costs, and business opportunities could bring in US $4.5 trillion annually.It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that the US has just agreed a $2 trillion financial package, within a couple of weeks, to fight the impacts of covid-19. The investment required to transform the whole world‚Äôs food system requires less than double that number over the next decade, with financial inputs from all countries.Increasing production isn‚Äôt the only issue, reducing waste and loss also requires enormous focus. Researchers suggest incentivising companies to report on food waste and loss to promote greater accountability as well as encouraging investors to fund climate-smart storage technologies. Earlier this year, at Davos, a new Food System Economics Commission was launched to better understand the environmental, health, and social costs surrounding food systems and to provide analyses to inform policy design and investment decisions.It‚Äôs helpful to look at land use transitions from the point of view of achieving many co-benefits, not just as a chance to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, better use of land promotes healthier ecosystems, reduces degradation which, in turn, ensures food security. Water and air quality also benefit, allowing for better health and improved quality of life.Equally, investors funding new technologies and innovative businesses have opportunities to see large returns on their investments while significantly contributing to the environment. Farmers and rural businesses involved in food production can earn more money, providing a greater safety net for their livelihoods and reducing the poverty gap. The domino effect of a healthy food system is enormous and can positively impact the vast majority of the sustainable development goals.Implementing a healthy food system, however, is certainly not an easy task. At the government level, targets must be established, prices for carbon must be set, and widespread spending on research and development of more efficient land use practices are needed.To succeed, cooperation between government, farmers, business and investors, as well as campaigns to drive public engagement and education will be important but we must start now to avoid further socio-economic and environmental costs.WRITTEN BY"
145,2020s: When Tech & Politics Collide or Collaborate‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa Forecast!,https://medium.com/swlh/2020s-when-tech-politics-collide-or-collaborate-a-forecast-c4b2760b8a48?source=extreme_main_feed---------148-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"I‚Äôm an optimist ‚Äî despite the horrible politics of the last few years ‚Äî Trump to Brexit to Orban in Hungry and Putin in Russia ‚Äî I‚Äôm hopeful that the next decade will be a great one!As the saying goes, optimists and pessimists die the same, it is how they live that is different! So, let‚Äôs be optimistic!And, given that this new year ‚Äî 2020 ‚Äî is soooo uncertain ‚Äî with Brexit and a potential Trump re-election(?), trade wars with China or real wars in the Middle East and a climate that burns, it is oddly easier to step beyond forecasting this single year and look at the trends that will carry us through the decade.I‚Äôm a ‚ÄòGot the T Shirt ‚Äî Scaleup Coach‚Äô ‚Äî and as a result I have the privilege to see new technologies and growth businesses first hand.I live and work in Europe ‚Äî that is Spain and the UK and across the EU. That allows me to see issues differently.So, here are my guesses ‚Äî yes, they are guesses ‚Äî for what the next decade will bring. I don‚Äôt promise that any will be true, but I believe we have to begin with an idea of what the future might be like so that if you are planning an investment, looking to grow a business, deciding where to live or educate your children, you can make better decisions.I‚Äôm only human, so my biases will be on full view here ‚Äî but I hope you can see through those and take something useful from my thoughts. Lastly, remember that we, as a species, over estimate what we can achieve in the short term and massively underestimate what we can do over a decade!In the next 10 years new ‚Ç¨bn businesses will breakthrough, last year‚Äôs ‚Äòtech‚Äô companies will fade from glory and the world will change. Let‚Äôs change it for the better and let‚Äôs begin that change by asking how things might work out:Politics has dominated the last few years and newspaper circulations have recovered from near death. However, popularism will pass. Yes, it may persist for a few more years, but it will pass. The EU is already stronger, more unified and more assertive as a result of Brexit and Trump. This trend will continue as popularism in its various forms fails to deliver the hoped for economic miracle and people / voters begin to look for something new.‚Äú‚Ä¶there is at least the hope that some of the false promises of the past will come to be exposed for what they are, and that the tide may well turn in unexpected ways. The end of populism? No, but it may be passing its zenith.‚Äù(Source: The Independent)The effect of political popularism has been to end any debate about whether markets are or should be ‚Äòfree‚Äô. Politics in the 2020s will continue to be interventionalist ‚Äî and even the world‚Äôs greatest capitalist ‚Äî Warren Buffett ‚Äî says that governments‚Äô job is to modify markets (source: FT).The ideas and years of Thatcherism and Reganomics are consigned to history. The 2020s will be a decade in which politics will intervene in markets and that is why disruptive or emerging new technology and politics will collide or cooperate. How well these two sides work together will determine how far and how widely many of these predictions are fulfilled.To understand how technology and digital disruption will impact our world in the next decade and to see the new ways of living, working and that our economies function, it is helpful to think of the economy in two parts, the replacement economy and the emergent economy.For instance, movie streaming is replacing traditional forms of enjoying screen entertainment. Instead of turning on a terrestrially connected TV or cable TV, we might choose our Netflix subscription and stream to any number of digital devices.Essentially, Netflix threatens to replace large parts of the BBC, TVE, ZDF, ABC or other traditional broadcasters.Spotify and Apple Music have largely replaced the sales of CDs.For instance, blockchain technology enables us to do things that we were never able to do before. Equally, space travel enables us to go places we were never previously able to go (that we could widely afford), this is the emergent economy.Whereas Uber enables us to replace our previous journeys with a ‚Äòbetter‚Äô alternative and hence is part of the replacement economy.When I started work in information publishing in the early 1990s, one of my first roles was to bring to market a CD-ROM version of a directory of published music. Hence, the information publishing business was one of the first sectors to be disrupted by digitalisation.The experience was a harsh one as we discovered that our costs went up rapidly (we were now publishing hard backed books and publishing CD-ROMs) but our sales barely grew.This was the early warning sign that digitalisation does not grow total markets ‚Äî but rather, grows the cost base and then shrinks the market!The publishing business was one of the earliest and hardest hit as was the music industry.But visions of the newspaper industry ‚Äòending‚Äô are overdone. There is always a bounce after a sector has been digitally disrupted. However, it is notable that the highest circulation newspapers are now free.For books and book stores, it‚Äôs a different story. For instance, the number of independent booksellers fell 55% (source: Guardian) falling from 1,894 to a low of 867 in 2016, since which it has lifted slightly to 883 shops in 2018.And US Bookshop book sales fell only 28% between 2009 and 2014 (source: marketwatch).One might conclude that the older the technology ‚Äî paper ‚Äî the greater the resistance to new mediums. Equally, the newer the technology ‚Äî CD and DVD- the easier it is to replace that technology with new forms ‚Äî such as streaming. Although, it does beg the question, what will replace streaming?When we see that recorded / physical purchase of music (vinyl, CD etc) in 2018 in the US represents just 10% of the market (source: RIAA) whilst streaming represents 75% of music revenue, it is quite imaginable that physical purchase of music will die out in the 2030s. After all, Spotfiy‚Äôs paying subscriber base reached 113m in 2019 ‚Äî up from just 18m in 2015 (source: statista).Cars, for instance, no longer have CD players but stream music via smart phones and hence the means of playing physically recorded music is disappearing too.Bar a few specialist collector CDs / vinyl and resale of old collectors‚Äô items, the music sales market will be 99% streaming and digital downloads by the end of the decade.DVDs can‚Äôt be far behind the CD either. It is reported that DVD sales fell 86% since 2006 (source: CNBC)Book sales, on the other hand, through US bookshops showed a 6% increase in 2016 after falling around 7% per year from 2009 to 2014 (source: marketwatch). The habit of reading ebooks is still small (26% in Germany in 2019, source: statista) having grown very slowing from 21% in 2013. The printed book will still be with us in 2030 as, no doubt, will Ikea‚Äôs iconic Billy bookshelf.There are seven big sectors that are in the eye of the digital and tech storm ‚Äî so to speak! These are historically huge sectors, many with heavy weight technology investments (think of new car development or pharmaceutical drug development) and therefore, they will respond in different and more complex ways than the ‚Äòsimple‚Äô newspaper, CD or DVD to disruption.There is, however, one thing that will connect all of these sectors in the 2020s ‚Äî and that is politics. Hence, an organisation‚Äôs success will be down to an ability to combine great technology that customers want and that politicians are willing / able to support and understand.Treating politicians as if they were customers in the winner strategy for the 2020s.Equally, companies operating in these sectors will be driven into compliance issues and therefore the need to ‚Äòpush down on error‚Äô will happen faster than say the advertising / music or publishing sectors were before them. The result is that innovation will slow earlier in a new startup‚Äôs life cycle and full sector disruption will take place in a greater number of waves. Take Transport for example:You could argue that transport disruption began with low cost airlines using the internet to fill seats at incredibly low prices ‚Äî disrupting travel agents. Ryanair launched its website in 2000 (source: Wikipedia).Last year, 2019, the huge holiday and travel company Thomas Cook filed for bankruptcy ‚Äî although other package holiday operators are still functioning with changed business models.Airlines went bust in the 2010s ‚Äî some of them modern ‚Äòlow cost‚Äô airlines ‚Äî like Air Berlin (2017), others like old flag carrier Alitalia are in special administration still awaiting a buyer (source: Wikipedia).Equally, online reviews and reputation (stars) are critical to hospitality success and Trip Advisor, one the first sites to offer visitor reviews, has been in business since 2000 (source: Wikipedia).From 2009, of course, we have the disruptive impact of Airbnb and now its shift from selling space to selling experience. Equally, there is a growing cohort of European cities determined to control Airbnb (source: NewEurope) ‚Äî and appealing to the EU for help.But tech is now impacting the car industry too as the shift to electric gathers pace and the drop of diesel car sales accelerates. In 2018 there were over 3m electrical or hybrid vehicles in circulation, an increase of over 1.2m from 2017 (source: statista).The increase in battery storage power ‚Äî as a result of the lithium battery ‚Äî which enabled smart phones to develop ‚Äî now means that electric cars have greater range and heavy investment in battery production will take place in the US, EU and China now and in the early 2020s.Recent investment means that by 2023 Europe will have increased its battery production to 198 gigawatt-hours which will pass the expected level of US battery production of 130 gigawatt-hours. Putting Europe at the front of electric car battery production.These new batteries will power the emerging European electrical car industry and will help European drivers meet the city centre restrictions on fossil fuel cars. However, significantly, the EU is also seeking to establish its own battery research and development and has opened a $3bn fund to allow this (source: FT).Vehicles in the 2020s are increasingly automated but will take time to be fully autonomous. Automation can take place without new legislation or insurance, but autonomous vehicles require the agreement of local or national governments ‚Äî an agreement that can be withdraw at various points depending on performance. Tesla already faces new challenges follow semi-autonomous driving fatalities (source: BBC).Think only of Uber‚Äôs loss of the right to operate in London as the London Major withdrew their operating licence and you begin to see how politics will play the key role in facilitating or denying the expansion of these new technologies.It is impossible to consider energy without looking at the impact of climate change and the legislation that will follow.Energy is likely to be governed by global rules by default as climate change drives the political agenda. However, who will drive those global rules? It is unlikely to be Trump‚Äôs USA and therefore, US involvement in the 2020s will depend on the next two White House elections.However, the EU is already setting ambitious targets for reductions in CO2 emissions. Sometimes this is at the level of the trading block, sometimes national governments and other times at city level.Other countries, such as the UK, are beginning to record weeks without electricity generated from coal (source: The Guardian) and generating almost half of its electricity from zero-carbon methods (source: edie)This shift away from fossil fuels will continue and in the 2020s both India and China ‚Äî already struggling with smog and city air pollutants will adopt similar measures.However, perhaps the two biggest potential disruptive ideas in the energy market in the 2020s areYou might want to watch this short The Economist video about the effect of free electricity and how it would unleash potential yet make ‚Äòthinking‚Äô governments more important and the market economics of limited supply need to be replaced by rules and regulations.I‚Äôm not ready to predict ‚Äòfree‚Äô electricity in the 2020s, but ‚Äònearly free‚Äô is a distinct possibility that would liberate many people from poverty and hence, is a likely goal for progressive politicians.Equally, the rebirth of nuclear as a source of power is ‚Äî possibly ‚Äî the only way to replace our dependence on fossil fuels in a short space of time. Have a read of this WSJ article to find out more.Education is a sector that is old-world in almost every respect ‚Äî no technology is required to run a classroom (beyond electricity ‚Äî nearly free in the 2020s???- and paper and pencils); it is extremely labour intensive and that labour (teachers) is highly qualified and expensive to educate. Lastly, students learn better when they are together ‚Äî hence, physical proximity is still important.But it is changing. And demand for education is growing at the same time.Whether virtual learning environments will extend beyond tech / software subjects is hard to predict. I suspect that there will be limited appetite but that won‚Äôt stop home schooling and a more decentralised way of learning where ‚Äòinfluencer teachers‚Äô join a classroom to teach a favourite subject. For instance, just imagine David Attenborough (well, a virtual representation of him at least) turning up in your classroom when you were learning biology? Think you might have learnt a bit more? Me? Certainly!In the 2020s education demand will grow for the over 70s as learning new stuff features at the top of local government‚Äôs anti-loneliness and anti-dementia policy. Learning new stuff gets you smart and keeps you smart ‚Äî it will be essential for both ends of the age scale.It may be that the ‚Äònew stuff‚Äô needs to lead directly to employment activity too ‚Äî as that is where much of the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô learning will take place.In fact, we will see education move beyond the classroom and into a ‚Äòdoing‚Äô or apprentice type context ‚Äî just don‚Äôt be surprised if your apprentice is 50 years older than the teacher and that after lunch, they swap roles.Lastly, the half-life of a practical subject ‚Äî like law or medicine ‚Äî has been decreasing rapidly ‚Äî such that every 5 or so years, experienced practitioners will need to go for substantial re-fresh. This maybe where virtual learning has the greatest success, as it enables updates whilst taking the least amount of time and therefore allows the student to continue to earn a living.Health has always been a high-tech sector ‚Äî but it is undergoing unprecedented change as investment is made into bio-tech. Some highly successful tech investors (eg. Andreessen Horowitz) are convinced that bio-tech is like software in the 1990s ‚Äî developed, but tiny in comparison to its potential and therefore, this is the sector most likely to receive trillions of investment dollars and hence, most like to change out of all recognition in the next 10 years. So, rather than give predictions, let me share some thoughts on the themes:The way we eat is changing fast‚Äî how this will evolve will be driven by some of these issues:The digitisation of the finance industry is so significant that it already has its own name ‚Äî Fintech!That must also mean that it isn‚Äôt exactly new! However, we may not have seen the full disruption of finance in the past decade ‚Äî so here‚Äôs what might happen by 2030:My final ‚Äòbig sector‚Äô to be disrupted in the 2020s is property. I don‚Äôt just mean the buying and selling (or listing services which began back at the turn of the century) but also construction, design, maintenance and improvement.In the next decade we‚Äôll see more ofMega cities ‚Äî see below ‚Äî will demand one solution, rural emerging economies another, but the unstoppable price hike in homes over the past 30 years will demand new solutions ‚Äî some of which can be delivered through technology.Equally, the drive to solve the housing and homeless crisis across the world will lead to new policies and new technologies emerging in the property sector.These technologies can then filter out and transform the sector. In particular, the laborious effort of measuring up a room, a property, a site, will quickly come to an end and surveyors will be freed to spend their time on more value adding work.In the commercial sector, the decline of the high street will meet the growth of co-working space ‚Äî as people ‚Äî freelancers and mini corporate teams ‚Äî look for easy to access hubs from which to work. Expect fitness centres to appear alongside to offset all those hours spent sitting in front of screens.And lastly, retail will decline as ‚Äònear city‚Äô warehousing demand grows as delivery companies (Amazon for instance) target the ‚Äòsame day delivery‚Äô option for 80% of the urban population.In the 2020s, City to other City connections, not region to region or country to country, will be more significant.Think of flights ‚Äî they fly city to city ‚Äî not country to country. Unless you live on an island‚Ä¶Adidas. for instance, have adopted a six-city strategy ‚Äî if they can succeed in these mega cities ‚Äî they will succeed worldwide ‚Äî because these cities have more in common with each other, than their respective hinterlands.And which cities are they? Two in North America ‚Äî New York and Los Angeles. Two in Europe ‚Äî Paris and London. And two in Asia ‚Äî Tokyo and Shanghai. (Source: ISPO)Countries with a number of mega cities are likely to do better than countries with just one major city.Compare, say, the UK ‚Äî where the economic value is hugely centralised in London at the expense of other cities ‚Äî will fare worse than a country such as Spain where Madrid competes with Barcelona and cities such as Valencia stand apart.Equally, Germany offers city growth in Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich against France‚Äôs heavy dependence on Paris.As a result, some countries will experience extreme concentration of wealth (UK, France), others, will see a far better distribution (Spain, Poland, Germany).There will be two ways to afford a home for young people. Firstly, live with less space (and use technology to reconfigure your home every few hours between sleep, work and play) and secondly, buy in tall apartment blocks.Some cities and cultures ‚Äî particularly the UK and southern US / Australian environments ‚Äî are poorly adapted for living at height and these endless extended suburban cities are unlikely to attract the smartest and the brightest.Which leads us to immigration:Ever improving digital communication will mean that you do not need to sit in the same room in order to work alongside each other.This technology will cut across boundaries as technology enables language skills to be available to any smart user and management of cultural differences will be built into our communication (source: a16z).Hence, our mental barriers to immigration will decline ‚Äî we will no longer be able to see ourselves as part of a tribe threatened by ‚Äòother‚Äô people.But the migration of work can be managed digitally ‚Äî so, your team can join from Mogadishu or Chennai ‚Äî they don‚Äôt have to make the physical journey.This breaking down of barriers also means we will need new ways of building our tribe ‚Äî perhaps our support of a football team will be the glue that joins us ‚Äî just look at how twitter brings a global audience of people together for an English football game ‚Äî to understand how that might work.However, physical migration will be necessary to support ageing populations in the developed world as birth rates decline further with small space living and the loss of traditional ways of life, physical immigration will be essential to both maintain economies and deliver basic services.In the mega cities ‚Äî this will be seamless ‚Äî the resistance will come from the rural areas which are still dominated by social conservationism.Single countries will increasingly feel like two different countries ‚Äî urban liberal and conservative rural ‚Äî and politics and national identifies will break and re-form to allow them to co-exist peacefully. However, the 2020s will represent that journey apart and then possibly back together again.Skills-based immigration policy will be a total nonsense in the 2020s! Utterly and totally!The smartest brains will be like the fruit pickers of old ‚Äî seasonal workers and project based. Nomadic, moving from city to city or if beyond single and settled with a family, their skills will sell and they will connect with people across mega-cities and globally digitally.Digital nomads will go where the broadband is powered, the weather is great and the food amazing and the flights are cheap! Look out Spain! They will be led by the desire for experience rather than tradition and rootedness.And digital nomads along with consultants, advisors and mentors, freelance marketers and so on and so forth, will mean that organisations change from one with hard boundaries ‚Äî where you are either ‚Äòin‚Äô or ‚Äòoutside‚Äô the company, to organisations with porous membranes will allow the attraction of great projects to draw the best skills into the organisation for as long as suits.Similarly, national ‚Äî or city ‚Äî boundaries will become porous membranes as working people move back and forth or scale the ‚Äòwalls‚Äô by connecting digitally.Forecasts that there will be 1 billion freelancers / digital nomads by 2020 now look over done especially given the semi-demise of WeWork. However, the growth trend will continue in the next decade from a high starting position:Small cities with specialisms in research and in the geographical shadow of mega cities will also perform well. Good examples are Cambridge England, which is close enough to London to access capital and talent as well as being a centre of research. Equally, Cambridge MA is close enough to Boston for the same benefits.Large, but non-mega cities ‚Äî like Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield in England‚Äôs north, will lose ground unless they unify their transport systems and effectively, in economic and tech terms, become one mega-city. This is not a binary choice but a matter of degree ‚Äî essentially, the greater the unification, the stronger pull the ‚Äòmega-city‚Äô will exert on talent, investment and research.Small cities like Chester (near Liverpool and Manchester) will only benefit by their location in the shadow of such mega-cities. Their‚Äôs is a cross-your-fingers-and-hope strategy combined with rigorous focus on improving transport connections to the nearby (potential) mega-city.Let‚Äôs now look at three emerging economy sectors:Blockchain is a controversial technology partly mired by its link with cryptocurrencies which are (and will remain) a mystery for most people (see the piece on Fintech above).However, the technology is being applied behind the scenes to facilitated ownership and transfer of assets in new ways which will both increase the value of those assets but also create new economic possibilities.Company ownership is often described as ‚Äòsingular cell‚Äô ‚Äî blockchain offers the technology that can transform this. However, the modern company structure is underpinned by company law and that would require a full update to enable a multi-cell structure of ownership and governance.Perhaps Blockchain will be of more value in enabling, say, indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest to stake and hold a claim of land ownership. Blockchain may also help sell things like coffee direct to buyers bringing far greater revenue to the coffee farmers (currently, there are up to 7 middle (wo)men between a poor coffee farmer and my morning caf√©).Blockchain statutory ID ‚Äî secure and incorruptible is a technology that can be used to ensure people who have the right to vote get to vote ‚Äî and only once ‚Äî that your driver‚Äôs licence is always with you and up to date, when, for instance, you go to hire a car in another country. And, equally, it should mean the end of passport queues too.Lastly, something needs to manage (install updates, recognise ownership) of all my IoT devices ‚Äî smart fridges, smart doors, smart lights etc‚Ä¶ and blockchain may be the technology to unify these seamlessly and, most important of all, securely.Artificial Intelligence will replace humans! Such were the rubbish and typical scare headlines of UK gutter press ‚Äî Sept 18th 2019 (Source: Daily Express ‚Äî you can google it you really want, but I‚Äôm not promoting links to this newspaper üòâ)Instead, Artificial Intelligence will become even more super powerful at finding stuff!I wonder then, can it find truth? Well, perhaps not, because truth and untruth are fluid concepts whereas stuff ‚Äî like cars, software developers, flights, homes, shoes ‚Äî that‚Äôs stuff and can be found (sorry software developers ‚Äî I mean, find your skills ‚Äî not you as people).In addition, Artificial Intelligence can find pathways too ‚Äî so, the route to winning a chess game or a game of GO is to find the pathway most likely to bring you to a successful outcome ‚Äî recalculated each time it is your turn. As it happens, computers are brilliant and discovering these sorts of pathways.Computers will also detect cancer earlier and bring exceptional levels of diagnostics to our medical examinations ‚Äî which will in turn, increase the demand for more examinations and more data and faster updates / responses to that data ‚Äî which is going to place new demand on medical staff as once you have a diagnosis and there are two or three options, you‚Äôre going to want to talk this through with a human.So, don‚Äôt expect AI to replace jobs ‚Äî displace jobs, yes ‚Äî but oddly, the areas where AI has the greatest potential impact in the 2020s ‚Äî medical services ‚Äî will also stimulate new demand and existing jobs will move or be displaced to meet that new demand.Can AI be used to find a path through streets? In other words, will AI be able to drive our cars? No and maybe!Rather than seeing millions of drones delivering Amazon parcels ‚Äìdrones for surveillance, for disrupting flights, for policing and military purposes ‚Äî will be the drone stories of the 2020s.Forecasts for 2027 suggest that US home deliveries by drone will reach a market value of just $29bn against a total home delivery market value of $400bn (source: marketwatch). Rather than this representing just 1/16th of the whole market, it is more likely that drone delivery will be well advanced but only in a few cities or towns.Which towns and cities adopt drone delivery will be determined by local politics and, perhaps, whether issues of congestion and terrain make drones more attractive.Home delivery by drone will follow a similar path to autonomous vehicles ‚Äî where local towns and cities allow it, it will be possible. But will you and I want to live in those cities?Drones will of course have a special value in certain industries ‚Äî building or industrial plant surveillance and maintenance as well as wildlife filming and movie making, all of which will reduce cost and, in the case of filming, increase supply. A YouTube for wildlife videos, anyone?Or perhaps a drone will become the new ‚Äòmust have‚Äô for social media influencers? Will Facebook servers be able to cope?The 2020s will be characterised by the feeling that everything is and can be measured ‚Äî our heart rates, our blood sugar levels, our sleep patterns, our urine will be sampled on a daily basis and our food calories too.However, this might only appeal to a niche audience. Many people will just say, what the heck! ‚Äî who wants an ‚Äòoptimised‚Äô life if I‚Äôm not allowed a beer once in a while (or perhaps more often).The failure of Smart Watches to reach beyond a niche is a good warning that we don‚Äôt want tech to manage everything ‚Äî sometimes, we just don‚Äôt want to know ‚Äî especially if it is good for us!Last decade featured battles over US tech giants seeking and then losing influence in China (eg. Google) just as China has built its own tech giants and now seeks to open up markets beyond China.And these spats and issues will continue until 2030.However, there is a new player in the 2020s version of the Splinternet and that is the Hispanic world.After English, Spanish is the most common second language on the planet.Not only does it have huge impact on North America ‚Äî through central America, Mexico and Spanish speakers in the USA, but is also operates across South America bar Brazil and a couple of small exceptions.The Hispanic world is, unlike the Anglo-Saxon world, still culturally focused on the mother country ‚Äî Spain! Most people in South and Central American can trace lineage and cultural connections back to Spain ‚Äî for instance, the tradition of celebrating the arrival of the three kings on the 6th of January is largely a Spanish and Mexican tradition.This matters because it cements Spain‚Äôs position as the gateway to BOTH the EU and also Latin / Central America (and beyond into Spanish speaking USA itself).Once the UK removes itself from the EU, it will no longer be the go-to destination for US tech companies moving abroad ‚Äî Spain will take the place of the UK. Yes, Ireland will play a part, but it is too small to host the breadth of tech and engineering skills that will be needed.As such, the Hispanic internet will see strong investment and the hub will be Spanish cities in the 2020s.The 2020s will end the binary division between USA and China as Spanish becomes the third part of the digital world.What could stop this three-language vision of the internet happening in the 2020s? Well, Spanish politics for a start ‚Äî but 10 years is long enough for Spain to get its act together and, when an idea‚Äôs time has come, nothing can stop it, not even all the armies in the world (adapted from Victor Hugo).The technology to do many things we might be able to imagine will exist by the end of the 2020s. Whether the technology is allowed to be deployed or how it operates will depend less on the tech world and more on the political world and of course, customer response.The business models, privacy and ethical frameworks will need to be designed, built and adapted to allow new technologies to emerge and establish themselves.Therefore, the pre-eminent political power in the 2020s will lie with those that legislate over the largest markets.The experience of the EU‚Äôs GDPR (data and privacy rules) are that the European highest standards, quickly become global standards. Tax law changes will also effect how tech companies deploy globally and on this issue, the US Presidential policy will impact the decisions of US tech companies.However, this bigger issue is that the EU is likely to have as high or higher technological standards and greater interest in social and political frameworks for the emerging technologies than the USA, and hence this block will be the dominant political body for the next decade.The EU parliament has already set global standards for data use and privacy. It is significant that the exit of Britain in 2020 doesn‚Äôt stop anti-EU politicians threatening to sue the British government for data breaches using EU inspired law (source: The Independent).Equally, any tech company with a goal to operate globally, will find that its servers hold data on people who either are living in the EU or non-EU citizens who have passed through the EU and therefore, they must comply or face potential fines.The EU ‚Äî and EU parliament, is therefore setting the highest data and privacy standards and any tech or digital company that is more than a local agency, will need to meet those standards.Equally, European cities are those with both the greatest need to remove the car from their centres (as medieval layouts are not suited to heavy traffic) and the politics (at local and EU level) to ban diesel and petrol cars is powerful, thus spurring the adoption of electric vehicles, driving this innovation.Expect therefore the changes in new drug testing and adoption to be first tested in law at the EU level. And the legal framework for non-driver autonomous vehicles will have to be set at EU level and so on and so forth.Equally, the digital tax on tech giants will come from coordinated action across the EU and no doubt through the EU parliament too.Hence, even if Silicon Valley can invent new tech, its commercial success will require compliance with EU law. This will happen regardless of who sits in the White House or what kind of promises a Brexit Prime Minister makes in Britain.It is also possible that the next holder of the keys to the White House will exert some pressure too ‚Äî but depending on the nature of those incumbents it might simply be restricted to adjustments to the tax code to force US tech companies to onshore profits and IP (source: FT)In the meantime, smart news organisations will be taking half their international bureau budgets and using them to expand their reporting teams in Brussels in the 2020s.Above all else, this is the decade where technology and politics cooperate‚Äî or collide. Expect squeals and yelps from West Coast libertarians, but most people will recognise the value and need of a more grown up approach to technology.We‚Äôve had the dark social media adverts influencing our politics. We‚Äôve seen our health systems brought to its knees (temporarily) by cyberattacks and we‚Äôve experienced the drama and emotionally numbing effect of VAR technology in that European export success, football.Our planet faces a number of potentially existential threats ‚Äî eg. climate change ‚Äî that will drive technology development in transport, consumption and energy. But this time, the politics will be driving the change, not just the market or consumer.Success in the 2020s will depend on the ability to combine both great technology and user experience with effective engagement with the politics and political issues of the day.No wo(man) is an Island! We really are in this together!I hope this has been helpful, interesting and stimulating!And above all, have an amazing year and an incredible decade.I‚Äôm Neil Lewis ‚Äî a ‚ÄòGot the T Shirt‚Äô Scaleup Coach at Media Modo and I coach startups to scaleup.

146,How I DIY‚Äôd my Budget Using Python for Selenium and Beautiful Soup,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-diyd-my-budget-using-python-for-selenium-and-beautiful-soup-4d2edc5c519?source=extreme_main_feed---------149-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"I‚Äôm an avid fan of personality tests. I love reading through my pre-packaged type description I swear is unique to me and only me. I love how they make me feel as though a pair of psychologists have stolen a glance at my soul using answers I myself provided. But I know not everyone agrees. For the naysayers, whether they say the mainstream options are too cliche, or discount the result because it‚Äôs very much self-reported, I present: the Budget Type Index.For those now expecting to receive a pdf with your personalized profile, I hope you‚Äôre not too disappointed when I tell you this is something you‚Äôll have to make for yourself. Okay, fine, this isn‚Äôt really a personality test in the traditional sense, but I do think a well crafted budget can tell you just as much about yourself, if not more, as any of those alluring online quizzes.When I set out to do this project, I wanted to understand where my money was going, and by extension, understand what I prioritized. I was previously manually aggregating all my spending across my multiple bank accounts, including non-banks but frequently used services like Venmo. I had searched for a service that would not only automate this process and show me my historical data, but also do it without a monthly fee. There wasn‚Äôt quite anything that fit all these criteria, so I created my own using Python.For anyone else also looking to measure and manage their spending, gathering the data is the first, and most important, step. I‚Äôve broken down the rest of this article based on the two tools I‚Äôve used:Selenium automates browsers. Originally created to test web applications, it is now also widely used for web scraping. I‚Äôve included the entirety of my code below before breaking down how I used this tool.You‚Äôll first need to install two software packages.Install by typing the following in your command prompt:The Chrome driver (which is what I‚Äôm using) can be found here. There are different drivers for different versions of Chrome. To find out what version you‚Äôre using, click the three vertical dots on the top right of your browser. This will take you to settings. Then, open the menu and click ‚ÄúAbout Chrome‚Äù ‚Äî this will display your Chrome version. Download the applicable driver and make sure it‚Äôs in your Python PATH.A more thorough installation explanation, including links to drivers of other browsers, can be found in the docs here.Now that you have the necessary packages, you can start dictating web elements the driver should select. One thing that can affect the location of these elements is the size of your window. For maximum consistency, I like to full screen my window before starting any processes.To retrieve transactions, we first want Selenium to log into the bank‚Äôs website. We can identify what elements need to be selected by inspecting the website‚Äôs HTML page. To pull up the page, go to the website, and identify the log in box. Right click the Online ID field. Select ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù.You‚Äôll have this elements locator pop up, highlighted on the field you chose (in this case, Online ID).There are eight different ways to locate your element in selenium. These are by:This is the one I decided to use, as indicated by the poorly drawn red circle in the screenshot above.This is considered to be the most accurate method, as each element‚Äôs ID is unique.Good examples on CSS selectors can be found here: https://saucelabs.com/resources/articles/selenium-tips-css-selectorsXPath is a language used for locating nodes in a XML doc. This is useful for when there is no suitable id or name attribute for your target element. The basic format is as follows:You can read more on xpath here.Be mindful that all these methods will only select the first element it finds. To select multiple elements, use the same methods, but replace the word ‚Äúelement‚Äù with ‚Äúelements.‚Äù (e.g. driver.find_elements_by_name(‚ÄúINSERT-NAME‚Äù))After you find the login element, the next step is to input your credentials. This is done with the function send_keys().Remember to protect yourself by not committing your password anywhere.I added a wait to tell Selenium to pause for two seconds between entering my username and password using time.sleep(). I found that without it, Selenium moved too fast and the browser had a hard time keeping up.I would typically press the ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù button after I typed in my credentials, so I wanted to do the same in Selenium. Luckily, Selenium has a list of standard keyboard keys. In this case, I used Keys.RETURN:Now you‚Äôre in!To see if you located the elements and inputted your credentials correctly, you can try running your code. A new Chrome instance will pop up and you can see the browser running automatically. This instance is a different browser than the one you use regularly. It contains no cookies and disappears after you are done. Therefore, if you do need cookies, you can check out how to add them on this website.I can see that my code ran correctly when this Chrome instance takes me to my bank account home page. I see two links: one to my checking account and the other to my credit card. To click these links, I use find_element_by_link_text and select using the click() method.Once you are on the page with the transactions you want, retrieve the page_source from the web driver and store it in a variable. This will be used for parsing later.Now the only thing left to do is to repeat with your other bank accounts.The process was nearly the same for my other account at Barclays, aside from a pesky iFrame. An iFrame, or inline frame, is an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document on a website. I first suspected this might be getting in my way when I received an Element Not Found error despite clearly locating the element I wanted by its name. Luckily, Selenium has an easy way to navigate to an iFrame using the switch_to method.Continue to retrieve the page source using the same method as in the Bank of America example.Once you know that your code works, you can expedite the process by getting rid of the browser that pops up the next time you run your program.You now have all your necessary data. It may not be in a very readable format, but making it usable is what Beautiful Soup is for.Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML files. Now that we have the necessary HTML pages, we can use Beautiful Soup to parse it for the information we need. Again, I‚Äôve included the code in its entirety before diving in below.It‚Äôs time to check out the HTML page you retrieved earlier. Because the jumbled plain text page is so‚Ä¶ jumbled, I chose to navigate the HTML via the source itself, by right clicking each of the transactions on the bank website and selecting ‚ÄúInspect.‚Äù This highlighted the transaction in the web page element inspector (used earlier to identify login boxes with Selenium).The data I wanted to gather included the date, the description of the transaction, and the dollar amount. As seen above, these pieces of information were nested in multiple ‚Äútd‚Äù tags within the parent ‚Äútr‚Äù tags. I used a combination of find and find_all functions to move along the tree until I arrived at the tag containing the text I wanted. The snippet below is how I retrieved the date.Since how you use Beautiful Soup is so specific to the web page you‚Äôre looking at (as evidenced by the separate functions I made for each page I retrieved), instead of running through my code line by line, I wanted to instead point out irregularities and interesting tidbits I found to help your process be as efficient as possible.All the Beautiful Soup find functions take HTML attributes as keyword arguments. While this is pretty straightforward for most attributes, in Python, since class is a reserved keyword, you can use class_ to represent its HTML counterpart.The find functions can also take other functions as arguments. For a quick way to locate specific tags that fit multiple criteria, try inserting a lambda function.Example 1 is pretty simple. I could also have done without the lambda function to find the same element using this:Example 2 is where the lambda function‚Äôs power really shines. By combining multiple criteria and using Python‚Äôs has_attr, my power to search for exactly what I want increases exponentially. Another good example of lambda‚Äôs usefulness (and an explanation of lambda!) can be found here, where the author takes the Python isinstance function to conduct Beautiful Soup searches.In Rows 8‚Äì19 of my Beautiful Soup code above, I narrowed down the tags (or containers as I like to call them) to the largest one that contained all three pieces of information I wanted to extract (date, description, amount) for each transaction. To extract data from these drilled down containers, I used soup.tag.get_text().If you read through the Beautiful Soup documentation, you may have seen soup.tag.string instead used to extract text. This is the function I first used, but I quickly found it did not work in this situation. soup.tag.string only returns a NavigableString type object, which further must be the only object present in the tag.soup.tag.get_text(), on the other hand, can access all its childrens‚Äô strings (even if it‚Äôs not a direct child) and returns a Unicode object. Therefore, if the text data you want to extract lives within a child tag (you can see the a tag within the td tag in the screenshot below), you should use soup.tag.get_text().If you prefer slightly cleaner code, you can also use soup.tag.text. This calls get_text(), and basically does the same thing, but I prefer the original get_text() as it supports keyword arguments like separator, strip, and types. For this project, I included strip=True as a keyword argument to strip out any white spaces from the text.You now have the power to retrieve all your financial data from your sources by running a single program. This is your start to creating your own Budget Type Index and finding out more about yourself through your spending habits. Head off to collect your data points, and become the best financial version of yourself!WRITTEN BY"
147,Coffee and Your Immune System,https://medium.com/@jonathanoei/coffee-and-your-immune-system-44a541ce4f70?source=extreme_main_feed---------150-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"Anyone can publish on Medium per our Policies, but we don‚Äôt fact-check every story.

imes are hard. The world is witnessing an unprecedented outbreak of mass proportions, and for most of the lucky ones, this means social distancing and self-isolating, essentially locking ourselves inside our own living quarters, reducing social interactions and community activities to a bare minimum.And while physical business locations are closing down, there is an ever-present demand for the continuation of work, and that leaves many of us with the conundrum of having to hand in assignments and follow-up on projects from the uninspiring embrace of our living room couch.Naturally, moments like these call for hot cups of freshly brewed coffee. It seems like there‚Äôs nothing more fitting than our usual daily dose of caffeine to put our cerebral engines into gear and jumpstart productivity. Coffee shops too far away? Worry not, delivery service platforms are here to help. Oh now they‚Äôre closing down too? Don‚Äôt worry you can still purchase some roasted coffee bags online and brew some yourself from the comfort of your kitchen pantry.When there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way right?Yes, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs always a good strategy. While there is an abundance of studies and papers citing to the seemingly endless array of benefits from consuming coffee, such as its ability to reduce stroke risk, prevent Type II Diabetes, and promote longevity, a 1990 paper by Dr. Isaac Melamed contrastingly showcased how drinking coffee instead decreased the immune function‚Äôs ability to fend off infections.The study was performed in 15 healthy medical facility staff members, who were later divided into two additional subgroups of 7 and 8 people respectively. The first subgroup was asked to drink 5 cups of coffee (containing 45mg of caffeine) daily for 5 weeks and to abstain from coffee in the succeeding 5 weeks. In the second subgroup, the orders were reversed, so they were told to abstain from coffee for the initial 5 weeks, and then coffee for the next 5.The subjects‚Äô blood was drawn on the first day of the trial before the intervention, and at the end of each 5-week period, and were evaluated for mitogen stimulation, chemotaxis, and subsets of T-cells.Though no significant correlation was found between coffee consumption and the resulting number of T-cells, chemotaxis was found to be higher in coffee periods at all concentrations, and mitogenic stimulation had a more blunted effect on lymphocyte response during coffee drinking.If we translate all this to day-to-day English, coffee essentially decreases our white blood cell‚Äôs ability to react to potential pathogens by curtailing its ability to divide. And yet there was an increase in chemotaxis, a term used to describe when your immune cells mobilise toward a particular chemical stimulus. While this would be useful in the event of an infection, increasing chemotaxis in the absence of real danger is analogous to the boy who cried wolf. With coffee consumption, cortisol is thought to be the perpetrator.The results of the study was ultimately inconclusive to its chemotactic and T-cell findings, but this 2005 paper by Professor William Lovallo underlines the causative correlation between caffeine consumption and endogenous cortisol release.‚ÄúIt affects your immune system,‚Äù postulates sleep scientist Dave Gibson. ‚ÄúChronic elevations of cortisol can alter the immune system responses.‚Äù And if you and I have ever heard of the word cortisol, our brains will immediately refer to them as the stress hormone. While the definition may be slightly misleading, since cortisol actually helps reduce stress and inflammation (which is why they are very closely associated), too much of it can actually suppress brain function, slow down metabolism, break down muscle, and increase blood pressure, all of which are counterproductive to a normal and balanced physiology.‚ÄúChronic elevations of cortisol can alter the immune system responses‚ÄùIn addition to the cognitive strain that cortisol generates within the body, they are also thought to decrease our body‚Äôs ability to fight off infections as well as remove abnormal or damaged cells. And to make things even worse during times like these, this article lays upon some other devastating effects of consuming too much caffeine, such as worsening panic attacks, anxiety, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, stomach upset, tachycardia, irritability and addiction.The bottom line is this. There is yet to be a conclusive study on the true objective effects that coffee and caffeine begets on our immune mechanisms, both at low and high concentrations. But at times like these, when the urge to consume gallons of coffee as a catalyst to overcome the seemingly insurmountable goal of producing meaningful work from home is at its peak, it is imperative that we train our self-discipline muscles and look for alternatives elsewhere.Desperate times may call for desperate measures, but uncertainty is not fought by adding another layer of uncertainty. The war with uncertain times is fought by taking no chances, by adhering to professional advice, by sticking to government policies, to make sure you and your loved ones see through this one.

What the?Forgive me. I‚Äôm going to be blunt, maybe even a little harsh. But then I‚Äôll be gentle, and we‚Äôll talk about all this like adults, and maybe you‚Äôll gain something from reading about why American can‚Äôt seem to deal with a pandemic well (but you can be the judge of that.)Nobody should have expected a society as ruthlessly and lethally capitalist as America to save the average prole during a pandemic‚Ä¶instead of exploit them all the harder. If you expected America to save you‚Ä¶you shouldn‚Äôt have. What was never expendable to capitalism was another quarter of profits‚Ä¶another few million dollars for billionaires‚Ä¶higher stock prices. What was expendable was you.(Now, ‚Äúcapitalist society‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean your local tiny microbrewery, bakery, or drycleaner. Sorry, I‚Äôm not a die hard Marxist. I love business, trade, commerce, enterprise, which are what your local bakery and microbrewery are. But capitalism, predatory capitalism, America‚Äôs weirdly Soviet totalitarian capitalism ‚Äî as in more money, at any cost, for vast corporate entities, who are super-people, bending every social and political and economic institution to that single one-dimensional end ‚Äî is something that, at this juncture, all sane people should find problematic. Why?)Let me explain, beginning with a simple observation.Capitalist societies have long had enough homes to house everyone, enough money to pay everyone a decent income, enough food to feed everyone, more than enough professors and teachers to educate everyone, enough medicine to treat everyone. And yet they‚Äôre never once ‚Äî once in history ‚Äî given any of those things to people. In more technical terms, capitalist societies have huge surpluses of resources ‚Äî and yet people struggle as entire classes and groups for just those very things. Don‚Äôt you find that odd? Striking? Bizarre? I do. It raises the question: if a society has ample resources to give everyone a better life ‚Äî why on earth does it keep them from people?There‚Äôs really only one possible answer to that question. It goes like this. In a capitalist society, you aren‚Äôt seen as deserving of those things. Those are things which must be ‚Äúearned.‚Äù But that also means: nobody has intrinsic or inherent worth. Because, of course, the definition of ‚Äúinherent or intrinsic worth‚Äù is that I have a basic human right to things like housing and healthcare and medicine and so on.I want you to think about this point carefully, closely, to really interrogate it until you get it.If a society has ample food, medicine, money, homes ‚Äî and yet people still struggle for all these things, the only conclusion is that society must not think people have any inherent worth. Why else would a society deny its own people the things it already has? And yet that is precisely where 75% of Americans are. America‚Äôs a society with ample homes, money, medicine, food, and so on ‚Äî and yet that‚Äôs how many Americans struggle to ‚Äúafford‚Äù these things. What the?All that‚Äôs what Marx called exploitation and immiseration. Exploitation ‚Äî you have to work for things that should be basic rights. Immiseration: society has more than enough to provide all these things for you, but for some reason that you can‚Äôt quite fathom, nobody much has them. The reason is the system, the ideology, the belief. Nobody has intrinsic or inherent worth. The only point of all human existence, endeavour, thought, action is one-dimensional: making more profit.That is the fatal flaw at the heart of capitalism. Again, I want to distinguish it from everyday business, commerce, trade. You might be a great, awesome, wonderful CEO of that small or medium sized business, and give all your employees all the above, unconditionally. Excellent. Capitalism, on the other hand ‚Äî McKinsey‚Äôs storm troopers marching into a boardroom, demanding ‚Äúrationalization‚Äù, Goldman Sachs selling poisoned derivatives to small towns, both investing in concentration camps ‚Äî isn‚Äôt interested in any of those things.‚ÄúCapitalism doesn‚Äôt allow you to have any inherent worth‚Äù can be put in a simpler way: it‚Äôs indifferent to life and death. Yours, in particular. It literally doesn‚Äôt care if you live or die. In many respects, it‚Äôs happier if you‚Äôre dead. If you‚Äôre a burden ‚Äî in the form, of say, taxes for social systems. If you‚Äôre ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù or ‚Äúinefficient.‚Äù If you cost it money, capitalism is much happier with you dead than alive.You‚Äôd be fair to think I was exaggerating‚Ä¶until, well, right now. Because right now, capitalism is demanding that Americans go back to work, risk their lives, spread a pandemic, see their loved ones die‚Ä¶all so that profits can continue their upward spiral. Can there be a more powerful, direct, and visceral example than that of all the above? That capitalism‚Äôs indifferent to you living or dying? That it prefers you dead over alive, the moment you cost it money? That in a capitalist society, nobody has intrinsic or inherent worth ‚Äî in this case, the most fundamental aspect of it, which is‚Ä¶living itself?A capitalist society is run for one purpose. I‚Äôve already alluded to it above. The only point of it all, and all means every single thought, action, idea, interaction, behaviour in a society, is this: to maximize profits. There‚Äôs a point at which profit is earned fairly, sure ‚Äî think of the local microbrewer or baker. But to capitalism, the quest for profit is endless and perpetual, which demands, in turn, harder and harder exploitation ‚Äî to the point of true immiseration.Again, you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking I was exaggerating not so long ago. But today?Consider this. Americans work harder than anyone else in the rich world ‚Äî harder than most people in the poor world. And yet their incomes haven‚Äôt risen in five decades. They don‚Äôt have decent healthcare, education, retirement, childcare ‚Äî any kind of social system. Meanwhile, those who ‚Äúown‚Äù the super-people known as ‚Äúcorporations‚Äù ‚Äî entities with superhuman rights and powers ‚Äî went from millionaires to billionaires to mega billionaires. Exploitative enough for you?But that was yesterday. Today, Americans are being exploited even harder than that. They‚Äôre being made to go back to work in the face of a global pandemic. What the? How much more exploitative can a system even get? Maybe gulags, I suppose. But how different is it really being made to go back to work and risking sure death? Americans are reaching the outer limits of exploitation. What else are we to call being made to work when a fatal disease ravages a rich country?Yet there‚Äôs exploitation, and there‚Äôs immiseration. Exploitation is what‚Äôs easy to see: America‚Äôs bigwigs take a massive, unfair slice of the pie, thus driving the people formerly known as the middle class into poverty. Immiseration is what‚Äôs harder to see: the idea that a society has enough to go around ‚Äî a surplus. And yet that surplus can never be shared, precisely because capitalism can‚Äôt allow such a thing to happen, because then profits would crater.I‚Äôve already pointed out how America has ample homes, money, food, medicine, and so on ‚Äî and yet Americans struggle to ‚Äúafford‚Äù just these things. That‚Äôs immiseration. Now let‚Äôs apply that concept to Americans being made to work during a pandemic.The point is this: Americans don‚Äôt need to work during a pandemic. There is literally no reason for them to. They don‚Äôt need to be made to ‚Äúwork‚Äù for basics like homes, medicine, money, and food ‚Äî society has a massive surplus of all these things already. They don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúwork‚Äù during a pandemic for a similar reason. America is easily rich enough to simply support the whole economy for a few months during the pandemic ‚Äî which is the wise and right and fair and moral thing to do. Nobody needs to work. Not just because America is a rich society ‚Äî but because the only ‚Äúwork‚Äù that really needs to be done during a pandemic is tending to the ill, feeding the indigent, making sure the disease‚Äôs spread is slowed, and so forth. The ‚Äúwork‚Äù that Americans are to be made to do has literally nothing to do with any of that very real labour. (Does anyone really need a new home built right about now? How about a trip to the dentist? Or a pair of new designer jeans? Maybe you see what I mean.)You know and I know the real reason Americans are being made to work during a pandemic: money. So that profits rise, so that stock markets rise, so that the rich get richer. So that, in other words, the system doesn‚Äôt collapse in on itself. A cynic might have an even darker interpretation: so that Americans know their place. So that they‚Äôre so beaten, weary, terrified, and anxious, they never really have the time or energy to question the insanity of all the above.Because insanity is really the only word for it. What else would you call a society that has a massive surplus of homes, money, medicine, food ‚Äî and yet 75% of people still struggle to ‚Äúafford‚Äù these things? What the?That‚Äôs insanity, for three reasons. First, no progress is possible. People are just made to work for things they already have. So what reason is there for anyone to really create anything new, positive, life-changing? Why bother, when you can exploit people over what they should already have ‚Äî which a mobster might just call extortion?Second, regress tends to happen. When I feel desperate and bitter, when I grow poor and insecure, I‚Äôm likely to turn to demagogues, like the idiot America has for President right about now. Third, societies like that fall apart. When I can see that my society has a surplus of the very things I need desperately ‚Äî why would I trust my institutions? My leaders? The system? Anyone or anything? Bang! A society plunges into distrust and enmity and hostility and superstition that way. It literally begins to disintegrate ‚Äî just the way America is.That‚Äôs immiseration, my friends. The insanity of a society denying its people the very things it has an abundant surplus of. In America, they used to be things like medicine, food, money, education. Today ‚Äî even more grimly ‚Äî the thing Americans are being denied‚Ä¶that they have an abundant surplus of is‚Ä¶have you figured it out yet?It‚Äôs life itself. When you‚Äôre made to go back to work, during a pandemic, you risk your life. But there‚Äôs literally no reason to. No reason, that is, except more profits for the ultra rich. (Yet that is no good reason at all ‚Äî because, as we‚Äôve established, society has a massive surplus of just those profits. Not only that, money is denominated by life. If life has no worth ‚Äî what good is money? All it can really buy is violence, the right to harm life. But I digress.)Americans were ‚Äî until last week or so ‚Äî immiserated over money, food, homes, education, medicine. Society had a huge surplus of these things, and yet Americans never had enough of them, because they were deliberately withheld. Americans were made to compete viciously and brutally over them, instead, so that profits could skyrocket forever.Today, Americans are being immiserated over life itself. Their institutions are literally telling them they must work ‚Äî or else. On the one side, they risk losing their lives, yet on the other, they‚Äôll lose their incomes, what little healthcare and retirement and stability they have. What kind of choice is that? A choice that says: on the one side, you don‚Äôt live, and on the other, you don‚Äôt either.But these are the outer limits of immiseration, too. It‚Äôs one thing for a society to withhold a surplus of homes, food, medicine, money. But life itself? As in the basic right not be infected by a global pandemic, and infect those you love, too? Just so that ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù as in profits and stock markets for mega-corporations can ‚Äúkeep going‚Äù, as in keep rising forever? What on earth? Can immiseration get more extreme than that, really?Here‚Äôs one of the big secrets capitalism doesn‚Äôt want you to know. The point of life isn‚Äôt money. The point of money is life. The point of you isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe economy.‚Äù The point of the economy is you. Or else the idea of ‚Äúan economy‚Äù is a contradictory, foolish, nonsensical proposition. What good is ‚Äúan economy‚Äù where we‚Äôre all sick and dying, but one person‚Äôs made trillions? What good is ‚Äúan economy‚Äù where living standards only ever‚Ä¶fall‚Ä¶because we‚Äôre all being made to exploit each other‚Ä¶and love it? That‚Äôs not ‚Äúan economy‚Äù, it‚Äôs just idiocy and self-destruction, collapse, and implosion into poverty and despair by any other name. And yet this is precisely and exactly where the thinking of predatory capitalism has self-evidently led.‚ÄúThe economy‚Äù means nothing at all if it doesn‚Äôt include your life, getting better. Not getting worse ‚Äî to the point of literally hoping you don‚Äôt die. If it‚Äôs just money, stock markets, profits ‚Äî it‚Äôs meaningless. That‚Äôs the central lesson of this mess: the economy and your life aren‚Äôt mysteriously separate things. They are one and the same, and that our way of thinking doesn‚Äôt reflect that is why we cannot ever seem to fix much of anything, or get out of our self-made messes. The economy is you, and you are the economy. Capitalism wants to separate life and ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù precisely so that it can exploit and immiserate you, and then point to booming stock markets and roaring profits, and say: ‚ÄúWoo-hoo! The economy‚Äôs roaring!! Nothing to worry about here!!‚ÄùAnd yet not a single American pundit or intellectual, so far as I can see, has grasped that elemental lesson: ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù and living standards are not distinct things, but one and the same. So let me flip that on it‚Äôs head.You shouldn‚Äôt have expected capitalism to save you during a pandemic. It was never going to. Capitalism takes you at your most vulnerable ‚Äî and exploits you al the harder. It withholds a surplus of things which already exist in society ‚Äî it always and always will ‚Äî even if those things are safety from a pandemic. It‚Äôs only purpose, like a mindless predator, is to profit, more, forever, and all you are to it is a means to this end. Those are it‚Äôs rules. What was a capitalist society going to during a pandemic? Exploit. Immiserate. Who? Itself.When I phrase it that way, perhaps you see the grotesque tragedy and the absurd folly of it all ‚Äî America, right now. What kind of a society‚Ä¶exploits‚Ä¶itself? What the? Shouldn‚Äôt a society want to mature, develop, elevate, expand, lift, walk from the desert to the shore?Ah, my friends. These are the days we learn the bitter, strange truth of ourselves. If, that is, we see what‚Äôs revealed to us by the hand of tragedy, and the finger of folly.Umair Haque

149,Amazon and SpaceX Think Satellite Constellations Are the Key to Faster Internet,https://onezero.medium.com/satellite-constellations-are-the-future-of-the-internet-d48c22b87918?source=extreme_main_feed---------152-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"ou may have seen one of the countless articles peppering news feeds about satellite constellation-based internet connectivity such as Starlink by SpaceX or OneWeb. A few companies have deployed their first satellites, and many more, such as Amazon, have filed applications with the FCC and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to get permission to develop their constellations. There are even rumors that Apple is working on a cluster of satellites to provide internet connectivity to its devices. The interest in satellite-based internet is high, and there‚Äôs plenty of opportunity for financial gain.Satellite internet already exists, but it‚Äôs a different kind. Almost all satellite internet today is served by massive satellites in geostationary orbit, which means the orbital speed matches the rate of the Earth‚Äôs rotation. This gives the impression that the satellite remains at a fixed position in the sky (hence the ‚Äústationary‚Äù in geostationary). Such an orbit is only possible around the Earth‚Äôs equator.The picture below is a computer-generated image of some known space objects. You can clearly identify geostationary orbit, which is the ring of satellites around the equator.Geostationary orbit allows telecommunications companies to construct only one satellite that can serve entire regions at once. Geostationary satellites serve upwards of tens of thousands of people at one time, so these satellites must be very large and costly to accommodate sophisticated antennas and processing equipment. One geostationary satellite can typically cost over $100 million to build.Geostationary satellites are often the only way individuals in remote areas can access the internet. The ‚Äúsatellite dishes‚Äù visible on buildings are almost always used to communicate with satellites in geostationary orbit, and are found more frequently in rural areas far away from high-speed fiber links.Despite their widespread use, geostationary communications satellites have a distance problem. Geostationary orbit is over 25,000 miles above the surface of the Earth, which means that the time it takes radio waves to travel from the Earth to the satellite and back becomes problematic.Typical round-trip time latency between your computer and a server on Earth is in the tens of milliseconds. When communicating through a geostationary satellite link, however, latencies of 500 milliseconds or more are not uncommon. This will limit the maximum data transfer rate in practice and make latency-dependent applications like gaming all but impossible.High latency, and its associated impacts on service, is one of the primary drivers for the development of a new kind of satellite network. Additionally, the distance to these satellites necessitates large and highly directional dishes in order to communicate effectively from the ground. The only way to fix latency is to bring the communications satellite closer to Earth.In order to achieve acceptable latencies, almost all proposed satellite constellations are designed to operate in low earth orbit (LEO). LEO encompasses all orbits up to around 1,000 miles in altitude, but most constellations target orbits lower than 500 miles. At this altitude, satellites move very fast across the sky and can only be seen from a very small patch of the globe. To get a better grasp of this concept, take a look at the image below.This is precisely why so many satellites are required for coverage of even small parts of the globe. The image below is a diagram of a possible orbital plan for the Starlink constellation. These orbits are precisely tuned such that as one satellite leaves the sky another will be visible in most of North America. Satellites here are represented as dots.Once deployed, satellite links can offer latencies lower than that of terrestrial links. Most terrestrial traffic is carried via high-bandwidth fiber-optic links. These can transport lots of data (on the order of trillions of bits per second) a long way, but fiber is actually slower than radio despite having greater bandwidth. The speed of light in a fiber-optic cable is around 200 million meters per second, whereas light and radio waves propagating through the atmosphere travel close to 300 million meters per second. Some satellite designs support inter-satellite data links via radio or lasers, allowing traffic to bypass terrestrial networks and reach its destination almost entirely via satellite.All network designs require some number of ground stations, or ground-based transceivers tasked with taking traffic from satellites and transferring it to terrestrial wired networks. Some designs, such as that of OneWeb‚Äôs satellite cluster, will operate almost entirely through ground stations. Other designs, like that of SpaceX and Telesat, will use lasers and radio waves to transfer data between satellites before reaching a ground station. There are trade-offs to each, and this video by professor Mark Handley at University College London provides an overview of different link capabilities.Despite their potential, there are many problems that may arise if all the proposed satellite networks are eventually developed.One of the biggest problems with satellite constellations is the sheer number of objects that will end up in space. In fact, the number of man-made objects in orbit around Earth is expected to quintuple in the next decade. This drastically increases the chances of satellites colliding and could produce a scenario like from the movie Gravity, where a growing cloud of space debris wipes out almost all satellites in orbit. In fact, the first inter-satellite collision involved a satellite that was part of a communications cluster. This poses a threat to the future of space exploration.Satellite clusters also threaten ground-based astronomy. A drastic increase in the number of satellites in the night sky can affect astronomical observations from ground-based telescopes. Many astronomers have warned that satellites are already affecting measurements. The image below shows a cluster of Starlink satellites right after launch. You can imagine how this long train of satellites could disrupt astronomical observation.A last physical concern is radio frequency (RF) interference. All constellation designs call for a use of radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to deliver service. With so many satellites in space, this can affect receivers on Earth by bombarding them with more electromagnetic radiation and raising the noise floor.Potential issues also exist on the geopolitical front. Many countries, most notably China and Russia, heavily restrict internet access by forcing all traffic to pass through government-operated gateways within the country. Constellations with inter-satellite links can bypass internet censorship, making them potentially incompatible with government regulations.Bypassing government censorship sounds like a nice idea in practice, but these constellations are designed to make money. If governments ban them, the corporations developing these networks lose out on customers. A potential way around this is to heavily utilize ground stations and force all incoming traffic to be routed through government servers first. This is the reason that OneWeb decided to abandon inter-satellite links in the first place.SpaceX is likely to win the race to provide the first commercially available coverage with a next-generation satellite cluster. A commercial rollout with limited coverage is slated for mid-2020. SpaceX is in the unique position of controlling the entire process, from development to operation. Satellite development engineers can work closely with the teams operating SpaceX rockets to ensure maximum efficiency. SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink satellites are launched in groups of 60 at a time with startling packing efficiency in the rocket fairing (the nose cone that protects payloads during flight). The image below shows a human next to an almost empty fairing on the left, with the fully loaded Starlink payload on the right.Satellite internet constellations are something to watch out for in the 2020s. This will likely be the first major revolution in the way massive portions of the population access the internet since dial-up internet. When activated, satellite internet constellations will provide instant competition to the monopoly that some ISPs have in rural areas. Rather than provide inferior service like with geostationary satellite internet, these constellations can provide speeds and latencies rivaling or surpassing fiber.WRITTEN BY"
150,How to Tell If Your Relationship Will Last.,https://medium.com/@brookemeredith/how-to-tell-if-your-relationship-will-last-c7a86b87e2b4?source=extreme_main_feed---------153-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"While there are never any guarantees and one cannot ever know for certain if a romantic relationship will last (since a significant aspect of living is not fully knowing what is going to happen to us as we move along on our journey), there are signs that offer telling insight into whether it‚Äôs likely your relationship will go the distance.Here are a handful of strong signs that your relationship has staying power.Your partner continually makes plain, via their actions, that you are a top priority in their life. This can be anything, from listening carefully when you speak to being reliable and steadfast, including you within significant aspects of their life, bestowing loving and significant gestures of care on you, going out of their way for you, etc.You two can and do talk about the tough stuff. Couples who avoid (or, cannot handle) the tough stuff are unlikely to go the distance. The ones who bring it out on the table and dive right in, they showcase a sense of courage and openness with regards to dealing with both the positive and challenging aspects of their relationship, which results in their relationship as more likely to last.You have each other‚Äôs backs. Whether it‚Äôs finding a means by which to understand their personal goals and projects, supporting them in a tough moment or situation, to jumping in and helping when they might need it. This includes standing up for them in moments when it may be difficult, as well as, speaking glowingly of them to others when they aren‚Äôt around. It means making clear to onlookers and loved ones that this person is a prominent and big love in your life.You play together. This can be adventuring and going away together, playing board games, trying novel places to eat, exploring new parts of your city (or other cities) together, attempting a challenging physical activity you‚Äôve never done before, heading to an arcade, going out dancing, hosting a game night with friends, you get the idea. Couples who play together, more often stay together.You have a life and identity outside of your partner. This includes having a few friends of your own, with whom you spend time separate from your partner sometimes. It means having passions, projects, and hobbies that light you up inside and add meaning to your life, apart from your partner. It means having a sense of purpose, your partner aside. When your romantic relationship is your whole life, sense of being, and purpose, this risks suffocating and eventually snuffing it out. Life, interest, and excitement is breathed into relationships when there is a degree of separateness between each of you in some ways.You continually pursue learning and growth together, both, as a couple and as individuals. People in the relationships which most flourish and stand to last are those who shift and evolve over the months and years together, in wonderful, possibly unexpected, and interesting ways.There are shared interests and values in the relationship. No, you need not have everything in common. You need not even have a lot in common. You should, though, have some core common interests, as well as, share similar morals and values. Otherwise, there may not be much binding you together over the long term, and extremely differing morals and values can pull you apart with time.You search for opportunities to, as well as, routinely choose to see your partner with new eyes. When we think we know our partner fully, this creates a sense of dullness in the connection. There is nothing left to discover. Nothing left to hear or learn, we believe, since we already know them fully. What most do not realize or remember is that this is faulty thinking. Even for the closest romantic relationships in which you know one another intimately, you never know someone fully and entirely. This is for two reasons. Because healthy people are ever-evolving and changing, in small ways and significant ones. And, because there are always some aspects to a person which are not shared with others, which are kept only for themselves.Thus, remember this. You can know your partner deeply, intimately, incredibly well. Though still, you do not know them fully. There are ever new things to discover, learn about, and see in your partner. You must choose, then, to see them with new eyes regularly. To search out the moments in which they have something to teach you, or in which they interest, impress, awe, or surprise you. These moments are always there. You just need to choose to see them. The couples who stand a strong chance of going the distance know and do this.You listen to each other. Most people are, sadly, not great listeners. Some people are decent listeners sometimes. A few people are great listeners most of the time. The majority of people, though, are subpar at best. The funny thing is that almost everyone thinks they are a good or great listener. This is like the statistic that a high percentage of people think they are excellent drivers when of course, that cannot be true. Same thing with listening. Couples who stay together over the long term turn towards and tune in fully (most of the time) to their partner. They listen to the words (and beyond the words, the feelings and messages) their partner is saying and attempting to get across. They are curious about and care with regards to what their partner has to say.Even when other aspects of life may compete with priority placed on their relationship, the couples who last do not allow other things to take precedence over their love. Their love and relationship comes first. This will be displayed via behavior in a variety of ways. They make clear though that their love is the most important aspect of their life.You are both open to flexibility, as well as, are both forgiving. People make mistakes. The people we love most will disappoint or even hurt us (hopefully unintentionally). There will be moments of let down. And, in all intimate relationships, there exist moments and times of anger.People who know this, who can be flexible, as well as forgiving, are much more likely to go the distance together. To weather the difficult times together and remain in a relationship. There may be times in a relationship when a period of uncertainty exists, or when some distance is needed. That, if both people are able to be flexible, they can emerge through the phase of ambiguity intact, their relationship stronger. Many couples cannot be flexible, open, or forgiving, and so their relationship may unnecessarily end (where others might have pushed through, healed, and gone the distance).WRITTEN BY"
151,Several Passive-Aggressive Income Streams You Probably Never Knew Existed,https://medium.com/jane-austens-wastebasket/several-passive-aggressive-income-streams-you-probably-never-knew-existed-13249ad48b40?source=extreme_main_feed---------154-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"I was often told growing up that my passive-aggressiveness would get me into trouble. Sure, there were times where I wasn‚Äôt as careful as I could have been and feelings got hurt. Yet as I‚Äôve matured so too have my passive-aggressive quips. Now only one question remains. How can I use these talents to make some extra money? Luckily there are several ways an industrious entrepreneur can make a passive-aggressive income.You‚Äôve got a way with words. You‚Äôre not a fighter, you‚Äôre a slayer. When you are hired to hang out with your new friend, your goal will be to put down her enemies. This won‚Äôt be difficult for you.Your compliments are actually very well-hidden insults that will make the target lie awake for nights to come. Sleep will be impossible as they wonder if, in fact, you actually did think their earrings were something only they would wear‚Ä¶because they are unfashionable.Your clients will pay you well for your passive-aggressiveness expertise. Mostly because they won‚Äôt want you to use your talents on their insecurities.No bride wants to tell her cousin that their gift sucked. But what if that bride never put a duck toaster on her registry in the first place and is a known vegetarian?Still, rules govern our society and they state that thank you cards must be sent after a wedding. So get yourself the sweet gig of writing passive-aggressive thank you‚Äôs to the wedding guests who deserve it most.Really they are lucky to be hearing from ‚Äúthe bride‚Äù at all after purchasing 1 spoon from a whole set of dinnerware. Though maybe they will wish they hadn‚Äôt heard anything when you subtly imply that the bride thanks them for their gift knowing it was more than they could probably afford since money is so tight due to that gambling problem.Passive-aggressiveness works best when you know what you‚Äôre doing. This is why amateur passive-agressive insults are often seen for what they are, aggressive. If you are truly a master, then give yourself permission to show the world your talents in a one-of-a-kind online course. If someone says they don‚Äôt need your help just reply, ‚ÄúNo worries! If you‚Äôre happy with where you are that‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù Stunned by your abilities, and wanting to know how to how you do it so well, they‚Äôll sign up in droves.Society6 and websites with similar structures allow you to create your own designs and stick them onto different products. From tee-shirts to shower curtains you could have your passive-aggressiveness out there in the world, changing lives every day.Imagine!Notebooks with slogans like, ‚ÄúThis journal belongs to a writer who has more than ideas.‚ÄùOr a tote bag proclaiming, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind me, just doing something small to save the earth. But you probably just forgot your bag at home.‚ÄùMaybe a tee-shirt with the large, bold font reading, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about me, I love my body.

152,How Under Armour Bet Everything on the Wrong Customer,https://marker.medium.com/how-under-armour-bet-everything-on-the-wrong-customer-e0b2edb569e4?source=extreme_main_feed---------155-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"year ago, Under Armour founder Kevin Plank was as blunt as he could be about the company‚Äôs strategy: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to double down on performance.‚Äù At its core, this is a strategy many companies embrace when times are tough: Let‚Äôs do even more of what we do best. But as Under Armour would learn, that‚Äôs not always the right move.Still, it was an understandable stance at the time. The ‚Äúperformance‚Äù corner of the athletic-wear market ‚Äî meaning products made for actual sports use, not for sitting on the couch in front of the game ‚Äî is where Under Armour made its name. Plank created the brand‚Äôs very first moisture-wicking garments as a direct result of his experience as a college football player and an understanding of what other athletes might want.Under Armour went on to live out the axiom that if you win over the most demanding consumers (in this case, serious athletes), then the wannabes fall in line and follow whatever trend those influencers set. The consumer market rewards authenticity; that‚Äôs the conventional wisdom, at least. And for years, that was the story of Under Armour‚Äôs meteoric rise ‚Äî from the then-twentysomething Plank selling gear out of his trunk in 1996 to around $5 billion in revenue in 2018.For many consumers, it may be more important for sports shoes or athletic gear to pass muster at a weekend outing or the office than it is for it to dazzle on the track or the field.But lately, the company‚Äôs strategy hasn‚Äôt been a winner. Just months after his declaration, Plank stepped down from his CEO role. Under Armour announced disappointing results and a gloomy forecast, its stock has suffered accordingly, and among other problems, a federal probe is reportedly exploring whether the company used accounting tricks to massage its sales-growth curve.What went wrong? One compelling answer is that Under Armour misread the rise of the so-called athleisure trend and put too much focus on performance. In short, this maker of gear for authentic athletes may have been better off catering more to the poseurs and couch potatoes.It‚Äôs not that a brand can‚Äôt be successful with a strict focus on performance, says Matt Powell, vice president and senior industry adviser for sports at research firm NPD Group. But a brand with mass aspirations shouldn‚Äôt get overly obsessed with an elite customer niche. ‚Äú[Under Armour] clearly needs to understand that [performance] is very much the smaller part of the market,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd a shrinking part of the market.‚ÄùIt is possible to obsess too much over your most hardcore, dedicated customers.NPD regularly interviews consumer panels on a variety of marketplace behaviors, and last year, when the firm asked buyers of sports shoes how they intended to use them, only 15% offered an answer that involved actual sports or athletic activities. Similarly, just a quarter of buyers of activewear planned to use it for anything, you know, active. Powell says NPD has been asking these questions for about half a decade, and these are the lowest scores so far; just five years ago, 25% of shoe buyers mentioned sports use.To be fair to Under Armour, Powell thinks most athletic-wear makers are still adjusting to the athleisure consumer. For decades, there‚Äôs always been at least one performance category that was attractive to a wide audience partly because of its performance: tennis wear in the 1970s, then jogging and running gear, basketball shoes in the 1990s, and so on. ‚ÄúWe always had at least one performance category that we could say was in fashion,‚Äù Powell says. ‚ÄúAnd now we don‚Äôt. I think that‚Äôs a sea change that the industry has not fully grasped.‚ÄùClearly, people still run, play tennis, and shoot hoops, but many of them are happy to settle for doing so in shoes that don‚Äôt offer maximum performance. ‚ÄúWe used to have multiple wardrobes,‚Äù Powell suggests. ‚ÄúWe had a wardrobe for work, and we had a wardrobe for the weekend, and we had a wardrobe for working out.‚Äù Now it‚Äôs fine to wear athleisure to social occasions, maybe even to work. For many consumers, it may be more important for sports shoes or athletic gear to pass muster at a weekend outing or the office than it is for it to dazzle on the track or the field.Sometimes the needs of the hardcore, ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù superuser simply diverge from those of the more casual customer.The larger point here, however, is that Under Armour seemed to dismiss a trend that was hardly obscure ‚Äî the athleisure idea has been touted for years. Maybe the company thought this was irrelevant to its own product line? Or that its brand was immune? Or that athleisure would simply expand the number of followers attracted to Under Armour‚Äôs authenticity? Or that it would just be a passing fad? These are tempting reactions when a trend emerges that runs counter to your business plan. But such rationalization is a serious risk.And there‚Äôs a deeper lesson: It is possible to obsess too much over your most hardcore, dedicated customers. Yes, performance always matters, in any business. And some customers will always seem more crucial, more sophisticated, and thus more influential than others. It seems only natural to give them the most attention and that if their needs are met, then everyone‚Äôs will be.That‚Äôs true ‚Äî until it isn‚Äôt. Sometimes the needs of the hardcore, ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù superuser simply diverge from those of the more casual customer. This is why the casual customer ‚Äî the less-demanding wannabe follower ‚Äî sometimes deserves special attention. If you‚Äôre looking for a mass audience, that‚Äôs who your business depends on.WRITTEN BY"
153,You Need to Know SQL Temporary Table,https://codeburst.io/you-need-to-know-sql-temporary-table-8be0584a85ee?source=extreme_main_feed---------156-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"The discussion here focuses on SQL Server, but the concept of Temporary Table is applicable to most relational database providers. Temporary tables are short-lived tables in database servers, and they allow us to store and process intermediate results by using the same selection, update, and join operations we employ on regular relational database tables.We have been warned to NOT write any business logic in databases using triggers, stored procedures, and so on. It doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt need to know database systems. Being competent in database systems could save us a lot of work. For example, managers or customers often send us an email or a short notice asking for some one-off reports. Then we need to quickly log into the database servers and generate reports with either a list of parameters or a CSV file from requesters.In this article, we will learn about or refresh our mind regarding temporary tables in SQL Server.In an article ‚ÄúWhat permissions are required to create temporary tables?‚Äù (link), Jason Strate tells us that any login with the most basic permissions can have full rights to create and manage temporary tables.We usually replicate our transactional databases to read-only servers for reporting purposes or for the sake of read/write segregation. In a read-only database server, without permissions to insert external data into regular tables, we can use temporary tables to store data for further usage.There are two types of temporary tables: local and global temporary tables. Both of them share similar behaviors, except that the global temporary tables are visible across sessions. Moreover, the two types of temporary tables have different naming rules: local temporary tables should have names that start with a hash symbol (#); while the names of global temporary tables should start with two hash symbols (##).All temporary tables are stored in System Databases -> tempdb -> Temporary Tables. The following screenshot shows two temporary tables saved in a database. One is a global temporary table (##temp), and the other is a local temporary table (#temp).The local temporary table has a generated name in order to avoid name collision, because each session could have a #temp table. The actual names of local temporary tables are different, but we can refer each of them as #temp in their scoped session.On the other hand, the global temporary table has a unique name, because it can be referenced in all live sessions.A temporary table will be automatically dropped once its creation session is closed, for example, when we close the query editor tab or when we disconnect the database server.There are two ways to create a temporary table. One is using the SELECT INTO statement, and the other is using the CREATE TABLE statement.The first method is usually used to save intermediate results for repetitive use at later times. For example, the following query saves ‚Äúmale students‚Äù into a temporary table. Then, we can use the #temp table multiple times in order to reduce redundant queries in the same session.The CREATE TABLE method uses the same syntax as creating a regular table. The following SQL script shows an example.Line 1 checks if a temporary table (#temp) has been created in the current session or not. If the temporary table already exists, then line 2 will drop this table, so that we will have a clean state. Then we can create the table with our desired DDL. After the #temp table is created, we can insert values into the table and use the #temp table as if it is a regular table. This method is useful when we work on database tables together with a list of values from external sources.We usually need to join the data in a database with the data from an existing CSV file. In this case, we have to load data from the CSV file into the database. If we want to save the CSV records to a temporary table, then we can either use an editor to convert CSV records to SQL INSERT statements, or import the CSV file directly using BULK INSERT statement.Here, let‚Äôs take the second approach. The following SQL script shows an example that imports a CSV file from the local disk to a temporary table in a database.Note: in order to import data from a CSV file to a SQL database, the user needs to have the bulkadmin permission.The sections above have summarized commonly-seen scenarios of creating temporary tables. With temporary tables being created, we can conveniently manipulate the data in the temporary tables and other regular tables/views in databases.That‚Äôs all for today.

155,Did the Third Wave bring Black Swans?,https://medium.com/swlh/did-the-third-wave-bring-black-swans-58c6d3923a69?source=extreme_main_feed---------158-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"Can a ‚Äòfuturist‚Äô (‚Äúa person who studies the future and makes predictions about it based on current trends‚Äù) make sensible predictions fifty years out? Or are there too many ‚ÄòBlack Swans‚Äô to mess things up?In New Zealand in 1984 I occasionally drove to work in the boss‚Äôs 1950 Bedford truck ‚Äî no license, no registration, so I‚Äôd stick to the back roads. To change gear down in these ancient vehicles where the transmission was not synchronised, I had to learn to ‚Äòdouble the clutch‚Äô - and learn real fast. This process involves getting into neutral (using foot pedals that were so high I had to lift my knees up to my chest to work them), taking my foot off the clutch and revving just the right amount so that I could then slip from neutral into a lower gear - without leaving a gearbox full of gear fragments. Until I learnt the knack, I veering around a few corners in ‚Äòangel‚Äôs gear‚Äô (neutral) way too fast. That truck seemed unbelievably ancient even then ‚Äî I was driving a damned a museum piece!Once at work, I joined a bunch of others picking pears on an orchard. I was overgrown ‚Äî the highest parts of the trees were far too high to reach, even perched no-hands, on the top of twelve foot ladders (this took a little Dutch-courage, just a few hundred meters away from the orchard I‚Äôd discovered a place that sold home-made apricot brandy).Lest it sounds like we were slacking, we were working ‚Äòcontract‚Äô ‚Äî only getting paid for what we picked. In my morning, afternoon and lunch breaks, I was reading, and being impressed by, Alvin Toffler‚Äôs (and his wife‚Äôs) book ‚ÄòThe Third Wave‚Äô, by then, already four years old. The book built on the success of his earlier ‚ÄòFuture Shock‚Äô (1970). Toffler was a famous ‚Äòfuturist‚Äô ‚Äî and his concept of a ‚ÄòThird Wave‚Äô was his way of conceptualising the massive explosion of change that was rushing over the world by the end of the 1970s.To Toffler, the amount and direction of change was as significant as two major ‚Äòwaves‚Äô that had preceded it: The ‚ÄòFirst Wave‚Äô was the Agricultural Revolution, which kicked off several thousand years ago. It was a big-one. Richard Manning, author of ‚ÄòAgainst the Grain: How Agriculture Has Hijacked Civilization‚Äô says ‚Äúthe most radical change that ever happened in the human condition‚Äù (link goes to a ‚ÄòCollapse Chronicles‚Äô YouTube interview with him) was when we started farming.The ‚ÄòSecond Wave‚Äô was the Industrial Revolution when humans figured out how to harness the energy in fossil fuels. We had been messing with the Earth system ever since we started farming, but once we started burning coal and oil, the messing went to a whole new level. Industrialisation led to factories, which were the epitome of standardization and conformity. The year that truck was built, 1950, probably perfectly encapsulates Toffler‚Äôs Second-Wave times. Looking back at movies of that time ‚Äî what an austere, conformist, older-male-dominated society the ‚ÄòWest‚Äô seems to have been!And then came the ‚ÄòThird Wave‚Äô. It‚Äôs perhaps harder to define, with ‚ÄòPost-Industrial‚Äô defining it on what it is not, while ‚ÄòThe Information Age‚Äô encapsulates only a part of it. Definitions aside, the main thing I took away from reading ‚ÄòThe Third Wave‚Äô in 1984, was that we were heading into a far more diverse and flexible society. Certainly a bright future. Of course, here was I, labouring on an 8‚Äì5 job (when it wasn‚Äôt contract), with union-stipulated breaks. The thought that in the future we were in for ‚Äòflexi-time‚Äô and somehow working from home (I‚Äôm not sure how that works with fruit-picking) could only sound appealing. Well, whatever the Third Wave was/is, forty years on from Toffler‚Äôs book, we are well and truly in it/under it now. So how did things go?Toffler died in 2016, and this triggered a range of articles reviewing what he got right and wrong. For instance, the BBC pointed out that he got internet and cable television, Genetic engineering, break-down of the nuclear family, and rise of consumerism right. On the other had, he was wide of the mark on any decline of cities, colonising space and underwater, and the continuation of 1960s prosperity. The Guardian thought he was correct about the ‚Äúdownfall of centralised hierarchies‚Äù and that there would be a rise of what Toffler called the ‚Äòprosumer‚Äô ‚Äî a blend of consumer and producer. He was clearly on the mark when he foresaw that the future would be the ‚ÄòInformation Age‚Äô. But what about the potentially very dark spin-off of that revolution ‚Äî Artificial Intelligence? (To see where that is taking us, look at Frontline‚Äôs Documentary ‚ÄòIn the Age of AI‚Äô on YouTube).However, aside from what Toffler predicted, and got right or wrong, there is a third category ‚Äî really important stuff that he apparently didn‚Äôt see coming at all. It‚Äôs a concern when people who devote their lives to trying to see the future miss really important stuff. Of course, there are events that nobody can predict. Some of these, the ones that have a large impact, are called ‚ÄòBlack Swans‚Äô by Nassim Nicolas Taleb in his book, ‚ÄòThe Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable‚Äô. Was Toffler off the mark because of Black Swans?So here are three things that Toffler didn‚Äôt foresee, and that have had (or will) have a large impact:In 1979, the year ‚ÄòThe Third Wave‚Äô was published, the National Academy of Sciences brought out what is popularly known as the ‚ÄòCharney Report‚Äô. The authors introduced their study by writing:‚ÄúFor more than a century, we have been aware that changes in the composition of the atmosphere could affect its ability to trap the sun‚Äôs energy for our benefit. We now have incontrovertible evidence that the atmosphere is indeed changing and that we ourselves contribute to that change. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are steadily increasing, and these changes are linked with man‚Äôs use of fossil fuels and exploitation of the land. Since carbon dioxide plays a significant role in the heat budget of the atmosphere, it is reasonable to suppose that continued increases would affect climate‚Äù.And then the real meat:‚ÄúWe estimate the most probable global warming for a doubling of C02 to be near 3¬∞C with a probable error of ¬± 1.5¬∞C‚Äù.This study didn‚Äôt come out of the blue, as it said, scientists had know about the effect for years. It‚Äôs been no Black Swan, but simply atmospheric science. Toffler just had no interest in the subject. As for the National Academy‚Äôs conclusion, nothing much has changed since then.2. Secondly, the wide-spread swing to authoritarian rule seems to have blind-sided Toffler. Remember that optimism in The Third Wave? Instead, we appear to be returning to just the kind of conservative culture that Toffler thought we were escaping from. Why? The most concise explanation of this that I‚Äôve seen, is in Umair Haque‚Äôs recent post, ‚Äò(How) America‚Äôs Fascist Collapse is Going Global‚Äô. As Haque puts it:‚ÄúCapitalism implodes into fascism because it causes systemic stagnation‚Äù and ‚ÄúCapitalism stagnates because labour‚Äôs share of income never rises, but capital‚Äôs skyrockets‚Äù.As he bluntly summarises:‚ÄúCapitalism implodes into fascism‚Äù.We can, perhaps, forgive Toffler on this one. He thought the onward and upward progress of the Sixties would just keep barreling on. The turbo-charged Neoliberal variety of capitalism hadn‚Äôt yet began, and so there was no trend to project.I don‚Äôt know enough about economics, but I‚Äôd guess that deep thinkers in the subject, like Marx, probably figured out how this would go a long time ago. Toffler was familiar with Marx, but tended to regard what he had to say as no longer being significant post Third-Wave:‚ÄúYet the farther we move beyond industrial mass society, the less tenable the Marxist assumptions. For both masses and classes lose much of their significance in the emerging Third Wave civilization‚Äù.So no Black Swan here.3. Thirdly, and what prompted me to write this, is in Clive Hamilton and Richard Denniss‚Äô‚Äôs book, ‚ÄòAfluenza ‚Äî when too much is never enough‚Äô. Tofflers‚Äô Third-Wave society had a lot of free time. But what actually happened? Hamilton and Denniss studied Australian society. They found that‚ÄúAustralians today have real incomes three times higher than 1950‚Äù but that ‚ÄúAustralians feel they suffer from a chronic lack of ‚Äòstuff‚Äô‚Äù.To compensate:‚ÄúPeople in affluent countries are now even more obsessed with money and material acquisition‚Äù.As just one example, they noted that in the mid 1950s, the average size of a new house was about half the size of one today ‚Äî and today many new houses have a three-car garage about half the size of what an entire house was back in the fifties. This phenomenon of a society being one of the richest in the world, and yet where a majority of its population believe that they cannot afford to buy everything they really need, is what Hamilton and Denniss call ‚ÄòAfluenza‚Äô. The effect has been extraordinary ‚Äî Aussies ‚Äúnow work the longest hours in the developed world‚Äù. They noted that back in the seventies (in other words, when Toffler was writing The Third Wave):‚Äúthe problem ‚Ä¶ was ‚ÄòWhat will Australians do with all their leisure?‚Äô At the time, nobody suspected the answer would be to work longer and longer hours to pay for bigger and bigger houses filled with more and more things‚Äù.How utterly different from what Toffler foresaw! (and I would guess New Zealand and many other developed countries don‚Äôt differ much in this mind-set). In the sense that this weird reaction came from left-field (‚Äúnobody suspected‚Äù), it is, arguably (surely somebody, somewhere has suggested this) a kind of Black Swan. We can give Toffler the benefit of the doubt, and forgive him this one.***Back in that orchard in 1984, the ‚ÄòBlack Swans‚Äô we had to worry about were pears, that looked fine, but after you dropped them in the picking bucket that hung around your neck (which was about 18 feet above the ground), was finding that the inside was full of wasps). Even scarier, there‚Äôs two years more time between now and when I drove that truck in 1984, than between when I drove it and when it was made. That pear orchard is no more, (very) sadly the apricot brandy is no longer produced, and maybe that truck is in a museum, or more likely, stuck away in some shed.It‚Äôs been forty years now since ‚ÄòThe Third Wave‚Äô came out. Toffler enjoyed great success at the time, and at least some of his predictions have come to pass. But there are at least three major trends that he did not foresee. In their own way, each of these will have a major impact on our society ‚Äîcertainly big enough to seriously dent the optimistic tone of ‚ÄòThe Third Wave‚Äô. Futurism is a worthwhile subject. It‚Äôs a good idea to have some sense of where society will go. But keep a relatively open, skeptical mind. Your futurist author may be blind in some areas of deep thought ‚Äî or even basic science.WRITTEN BY"
156,How to Tell When It‚Äôs Time to End a Relationship,https://medium.com/fearless-she-wrote/how-to-tell-when-its-time-to-end-a-relationship-da9e47cc9f17?source=extreme_main_feed---------159-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"My
first marriage ended dramatically. I kissed my ex-husband goodbye in the morning and as soon as his car was out of sight, I started packing. I took my clothes out of the closet and laid them, still on hangers, in the back of my car. I threw drawers full of underwear, socks, and t-shirts in the floorboards. I worked quickly, fearing that he would return home before I could leave. Finally, I placed my cat Samantha in her carrier and locked the kitchen door behind me, never to return.I managed to get away undetected. My ex didn‚Äôt realize I was gone until he came home from work, and by then I had already taken out a restraining order against him and was hiding out in a women‚Äôs shelter where I would stay until our court date a week later.After my day in court, I filed for divorce and promptly moved out of state. By the time our divorce was final, I had a new life, new friends, a new apartment, and a renewed sense of hope for my future ‚Äî something I had lost over the six years of our marriage.In preparation for my grand escape, I spent the last month of our married life slipping our wedding china and my personal items into a storage unit. Piece by piece, household appliances, linens, and pictures diminished by half without him ever noticing. I guess he also never noticed that my love for him had diminished by far more than half by the time I initiated my plan.The day I locked that door behind me, there was nothing but anger and hatred left in my heart for him. I had stayed far too long at the dance and because I had not been able to cut ties earlier, what was once merely dysfunctional had become a dangerous and tricky situation. Stealth became a necessary component of my exit strategy. My ex-husband was emotionally, mentally, physically, and sexually abusive. He would have never just let me walk away.During our six-year marriage, I had drawn many lines in the sand, and he had proceeded to cross every single one. Just before our first anniversary, I found out he had been cheating on me. He was riding around town with various women while I worked nights at a grocery store. The news was delivered to me by a co-worker and friend. When I confronted him, he didn‚Äôt deny it but instead changed his story little by little so that all he was really guilty of was kissing another woman. He said this as if that should have made me feel better.After all, he said, I was never around and he was lonely. I was too busy getting a college degree by day (something he resented) and paying half of our household bills by night. Somehow, it was all my fault.I was so stubborn that I insisted that we go on the weekend trip we had planned to celebrate our anniversary. We spent a miserable weekend not having sex in a hotel with a mirror on the ceiling. I sat in the hot tub alone wishing I was old enough to buy an alcoholic drink.I stayed until my hatred of him made leaving the kindest thing I could do for either of us.I should have left when he crossed that first line but I didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt leave when he cussed me out the first time. I didn‚Äôt leave the first time he pushed me into a wall during a fight. I didn‚Äôt leave when he spent money calling sex lines and had his mother lie to me about it.I didn‚Äôt leave when he grabbed me by the hair and knocked my head into the floor. I didn‚Äôt leave until I hired a private investigator and found out that he had been telling me an elaborate lie, making me believe that people were following me and spying on me through hidden cameras behind the mirrors in our apartment (yes, this was some crazy shit, but I was so brainwashed by that time, I had no idea what was real and what wasn‚Äôt).I couldn‚Äôt give up that easy. I was so ashamed of failing at my marriage that I allowed my dignity to be stripped away one crossed line at a time. I kept at it for five years past that first horrible anniversary, until I lost count of all the ways he had betrayed me.I stayed until my hatred of him made leaving the kindest thing I could do for either of us. And when I left, I didn‚Äôt look back. I was done. It was relatively easy to be done with him. We had no children, we had few possessions. I was only twenty-four with many years still ahead of me to find someone better. Someone worthy of my love and devotion.Not every relationship is as blatantly toxic as my first marriage. There isn‚Äôt always a clear line that has been crossed. Sometimes there is just gradual chipping away of love by one thoughtless action after another until one day you wake up and realize that you don‚Äôt care. You don‚Äôt hate them. You wish them no harm. It‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt care if they come home or not.Then what? How do you leave a completely mediocre relationship when staying makes more practical sense?I‚Äôve thought about this a lot. I have a tendency to want to make things perfect. I want to be a better person and I want others to want to be better people too. It is hard for me to admit defeat. It is hard for me to accept failure. And because of this, I find it hard to know when enough is enough. Especially when my decisions negatively affect other people.But with age comes experience and with experience comes wisdom (if you‚Äôre lucky). I‚Äôve finally come to realize that you don‚Äôt have to make excuses for your decision and you don‚Äôt have to let a situation become completely toxic before you give yourself permission to end it.In my experience, there are a few clear signs that a relationship is not worth your time or effort.

In 2018, it was reported that Americans spent on average 97 hours a year in traffic congestion, costing the economy over $80 billion (INRIX). Despite the rise of alternate transportation methods such as publicly funded transit networks, major cities including Chicago and Atlanta have seen traffic get worse year over year.It is crazy to think that up to this point, solutions for the transit crisis have been limited to subway systems, passenger trains, or bike lanes. How can we expect exceptional change with such mediocre and uninspiring solutions?In California, a massively expensive $77 billion high speed rail (HSR) project is underway with the goal of being the future of effective transportation. One thing for sure is that it won‚Äôt be the near future‚Ä¶ with completion expected to be longer than a decade. On top of the hefty price tag and marathon to completion, the HSR is merely an incremental improvement to the preexisting rail system and won‚Äôt likely lead to unprecedented change.To combat the lack of innovation in regional transit options, Elon Musk has proposed an alternative named Hyperloop Alpha, as the future of transportation. How much can it truly help? Let's find out.Hyperloop is a concept in which pods travel though a low pressure tube at subsonic speeds (slightly slower than sound), mitigating friction and air resistance to increase speed and efficiency.Musk has proposed this system as an alternative to the San Francisco ‚Äî Los Angeles HSR, and can travel at proposed speeds of up to 760mph (compared to 220mph for HSR). Hyperloop‚Äôs maximum efficiency threshold is roughly 500 miles, at which air would be a faster alternative past that range. Estimates project an annual capacity of around 7.5 million passengers, with a ticket price of $20 per passenger.The best part, the price tag for the project is a mere $6 billion. Less than 10% the cost of the HSR project.The cost of the Hyperloop system contains two key facets: capsule construction and tube construction.The 40 capsules that are expected for the LA-SF project are projected to cost a total of $54 million. The pods consist of three technical components, including a compressor, batteries, and suspension, that all drive up the price.Contained in a steel tube, the compressor consumes air that is ahead of the moving capsule, and redirects it to the suspension where the air creates a cushion that allows the vehicle to levitate.On the other side, totalling roughly $5.5 billion, the tube component of Hyperloop is the greatest cost driver of the project.Due to the scale of this project, the size is reflected in the price tag. Namely, the 25,000 concrete ‚Äúpylons‚Äù that support the tube are projected to cost a total of $2.5 billion. Other notable costs include $650 million for the tube, $600 million for tunnels, and around $1 billion for land acquisition.When compared to HSR, Hyperloop is projected to be less than a tenth of the cost. How could it be that such a new technology is an entire order of magnitude cheaper than the status quo?The answer: land efficiency and prefabricated construction.Land prices are a large contributor to the discrepancy between HSR and Hyperloop costs. HSR demands a continuous strip of tracks, which consumes significant land, and may also act as a barrier that could literally divide property that people own. These two factors combined equate to a steep land price for HSR.Conversely, the Hyperloop tunnel does not run on the ground, but rather on pylons that are 100ft apart. Not only do these pylons have a very small footprint that demand less land, but they only cause a minor inconvenience for land owners and can easy be worked around.Looking at construction processes, less onsite construction generally equates to a cheaper project. This concept is leveraged in the Hyperloop project, as all the infrastructure components are prefabricated offsite and simply need to be placed and installed onsite. Namely, the 25000 pylons are all mass produced offsite, maximizing economies of scale, and are brought to the site already prepared for installation. All that needs to be done onsite is to install them in predetermined locations.HSR takes the opposite approach, in which the majority of construction occurs onsite. Despite having some components such as the rails or the rail bases being produced offsite, the fabrication and construction occurs almost entirely onsite. This increases the amount of labour required and timelines, both contributing to increased costs.Originally considered an afterthought to the passenger Hyperloop concept, the idea of transporting freight has begun to grow in popularity. As a proof of concept for the unproven Hyperloop idea, the cargo option would pose less risk to potential passengers, and could act as a steppingstone for the integration of a passenger Hyperloop. It also has the potential to get cargo off the road networks, improving traffic flows.Hyperloop would be competing against the four traditional cargo transportation mediums: air, train, truck, and sea. However, due to the nature of Hyperloop, it would be unlikely that it could substantially disrupt any of these markets.Despite the interesting prospect of a freight Hyperloop system, it seems unlikely to hold any significance in the market.Hyperloop is a step in the right direction when it comes to clean transportation. Running entirely on solar power, Hyperloop creates zero emissions while in use.Over $200 million of solar panels would be required and would be placed along the top of the tube. The energy would then be conveniently stored in batteries in the capsules for easy access.Unlike many places around the globe, California is fortunate enough to have a climate that supports viable solar power. However, it is unlikely that Hyperloop could be powered entirely by integrated solar in many other areas.To solve this problem, either more money would need to be spent on external solar panels; otherwise, Hyperloop would need to tap into the local electricity system that is likely powered by fossil fuels.When it comes to the future of transportation, Elon Musk has the right approach. With all of his transportation ventures, he identifies a problem with the status quo, brings the cost down an unprecedented amount, and also improves on the existing technology in the process. The success of this process has been proven with SpaceX, Tesla, and The Boring Company. The same goes for Hyperloop.However, let‚Äôs really think about it. What problem does Hyperloop really solve? Certainly not rush hour congestion. There is simply a lack of versatile uses for the system.By connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco via Hyperloop, perhaps there will be more travel between the two cities, but it‚Äôs not like people are frequently taking that six hour drive in the first place.In fact, I see no reason why there is value in having a HSR system in place either. The resources are being put in the WRONG places. Neither solution actually tackles the REAL PROBLEM of rush hour congestion. The only problem Hyperloop solves is that it‚Äôs better than HSR for an issue that is practically irrelevant.Here‚Äôs how I see it. The innovation put into Hyperloop is the spark needed to trail-blaze a new transportation medium, but I don‚Äôt think the effort is being put into the right areas.Moving forward, I do see Hyperloop becoming one of many pillars in a revolutionized transit network, but it is far from the saving grace we currently need. For connecting cities to one another, Hyperloop is the solution, but in terms of commuter traffic, there is not much of a future for this system.Perhaps this is all part of Elon Musk‚Äôs secret master transportation plan: Tesla is for local endeavours, Hyperloop is for regional connections, and SpaceX handles international and interplanetary travel.One piece in the overall puzzle of the future of transportation, Hyperloop only fits in once there is a transit network that is able to compliment it. Maybe once Musk gets his vision up and running, Hyperloop will find its place. Hyperloop is by no means be a fad, but only time can tell when it may become the future.WRITTEN BY"
158,The 3 Simple Reasons Why You‚Äôre Crushworthy Yet Still Single,https://medium.com/mind-cafe/the-3-simple-reasons-why-youre-crushworthy-yet-still-single-8f1f7ded681b?source=extreme_main_feed---------161-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"Another guy caught my eye that night. But David, unaware, ambled over to us (to talk to me, as I‚Äôd later find out). His sparkly humour and fantastic dance moves caught our attention. He even did the splits that warm fall night.The following weekend, I invited David to a friend‚Äôs house party. The other guy who‚Äôd caught my attention was there too. Not awkward at all.At the party, David made sure to enthusiastically compliment my backless blouse. Even though I‚Äôd caught the hint, I still wasn‚Äôt sure about him. But he was funny, intelligent, and cute, so I started dating him. And the other guy too.I eventually chose the other guy. But although I‚Äôd lost all romantic interest, David and I forged a friendship.Our conversations challenged my opinions. Talking to him made me interrogate how I viewed the world and my self-identity in an unprecedented way.Unbeknownst to me, David‚Äôs feelings morphed from normal romantic interest in me to a super crush. Or crushing on a version of me, perhaps.One late boozy night several months after the other guy and I had broken up, I kissed David. Whether it was the right decision or not, I‚Äôll never know. But I don‚Äôt regret it.The reason why crushes feel so intense is that the person with the crush craves deep intimacy with their object. It‚Äôs the kind of closeness that is difficult (but not impossible) to come by in friendship.Imagining that intimacy is euphoric. But with true intimacy, you get to see the best and worst in someone. And after we got into a relationship, David saw me at my worst.Within a few months of dating, his high regard for me vanished. Why?The devil is in the details. But the super crush he developed during our ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù was part of why our relationship later fell apart.Being the object of many people‚Äôs crushes is a position our society deems enviable. You receive a lot of attention with little effort. But there are three serious disadvantages of being crushworthy (I hate this word).Let‚Äôs talk about what a crush is and who‚Äôs at risk for being the object of several crushes.A crush is an intense infatuation, sometimes fleeting, with a person who is often deemed unattainable or inappropriate.In contrast, a person with a healthy romantic interest differs in the following ways:When you‚Äôre the object of a crush, you‚Äôre reduced to just that ‚Äî an object. What this person projects onto you is out of your control.The one with the crush thinks that they want to get to know the real you. But by withholding their true romantic desire, they create an awkward, fake friendship.Spending time with someone with a crush on you (assuming you‚Äôre perceptive enough to suspect it) is like that cloudy summer afternoon when the air is pregnant with the threat of an imminent downpour ready to drown everything.With this unspoken tension hovering over you two, your crush can‚Äôt get to know you in a meaningful way.Like many of us, I‚Äôve felt misunderstood for most of my life, for reasons that are my fault and also have nothing to do with me.I‚Äôm a nerd. Not a fake pop culture nerd that‚Äôs memorized GoT or romantic comedy trivia, but the kind that got picked on in school, loves science and math, and pontificates about the universe, death, and other random topics for fun.I used to be shy, and I‚Äôm currently a socially anxious introvert, so I don‚Äôt show the full spectrum of my personality to people I don‚Äôt trust. (To be clear, I‚Äôve got all sorts of conventionally good qualities going for me.)But I‚Äôm not perfect. And I‚Äôm certainly no supermodel. For self-identified weirdos whom some people happen to find attractive, the outside doesn‚Äôt quite match up with what‚Äôs going on inside.Add one of the mystery traits explained below and bam- you‚Äôre the object of a crush. And you‚Äôre destined to be misunderstood.The people that ultimately connect with you are those that dig past the superficial to embrace the dark, weird parts of you. And they‚Äôll stick by you at the worst moments in your life.If you find yourself repeatedly becoming the object of an unhealthy crush, there are, perhaps, three reasons why this might be the case ‚Äî and within them, three major disadvantages.The mystery factor is what separates the crushworthy from merely attractive people. You‚Äôre conveying at least one (but not necessarily all) of the following traits:Whether it‚Äôs underlying shyness, aloofness, asexuality, or introversion, this mystery factor makes the person with the crush conclude you‚Äôre ‚Äúout of their league.‚ÄùThey react in 2 ways:The person crushing on you doesn‚Äôt know you, even if they‚Äôre your colleague or friend. And forget about those who don‚Äôt have an actual connection to you. They don‚Äôt know you from a magazine cover.This is the paradox that turns a crush into a trap for both parties. They want to get to know the real you, but their fear of rejection and/or their inability to see your imperfections keeps you both in limbo.Their overwhelming feelings superimpose positive attributes where there are none, or even worse, where there are flaws. This trap can be overcome. A crush that is finally revealed can morph into a vulnerable, honest relationship.But how honest is a relationship when your ex is disappointed with who you turned out to be?Recently, I was talking to a close friend who had a crush on me ages ago. We were friends for 10 years before he told me how he felt, and now that it‚Äôs been several years since the reveal (we dated briefly, it didn‚Äôt work out), he shared a new perspective.He was too enamored with who he thought I was to see the dark, quirky parts of me. He couldn‚Äôt see the forest through the trees.Perhaps I held back a bit, not wanting to encourage feelings I didn‚Äôt reciprocate (until I was ready to try a romantic relationship). But we were the same before and after he confessed.What changed was our level of intimacy. Now we were free to talk about anything without having to subconsciously avoid his hidden feelings.If you date someone who has a massive crush on you, it‚Äôs important to spell out upfront ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with you.‚ÄùIt‚Äôll give you the best shot to determine whether you two are compatible based on core values, not based on what they‚Äôve imagined your virtues to be.You might think a person who has many people developing crushes on them has an easier time finding a partner.Indeed, finding short-term relationships and even falling in love is probably easier than it is for others.Multiple people having crushes on you doesn‚Äôt keep you single (although it can make being single more fun). But being crushworthy also doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll find a life partner.If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre a sucker for kindness, respect, and reverence.In the full heat of that attention, you can lose the ability to distinguish who is accepting your flaws from who is too starry-eyed to integrate your imperfections into their distorted reality.When coupled with chemistry and common interests, attention gets mistaken for compatibility ‚Äî the true key to a lasting partnership.But now you‚Äôre in love. When the crush bearer wakes up to the reality of your human imperfections, your sky-high romance is likely to collapse.If you‚Äôre tired of being the person people imprint their fantasy of an ideal partner upon, you‚Äôre not alone.What I want most from this life is to feel seen and heard as plain, old me. I‚Äôm lucky to experience that in bite-sized, precious moments.It‚Äôs difficult to see that imagined ideal reflected in someone‚Äôs eyes. You can‚Äôt help but wonder when they‚Äôll finally realize you‚Äôre not the flawless god/goddess they‚Äôre dreaming you to be.A perfect version of you doesn‚Äôt exist. Learn to accept and embrace that. And hopefully, the next person with a crush on you will too.Liked this story?

159,4 Exercises That Can Help You Simplify Your Life,https://medium.com/personal-growth/simplify-your-life-with-these-4-exercises-5c57808f7b84?source=extreme_main_feed---------162-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"‚ÄúGo into your closet. Take all of your shirts and hang them so they‚Äôre all facing the same direction. When you‚Äôre done wearing one, hang it up so it‚Äôs facing the other direction so you have a ‚Äòworn‚Äô camp and an ‚Äòunworn‚Äô camp. After 90 days, grab all of your unworn shirts, and give them to someone who will wear them.‚ÄùThree years ago, my mom told me about the exercise above. When it comes to simplifying my closet it‚Äôs been a godsend. Every single piece of clothing I have serves a purpose. After some time, if I discover that something isn‚Äôt being of use, I get rid of it.I‚Äôve reached that stage in my life where I want my life as clean as my closet. I want my life to be lightweight. My goal is simple: be surrounded by people that fuel me and spend my time on activities that light me up.The 4 exercises below have helped with this. When life gets complicated I turn to them as a guide. They remind me to act in-line with the person I want to be while providing clarity regarding the actions I need to take to keep moving in the right direction.According to legendary investor Warren Buffett, one of the best decisions we can make is to mirror the qualities we admire in others while doing away with the qualities that we don‚Äôt.A very simple way to accomplish this is by taking out a piece of paper and creating an ‚Äúadmirable‚Äù list and an ‚Äúunadmirable‚Äù list.Start by thinking about your closest friends and take a moment to identify the one quality in each of them that you respect the most. It could be that you look up to generous people who give for the sake of giving and don‚Äôt keep score. Or maybe you respect optimistic people or you look up to brave people who have the courage to be themselves.Once you get all of the positive traits you admire in others down on paper, flip the script and get clear on the qualities that you do not admire in others. It could be that dishonest people turn you off. Or maybe it‚Äôs someone who thinks they are above others or a person who doesn‚Äôt walk their talk.This exercise may sound overly simple, but when it comes to getting clear on your values it‚Äôs deadly effective. None of us are born with any of these positive and negative traits. Each and every one of us can work to improve upon the qualities we admire in others while being more conscious of the actions we don‚Äôt.A year ago, my friend Niklas G√∂ke told me about this exercise. Since then, not a day has gone by when I haven‚Äôt thought about it. In short, at the beginning of each year, Nik chooses a theme for the year that serves as his guide.For 2020, Nik‚Äôs one-word theme is ‚ÄúBalance.‚Äù Over the last few years, he‚Äôs been focused primarily on his career. He has reached the decision that now is the time to lower the burner in that area while raising the heat in other aspects of his life. This year he will make more time for family, friends, romance, and health. Opening up his computer and seeing the word ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù every day on his screensaver helps him to not only remember this, but act upon it.My one-word for this year is ‚ÄúEnjoy.‚Äù Last year I was presented with some amazing opportunities. Offers I never thought I was capable of getting. However, I became blinded and without realizing it I began to risk the things I love in order to get things I‚Äôm not sure I even want.I don‚Äôt want to make that same mistake again. My goal this year is to better appreciate what I have. So this year I‚Äôm pulling up the brakes. Every time something gets thrown at me I say the word ‚ÄúEnjoy‚Äù to myself and it triggers a set of questions: Does this opportunity represent my own definition of fun? Most importantly ‚Äî Will this decision take away from the time that I should be spending with my number one priority: my wife and kids.Reminding myself of my one-word theme ignites a gut reaction. The older I get the more I am beginning to trust that response and it has saved me countless hours of internal debate.When it comes to building self-awareness, pattern recognition is the name of the game. One of the best ways to achieve this is by journaling about not only our day-to-day actions but also our daily interactions. Over time, patterns will come to light regarding both the things and people that fuel you, and the things and people that don‚Äôt.An easy way to get started with this is by keeping a daily ‚Äúlove-hate‚Äù list. Simply take a moment towards the end of each day to jot down everything and everyone that brings light into your life and everything and everyone that stamps it out.According to leadership expert Conor Neill, more times than not it‚Äôs the little things that detract us from staying on track. So when making this list, dig deep. Identify the food that fuels you and also those which slow you down. Get clear on the conversations and individuals that lift you up, while taking note of those which bring you down.Like a lot of people, I used to wake up each day and ask myself what I needed to do. Today, however, I also see tremendous value in reminding myself of what I shouldn‚Äôt do. Keeping a ‚Äúlove-hate‚Äù list helps with this.Like my mom‚Äôs suggestion for my closet, the 3 exercises above can help us to speed up our decision-making process. But what happens when we are faced with situations where the answers aren‚Äôt as black and white?This is where the power of establishing a group of trusted friends to act as your advisors can seriously come in handy.Once a month, 4 of my friends and I get together on a call where each of us brings to the table a problem or question we are facing. Prior to the call, we let the other members know the background of the situation so when we get together we are focused primarily on solutions.The group of people you work with doesn‚Äôt have to be your closest friends. But trust is essential. The goal is to get the right feedback even if it hurts.Gaining the perspective of straight-shooters on a regular basis has been huge for me. However, one benefit I didn‚Äôt see coming is that when I have a problem, instead of pining over it, I tuck it away knowing that in a few days I‚Äôll be speaking to the right people about this problem. This has freed up a ton of headspace. It has helped me to be fully present with my friends and family even while I‚Äôm in the process of making a tough decision.Like I said above, I‚Äôve reached the stage in my life where I want to be lightweight. I want to be clear in my direction and decisive in my actions.When it comes to achieving this, the 4 exercises have helped tremendously. The beauty of each of them is that they don‚Äôt take that long or involve a lot of heavy thought.Stuck in a position that tests your values? Remind yourself of the traits that you admire in others and follow suit.Faced with a new opportunity? Remind yourself of your one-word theme and ask yourself if now is indeed the best time to ensure your actions are in-line with your commitments.Want to get a better idea of where and with whom you should be spending your time? Take 5 minutes a day to update your ‚Äúlove-hate‚Äù list and pay attention to the patterns that arise.Still unsure of what you should do? Turn to your advisors for guidance to see if their suggestions match your feelings.And don‚Äôt forget, if your closet is getting too full ‚Äî it may be time to clean it out.Thanks for reading. If you are active on Linkedin, feel free to say hi here.WRITTEN BY"
160,5 Habits of Happy Brains,https://medium.com/mind-cafe/6-habits-of-happy-brains-e85d2e961d51?source=extreme_main_feed---------163-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"Happiness is work in progress but everyone‚Äôs process is different. The good news is that every day presents an opportunity to try something that can make you happier.Many people blame their circumstances, situations out of their control or other people for their own unhappiness.But the truth is that our happiness is our own responsibility. It‚Äôs like that Eleanor Roosevelt quote: ‚ÄúNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.‚Äù No one can take away your happiness without your consent.Your happiness is an everyday process. You can do more of what makes you happy every day to fully experience it. Every day, you have the opportunity to control your mood. You can learn how to be happy and stay happy.Dan Millman, author and lecturer in the personal development field explains, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always believed that a life of quality, enjoyment, and wisdom were my human birthright and would be automatically bestowed upon me as time passed. I never suspected that I would have to learn how to live ‚Äî that there were specific disciplines and ways of seeing the world I had to master before I could awaken to a simple, happy, uncomplicated life.‚ÄùWildly happy people have embraced certain habits that set them apart from the rest ‚Äî they have happy habits. Happy people do more of what reinforces their state of happiness. Elements of the happiness process involve specific routines, activities, and choices. And the more you practice them, the more your brain rewires itself to adjust to the new happiness habits.When you feel good, your brain is releasing dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, or endorphin ‚Äî the quartet of chemicals responsible for your happiness.We want more of these great feelings because our brains are designed to seek them. Here are a few things that any of us ‚Äî at any stage of life ‚Äî can start doing to feel the effects of more happiness in our lives.Have you ever lost yourself in something, so much so that you lost track of time? Being consumed by a task or activity, while it can be rare for most people, is a state of being called Flow.It‚Äôs an optimal experience that can make you happy. From hiking to gardening, reading or even watching a particularly engrossing movie or TV show, flow basically describes the inherent sense of satisfaction.In his best-selling book, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, credited with popularizing the flow state with his research in the 1980s and 90‚Äôs describes flow as ‚Äúa state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.‚ÄùDuring such spells, we experience the paradoxical sensation of time both having stood still internally in ‚Äòour world‚Äô.Flow can be achieved in just about any activity that requires prolonged mental effort and in which our participation is enjoyed, literally, for the sake of it.To experience happiness without pursuing it, embrace daily happy habits. When your brain builds expectations about what will make you happy, it begins to rewire itself to seek more happy habits. If you decide to be happy, your brain will find things to be happy about.Research shows, for example, that frequency of small, positive experiences has a greater impact on our life satisfaction than a few epic events of achievements. People who are grateful feel better about themselves and their lives, and they also show higher levels of happiness.Expressing gratitude helps people feel good about themselves ‚Äî which improves their self-esteem. Practising gratitude can also make lasting changes in your brains.‚ÄúPeople who intentionally cultivate gratitude show greater neural sensitivity in the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region associated with learning, rational thinking and decision making,‚Äù says Ellie Cobb, PhD, a holistic psychologist and the director of Psychology for Thankful, a social enterprise and lifestyle brand focused on gratitude.When practised in our lives authentically, gratitude can help us feel more grounded, humble, and connected to the world around you. It draws people to us. Practised over time, you won‚Äôt even have to think about it, and you‚Äôll see the effects on your perspective in life.Good social relationships are the most consistent predictor of a happy life.Heaps of research suggest that social connections make people happier. Satisfying relationships not only make people happy, but they also associated with better health and even longer life.Relationships are connected to some of our strongest emotions. When they are positive we feel happiness, contentment and calm. When relationships bring out the worst in us or they are non-existent, we feel anxious, depressed, and lonely.A Harvard study on adult development (considered to be the most extended study, which started in 1938, tracked the lives of 724 men for 75 years) found that good relationships are the key factors that matter the most for long-lasting happiness.‚ÄúThe lesson that came from tens of thousands of pages of that research was that good relationships keep us happier and healthier,‚Äù says Dr Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist, and director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development.It‚Äôs extremely hard to be happy when you spend most of your time worrying about the past or living in fear of the future.Life unfolding, but we are too occupied to notice. We are too busy worried about the past and the future that we let the present slip away, allowing time to rush past unobserved and unseized.We squander to our precious seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years as we worry about the future and ruminate about what‚Äôs past.You can only live one moment at a time, choose to live in the moment. ‚ÄúLiving in the moment ‚Äî also called mindfulness ‚Äî is a state of active, open, intentional attention on the present,‚Äù writes Jay Dixit of Psychology Today.Lean into the little joys in life when you find them. The simple things are the most extraordinary things that sometimes makes life easy to manage.Don‚Äôt think too much about ‚Äúenjoying‚Äù life. The moment you jump to ‚Äúthinking mode‚Äù, and seek things to make your life fulfilling, the fullness of life will become a mirage.Planning adventure no matter how small can increase your happiness for days and weeks leading up to a trip through delayed gratification.People are naturally excited, appreciative, less stressed, and more present when they are adventurous.You can turn everyday life into an adventure ‚Äî every day can be extraordinary. You can even be adventurous without leaving your home ‚Äî take a different route to work, read about other things beyond your usual topics.Learn a new skill that can make you indispensable in the future, and enjoy the excitement of the new experience. F–ær nature l–æv–µr—ï, adventure is an opportunity to appreciate amazing landscapes.A study has found that spending two hours per week soaking up nature ‚Äî be it woodland, park or beach ‚Äî gives a positive boost to health and wellbeing, both mentally and physically.To experience true happiness in the overlooked details, you must be willing to be surprised, or wrong in your assumptions.Wake up each day ready to take those ‚Äúsmall steps‚Äù toward your happiness ‚Äî take good actions, no matter how small to boost your mood. Every little experience counts.WRITTEN BY"
161,When You Eat Is More Important Than What You Eat,https://elemental.medium.com/when-you-eat-is-more-important-than-what-you-eat-ff81c3f33770?source=extreme_main_feed---------164-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"he latest science around fasting is catching a lot of attention. Studies show time-restricted eating (TRE) increases lifespan and decreases the incidence of major diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease.TRE means consuming all your calories ‚Äî whether from food or drink ‚Äî within a specific time frame each day, called the eating window.It turns out you can greatly impact your health just by limiting your daily eating window. The quality of your diet still matters, of course, but the success of TRE lends credence to the idea that when you eat is even more important than what you eat.Every time you eat ‚Äî even just a bite of food ‚Äî it triggers a process of digestion, absorption, and metabolism that takes hours to complete. And when your body is dedicated to processing food, it can‚Äôt also repair and restore.Dr. Satchin Panda is arguably the world‚Äôs top expert on TRE. Panda is a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and author of the book The Circadian Code. He has also analyzed the daily eating, sleeping, and activity patterns of thousands of people as part of his ongoing research.In his book, Panda says setting an eating window and sticking to it is one of the most important things you can do for health and longevity. This is because every time you eat ‚Äî even just a bite of food ‚Äî it triggers a process of digestion, absorption, and metabolism that takes hours to complete. And when your body is dedicated to processing food, it can‚Äôt also repair and restore.You need to go at least 12 hours without consuming calories for the cycle to qualify as TRE. (For example, an overnight fast from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.) But it appears as though the shorter the eating window (and the longer the fasting window), the better.‚ÄúWhile the science at 12 hours is impressive, lowering your window to as few as eight hours is significantly advantageous,‚Äù explains Panda. ‚ÄúThis is because the health benefits that you get from eating within a 12-hour window double at 11 hours, and double again at 10, and so on, until you reach an eight-hour window.‚ÄùTRE isn‚Äôt a short-term fad diet ‚Äî it is a routine to follow for the rest of your life.Hugh Jackman‚Äôs famous ‚ÄúWolverine Diet‚Äù is an example of an eight-hour TRE. Recent research shows that going down to a six-hour eating window can be a worthy goal, but it can take a while to get to that point and might not be sustainable in the long run.Regardless of the duration of your eating window, what‚Äôs most important is that you remain consistent. TRE isn‚Äôt a short-term fad diet ‚Äî it is a routine to follow for the rest of your life. According to Panda, ‚ÄúIf you eat three times a week outside a 12-hour window, you are not adhering to TRE.‚Äù His data reveals that 50% of adults in the United States regularly eat for 15 hours or longer.It is much better to set an achievable schedule than to be overly restrictive from the get-go. Panda advises starting with a 12-hour TRE and working your way down over time.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt predict what 12-hour window you should start with,‚Äù says Panda. ‚ÄúSome people love breakfast foods and need them to jump-start their day. Others wait until noon and can more easily handle a shorter TRE. Only you can make that decision.‚ÄùWhat about breakfast being the most important meal of the day? ‚ÄúYour brain really doesn‚Äôt need breakfast to provide extra energy,‚Äù asserts Panda.However, he does point out there is an increased benefit to starting your window earlier in the day, primarily because you don‚Äôt want to eat too close to bedtime.‚ÄúEating late at night is by far the worst choice you can make,‚Äù says Panda. He advises giving yourself at least three hours between your last bite or sip and the time you go to sleep ‚Äî eating your last meal around 6 or 7 p.m. Your body needs that digestion time in order to have restorative sleep.‚ÄúSleep is when most of the cleanup of damaged cell proteins occurs,‚Äù says Panda. ‚ÄúWhen you get more sleep, your brain naturally has more time to repair and cleanse its waste.‚Äù This helps protect against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and other forms of dementia.That means no nightcap before bed, either. If you like to wind down with a glass of wine or a cocktail, Panda says a better habit is to have a drink before dinner, or during dinner, if it‚Äôs at least a couple hours before bed.For the best overall health results, Panda recommends following a balanced diet centered around fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. You don‚Äôt need to count calories on a TRE, but you still want to limit junk food. Panda‚Äôs common-sense advice includes staying away from soda, juice, breakfast cereals, energy/protein bars, processed foods, corn syrup/fructose/sucrose, fried food, and commercially processed nut butters.If you‚Äôre tracking your diet to match low-carb, sugar-free, paleo, vegan, Mediterranean, Blue Zones, Atkins, or Warrior Diet standards, you can let them go in TRE, according to Panda. You can eat whatever makes you feel best, as long as you confine it to a condensed period. If you‚Äôve had good results with any particular dietary style, feel free to stick with it and you‚Äôll likely further boost the benefits by combining it with a smaller eating window.Panda personally adheres to an 11-hour TRE. He eats his first meal of the day around 8 a.m. and finishes dinner by 7 p.m., which is several hours before his 10:30 p.m. bedtime. He acknowledges that not every day goes perfectly according to that schedule ‚Äî but he does his best to stick to the routine. Even if he winds up eating a later dinner, he still tries to give his stomach at least 12 to 13 hours rest before his next meal.As for me, I like an eight-hour TRE window from about 12 to 8 p.m. each day (commonly referred to as 16:8 intermittent fasting). I still consume black coffee and tea during my fasting window, which helps immeasurably.There is some debate about whether tea and black coffee are technically ‚Äúallowed.‚Äù Purists like Panda say anything you eat or drink apart from water breaks a fast. However, other experts say coffee or tea (without cream or sugar) is okay and may actually amplify the benefits of fasting.The takeaway message is clear: Time-restricted eating is a simple tool available to everyone ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt require any significant changes to what or how much you eat. The best reason to shorten your eating window? It may, in turn, prolong your life.WRITTEN BY"

Even as air travel has lost much of its former lustre, it‚Äôs a career that still maintains an air of glamour, thanks to the cute uniforms, free flights, and sense of adventure.And yet, as anyone who flies has probably observed, being in charge of making sure everything goes smoothly at 36,000 feet isn‚Äôt always easy. Or clean. Or even, to be honest, totally safe-feeling. How do we know? Well, we caught up with three former flight attendants to hear their wildest on-the-job tales. From a passenger who lit his hair on fire while smoking crack in the bathroom (seriously) to chance encounters with the rich and famous, these high-flying women have enough fodder to power a thousand cocktail party conversations. Perhaps that‚Äôs the real perk of the profession.‚ÄúAir Traffic Control cleared two planes to take off at the same time going down intersecting runways‚ÄùThe Time The Plane Almost Crashed‚ÄúWe are all human and make errors, and luckily this story has a positive ending,‚Äù prefaces Shannon Kontalonis, a former flight attendant who now works at the student travel organisation WorldStrides. ‚ÄúHowever, Air Traffic Control cleared two planes to take off at the same time going down intersecting runways. As we were barreling down the runway, our pilot all of a sudden slammed on the breaks and veered off course because the other plane was coming down the intersecting runway at the same time. As I said, luckily, the pilots realised the error and took corrective action to divert a horrible accident.‚Äù‚ÄúAll we heard was a loud bang‚ÄùThe Time The Plane Got Hit By Lightning‚ÄúWe were once hit by lightning while in-air,‚Äù recalls former flight attendant Brittany Cosenza. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot less destructive than you might think. All we heard was a loud bang. I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what had happened until the pilots called up to tell me.‚Äù‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to get life advice, obviously take it from Quincy Jones‚ÄùThe Celebrity Run-Ins‚ÄúI had Matthew McConaughey on my flight. He had his whole family with him, and I got to witness him disciplining his kids. That was a trip!‚Äù Cosenza says.Shawn Kathleen, a former flight attendant who runs the hilarious social media account Passenger Shaming (check it out on Instagram) remembers her own Hollywood run-in: ‚ÄúIt was Quincy Jones and he was just like the nicest celebrity. It was weird because it was a short flight so we didn‚Äôt do [drink] service ‚Ä¶ [But] I talked to him for almost 30 minutes and he was the loveliest, sweetest guy. Asking questions, he was nice to everybody. He was like giving me life advice. And I‚Äôm like, well, if I‚Äôm going to get life advice, obviously take it from Quincy Jones. Thank you! I remember after the flight was over, I was like, that is why that man is so successful, because he was just lovely.‚Äù‚ÄúI was panicked he lit a cigarette and threw it somewhere‚ÄùThe Guy Who Did Drugs And Lit His Hair On Fire‚ÄúWe had started our descent into the city, so we were like maybe 20 minutes out from the airport and a gentleman went into the front lavatory and caught his hair on fire while he was smoking crack cocaine,‚Äù explains Kathleen. ‚ÄúIt involved me, you know, running up to the front of the cabin because I saw the lights and [heard] the alarm. The cabin was pitch black because it was at night and I was like, oh God, fire on an airplane. Worst thing ever. So I grabbed the fire extinguisher, pull the pin. The captain‚Äôs calling me, so I‚Äôve got a phone to my ear. And this guy stumbles out. You get that burnt hair [smell]. And of course I didn‚Äôt know it was crack cocaine. That didn‚Äôt cross my mind, I was just panicked. I was panicked he lit a cigarette and threw it somewhere.‚ÄùThe funniest part? After lighting his own head on fire and getting caught smoking crack on an airplane (for which he was arrested), the passenger in question was most concerned about making his connecting flight. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of the inside jokes, you know, where something crazy like that happens and people are like, ‚Äòam I going to make my connection?‚Äô No.‚Äù‚ÄúThey will use that tray table as a changing table‚ÄùThe Nappy ThingBelieve it or not, all three of the one-time flight attendants we spoke to had the same answer when asked what the grossest thing people do in the air is: changing nappies. Sounds benign, but it‚Äôs not. ‚ÄúThey leave them on the floor. They put them in the seatback pockets. They do that a lot. They will use that tray table as a changing table. The one that we eat off of,‚Äù Kathleen says. ‚ÄúYou know, changing a shitty ‚Äî excuse my language ‚Äî nappy in an enclosed cabin where people are eating with recirculated air? Not cool.‚ÄùKathleen advises parents to instead ask airline staff where the changing table is, as most planes have one available in a bathroom. Meanwhile, Kontalonis also has some practical advice for flyers using the fold-out tables: ‚ÄúPlease people, use a napkin or a wipe to rest any food down on those things before you eat anything!‚Äù‚ÄúAnyone considering fulfilling their ‚Äòmile-high club‚Äô fantasies should think twice‚ÄùThe (Other) Gross StuffLest you think it‚Äôs only babies being gross with their bodily functions on planes, well, our former flight attendants would like to assure you it‚Äôs not. ‚ÄúPassengers would also cut their toenails, depositing them all over the floor!‚Äù Cosenza says.‚ÄúAnyone considering fulfilling their ‚Äòmile-high club‚Äô fantasies should think twice. The lavatory floors (and even walls!) are absolutely covered in filth and urine from guys who can‚Äôt seem to make it in the hole,‚Äù she continues.And no one understands all of this more than Kathleen, whose Passenger Shaming social media accounts are filled with viewer-submitted images of humans being vile on airplanes in various ways. ‚ÄúPeople essentially treat the airplane like a living room,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThey put their bare feet up on the arm rest. You know, you put your elbow back, you‚Äôre like, oh, excuse me. Oh wait, holy shit. That‚Äôs like, somebody‚Äôs nasty Fred Flintstone foot.‚Äù‚ÄúI like to think this has only encouraged her to follow her business instincts‚ÄùThe Mini MogulThankfully, it‚Äôs not all toenail clippings and lavatory fires. Kontalonis shares this sweet moment: ‚ÄúOn one of my flights, a sweet girl around the age of eight was making these little string friendship bracelets, I asked her how much she was selling them for, in a joking manner, however her entrepreneurial thinking kicked in and she told me they were $1 each if anyone on board wanted to buy one. I of course purchased one and during my next announcement I let other passengers know of our ‚Äòbusiness mogul‚Äô on board. By the end of the beverage service, the girl was beaming from ear to ear as she sold her entire supply. I like to think this has only encouraged her to follow her business instincts!‚ÄùOriginally published at https://refinery29.com.WRITTEN BY"

ar and conflict, and the threat of both, remain realities of daily life for people in much of the world. However, research indicates that that global deaths from war and related violence have long been in decline. This is a trend that both historians and futurists alike point to when discussing how the human condition is improving. Much of this can be attributed to the changing nature of warfare itself. With advanced technology, modern global warfare is as much characterized by the threats of advanced weaponry and terrorism as it is by actual hu- man combat. But, as we look deeper into the changing nature of warfare, we see something else happening. Warfare ‚Äî and cyberwarfare ‚Äî is increasingly digital and autonomous, online, distributive, and subversive. While deaths decline, broader human impact rises. The theaters for war are changing, and the barriers for participation are dropping.The future of warfare will increasingly be influenced by AI. Many applications still remain theoretical, due to technological limitations and the ethical considerations which cast a shadow over the widespread adoption of these technologies. However, many other applications are already well in development, while some are already having an impact. Combat will be increasingly populated by specialized drones and robots that are either fully autonomous or operated remotely by human pilots. And, within this context, AI itself may soon decide who lives or dies. We may be fast-approaching a future characterized by what some might call ‚Äúalgorithmic warfare.‚Äù The US Army wants to build smart, cannon-fired missiles that will use AI to select their targets, out of reach of human oversight. The project is called Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munition (C-DAEM). Unlike laser-guided weapons, which utilize human operators, C-DAEM will find targets for itself. Currently, these types of robotic and autonomous applications are more easily deployed via air-based weapons systems, versus within what remains a a far more complex ground-based combat environment. We are also rapidly entering the era of unmanned naval warfare.The US is not the only country developing these types of smart missiles and bombs. Russia is at the forefront of the race to AI-guided missile technology; Israel is currently developing the Spice-250 bomb; China has developed lethal autonomous drones; and European firm MBDA has developed ‚Äúfire-and-forget‚Äù missile systems called Meteors to be deployed by several countries‚Äô armed forces. Many protesters demand that such weapons be banned. These include the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a coalition of NGOs that want use of force controlled solely by humans. But, going beyond conventional warfare, there is perhaps no combat theater more directly influenced by AI today than cyberwarfare. The last three years have signaled a rise in automated bot attacks, including the first AI-powered cyberattack, which was detected in India in late 2017.‚ÄúMachine behavior‚Äù is a new field of scientific inquiry designed to study how artificial agents interact ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù with humans, their environments, and each other. It was initiated by Iyad Rahwan, who directs the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development ‚Äî with the help of colleagues from robotics, computer science, sociology, cognitive psychology, evolutionary biology, AI, anthropology, and economics. The nascent field has not been in existence long enough to collect the kind of longitudinal data necessary to make concrete conclusions yet. But it is well on its way, and just in time, as autonomous systems are impacting more aspects of our lives than ever before, and the ‚Äúbehavioral‚Äù outcomes of these systems are proving hard to forecast by simply examining the underlying code or technological engineering. It will be important to see how advancements in this nascent field will influence the future of AI-driven warfare.One of the ways in which warfare has changed most profoundly has been in the systematic blurring of human accountability and personal risk. If someone is remotely operating a drone, versus flying the plane in combat, how might their calculations of risk or ethical decision-making change? If something malfunctions with a partially or fully automated technology, who bears the responsibility? The rules of engagement change dramatically.Traditional war is expensive, politically unpopular, risky, and rarely effective. But competition over land and limited resources, and the desire for security, global influence, and economic dominance, haven‚Äôt diminished; if anything, they continue to rise. States have been moving to more subversive, online forms of warfare in pursuit of objectives, via mainstream social media and sharp power tactics, manipulation of digital systems and smart architecture, and the dark web. ISIS was the first terrorist group to hold both physical and digital territory, and it served as a harbinger of things to come. Future prominent terrorist groups may be likelier to have extensive digital operations than control physical ground. ISIS operates as a pyramid consisting of four levels of digital fighters. And that is all part of its broader social media and disinformation strategy, designed to spread propaganda and recruit new members.The World Economic Forum ranks massive digital misinformation, ‚Äúdigital wildfires,‚Äù as one of the world‚Äôs greatest geopolitical risks. And DARPA has developed its Social Media in Strategic Communication program. According to a report by researchers at Oxford University, the number of countries engaging in social media manipulation more than doubled to 70 in the last two years. Foreign meddling operations have thus far largely been the purview of state actors and their proxies, but other actors will have similar capabilities in the near future as AI lowers the barriers to entry.As information warfare expert Brett Horvath shared with us, ‚ÄúThis creates an environment where instances of social and economic volatility are increasingly enticing openings for bad actors with an agenda. That could be a rival faction in an authoritarian regime, domestic or international economic interests, or a foreign nation-state. As volatility attracts speculators to financial markets, social instability may be a magnet for a range of bad actors, armed with weaponized technology and an incentive to make a dangerous situation worse.‚ÄùBut these efforts in engineered volatility may not be the most dangerous outcome. As Horvath goes on to say, ‚ÄúPerhaps one of the greatest risks is that neither the actors behind these efforts, nor independent researchers, have a scientifically reliable way to model the non-linear second- and third-order risks that result from constantly escalating influence operations. I worry that unless we move beyond simple detection and attribution of misinformation, and toward something that accurately models emergent risk, actors like Russia, China, and the US may not be able to understand the information warfare equivalent of ‚ÄòMutually Assured Destruction‚Äô before it‚Äôs too late.‚ÄùOne of the easiest ways for non- state actors to manipulate public opinion will be through the use of increasingly sophisticated ‚Äúdeepfakes‚Äù ‚Äî highly realistic and difficult-to-detect digital manipulations of audio or video.Researchers have long been moving toward a future where human soldiers with enhanced abilities (e.g., exoskeleton suits) operate more like real-life superheroes than they do as conventional soldiers. The Pentagon‚Äôs Skunk Works is creating technology to build the ‚Äúsuper soldier‚Äù of the future. This is part of DARPA‚Äôs new Squad X Core Technologies (SXCT) program, which could equip soldiers with unprecedented awareness, adaptability, and flexibility. And military robots inspired by various animals will soon work alongside South Korea‚Äôs human soldiers. South Korea‚Äôs Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) plans to incorporate ‚Äúbiomimetics‚Äù equipment into military operations by 2024US Big Tech: The US Pentagon has long been trying to establish supremacy in the race toward advanced, autonomous, and AI-driven defense capabilities. In order to do so, it enlists the help of the world‚Äôs leading technological minds, enabled by the tech industry‚Äôs ability to poach talent from the defense and intelligence world. One of the most well-publicized examples is Google‚Äôs Project Maven contract, which helps intelligence analysts identify military targets from video footage. The project was disbanded because Google employees protested the company‚Äôs involvement; it remains a harbinger and warning of both the capabilities unleashed by these types of public-private partnerships involving big tech, and the internal employee unrest triggered. In late 2019, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos provided a pessimistic outlook for the US if tech companies avoid working with the Pentagon. He, along with many others, believe that it is US big tech‚Äôs partnership with defense groups that is the more humane path: ‚ÄúWe are the good guys.‚Äù His comments came during a time when Amazon was competing with Microsoft for the Pentagon‚Äôs cloud-computing JEDI contract.Perhaps no tech firm is as intertwined with the US government defense function as Palantir. For years, Palantir has provided advanced, and controversial, data analytics and surveillance services to the US intelligence community and Department of Defense. This partnership is equal parts lucrative and secretive, and it is laden with myriad ethical considerations for how data is collected and leveraged.Global Private Sector Tech: The conversation around big tech‚Äôs role in warfare is rapidly becoming more important ‚Äî and complicated. But complications become even murkier as we watch this pattern play out around the world. Israeli spy tech is some of the best in the world, and has been used by at least 130 countries to invasively track and surveil external enemies and domestic activists. Companies like NSO Group, Verint Systems, Circles Technologies, Elbit Systems, and Fifth Dimension specialize in snooping on smartphones and laptops, infiltrating social media tools like WhatsApp and Facebook, and have sold systems to Bahrain, South Sudan, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Nigeria, Botswana, Mexico, Azerbaijan, India, and more. Israeli tech has also been used to disrupt elections.In China, tech companies and government have little barrier be- tween them. As Chinese private sector tech quickly catches up to US tech dominance (and in fact already leads in areas like drones, 5G cellular networks, and more), we can assume that technology is available and accessible to the government as well. To add further complication, Chinese tech companies may have collaborations with foreign firms. For example, many US tech companies have had ties to Chinese tech companies that have ties to Beijing.How will exports of warfare tech evolve with global political dynamics? Is every state actor as strong as the tech companies it can partner with and buy from? Small countries with limited military forces but deep pockets ‚Äî or access to deep pockets ‚Äî can be just as powerful and threatening as large ones. What are business, patriotism, and security in our new world? How do globalized business models and supply chains adapt to nationalist governments, and what are the implications?One of the most important considerations when examining the future of warfare is how these emerging autonomous and gamified combat technologies and cyberwarfare tactics will become less prohibitive and expensive, and more accessible, than conventional weapons. The barriers to entry will be far lower for third-party, rogue nation-state or non-state actors (e.g., guerrilla groups, terrorists, hackers, or other groups or individuals that sit outside of our known parameters of public sector, private sector, and multilateral entities). Individual hackers with insidious goals could theoretically do as much damage to large governments, institutions, and companies as any other actor. The future is one characterized by cyber-insecurity, in that no single technological system ‚Äî irrespective of how sophisticated ‚Äî can be fully safe- guarded from outside threats. That said, prominent ‚Äúhacktivist‚Äù activity, best epitomized by the notorious, decentralized, and global Anonymous hacker collective, has been on a steady decline over the last several years, due in large part to more sophisticated cybersecurity countermeasures and a fracturing of the group from within. Will security tactics be able to improve at pace with warfare tech?A recent drone attack in Saudi Arabia targeted Abqaiq, the world‚Äôs largest oil processing facility, and the Khuaru oil field, which produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. The Iran-backed Houthi group in Yemen claimed responsibility. Houthi rebels have used increasingly sophisticated drones for several recent attacks. In addition, Russian company Kalashnikov has developed a suicide drone that may revolutionize war by making sophisticated drone warfare technology widely and cheaply available.There is also an enforcement vacuum that helps create the fertile conditions that allow such rogue actors to thrive. In conflict zones around the world, 1.5 billion people live under the threat of violence. UN peacekeepers comprise the second-largest military force deployed abroad, after the US military. But they are often given few resources with which to achieve their objectives.The Future of Wargaming ‚ÄúTalent‚Äù: What will the future pipeline of wargaming talent be, from a human perspective? If war is being increasingly fought digitally, will it change who fights the wars? Will it mean more female soldiers? Older soldiers? Physically disabled soldiers? Will it allow smart military minds who are incapable of conventional physical fighting (e.g., amputees) to potentially return to the battlefield and still engage in ‚Äúcom- bat?‚Äù And what new skills will people have to learn? It is wholly conceivable that teenagers skilled in advanced videogaming (both gameplay and design) will become compelling candidates for recruitment. What would a draft look like in the future?The Future of Diplomacy: In a world where technology is blurring the lines between what is real and what is fake, what will diplomacy look like? It is already difficult to discern between authentic and forged images and videos of the world‚Äôs most prominent leaders, and such enabling technologies are still fairly rudimentary. What happens when it advances even further? Will formal diplomacy as we know it continue to morph into something that is enacted through various other technological platforms (e.g., Twitter)? Will we have to develop entirely new protocols to safeguard diplomatic communications? Trust has now become a luxury; how will we optimize it in the future?Peace in a New Decade: The most pragmatic justification for weaponizing all of the technologies contained herein will be their ability to make combat more efficient, inexpensive, and precise. Going beyond that, the future perception of these technologies by the public will be driven by one key metric: Will they make the world safer, and ultimately decrease the toll on human lives? But more questions remain. Will these technologies require fewer people to be employed in traditional military capacities? Who is ultimately responsible or liable for decisions that fully or semi-autonomous weapons make? If the center of control is taken away from humans themselves, does the impact of war become less personal, and thus more justifiable? We might see combat start to take on the features of a videogame. Conflict might also become more unpredictable, if it is increasingly enacted by rogue or third-party actors, through means like cyber-warfare, terrorism, or information warfare. How do we enable peace in a new decade? When we look at this trend in isolation, it is terrifying to imagine its escalation, and yet we know trends are rarely as simple as that. Counterreactions emerge as trends play out, impacting what occurs. The end of this story is not yet written. We can still actively shape it.Consider Explorations an open space for discussion. We welcome new perspectives ‚Äî especially those rarely heard, contradictory, relevant, and tangential ‚Äî and most of all, conversation and partnership to build the future we want, one that includes and empowers us all.Special thanks to Brett Horvath, information warfare expert and founder of Guardians.ai, for his contributions to this brief.WRITTEN BY"

This piece is part of weeklong series on how to battle distraction, co-edited by Eyal.know how distractions work from the inside. For over a decade, I‚Äôve helped tech companies build products to keep you clicking. In fact, I wrote the book on it. Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, which came out in 2014, was written to help companies build healthy habits in their customers, like regularly going to the gym and eating right. But in the process of researching the book, I found that some products drew some people in too much. Including me.I remember sitting with my daughter one afternoon doing activities from a book written to help daddies and daughters bond. One exercise consisted of asking each other, ‚ÄúIf you could have any superpower, what would it be?‚Äù Between the moment I asked the question and when my daughter could answer, I felt a buzz in my pocket. A work email diverted my attention.‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù she queried.‚ÄúJust a second,‚Äù I grunted. ‚ÄúI need to respond to one thing.‚Äù My eyes were glued to my phone, my fingers tapping away, writing a response.I wish I could tell you what she said in that moment, but I can‚Äôt. While she was telling me her dream superpower, I was busy staring at my phone. By the time I looked up, she had left the room.I‚Äôd blown a perfect daddy-daughter moment because I was distracted. That‚Äôs when I knew I needed to learn how to manage distraction. I wanted to get the best out of my tech gadgets, without letting the tech gadgets get the best of me.If you asked me what superpower I‚Äôd want, I know the answer: I want the power to be indistractable.bemoan the fact that technology is becoming more pervasive and persuasive, and complain that our devices are ‚Äúhijacking‚Äù our brains. On top of all that, we just can‚Äôt seem to disconnect from work.Hoping tech companies change these products or that your boss finally learns to respect your time may take longer than you‚Äôre willing to wait. Although distractions aren‚Äôt necessarily your fault, they are your responsibility. It‚Äôs time to equip yourself to manage your distractions.Let‚Äôs start with a definition of distraction. According to the American Psychological Association Dictionary of Psychology, distraction is ‚Äúthe process of interrupting attention‚Äù and ‚Äúa stimulus or task that draws attention away from the task of primary interest.‚Äù In other words, distractions draw us away from what we want to do, whether it‚Äôs to accomplish a task at home or work, enjoy time with a loved one, or do something for ourselves.If distraction becomes a habit, we may be unable to sustain the focus required for creativity in our professional and personal lives. Worse, if we‚Äôre constantly pulled away from friends and family by distractions, we miss out on cultivating the relationships we need for our psychological well-being.Digital distraction might manifest in looking at notifications that pop up on your phone ‚Äî even during conversations with family, friends, or colleagues, interrupting focused work to check email ‚Äî chatting with coworkers who pop by your desk when you intended to do focused work, or scrolling through your social media feeds when you planned to read a book.The opposite of ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù is ‚Äútraction.‚Äù Traction is any action that moves us towards what we really want. Tractions are actions, done with intent. Any action, such as working on a big project, getting enough sleep or physical exercise, eating healthy food, taking time to meditate or pray, or spending time with loved ones, are all forms of traction if they are done intentionally. Traction is doing what you say you will do.What prompts us to traction or distraction? All human behavior is cued by either external or internal triggers.External triggers are cues from our environment that tell us what to do next. That can mean dings and pings that prompt us to check our email, answer a text, or look at a news alert. Competition for our attention can come from a person as well, such as an interruption from a coworker. Even an object can be an external trigger: your television set seems to urge you to turn it on by its mere presence.Internal triggers are cues that come from within. When we‚Äôre hungry, we are cued to get something to eat; when we feel a chill, we put on a sweater. When we‚Äôre stressed or lonely, we might call a friend for support. Even the desire to feel pleasure is itself a state of uncomfortable craving. Internal triggers are negative feelings.Since all behavior is prompted by either external or internal triggers, then both the actions we intend to do (traction) as well as those that veer us off course (distraction), originate from the same two sources.Now we can draw a complete picture of what I call the ‚ÄúIndistractable Model‚Äù:In order to overcome distractions, you need to understand what drives your behaviors ‚Äî what prompts you to compulsively look at your phone or read one more email.The root cause of human behavior is the desire to escape discomfort. Even when we think we are seeking pleasure, we‚Äôre actually driven by the desire to free ourselves from the pain of wanting.The truth is, we overuse video games, social media, and our cell phones not just for the pleasure they provide, but because they free us from psychological discomfort.Distraction, then, is an unhealthy escape from bad feelings. Once you can recognize the role internal triggers like boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue, and uncertainty play in your life, you can decide how to respond in a healthier manner. You can‚Äôt control how you feel, but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel.To start, you can change how you think about the bad feelings that can lead to distraction.Studies show that not giving into internal triggers can backfire. Resisting a craving or impulse can trigger rumination and make the desire grow stronger. When you finally give in, relieving that tension of wanting increases the reward, reinforcing a bad habit. Thankfully, there are smarter ways to cope with discomfort.Dr. Jonathan Bricker, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, has developed a set of steps we can take when faced with a distracting temptation. His techniques help patients reduce health risks through behavioral change.In this day and age, if you don‚Äôt plan your day, someone else will! Without knowing what it is you want to do with your time, everything is a potential distraction. To make time for the things that really matter, follow these steps.1. Don‚Äôt pick your goals, pick your values: Values are the attributes of the person you want to become. Examples of values might include being a contributing member of a team, being a loving parent, being in an equitable marriage, seeking wisdom, taking care of your physical fitness, or being a generous friend. Only you can decide which values are important to you.2. Turn your values into time: Many people talk a good game about what‚Äôs important to them ‚Äî family, health, friends. But when it comes to investing time in these areas of their lives, they get distracted and don‚Äôt follow through. They don‚Äôt live up to their values because they don‚Äôt make time for them in their day.3. Timebox your schedule: The most effective way to make sure you‚Äôll make time for your values is timeboxing. Timeboxing means deciding what you‚Äôre going to do and when you‚Äôre going to do it. The goal is to create a template for how to spend your time each day, eliminating all white space in your calendar.It doesn‚Äôt matter what you do as long as you do what you planned to do. Go ahead and scroll through social media, but at allotted times ‚Äî not at the expense of other things you planned to do, like spending time with your family.Decide how much time you want to devote to each domain of your life, according to your values. Make sure that you schedule enough time for yourself and for your relationships. After all, the most important people in your life deserve better than the leftover time in your day.Then, create a weekly calendar template for your perfect week. You can find a free blank template and schedule-maker tool here. Next, include 15 minutes per week to reflect and refine your calendar for the week ahead.Tech companies use external triggers to hack our attention. The pings and dings from our devices often distract us by pulling us away from what we really want to do. We may try to ignore those triggers, but research shows that ignoring a call or message can be just as distracting as responding to one.Not all external triggers are distractions, however. If used to help you accomplish tasks, external triggers can remind you to do what you planned. The right approach is to ask whether the external trigger is serving you, or whether you are serving it. If the prompt leads you to traction, keep it. If it leads you to distraction, eliminate it.External triggers are all around us. One of the most potentially troublesome sources of unhelpful external triggers is, of course, our smartphones. Whether it‚Äôs to keep in contact with family, navigate around town, or listen to audiobooks, this miracle device in your pocket has become indispensable. It can also be a major source of distraction, but you can take back your smartphone in four steps:Make sure to also ‚Äúhack back‚Äù external triggers in other environments, both online and off. Whether the external trigger comes from a notification on your phone or laptop, or the interruption is a coworker taking you off track when you planned to do focused work, the consequences are the same.Finally, the last step to becoming indistractable is to prevent distraction with pacts. This technique involves making a ‚Äúprecommitment‚Äù ‚Äî removing a future choice ‚Äî in order to overcome distraction.Precommitments are decisions we cement well in advance of the temptations we know might come. As such, this step should only be taken after we have followed the other three steps and learned to manage our internal triggers, made time for traction, and hacked back the external triggers that pull us to distractions.There are three types of pacts.An effort pact is a kind of precommitment that involves increasing the amount of effort required to do something you don‚Äôt want to do. Adding additional effort forces you to ask if a distraction is really worth the extra effort. There are numerous apps designed to help you make effort pacts with your digital devices. (Good examples include SelfControl, Forest, and Freedom, but there are many others.)A price pact puts money on the line. If you stick to your intended behavior, you keep the cash. If you get distracted, you forfeit your funds. This kind of technique has had astounding results when used to help smokers quit. I used a price pact to finish the first draft of my book, promising my accountability partner $10,000 if I did not finish the draft by deadline. I kept my money and finished writing my book.Finally, an identity pact is another way to change your response to distractions. Your self-image has a profound impact on your behavior. By taking on a new identity, you empower yourself to make decisions based on who you believe you are. Consider how people who call themselves ‚Äúvegetarians‚Äù don‚Äôt have to expend much willpower to avoid eating meat.To become indistractable, you can stop telling yourself you are a person with a ‚Äúshort attention span‚Äù or an ‚Äúaddictive personality‚Äù and instead tell yourself, ‚ÄúI am indistractable.‚Äù If you tell yourself you are the kind of person who is easily distracted, it instantly becomes true. However, if you believe that you are indistractable, you empower yourself to respond more healthily to whatever distractions get in your way.Becoming indistractable is not some mysterious formula. It‚Äôs as easy as following the four steps above. Mastering your internal triggers, making time for traction, hacking back your external triggers, and preventing distractions with pacts, are all powerful tools that can reshape your life.The world is splitting into two types of people: those who allow their attention and their lives to be manipulated by others, and those who proudly call themselves indistractable. When you become indistractable, you influence others to do the same. You can influence colleagues and coworkers to try these techniques. You can inspire your friends and family to pursue the lives they envision. You can help your children learn what is sure to be the skill of the century: the power to become indistractable.WRITTEN BY"
165,The End of Aging -,https://medium.com/swlh/the-end-of-aging-471a084c1108?source=extreme_main_feed---------168-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"and why we all should strive for more qualitative time in our lifeDo you know the feeling when you come home from a long day at work, take your jacket and shoes off and go to the bathroom to have that pee that your body has been asking for the last 3 hours? And as you approach the sink to wash your hands, you start to examine your reflection in the mirror: and there you spot it! Not even with big surprise, a new microscopic wrinkle seems to have popped up in the corner of your left eye. It‚Äôs not even a big deal, you think, and yet, you feel a little disappointed. You contemplate whether you should have taken more care of your body in the past few months. Maybe living a less stressful life could have prevented this tiny incision on your face. But one thing is for sure: from now on, it will accompany you for the rest of your existence. It will only grow deeper to show the outside world that your bodily functions are in slow decay. And you can‚Äôt help but wonder: can I stop this?This is a sign of aging.We all know that aging is much more than just wrinkles appearing on your middle-aged face as pimples usually do on a pubescent one. Aging comes with all sorts of side effects like hurting knees, everlasting hangovers and the swindling affirmation of ‚Äúback in my days everything was better‚Äù. Aging is the dying of cells, a slowing cell division and the demise of repair mechanisms in your body. This results in more fragile bones, reduced muscle strength, a weaker immune system and wrinkling of the skin. The more one approaches old age, the more devastating the effects of aging will be, leading to disease, dementia and finally death.!Important: there is no such thing as dying of old age. One dies because of diseases and medical conditions which the body cannot handle anymore!While many think that aging is a natural biological process, I might have to disappoint them. Aging is not an act of rebellion that our bodies naturally go through because they are tired of living. It is much more the wearing out of our bodies due to trillions of tiny physical processes that affect and inflict our being each and every second. This means that aging in itself, is no more biological than gravity dragging your tits to the floor. Obviously it is not as simple as that.Professor for Physics Peter M Hoffman at Wayne State University offers us a simple and elegant allegory¬π:‚ÄúThe inside of every cell in our body is like a crowded city, filled with tracks, transports, libraries, factories, power plants, and garbage disposal units. The city‚Äôs workers are protein machines, which metabolize food, take out the garbage, or repair DNA. Cargo is moved from one place to another by molecular machines that have been observed walking on two legs along protein tightropes. As these machines go about their business, they are surrounded by thousands of water molecules, which randomly crash into them a trillion times a second. This is what physicists euphemistically call ‚Äúthermal motion.‚Äù Violent thermal chaos would be more appropriate.‚ÄùThis ‚Äúviolent thermal chaos‚Äù, also known as Brownian force, is what makes the body function by putting our molecular machines in motion but at the same time damaging them. Add radiation, UV-light and oxidation into the equation and you see how these molecular machines are destined to break down over time. Therefore, on the most basic level of understanding, the dreadful wrinkle that popped up, is corresponding to your face rusting like an old piece of iron, which you left eroding in the sun and rain for the past (insert your age) years.As singling out physics as the sole cause of aging would be a bit too simplistic to describe the complex interconnected processes of your body ever slowly dying; I want to quickly explore two biological processes in your body which are affected by growing older.Let me first nerd out about genetics: Our cells have a nucleus, in this nucleus we find the chromosomes, which consist out of DNA that is manageably rolled up around packaging proteins. At the end of these chromosomes we find the telomeres, that have the function of protecting our DNA from getting damaged when it replicates during cell division (mitosis). You might imagine these telomeres like the plastic bits at the end of shoelaces. Each time when a cell goes through mitosis, an exact copy of DNA is created, which involves ripping the double helix apart and recompleting it on each side. In this process, a tiny bit of the telomeres gets lost, and after a number of cell divisions, it is used up. At this point the cell, becomes what is known as a senescent cell¬≤ (senescent coming from the latin root senex= old). Senescent cells don‚Äôt act like normal cells anymore. They act a bit like your great-grand-aunt Mary, who is senile and refuses to die, causing distress in her surroundings. Like aunt Mary is harmful for the harmony of your family, senescent cells stick around and hurt the tissue enclosing them, leading to conditions like diabetes and kidney failure. Therefore, senescent cells are not directly involved in the creation of that nasty wrinkle which you‚Äôll be dwelling upon for the next few days, but worrying about aunt Mary and her growing hospital bill are.Now that we explored how physics and genetics affect our aging body, it would be a shame not to mention the billions of bacteria that live in and on us: the microbiome. Our guts, our skin and our genitals are what vast clusters of different species of bacteria call their home. When we are born we take up the first bacteria at skin contact with our mother. As we grow up, we develop our own individual bacterial fingerprint which will stabilize around adulthood. The individual microbiome is prone to changes when we get sick. The good bacteria die and the bad ones quadruple when our immune system is under attack and stressing out. And as we age, we are much more susceptible to diseases ‚Äî therefore our microbiome changes¬≥ and the bad bacteria are more likely to take over. Of course we could try to handle this crisis like Jamie Lee Curtis by eating probiotic yogurt on a green couch (#activia), but we can‚Äôt halt the process of potentially pathogenic bacteria setting camp in the newly discovered wrinkle forever (at least for now).I feel the need to mention that these 3 selected processes I‚Äôve chosen to talk about aging, are not even close to representing just a tiny fraction of how growing older can and will affect us over the course of our lifespan. I simply wanted to give you a taste of some of the recent research revolving around this topic. Since the past decade, the focus on the science of aging has been expanding and is eventually leading researchers and industries trying to solve humanity‚Äôs lifelong question:Well, if I would shake the magic 8 ball of everlasting youth it would tell me: outlook good.‚Å¥ The science is promising, but too complex to tackle in this essay. If you are incredibly interested in the very details of how scientists are trying to find a cure to aging, I advise you to read up on the list of links in the footnotes. Yet, I would like to especially mention a very intriguing feature of a crowdfunding website first: The Rejuvenation Roadmap of lifespan.ioThis roadmap shows ongoing research into the most promising therapies to cure aging and at which point they are. It therefore also gives a small overview of the various fields scientists are looking into to end aging.As we see that the possibilities to end the aging process are becoming more and more tangible, the question is posed:Many are appalled by the idea of treating aging like a disease and think of it as unnatural or a product of vanity. This is why I wanted to point out that at its core, aging is a process caused by physics, with biological consequences. It is not in our genetic plan to become so fragile we eventually die, it is simply our DNA wearing out when it‚Äôs replicated. It is always diseases, maybe caused by bacteria, and other medical conditions, that are killing us when we grow older. !It is not aging in and of itself! Therefore, the curing of aging would be no different than any other medical milestone we achieved so far to cheat death. It is simply extending life, which is what we are doing each time when using treatments like chemotherapy, antibiotics or a surgical bypass. It just takes a different approach: prevention.Before there will be any relevant and successful product on the market, slowing down the process of aging is already somewhat possible. Like we discussed earlier, aging is the wearing out of our body over time. Does that mean that staying still on your couch and not undertaking any activity at all will make you live longer? Not at all. It just means that you should engage in a healthy lifestyle and try to avoid damaging your body. This means: no smoking, no drinking, a healthy balanced diet and lots and lots and lots of movement.‚Åµ (So yes, the gruesome look in the mirror could have probably been prevented by living a less stressful life, but it‚Äôs too late for that now, so no need to worry.) But if we look past today and into a not so distant future -The consequences of ending of aging open up a series of other questions that challenge our view on life quite drastically. If you think about the possibility of ending aging, it means that in some way we would get a step closer to having an endless life. Everlasting youth is not immortality, of course (I want to be clear about that!), but it potentially means that we could live healthy lives until 150, 200 or maybe 300 years of age. Being young forever doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt die in a car crash and doesn‚Äôt give you the guarantee of surviving the antibiotic apocalypse, but it gives you reason to think about how you want to spend your life. Today, we live by a quite fix set timelines. You study in your 20ies, stabilize your career in your 30ies, maybe start a family, buy a house and so on until you reach retirement towards the end of your 60ies. Then you‚Äôll go traveling for another 10 years after which you‚Äôre destined to die in a hospital, dreadfully realizing that you have become great-grand-aunt Mary. But the what if still remains. If you could live to 150 and be as fit as a 35 year old when you‚Äôre 70, would you go and study again? Start all over and pursue a career as a medical doctor instead of struggling to earn a living as an artist. Would you stress so much about finding your life partner to start a family, or would you be more open to a series of short lived relationships? As a woman, you wouldn‚Äôt face the choice: ‚Äúeither I have my own kids now or never‚Äù. Probably you wouldn‚Äôt stress yourself so much with finishing your degree and take a series of breaks in between, as the clock of life isn‚Äôt ticking for you anymore. You could take multiple sabbaticals just to check out in which country you‚Äôd actually like to settle. You could marry and remarry over and over. You could finally find the time to try to understand the mumbling part in Alanis Morisettes‚Äô Ironic. You could give yourself the proper time to get to know yourself, what you like and what your good at, without anyone or yourself putting the pressure of achievements first. Life‚Äôs not too short anymore, so why not taste it all?Opening up these alternatives timelines truly makes one wonder whether the pressure of life isn‚Äôt just a social construct, which we are all subconsciously complying with, or if there is another way out of it, rather than the ending of aging.Another topic the of ending aging shines a light upon, is the natural opposite of life: death. As we would be living a healthy life for much longer than we could ever imagine, would we grow tired of life at some point? As there would be no imminent limit to when our body says goodbye, would we have the free choice of when,how or if we want to end it all?‚Å∂ Could you already tell today at what age you would want to die? And what if you reach this age, would you still be in line with your decision from so many years ago? It is impossible to take a purely rational decision on the exiting of life. Our brains only know the state of living and cannot make sense of death in itself. When you try to imagine being dead, you‚Äôre still being. You are probably imagining a black void, but there is still your conscious present.We are usually not afraid of death itself as it is unimaginably abstract. We are afraid of the process of dying. And this is what we could possibly take a partially rational decision on. As we would be motivated by the fear of dying in an unpleasant way, we could be enabled to choose for a way out, that is much more pleasant than great-grand-aunt Mary‚Äôs hospital stay (which is the standard way of dying as of 2020). I imagine floating off into space like Major Tom to be a much more exciting form of waving farewell to my earthly existence.On this note, I want to mention the 5 biggest regrets of the dying as listed by Bronnie Ware‚Å∑, an Australian palliative care nurse and author. She cared for many patients in the last weeks of their lives and asked them how they would have lived differently, now that they are faced with their own mortality:1. I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.2. I wish I hadn‚Äôt worked so hard.3. I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to express my feelings.4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.Now that we talked about the tough stuff, I want to conclude our journey through the ending of aging. I would like to return to the moment when you discovered that new wrinkle in the left corner of your eye, which seems to have caused so much dismay. The thought that maybe having lived a less stressful life could have prevented it, can serve you as a reminder of how you want to spend your remaining time on this planet. I therefore advise you to welcome this wrinkle on your face, name it and each morning when you see it in your reflection take a minute to think about how you want to spend your day.

166,The Promise & Peril Of The Coming Technological Singularity,https://medium.com/predict/the-promise-peril-of-the-coming-technological-singularity-320d3b62cbd?source=extreme_main_feed---------169-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"The singularity is the digital nirvana of the 21st century: a moment in time when machines become self-aware, using human-level capabilities at machine speeds to rapidly bootstrap themselves to godlike levels of intelligence ‚Äî and what happens after that is anyone‚Äôs guess.How you feel about the singularity depends on your perspective ‚Äî almost like a Rorschach test for futurists. Optimists like Ray Kurzweil, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry Page see it as the birth of a new utopian future for mankind, while others such as Nick Bostrom, Bill Gates & Elon Musk are deeply concerned.Despite the uncertainties, science & technology continue their march forward ‚Äî with numerous Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) projects and efforts to reverse engineer the human mind pushing us closer to that day of reckoning.As Marshall Brain has written, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre creating a second intelligent species to compete with ourselves‚Äù ‚Äî and while we know little about the potential thoughts, motives, or perhaps feelings that it will have when it arrives, we at least have a notion of the timeline: futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts it will happen by the year 2045.The concept of the singularity originates with John von Neumann back in the ‚Äò50s, but it remained obscure until science-fiction author Vernor Vinge popularized it in his 1993 essay, The Coming Technological Singularity, and subsequently in Ray Kurzweil‚Äôs The Age Of Spiritual Machines in 1999.While predictions for the singularity vary, the premise arises from a common observation: the rate of technological advance is increasing exponentially ‚Äî and at some point humans will simply be unable to keep up. The image above, for example, shows Moore‚Äôs Law creating an exponential increase in computing speed in a standard $1,000 desktop PC, which is plotted against milestones representing the computing capacity of animals & people.While accelerating change in today‚Äôs world is created by people using machine-assisted design and online sharing of information, tomorrow it will be entirely the product of recursive self-improvement by machines, at which point humans will become irrelevant to progress ‚Äî and pessimists worry that mankind will be irrelevant to the planet as well.Futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts machines will reach human level intelligence by the year 2030 ‚Äî and after that point, computing power will continue to increase, surpassing the power of all human minds combined by around 2060.Kurzweil‚Äôs analysis doesn‚Äôt address the complexities of developing software capable of mimicking the human mind ‚Äî but he believes that advances in neuroscience will facilitate the development of true artificial intelligence, and projects like Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs IARPA-funded brain research project appear to support his prediction.While computing capacity is not synonymous with sentience, Kurzweil believes that combined progress in computing & artificial intelligence will inevitably lead a self-aware, self-improving machine that Kurzweil predicts will lead to a Technological Singularity, ‚Äúa hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization.‚ÄùAs mentioned above, advances in artificial intelligence and the prospect of the singularity have been polarizing in the futurism community. The graph below, from a Vanity Fair article on the dangers of AI, shows a diverse spectrum of opinions on the topic held by several popular futurists.Perhaps the most optimistic of these thinkers is Ray Kurzweil, who‚Äôs said, ‚ÄúBiological evolution is too slow for the human species. Over the next few decades, it‚Äôs going to be left in the dust. By the 2030, the non-biological portion of our intelligence ‚Äî our technology ‚Äî will predominate‚Ä¶‚ÄùIn Kurzweil‚Äôs view, the singularity isn‚Äôt an event where machines rise to dominance over mankind, but rather the merger of man and machine, blurring the distinction between natural and artificial, and in the process re-defining life as we know it.Kurzweil believes that concepts like mind uploading, molecular nanotechnology & cybernetic implants open the door to virtual immortality for humans, along with increased human intelligence, the end of disease, and a panacea of incredible new possibilities we haven‚Äôt even begun to explore.Obviously not all futurists are not so optimistic. The late physicist Stephen Hawking held a very pessimistic view of AI, saying, ‚ÄúThe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race‚Äù, and he wasn‚Äôt alone in his concerns.Elon Musk has called AI an ‚Äúexistential threat to humanity‚Äù, and Nick Bostrom has said, ‚ÄúOur approach to existential risks cannot be one of trial-and-error. There is no opportunity to learn from errors.‚ÄùA more moderate approach comes from Bill Gates, calling AI ‚Äúboth promising and dangerous‚Äù, but still advocating open, managed research. ‚ÄúThe world hasn‚Äôt had that many technologies that are both promising and dangerous, he has said, ‚Äúwe had nuclear energy and nuclear weapons‚Ä¶the place that I think this is most concerning is in weapon systems.‚ÄùRay Kurzweil, being perhaps the best-known prognosticator of the singularity, has said that computers will match human levels of intelligence by the year 2029 ‚Äî with the singularity itself anticipated to happen before the year 2045.Other futurists offer slightly different timelines, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son saying it will happen in 2047, and Ben Goertzel, an advisor to Singularity University, claiming that various social & scientific factors could put the date anywhere from 2020 to 2100.Futurism.com recently polled several computing & AI experts in an article entitled, Separating Science Fact From Science Hype: How Far off Is the Singularity?, and the consensus was generally consistent with Kurzweil‚Äôs projections, with a timeframe between 2045 and 2050.It‚Äôs worth noting that Kurzweil himself padded his view of the timeline for the singularity with the premise that even if human-level machine intelligence doesn‚Äôt happen immediately, the Law Of Accelerating Returns means that only a short delay will exist before the singularity occurs ‚Äî a result of the exponential rate of increase Kurzweil is fond of citing.Exponential growth in computing capacity over the last century points to an inexorable conclusion ‚Äî that computers will match and eventually exceed the computing capacity of the human mind.At some point, this increased computing power combined with advances in artificial intelligence is predicted to lead to the creation of a self-aware machine intelligence, which will be capable of recursive self-improvement to bootstrap itself to levels of intelligence beyond the scope of human imagination.The result will be one of the most important events in the history of the human race: the singularity will be the birth of a second intelligent species on Earth, capable of competing with mankind and driven by goals, desires & motivations that cannot be predicted.Various futurists hold an array of opinions about the meaning & impact of the singularity ‚Äî with some viewing it as a desired outcome capable of elevating mankind to godlike stature, and others anticipating the complete displacement of human beings by a new, more advanced form of intelligence.Currently not enough is understood about the potential impact of the singularity to draw a definite conclusion, but perhaps the best way to regard the it is like any powerful new technology: a pandora‚Äôs box of mixed blessings, fraught with an uncertain number of benefits & dangers.WRITTEN BY"
167,A Good Programmer is a Lazy Programmer,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-good-programmer-is-a-lazy-programmer-8982b2d971bb?source=extreme_main_feed---------170-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"W
hile it might not be something you want to lead with in a job interview, one basic philosophy that separates good programmers from the rest of the pack is that of laziness. A good programmer feels the same way about basic tasks such as looping through a recordset and performing simple logic based on the results with the same zeal as an elementary school student attacking their math homework, minus the full-fledged freak out but possibility not minus the grumbling acceptance of work to be done.Let‚Äôs face it, coding is sometimes just an advanced form of data entry. It‚Äôs something to get through rather than sink our teeth into.And often, it‚Äôs an opportunity.T
he art of being a good programmer through laziness is to always be on the lookout for patterns and ways to package them. The goal is to get through the mindbogglingly dull portions of the project as quickly as possible so we can focus more time and effort on the actual problem solving.To be fair, most programmers know this to a degree. After all, objects and functions are the fundamental building blocks of development and applications are just packaged building blocks being passed through over and over to produce results. But the good programmer takes these ideas to an extreme level.At this point, I will stop and state what should hopefully be obvious: The reverse is not true. A lazy programmer is rarely good. You know the person I‚Äôm talking about. Maybe they like to execute that query and stare at the screen for three minutes while it runs rather than opening up a new tab and working on a different piece of code. Perhaps they don‚Äôt feel they need proper error handling because ‚Äúcode is supposed to work perfectly.‚Äù Or maybe they are fine taking the long way around because they are there to do exactly what is told to them and not deviate from the plan even if it contains obvious inefficiencies.A good programmer is lazy because they prefer working on portions of the project that are difficult rather than typing in code that basically writes itself.This isn‚Äôt a contest to get the least amount of work done. It isn‚Äôt about clocking out at 5, going home and totally forgetting about your work until 8 AM the next day. A good programmer is lazy because they prefer working on portions of the project that are difficult rather than typing in code that basically writes itself. In fact, the best ‚Äî and often laziest ‚Äî of programmers wake up in the middle of the night with an ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment because they solved a particularly tough puzzle while they were asleep. Or they look across the dinner table at their significant other, having been coding in their head since food was on the table and suddenly realizing they have no idea what the conversation being conducted in their quasi-absence is all about.I‚Äô
ve certainly never been one that enjoys typing in code just to type in code. Both big and small, I like to package it up. Both big and small? Heck, even when it is tiny. When I was developing my random dungeon generator for table top games like D&D and Pathfinder, I would often need to check a certain radius around a point on the map. It might be a trap that could spring from one square away or an event that could happen from two squares or an encounter that could spot the party from four squares away, no matter the distance, the SQL was virtually the same. So instead of typing in the same section of the where clause, I programmed a function that would accept the x/y coordinates and a radius in order to spit back the SQL.Simple. And yet it saved me from manually typing it dozens upon dozens of times AND, perhaps even more important, it ensured the where clause would be free of typos. That means no scrutinizing of code for half an hour only to find I‚Äôd typed a 3 instead of a 4.I faced a similar pattern when looking up items in the treasure tables to fill a chest or monsters in encounter tables to create an ambush. The field names changed, but the basic algorithm was the same. There would be a record with a weight or frequency (how often it should be randomly pulled from the data set), conditions (such as the level of the creature or treasure, the type of encounter or item, etc.) and a primary key to identify it. The specifics might change, but how you randomly choose a record from this type of dataset stays the same, thus a function was born to do the heavy lifting.Sometimes the laziest way of doing something was to have code write code. I‚Äôve never been the biggest fan of templates that ship with development platforms, but I‚Äôm a big fan of coding your own.When I started with my first ‚Äòreal‚Äô programming job, we used Visual Basic to access a Microsoft SQL Server. (Yes, I‚Äôm a dinosaur. I even remember typing on green screen terminals to develop on a VAX/VMS mainframe back in college.) The normal way of creating a data entry form was to include a recordset object that linked to fields on the form, but the recordset object shipped by Microsoft wasn‚Äôt without its own bugs and performance issues, so we would do this part ‚Äúmanually.‚Äù And in this case, that meant writing out our own code for inserting, updating and deleting records.This resulted in large amounts of code looking up values in fields on the form to build the INSERT or UPDATE statement by hand. Tedious.While Microsoft‚Äôs recordset object wasn‚Äôt always reliable, it at least minimized the amount of code required to do these basic functions. So in order to mimic this benefit while avoiding the recordset object itself, I developed a class that would compare fields on a form to the fields in the database in order to automatically generate the SQL statements needed to perform these basic tasks. Obviously, this was a little more complex than I‚Äôll go into here, but the result replicated the benefits of the recordset object (easier and smaller chunks of code) while subtracting the primary detractor (possibly buggy or inefficient code you had no control over).When I moved to working in PHP with MySQL, I ran up against the same type of issue. Big table = lots of code = boring. The big difference here was that less technical people would be working within the same files doing the HTML side of things, so I wanted to ensure some simplicity. And sometimes those big chunks of code are actually easier for the less technical to deal with than a more complicated system of getting the same thing done. Solution: build code that could be run to automatically generate the basic PHP code needed to insert, update and delete records in the database. Basically, building your own template.T
hese examples aren‚Äôt meant to dazzle so much as demonstrate that looking for patterns is something programmers should do no matter the size of the code. Even something as simple as creating an SQL where clause to bring in records within a certain distance can have a positive effect on how much time it takes you to finish a project. I even have functions that will give me the count, min or max from a table given a certain where clause. And the mere fact that it takes the typo out of the equation can make these functions worthwhile in the long run.Most of us with a few years under our belt have worked beside the programmer quite happy to type in line after line of thoughtless code day after day feeling no sense of urgency to search for the most efficient route. And I‚Äôm not saying these are bad programmers, but if you are taking the most time to do every piece of your project, you are far more likely to get behind when that surprise puzzle pops up. And there is almost always a surprise.This is where looking for the patterns within the coding pays the biggest dividends. The time saved not typing in code that requires little thought can be put towards feature everyone thought was going to take a short amount of time but the reality was much longer.The basic mentality for a lazy programmer? Always look for a pattern.WRITTEN BY"
168,A Plan For Humanity,https://medium.com/future-literacy/a-plan-for-humanity-2bc04088e3d4?source=extreme_main_feed---------171-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"We need future literacy to survive.I don‚Äôt go to pools. I don‚Äôt drink margaritas.Somehow here I am, sitting at a pool with a margarita in hand, editing my 82nd draft of a plan for the future of the human race.My girlfriend is worried people might think I‚Äôm crazy.‚ÄúBaby,‚Äù she posits, ‚Äúmost people just want to make it through the day. Who really cares whether humans survive in 200 years?‚ÄùShe‚Äôs kinda right. Fortunately, tequila takes the edge off.For the past decade, I‚Äôve been obsessed with solving a problem that too few people seem to care about. And that, in my estimation, is the biggest problem of all. But who I am to say?Perhaps humans are destined to fail. Like so many other species before us, perhaps we‚Äôre simply meant to approach a natural, unavoidable end. Maybe we deserve it.But what if‚Ä¶.what if we adjusted a few things, turned a few knobs, and set off in new directions. What if we could not only survive, but create an existence more exquisite than we can even imagine?! What if.These are the ideas that consume me. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about them. Dreaming about them. I burn inside with an ambition that feels out of place in the early 21st century.We plan everything else in life: when we wake up, when we start work, meetings, social events, marriage, kids, career progression, financial goals, vacations, purchases, war, retirement, death ‚Äî everything.Why don‚Äôt we have a plan for our collective survival?We are racing into a wildly complex, unknown, and accelerated future, and we are unprepared.And so, in the absence of seeing any viable plans for the future of the human race, I‚Äôve decided to write one. Love it, hate it, or just find me crazy ‚Äî it‚Äôs a place to start. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.DISCLAIMERPrior to getting into the plan, a few quick notes:A 7 Step Plan For HumanityIn 1820, only 12% of the world‚Äôs population could read and write. Imagine what our daily lives would look like right now if we hadn‚Äôt achieved a 83% basic literacy over the past two centuries. I imagine that it would be significantly less prosperous, healthy, and interesting.Now, imagine that only 12% of us are ‚ÄúFuture Literate,‚Äù in other words, highly skilled at approximating what‚Äôs to come and capable of preparing accordingly. We‚Äôd be in very big trouble.But it‚Äôs actually worse than that. My guess is that the rate of future literacy is less than 1%. As a society, we‚Äôre future illiterate.We obsess over the short-term. We fly by the seat of our pants. We ignore risks until they become a crisis. We can‚Äôt imagine beyond the familiar. This cognitive disposition creates excessive risk for us as a species.The most effective way to deal with our circumstances is to recognize the underlying, foundational reasons why we naturally behave the way we do, so that we can get to work on these root source problems.Future literacy is the ability to forecast approximate milestones and create the capacity to reach them, regardless of contextual change. It‚Äôs the act of creating mental models for an emerging future while living experimentally and adventurously.If enough of us become future literate, we stand a chance of surviving ourselves and creating an exciting future.Our Brains are Dangerously FlawedIn a sample of 600+ US residents, more than 85% believed they were less biased than the average American. Only one participant believed that he or she was more biased than the average American. Known as the Bias Blind Spot, the study demonstrated that most people are less likely to detect bias in themselves than in others.To help us navigate a complex world, our brain has developed hundreds of cognitive biases. The challenge is that we can‚Äôt recognize them easily. We create our own unique, individual distorted realities .It is scientifically proven that humans are irrational, illogical, have blind spots, process information to support our existing beliefs, and are vulnerable to manipulation. We clutter our brains with unnecessary information, get confused by statistics and probabilities, have poor recollection when truth matters, and are generally terrible at predicting the future. And yet, our brains hide this reality from us.Even with the desire to recognize the problem and the stamina to try and fix cognitive errors, there are no tools sufficiently powerful enough to get the job done. (See my attempt at achieving Cognitive ‚ÄúPerfection‚Äù here, inspired by Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs attempt at moral ‚Äúperfection‚Äù.)So Step 1 begins like any therapy group might ‚Äî by admitting we have a problem.I‚Äôll go first: ‚ÄúHi, my name is Bryan Johnson, and I have a problem. I am riddled with cognitive biases that I can‚Äôt detect, define, or fix. My brain and my five, limited senses put me in a myopic frame of reference where only I appear at the center. My belief systems force me to believe untrue facts, but I still hold onto them with a death grip. My brain spends heaps of its precious energy trying to figure out the present and dwelling on the past, but is terrible at planning for the future. I am irrational, illogical, hypercritical, and find most pleasant the information that best conforms to my worldview. My memory is faulty, and I don‚Äôt even know where the gaps are. I fill in the rest with made up stories, like our eyes do with their tiny blind spots. Of the hundreds of cognitive biases and default errors I am aware of, I can‚Äôt stay focused on any single one long enough to overcome them. I only imagine in terms of things I‚Äôm familiar with. And worst of all, despite these admissions, I believe everyone else‚Äôs reality is even more distorted than mine, that these flaws apply less to me than to others.‚ÄùFor now, you and I are both stuck with flawed cognition, along with nearly 8 billion others we share the planet with.For those of you unaware of the severity of your cognitive shortcomings, or think that you are the exception to the rule (85% of people do!), I‚Äôd encourage you to become familiar with the literature. It is a useful and high value form of enlightenment that will help you in every aspect of your life. (A suggested reading list is below plus a visual representation of your 188 cognitive biases.¬π)For me, I find my daily practice of working to improve my cognition by trying to lessen my biases, blind spots, distorted reality, etc. is higher value than other practices I‚Äôve had over the years (i.e. meditation).After recognizing our flawed cognition, the next step is to improve it. After all, if we can improve our cognition, we can also improve everything downstream from it: ourselves, relationships, health, environment, religion/beliefs, politics, economics, education, security, and‚Ä¶our individual and collective futures.This is really important to understand: our political systems, our economic systems, businesses, war, relationships, scientific discovery ‚Äî everything ‚Äî all lives downstream from our minds.To be clear, my suggestion of up-leveling cognition is not merely about doing what we already do better, faster. This is not about taking a performance enhancer or trying to climb the IQ charts.Meditation, supplements, exercise, education, self-help programs and therapy, are all useful starting points for self-improvement. The next level of improvement needs to be enabled by substantially better tools that allow us to systematically improve ourselves on known fronts and on new frontiers.If our cognitive potential were represented on a scale from 1‚Äì10, imagine that we are a 3 right now and can barely catch a glimpse of 4. What levels do we need to achieve in order to solve the problems we face?It may be the case that becoming perfectly logical, rational, and eliminating all blind spots is a level up, and beyond that, we need to enhance our minds by extending our sensory experiences and capabilites. To go even further, maybe we build AI so that it assumes logic/reason-based responsibilities so we can focus on higher order creativity, emotions and complexity.The evolutionary potential I am suggesting sits beyond our current ability to conceptualize. Just because we can‚Äôt currently see it doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist. We are limited by our imaginations.When we think about AI, we imagine it as being capable of becoming and doing anything, yet, when it comes to our own potential, we‚Äôre woefully unambitious and unimaginative.When I‚Äôve spoken about this idea, people often get confused and think that their abilities are the same as their technology, that their smartphones capabilites are their own. It‚Äôs easy for that to happen.Upon further examination, we do not get a system upgrade every few weeks. We do not increase our native abilities by orders of magnitude every decade. (This is a form of Group attribution error, a bias where we often mistake traits of an person, or in this case, technology, for traits of the group as a whole.)Independent of whether you love or fear AI, intelligence is the most powerful and precious resource in existence. As the most generally intelligent species on planet earth, humans rule, and we do so ruthlessly.We decide who we eat, who we have as pets, who goes extinct and who we save. I am not suggesting that AI will behave like us ‚Äî at least, I certainly hope not. And I frankly don‚Äôt think we have the ability to discern how AI will evolve over the coming decades.Absent being able to predict the future, I am suggesting that it‚Äôs urgent that we begin radically improving ourselves so that we can catch the wave of co-evolving with our digital intelligence.There is a window of time, which is right now, in which co-evolution needs to begin in earnest. Otherwise, we risk leaving ourselves behind, by our own design, being at the mercy of whatever AI evolutionary path lies ahead of us.Radically improving ourselves is also the correct response to the coming unemployment crisis.Right now, we‚Äôre doing the exact opposite. Not only are we not urgently working to radically improve ourselves and thoughtfully co-evolve with our digital intelligence, we have built the perfect economic system to race ourselves to irrelevance. Oops. More on this in Step 3.Recognizing this need to radically improve ourselves was a primary reason why I started Kernel, personally seeding it with $100M. We are building next generation, non-invasive brain interfaces to accelerate our evolutionary advance.Make Humans Economically ViableThe future of the human race can be forecasted through a single metric: return on investment (ROI) of intelligence. Our current economic incentives (the engine that drives the world) are perfectly designed to put humans out of business and make us irrelevant as fast as possible.Take this example: if 100 investors were each given the option to invest $1M into improving employee skill sets at their company OR investing the $1M into a group of employees building digital intelligence (aka artificial intelligence), the vast majority would invest in digital intelligence. This is highly rational.The investment returns, for a large percentge of scenerios, are higher for digital. After all, it takes 33 years to produce a single human PhD! Digital intelligence, generally speaking, simply produces higher ROI than investing in humans in our current economic system, and the delta is getting larger daily.Regardless if you believe the rate of progress of digital intelligence is an exponential curve, punctuated equilibrium, or linear ‚Äî that line is moving up and to the right. Economic returns follow. Humans, comparatively, are flatlined.Yes, we are capable of living in a more complex society than previous generations. We have better technology at our fingertips than any previous era. We can do things that previous generations couldn‚Äôt do and we understand more about the world than any time in history.Still, the rate of human improvement is deminimus relative to the dynamic progress of digital intelligence.This is not an argument that AI is going to take over the world. I am arguing that our own, human built capitalist systems, are designed to invest money in things that create the highest returns, which is increasingly favoring digital intelligence. That means, soon, there will be little economic incentive to invest in humans.Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the economic system that some of the most powerful, capable and successful companies in the world have designed. I‚Äôll create a fictitious company for example purposes called‚Ä¶.Fakebook.1. Fakebook mines our digital ‚Äúselves,‚Äù i.e. data that represents our wants, preferences, habits, proclivities, knowledge, friends, personality, etc.2. Fakebook sells this data to advertisers, politicians, nationstates ‚Äî whomever will pay the highest price.3. Yay! Fakebook makes piles of money and hires the best people in the world, offering them so much money they are de-incentivized to work on solving other problems in the world (climate change, fake news, you name it.)4. These brilliant new hires from the best universities, build the most advanced digital tools in the world with two goals: 1) get us to use more Fakebook and 2) mine more information about us. This makes Fakebook more money, so they can hire more smart people to keep us using it more.5. Now that people are literally addicted to Fakebook, Fakebook can direct their attention anyway they want. People waste their precious time, become increasingly depressed, and get psychologically manipulated.6. Return on investment for digital intelligence increases; while return on investment for humans goes down.Rinse, repeat, and the cycle continues.So how do we create new incentives that align with human improvement? We have to change the current systems, for example:There are many ways we might think about shifting the incentive structures from the top down ‚Äî and plenty of smart people are currently thinking about this (i.e. blockchain technologies, impact funds), but another method to consider is from the ground up.In taking a ground up approach, one solution would be to reclaim the value of owning our own digital data, which can then be leveraged to improve ourselves and increase our value. This way, we become an asset to be improved, not an oil well to be extracted from.Fakebook‚Äôs business model, and market cap, assumes that a person‚Äôs digital data is ‚Äúownerless;‚Äù whoever can scrape and mine the most data about each of us (from whatever source) can do whatever they want with it. We have no say or control, can‚Äôt use it to improve ourselves, and we don‚Äôt financially benefit from its use.If there were to be a change in public tolerance or legal status around our digital data being ‚Äúownerless,‚Äù a Data Crisis may ensue and could possibly be more consequential than the 2007 Subprime Mortgage Crisis. The second, third, and fourth order consequences following a shift in data ownership to individuals could scramble economic and political power, concentration of engineers, revenue models, social norms, and incentive structures.In order to encourage investment into human improvement, people need to own their digital data. Here‚Äôs what that cycle of development will look like:The Economic System For Radical Human Improvement1. We digitally mine ourselves, converting everything knowable about us, into 0s and 1s. Think of it as your digital operating system. This is your property, like a house or car. This is your single most valuable asset as a human as it‚Äôs the key to your self improvement and future relevance.2. We leverage this digital representation of ourselves to begin radical cognitive improvement.3. Employers pay us more for improved abilities.4. Other businesses make money when we improve (versus making us worse versions of ourselves). Here is how this ecosystem might emerge: Changing Our Minds One Attebyte at a Time.5. With our profits, we build better tools to mine and improve ourselves.6. Better tools = faster self and community improvement.7. Human improvement ROI increases.In previous eras, improving oneself was a luxury. Now, it‚Äôs a necessity for our survival and relevance.It‚Äôs Time To Give AI A HugLike it, love it, or fear it, AI is here and here to stay.While there are plenty of well-founded conversations about how we proceed in thoughtfully building AI, it‚Äôs also our best co-evolutionary partner. Leveraging AI is simply the only shot we have at successfully managing complex systems such as geopolitical cooperation and conflict, resource management and our environment. Without AI, we will collapse under the complexity of our emerging world.More importantly, we need AI to offer us ‚Äústrategically unprecedented moves‚Äù.Looking one step further, AI is also essential in its enablement for our radical upleveling and evolution, a necessity for our future relevance and survival. AI creates a new opportunity for us to decide what is or is not worth our scarce cognitive resources.Imagine instead of spending years in school learning things that will be outdated by the time we graduate or will never use in life, we focus on exploring new and increasingly higher-order cognitive functions while AI takes care of the more functional aspects of society (i.e. self driving cars as a simple entry point to imagine ‚Äî why would we ever waste cognitive energy driving ourselves from one place to another?).In Changing Our Minds One Attebyte at a Time, I explain how this new neuroeconomy might develop. If we can‚Äôt get our act together and still manage to survive ourselves, it will be because AI somehow dragged us along with it.How we build and use AI, lives downstream from human minds, at least for now. This co-evolutionary neccessity, to simultaneously uplevel ourselves while building AI for a thriving future, cannot be overstated.We Need to Neutralize ThreatsOver the past few decades, society has built robust, swarm-like intelligence and infrastructure in digital intelligence (software and hardware). If a problem or opportunity arises in the world, or even a market need that can be addressed with digital intelligence, literally millions of talented software and hardware engineers, with cheap and powerful machines at their fingertips, leverage a vast ecosystem of tools, providers, knowledge, capital, etc. to address it instantaneously. We‚Äôve built the beginnings of global digital intelligence immune system.This is incredibly valuable for humanity.However, we do not yet have these same capabilities in biology, genetics, chemistry, or materials.Since you and I are built from biology, and we live on a big round ball of biology floating in space, that‚Äôs problematic.We need robust capabilities to respond in real-time to the risks that pose the greatest risk to our continued existence.I‚Äôve been trying to help build this global biological immune system with my venture fund, OS Fund. In 2013, after selling my company Braintree (Venmo) to Paypal, I seeded the fund with $100M and focused on investing in the hardest of sciences: biology, materials, chemistry and genomics ‚Äî technologies critical to our collective thriving and survival, yet underfunded globally relative to their importance and potential.Four years in, the fund performance is in the top decile among U.S. firms and of the 28 investments, we have 4 unicorns, 26 up valuations, and 2 exits.For more detailed explanations of what the companies are tangibly doing, plus some imagination exercises of how we might respond to certain risks (i.e. environmental), see OS Fund: Building A Global Biological Immune System.Work on Game Over Problems, not Horseshit ProblemsYou may have heard the ‚ÄúParable of Horseshit.‚Äù In New York in the early 1900s, one hundred thousand horses produced 2.5 million pounds of horse manure per day. Horses were the primary mechanism for transportation and industry, but the smell and the public health implications of being surrounded by horse manure were untenable.New Yorkers were terrified. They demanded change.Elections were won and lost on the issue; the greatest minds of the time were focused on figuring out a solution.Then, in 1908, Ford rolled the Model T off the assembly line and horse manure was literally no longer a problem. Horse manure went from being a Level-5 hurricane to a footnote of history.‚ÄúHorseshit problems‚Äù are the kind of problems that will likely be solved in the normal course of human innovation, science, and grit.For example, antibiotic resistance (ABR). I think ABR is a ‚Äúhorseshit problem‚Äù, not because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs serious or real (it is), but because I think we‚Äôll eventually figure out a technical solution that solves over-farming and over-prescribing.The economic incentives will drive the solution to ABR ‚Äî not any political, collective decision making.Our politics currently rely on poorly informed, irrational, illogical, and reality-distorted citizens with a myriad of competing demands (I include myself in this category) to make collective decisions about where to focus our resources. We cannot rely on political frameworks to find and identify Horseshit Problems ‚Äî it‚Äôs not their job.‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù problems are different. They‚Äôre the kinds of problems that end the human species, or perhaps less dramatically ‚Äî and likely first ‚Äî make the world inhospitable. These are problems like climate change, nuclear annihilation, and mass human economic irrelevance ‚Äî problems that no technical tweak can fix because they live at the core of our basic operating systems.Our political and economic systems are currently geared toward solving horseshit problems by rewarding short term solutions and smaller problems at the expense of addressing Game Over problems.Future literacy demands that we develop systems to identify and drive collective resources to Game Over problems, driven by a methodical data driven analysis, prioritizing the gravest and most immediate threats to humanity.Factfullness, is a useful guide in demonstrating ways to make data driven conclusions about the world instead of persisting in our self-created distorted reality.It‚Äôs Time to Update Our Belief Systems, Now.Science progresses one funeral at a time.
Max PlanckWe are stuck in our ancient brains ‚Äî hardware/software hundreds of thousands years old ‚Äî and our belief systems aren‚Äôt much better. In many ways, we are still stuck in the Cognitive Paleolithic.Belief systems are the gears of society, determining speed and torque. They‚Äôre the most powerful technology to facilitate mass human cooperation and also one of our biggest liabilities.Belief systems are also serious business. More people have died from conflict over belief systems than any other cause in history.I know first hand how hard it is to update a personal belief system. I was raised in a devout Mormon family and community and it was my singular reality for more than 30 years. When I finally concluded, after much anguish, that I no longer believed in what they taught, leaving the organization and regaining my footing elsewhere was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done.We struggle to update our belief systems even when we have clear economic incentives to do so. For example, twelve percent of the original Fortune 500 still exist. The other 88% couldn‚Äôt update their belief systems fast enough to see, adapt, and build the next thing. They‚Äôre now extinct.History has repeatedly proven that updating our belief systems is vital. Humans used to attribute illness to mystical influences; now that we understand the atomic, chemical, and biological nature of disease, we have updated our belief systems to compensate. Had we not progressed beyond leeching and prayer, we would not have the lifesaving medicines and procedures many of us have access to today.We now need more inclusive belief systems that recognize the interconnected nature of our fates, versus those that just opt to take care of a singular tribe at the expense of everyone else. We share a single planet, and whether we like it or not, we‚Äôre in this together.An example of caring for a tribe at the exclusion of others, and even, ultimately, only being responsible for yourself, is an unintended consequence of many religions.Take Judeo-Christianity as an example. A person‚Äôs ‚Äúsalvation‚Äù is not inextricably tied to anyone else‚Äôs salvation. Service, kindness, forgiveness, etc. are all encouraged, but in the end, the religious adherents quest to achieve the ultimate goal of ‚Äúsalvation‚Äù is only responsible for themselves. While they may have commandments to be zealous in converting others to the religion, ultimately: you obey the commandments, you get heaven, and win the game. In this case, religion is a single-player sport.This is not how we survive as a species.For humans to be successful in the future, we must play a multi-billion person sport. Any desirable future we can contemplate hinges upon the cooperation of a large percentage of our roughly 8 billion people. We are all interconnected, our fates intertwined.Our ability to build a future we love depends on our ability to adapt our belief systems to reflect the realities we live in. This means being more flexible and nimble in our response to external circumstances. Entrenchment in old beliefs will prevent us from leveraging the exceptional possibilities we have before us.The faster we can create new belief systems to encourage mass cooperation towards our collective well-being, in this life, the higher our probability that we‚Äôll each get the things we most care about.I was recently in the Middle Eastern desert where a business associate was telling me about the 2030 plans for his country.‚ÄúPlanning for 2030 will be difficult,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThe world will change many times over between now and then.‚ÄùHe gave me a skeptical glance.‚ÄúOk, let‚Äôs play a game,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou and I need a plan to get a robot over that sand hill sitting on the horizon, and we can‚Äôt intervene once it sets off. There are two ways we can do this. First, topographically map the area and chart the path. The problem? Within minutes of departing, the sands will shift and the robot will be stuck in the sand. The other way would be to first acknowledge that we can‚Äôt predict how and when the sands will shift, so let‚Äôs identify the end point and then give the robot the tools it will need to adapt on a second by second basis.‚ÄùDrawing maps in the sand won‚Äôt be a winning strategy.The future is unpredictable, and becoming even more unpredictable. The only way to succeed in this environment is to prioritize future literacy and adaptability ‚Äî in ourselves and society.Never before has the distance between imagination and creation been so narrow.In the past, we didn‚Äôt have the sophisticated tools to build the world we dream about and aspire towards. Now we do.It‚Äôs the best opportunity any of us could ever ask for.Like you, I‚Äôve got stuff to do tomorrow (stuff I‚Äôm really excited about!). And I‚Äôve got stuff going on tomorrow‚Äôs tomorrow. And tomorrow‚Äôs tomorrow‚Äôs tomorrow. In fact, tomorrows for decades to come.If we want to ensure we all get as many tomorrows as we want, it‚Äôs time to get to work.The size of scope of these ideas really requires something like a book. It‚Äôs why writing this condensed 5,000 word version has taken me more than 82 drafts and the remarkable patience of my girlfriend. If these ideas interest you, I‚Äôll continue to write about them, and you can receive them via my weekly(ish) emails.Subscribe to be in touch!Footnotes1.

169,Breaking Down the Massive 4-Team NBA Blockbuster Trade,https://medium.com/sportsraid/nba-blockbuster-trade-analysis-rockets-timberwolves-hawks-nuggets-basketball-covington-capela-2020-deadline-699a00c9ef3b?source=extreme_main_feed---------172-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"W
HILE YOU WERE SLEEPING LAST NIGHT, THE NBA EXPLODED WITH ITS BIGGEST TRADE IN 20 YEARS. The Houston Rockets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, and Denver Nuggets combined for a four-team blockbuster trade involving Clint Capela, Robert Covington, 10 more players, and a handful of draft picks.In all, 12 players were moved, the most since Patrick Ewing was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics in 2000, if that gives you any sense of how rare these massive blockbuster deals are. The Rockets went all-in on small ball, while the Hawks got a center they coveted. The Wolves went fishing for assets, while the Nuggets got one for a few players they weren‚Äôt using much.So who won and who lost the deal, and how does everything shake out for all four teams? Let‚Äôs break the trade down one team at a time‚Ä¶Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Jarred Vanderbilt2020 Houston first, Noah Vonleh, Shabazz Napier, Keita Bates-Diop, Gerald GreenWe‚Äôll start with Denver, because they‚Äôre easy.Despite the number of names here, there‚Äôs not a ton that needs to be said. Malik Beasley and Juancho Hernangomez are talented but neither has really established themselves in Denver. Both will be free agents this summer and would‚Äôve surely been expected to leave. Juancho and Vanderbilt weren‚Äôt even in the rotation. Beasley was, depending on the night, but pretty low on the totem pole.Essentially Denver consolidated three low-value assets whose value was about to expire and turned them into Houston‚Äôs first-round pick. That should come in the 20-to-25 range and essentially replaces Denver‚Äôs own pick, which they traded for Jerami Grant. So in a way, the Nuggets traded this trio for Jerami Grant, which works. Otherwise they got a pick which probably gets traded again as a singular asset. That‚Äôs good work.There‚Äôs a decent chance no one Denver traded here would have even played in many of their playoff games this year. If you need a reminder, here‚Äôs the talent ahead of those names in the pecking order: Murray, Harris, Barton, Millsap, Jokic, Grant, Porter, Morris, Plumlee, and Craig. That‚Äôs 10 guys, and both Napier and Vonleh can play, too. Vonleh‚Äôs even good enough to allow Denver to move Plumlee‚Äôs expiring deal if they can find a second trade before tomorrow.It stinks to move on from young talent, but Denver was going to lose these guys for nothing this summer. Getting a pick instead at very little cost is sweet.2020 Brooklyn first, Evan Turner, 2024 Golden State secondClint Capela, Nene HilarioAtlanta is a pretty clean analysis too. Nene and Turner are irrelevant. Turner is bad money on an expiring deal, and Nene will be cut in a few days. I‚Äôm not too sure why the Hawks had to include the Warriors pick here, but it‚Äôs hard to care too much about a second-round pick five drafts away.Essentially the Hawks traded a first-round pick for Clint Capela. And that sure seems like a slam dunk.First, note that this is Brooklyn‚Äôs pick, not Atlanta‚Äôs. The Hawks got this one for taking on Allen Crabbe‚Äôs bad salary into cap space they weren‚Äôt using anyway, and now they‚Äôre moving that pick for Capela. That‚Äôs awesome business. It‚Äôs also great business for the Hawks trading their least valuable pick, keeping all of their own. The Nets pick should be in the 15‚Äìto-17 range this year in a bad draft. There‚Äôs little chance the Hawks could‚Äôve gotten someone anywhere nearly as good as Capela, and it would‚Äôve taken years to develop them and find out even if they did.I love the Capela fit in Atlanta. The Hawks had one of the worst center rotations in the league and badly needed a defensive center. Capela is a good defender and a great rim runner and rebounder. As a sheer talent, Capela is just fine, and honestly, he‚Äôs probably a little worse than he looks so far because Houston‚Äôs system and James Harden have surely inflated his value.But as an asset, Capela is much more valuable. He‚Äôs only 25 years old and on a four-year $66-million contract. That‚Äôs a very palatable deal that will pay for Capela‚Äôs entire prime. Is Capela a better player than Andre Drummond or Steven Adams, other names the Hawks had been rumored to trade for? No, probably not. But as an asset, he‚Äôs far more valuable. Drummond would‚Äôve likely cost Atlanta almost twice as much to sign this summer. With Capela, Atlanta still has well over $50 million in cap room, most of any team.Capela fits what Atlanta is doing far better than Drummond or Adams too. The Hawks already have guys that need the ball in their hands. Capela sets mean screens and rolls hard to the rim, and he‚Äôs #blessed to go from one top-10 passer (arguably two) to another in Trae Young. On defense, Capela does the dirty work and is exactly what this team needs. He isn‚Äôt going to be some magical fix for a team with Young and John Collins, but he‚Äôs a start, and he‚Äôs far better than anything the team had.Atlanta will eventually need to start doling out money to Trae, Collins, and Kevin Huerter on contract extensions, and then to De‚ÄôAndre Hunter and this year‚Äôs likely top-7 pick on down the line. Capela‚Äôs bargain deal will be even more valuable on this roster as it ages.As an asset with a contract, I‚Äôd rank Capela as a top-10 non-rookie-deal center in the league. He might even be top-5 or 7. He‚Äôs obviously behind guys like Jokic, Towns, Embiid, and Gobert. I think anyone else is arguable. I‚Äôd probably prefer Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Jusuf Nurkic, and a few others along with a number of rookie deals. The point is this ‚Äî an above average starting center on a cheap deal is very valuable, even in the modern NBA.Can Capela play well enough to stay on the court when the games matter most? He couldn‚Äôt for Houston. That‚Äôs not going to be a problem for Atlanta, who won‚Äôt be playing in any conference finals the next four years. Great deal either way.Robert Covington, Shabazz Napier, Noah Vonleh, Jordan Bell, Keita Bates-Diop2020 Brooklyn first, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Jarred Vanderbilt, Evan TurnerIt really feels like this deal makes some sense for all four teams, but Minnesota‚Äôs side is definitely the one I like least. At best, it‚Äôs incomplete. At worst, it‚Äôs a rushed panic move.The Wolves gave up the best player in the trade in Robert Covington. In return they got potentially nothing that affects the team long-term. That‚Äôs a problem.You might not know many of the names in this deal, so here‚Äôs a quick breakdown. Napier won a championship at UConn but hasn‚Äôt done much in the NBA, though he‚Äôd been starting at point guard. Vonleh and Bell are serviceable bench big men. Bates-Diop has some upside but never found much playing time. All four of those names are gone but aren‚Äôt a real loss. Napier, Vonleh, and Bell were summer signings that made some impact and are probably being moved on in good faith so they have a chance to get to the playoffs. Losing KBD is a bummer.Evan Turner is a longtime veteran that has never impressed me as an NBA player. He‚Äôs essentially my nightmare scenario outcome for Jarrett Culver as a good-not-great defender that can‚Äôt shoot and needs the ball in his hands on offense but doesn‚Äôt pop athletically. Hopefully Culver can learn some of Turner‚Äôs positives the next few months, if Turner isn‚Äôt bought out.The Brooklyn pick is‚Ä¶ fine. It will probably end up in the 15-to-17 range in a pretty bad draft this year. That makes it a lottery ticket, or maybe it gives Minnesota ammunition to add to its own pick to move up a few spots for a shot at a star. Gerrson Rosas is hunting stars, and this is all just asset play, churning through names and assets, trying to find something that works.The Nets pick is lottery protected, so there is a bit of risk involved here. The East playoff picture is pretty soft, but if Kyrie Irving gets hurt again and the Nets miss the playoffs, the pick rolls over to next summer when it would likely be in the #25 range with Kyrie and Kevin Durant back. That would be relatively disastrous for the Wolves since the pick is the crown jewel of the trade for them.Malik Beasley is a classic gunner two guard. He‚Äôs the sort of guy that can win you a game if he gets hot or shoot you right out of when if he‚Äôs not. Beasley has made 39% of his threes the last two seasons and hit 86% from the line. He‚Äôs the sort of shooter Minnesota simply did not have, and he can create his own shot and isn‚Äôt afraid of the moment. Beasley isn‚Äôt much of a passer and isn‚Äôt good on defense ‚Äî hence the classic gunner two. But he can score in a hurry and it‚Äôs easy to see him fitting well as a nice complement next to Culver.Juancho Hernangomez has been a longtime favorite for nerds like me, though he might be a AAAA player. He looks good in Summer League and international play (for Spain) but has never established much playing time, and he‚Äôs a tweener big man that lacks strength. Juancho has started 37 games in his career, averaging 11/7 with 46/39/75 shooting splits. He fits theoretically next to Karl-Anthony Towns, though it will be a disaster defensively.Jarred Vanderbilt is a lottery ticket, like KBD was. Vanderbilt is a genuinely incredible rebounder who doesn‚Äôt really have an NBA position or any other NBA skills. Can‚Äôt hurt to take a look. Vanderbilt is the sort of out-of-the-box player Rosas loves giving a chance to. He fits with guys like Naz Reid, Jake Layman, and Jordan Bell as Rosas hunts cheap value, and eventually someone will hit.With both Beasley and Juancho, the key factor here is that both are in the final year of their rookie contracts. That means they‚Äôll both be free agents this summer, and it ostensibly means the Wolves could‚Äôve signed either one for free this summer, though that‚Äôs not really true. The team is strapped for cap room and Denver could‚Äôve matched any offer.You‚Äôd have to think the team definitely plans on keeping Beasley. His contract negotiations will directly determine how valuable he is. Many restricted free agents get screwed in negotiations, and in a summer with very little cap room out there, a patient Minnesota could luck into a bargain Beasley deal. But the flip side could also happen. All it takes is one team, and a lot of teams can use a young shooter. What if someone offers Beasley $60 million over the next four years? The Wolves will now be compelled to match so they don‚Äôt walk away from the Covington trade with no players to show for it, and now they‚Äôre stuck with a very overpriced player. That‚Äôs the risk-reward game here.The same is true with Juancho, but to a far lesser extent. He could actually get some starts next to Towns, but his market and eventual price should be much more tepid. It‚Äôs important the Wolves play Hernangomez enough to see what they‚Äôve got. He could easily become a bargain deal if they choose to keep him.Beasley, Hernangomez, and Vanderbilt are nice young assets with upside. That‚Äôs exactly what this roster needs right now.But were they worth the price?Covington was the best trade asset on the roster, and now he‚Äôs gone, and all Minnesota has to show for it are a few expiring rookie deals and a middling pick in a bad draft. Minnesota essentially traded Covington for two first but then flipped the Houston first for the Denver players.But what was the urgency to trade Covington now? 3-and-D players are always valuable, and Covington‚Äôs the sort of guy that would help almost any playoff team. He still had 2-and-a-half years on his deal and plays on one of the league‚Äôs most valuable non-max non-rookie contracts.Was this really the best Minnesota could get for Covington? Sure, the Nets pick is a handful of spots higher than a pick from a playoff team, but what‚Äôs that really worth in this draft? Is that Brooklyn pick really worth much as an outgoing trade asset in a deal for D‚ÄôAngelo Russell or whoever the next piece is? Is it worth anything comparable to Covington? I find that very hard to believe.Covington was always going to get traded, and sooner than later, but this felt like a rushed decision. He‚Äôs a good NBA starter, and Minnesota didn‚Äôt get any starters in return. Beasley probably won‚Äôt be one, and neither will the draft pick. I think Minnesota should have held onto Covington and waited for the right deal. Now they‚Äôre still stuck with bad Wiggins and Dieng contracts and no real way to get off those contracts, let alone adding to the team.The good news is the team should stink the rest of the season, so a top-5 pick should be on its way. The defense will be disastrous without Covington, and the team literally doesn‚Äôt have an NBA point guard on the roster. Trading Covington now is sort of like trading up a few spots in this summer‚Äôs draft, and it‚Äôs a draft loaded with lead guard prospects, so now Minnesota is in much better position to get their pick of the litter.Baby steps I guess.2020 Houston first, Clint Capela, Gerald Green, Nene HilarioRobert Covington, Jordan Bell, 2024 Golden State secondThe Rockets are the most interesting team in the trade as the only team to trade one starter for another, especially since those starters are so different. We‚Äôll see if this Rockets team can still sing a Capela. *cough cough*Daryl Morey and Mike D‚ÄôAntoni have never been half-measure guys. Now they go as all-in as they‚Äôve ever gone before on threes and small ball. With Capela gone, Covington and Bell are now the tallest rotation player on Houston‚Äôs roster. The Rockets will play Covington and P.J. Tucker as their effective big men in their biggest minutes this season. Covington is 6'8""; Tucker is 6'6"" in sneakers.Capela was good for the Rockets, but it‚Äôs hard to forget how easily he was played off the court in Houston‚Äôs biggest playoff moments. Houston is all-in on the present with what they‚Äôve invested into James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who make a combined $783 billion or so over the next few years. This year is their best window at a title ‚Äî Russ, Harden, and Tucker will only get older, and the window is more open this season with the Warriors and Nets sitting this year out as stars heal.Can Houston really win a title?Before this trade, the answer was a pretty easy no for me. Westbrook is not what he once was, Capela can‚Äôt stay on the court against the league‚Äôs elite, and the team has no bench or backup plan.Now? Maybe.The best version of Robert Covington is an elite, game-changing player. Covington is a career 36% three-point shooter, and that number should tick up a couple percents with two elite passers and all the spacing in the world. He‚Äôs made 38% of his career corner threes. Covington can‚Äôt create or even dribble really, but he won‚Äôt be asked to do either of those things in Houston ‚Äî just shoot the second he touches it. A 38% three is equal to 1.14 points per possession. That‚Äôll do just fine in this offense, or any offense really, and Harden will do the rest.Capela‚Äôs absence is also super helpful for Westbrook. Before the trade, Houston‚Äôs best lineups always had two non-shooters on the floor. Now it‚Äôll just be Russ, and he should benefit from the added spacing with Covington standing in the corner instead of Capela waiting with his defender in the paint. Watch Westbrook‚Äôs numbers, especially his two-point %, rise.Covington in place of Capela should also help the defense. Houston has been best defensively when it switches everything, and Covington is a perfect fit as such. He‚Äôs going to struggle if he has to defend LeBron, Giannis, or any star big men, but guess what? Houston had no answer to any of those guys anyway. Their better answer is strong team defense with quick rotations, and Covington will be the best on the team at that, far better than Capela.Yes, Houston is going to have some ugly games when guys like Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, and Nikola Jokic crush them in the post. But you know what? I think the Rockets are perfectly fine with opponents feeding the post all game. This is the team that‚Äôs all-in on 3>2. Go ahead, post up all game ‚Äî eat your heart out. You‚Äôre still going to miss plenty of shots, and Houston will still shoot enough threes to make the math work.And make no mistake about it ‚Äî those three-point attempt numbers will be higher than ever now, probably approaching 50 a game, with Capela gone. And that‚Äôs what makes Houston so very dangerous now: variance. Three pointers are fickle. Sometimes you miss 25 in a row with your championship hopes on the line. Houston knows that full well. But sometimes they drop, too.What will Houston do in a playoff series against Brow or Jokic? That‚Äôs a great question. But what will either of those teams do if Houston hits 25 of their 50 threes that night or if James Harden is the best player on the court? Those are both real possibilities now, and by the way, this new team matches up a whole lot better with teams like the Clippers and Bucks.Houston is a much higher variance team now, and that‚Äôs a good thing. Would you rather be the 7th best team in the league with variance that could make you 4rd or 12th best any given night? Or the 9th best team with the downside of the 20th best team but the upside of 2nd or even 1st? Houston prefers the latter, and this is their bet on variance and math and a chance at the unthinkable.And it might not work! Variance goes both ways. Houston could easily lose in the first round in five games, blow it up, move on from Morey and D‚ÄôAntoni, and start over. But they now have the upside to make a Conference Finals run, and if they get that far, anything can happen.That‚Äôs why the Houston Rockets are going all-in on Robert Covington and small ball. Can‚Äôt wait to see if it works. ‚ñ†Follow Brandon on Medium or @wheatonbrando for more sports, television, humor, and culture. Visit the rest of Brandon‚Äôs writing archives here.WRITTEN BY"
170,Iconic Icons: Designing the World of Windows,https://medium.com/microsoft-design/iconic-icons-designing-the-world-of-windows-5e70e25e5416?source=extreme_main_feed---------173-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"To design for Windows is to design for the world. Today, Windows 10 powers hundreds of millions of devices around the globe: in schools, homes, offices, and on the go. It‚Äôs part of the history of computing itself, and designers have been along for the journey since the outset, bringing the aesthetic principles of design to a new paradigm of user-friendly computing.That journey has evolved remarkably, always with a focus on the way people rely on technology to achieve their best. The Windows 1.0 operating system (OS) premiered to the world in 1985 (no old jokes, please). Microsoft held a steady strategy in the early years of Windows: build it, release it, build it again. These were predictable 3-year cycles in which Windows was literally shipped in a box. Rhythms began to change with the onset of the early web when people were introduced to the idea of being super-connected to all the world‚Äôs information. Over time, this new behavior shifted from desktop to mobile. Computing, knowledge, and global connection became even more ubiquitous.Fast forward to the era of Windows 10 and the concept of the personal computer (the PC, fondly) means something entirely different than it did three decades ago. It‚Äôs estimated that there are four connected devices per person, with that number rising steadily. As designers, this signals to us that modern life is complicated. And as designers for Windows, this signals a need for simplicity at the systems level.In terms of a system, we can look to the Windows icons as a means of wayfinding. Systems are inherently complex and icons provide simple points of reference. We may not even realize how much we rely on these subtle cues to navigate the OS ‚Äî our brains are amazing machines that synthesize this information in the background. We rely on that cognitive machinery when we design, helping the mind multitask, organize, and communicate.This design choreography becomes more critical as technology advances. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve embarked on a multi-year effort across Microsoft‚Äôs design teams to redesign our icons: a system within a system. Flat, monochrome icons look great in context of colorful tiles, but as more icon styles enter the ecosystem, this approach needs to evolve. When icons in the taskbar and Start menu are different styles, it creates more cognitive load to scan and find applications. We needed to incorporate more visual cues into the icon design language using our modernized Fluent Design Language.Put simply: we evolved. Our experience ecosystems are incredibly intricate and have started to spill out of Windows into third-party platforms like Android, iOS, and Mac. We‚Äôre dedicated to making our icons familiar, beautiful, and inclusive within the modern phenomena of cross-platform, cross-device experiences.When updating the language of the system, we didn‚Äôt move away from established iconography: the translation from function to image that‚Äôs become familiar to our brains. Research shows that people want consistency in design and connection to brand, with enough differences to aid in recognition. We stretched the language to allow for literal representations as well as abstract metaphors while maintaining a common DNA that ties them all together.Leveraging the Fluent Design System, we introduced depth and color to our iconography. These additional cues are subtle, but they make a world of difference when scanning an interface. We live among multiple operating systems, constantly switching between tasks, priorities, and identities. The addition of color also gives a cohesive design language across platforms: the icon that‚Äôs familiar in Windows 10 is the same on Android, iOS, and Mac, providing a wayfinding path across your digital life. The new rounded corners across the Windows 10 interface achieve the same goal: making these icons feel like they live in the real world; something familiar and approachable to grab onto.Most people will start to see new icons as app updates from the Microsoft Store. If you‚Äôre a Windows Insider in the Release Preview ring, the Mail and Calendar icons rolled out this morning. And if you‚Äôre an Insider in the Fast ring, you‚Äôll start to see some the new icons today and even more in the coming months.This real-world journey continues with designers across Microsoft sharing insights, research, and feedback to make the best possible system for our global customers. Redesigning these icons signals our commitment to the evolution of the Windows OS, honoring its legacy while redefining the archetype in which it lives. We love learning about the ways our customers rely on Windows to work, learn, play, and achieve, inspired by how the humble operating system can simplify modern life. Keep talking to us!Thanks to my collaborators: Danielle McClune (writing), Maxwell Prendergast, Ryan Bickel, and Mike LaJoie (visuals), and everyone across Microsoft who helps make Windows great.To stay in-the-know with Microsoft Design, follow us on Dribbble, Twitter and Facebook, or join our Windows Insider program.

171,The Fourth Industrial Revolution: The Rise Of The Autonomous Economy,https://medium.com/the-capital/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-the-rise-of-the-autonomous-economy-cfe0886ad8b3?source=extreme_main_feed---------174-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"To understand the present, one has to research the past. To see the future, one has to feel the momentum building in the present.When examining the past, it becomes clear that advancements in technology have undoubtedly been the leading driver in the progression of human civilization. Just like the wheel and compass revolutionized previous generations, developments of the smartphone and the Internet have completely changed society today, making it hard to even imagine a world without them. While it‚Äôs easy to look back in history and identify the key breakthroughs, most people are unable to foresee the technological innovations of the future before they become fully embedded into everyday life. In fact, most new technologies are ridiculed in their beginning stages, with ‚Äúexperts‚Äù claiming they‚Äôre unachievable and unnecessary.However, despite the doubt that stubbornly clouds the present, many believe that current technological trends are on the precipice of igniting a fourth industrial revolution; this time sparked by the rise of mass automation. While economies directed by humans are likely to never disappear, what is starting to happen is the formation of a parallel economy run entirely by machines. Similar to industrial revolutions of the past, the current one is coalescing around certain technological breakthroughs, specifically in the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).While the average person has little to no awareness of what‚Äôs coming, the trajectory of modern technology isn‚Äôt going unnoticed by everyone. Brian Arthur, an economist famous for developing the modern approach to increasing returns, has proposed a thesis to describe the phenomenon and coined it, ‚Äúthe autonomy economy.‚Äù Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, has echoed comparable sentiments and even wrote a book about it called ‚ÄúThe Fourth Industrial Revolution.‚ÄùBefore taking a closer look at current technological trends, it‚Äôs beneficial to study the impacts that the first three industrial revolutions had on society. Possessing historical knowledge can go a long way in helping one envision how the Fourth Industrial Revolution will impact the future.The Industrial Revolutions of PastThe previous three industrial revolutions have all been driven by a series of separate, but interconnected technological innovations that vastly increased humanities ability to produce output, while greatly reducing the input needed to obtain it, whether through reduction in labor, time, or materials. These advancements not only remade society from an economic sense, but also reshaped the whole concept of how humans perceived their day-to-day lives.The First Industrial Revolution:From roughly 1750‚Äì1850, the First Industrial Revolution took place and was predominantly the result of humanity‚Äôs ability to harness two key energy sources, steam and coal. The main driver of the first industrial revolution was a succession of engineering breakthroughs in the steam engine, along with the discovery of a cheaper more abundant mineral, coal. The combination eventually gave rise to coal powered external combustion steam engines, capable of producing far more energy at a cheaper price than ever before. This new input lead to major transformations in manufacturing and was used to fuel radical changes in several industries, such as textiles, metal works (especially Iron), and transportation.Some of history‚Äôs most famous inventions were developed during this time period, like the cotton gin, a machine used to separate cotton fibers from their seeds, and the power loom, a machine used to weave cloths and tapestries. Other notable breakthroughs include the development of machine tools, the rediscovery of cement, the introduction of sheet glass, and the burning of coal to produce gaslight.Prior to the First Industrial Revolution, most goods were made locally and the work of individual craftsmen, but after the commercialization of coal powered steam engines, large industries formed, able to produce products for a much wider consumer base. A foundational shift occurred in society from being a rural agrarian culture to the buildup of industrial cities centered around large manufacturing factories. The work force no longer was dominated by individual laborers, but instead was slowly being replaced by industries run by capitalists that employed the working class. Cities started to become the economic powerhouses of whole nations. The trend wouldn‚Äôt slow down either, as it wouldn‚Äôt be long before a second industrial revolution would take place, potentially even more impactful than the first.The Second Industrial Revolution:Also known as the Technological Revolution, the Second Industrial Revolution lasted from about 1870‚Äì1914 (the start of WW1) and can be best described as a mastering of the technology introduced in the First Industrial Revolution, mixed with two major breakthroughs of its own: the harnessing of two new energy sources: electricity and petroleum.Thanks to more advanced developments in iron and steel production, machine parts began to be produced in bulk and standardized across industries, such as standard sizes for screws and metal bars. Intricate railway infrastructure opened across several advanced countries, as well as the development of the steam turbine engine, which revolutionized naval vessels. Essentially, society developed far superior transport routes for all the factory products that were being mass-produced. Markets really began to open up during this period due to increased speed of transportation and decreased price of machine-driven production.The culminating outgrowth towards the end of the second industrial revolution has to be electricity and petroleum. Even the modern world of today is completely dependent on electricity and oil. Electrification is often seen as the biggest advancement of the 20th century because it gave society a cheap, abundant source of energy that would not only power factories and homes at any time of the day, but would lay the foundation for all the devices to come later. While electricity was vital, oil has been the most sought after commodity of the last century. It‚Äôs been the dominant fuel source for powering most transportation vehicles, whether it‚Äôs cars, airplanes, or farming equipment. It‚Äôs also given rise to a vast array of consumer products (plastic), fertilizers/chemicals, and medicines.There were other major advancements during this time as well, such as in communication with inventions of the telegraph, telephone, and radio. Paper making machines also started to gain traction in the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in new abilities to spread knowledge, news, and literature across continents. Finally, developments in rubber production lead to the mass production of tires that aided in the inventions of bicycles, cars, and airplanes.It‚Äôs important to grasp how the First Industrial Revolution was the technological bang that started the concept of modern industrial economies, while the Second Industrial Revolution was the mastering of the technology, giving rise to modern cities filled with the first skyscrapers. With countries able to trade and communicate like never before, the world was entering into the beginning stages of its move towards globalization. The trend would only continue too, and eventually reach unprecedented levels starting in the last half of the 20th century. Society would experience a radical new technological bang: the Digital Revolution.The Third Industrial Revolution:Starting around the late 1950s up until the present day, the Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the Digital Revolution, has taken root in society and is mainly the culmination of a shift from mechanical and analogue electronic technology to digital electronics. The two major outgrowths have been digital computing and communication technology. The fast computation of computers, mixed with the interconnection of the Internet and satellite broadcasting, has created a digital architecture where information can be instantly shared all around the world by devices with far faster processing speeds than humans. It‚Äôs no wonder people refer to this time period as the Age of Information.The abundance of digital information is the result of a mastery of electricity and precision craftsmanship, which combines to birth ever-improving microprocessors, aka computer chips. From smart phones and HD television screen to high-end photography equipment and drones, computer chips are the backbone of all advanced electronics. Interestingly, all these technologies have consistently been replaced with better versions within a small period of time. The phone is a good example, going from the payphone, to the landline, to the cell phone, to the smartphone, and potentially becoming a biotechnology next.Just like manufacturing innovations of the 1st and 2nd industrial revolutions lead to the construction of industrial cities using all the materials being produced, the electronic innovations of the 3rd and 4th industrial revolutions are leading to the construction of intelligent applications using all the data being produced.The Fourth Industrial RevolutionTo wrap one‚Äôs mind around the fourth industrial revolution, it‚Äôs important to understand the concept of intelligence. The best way to grasp intelligence is to think about how it is obtained, which is usually a four step process.1) Gather data2) Process the data using previous data as reference3) Take action based off the refined data4) Receive feedback data, learn from the result, and store it all in memory.The process is a cyclical loop of continually gathering data, processing it, taking action, and receiving feedback. The more times someone goes through the process, the more intelligent they become, assuming they‚Äôre able to learn from their actions. Two key factors underpinning it all are exposure to as much data as possible and developing impeccable pattern recognition skills.Patterns not only point out what works vs. what doesn‚Äôt work, strengths vs. weaknesses, and trends vs. anomalies, but it helps people categorize information so it‚Äôs easy to remember for future use. Superior pattern recognition that leads to improved mental and physical capabilities is the backbone of harnessing intelligence. As Albert Einstein once said, ‚ÄúThe measure of intelligence is the ability to change.‚Äù The only way someone is going to change is by being exposed to a negative pattern holding them back or see a better pattern to get ahead. The last step is implementation through will power and action.If technology is to replicate intelligence and develop it into a digital commodity sold on the open market, then it must be harnessed using the same model. While most are unaware of recent developments, current technology is opening up new possibilities on this front, specifically due to advancements in the IoT industry, AI, DLT, and a few other macro trends. Utilizing advancements in hardware, software, and data, technology is on the verge of manufacturing intelligence. The autonomous economy is closer than most think.The Internet of Things (IoT):A major outgrowth of the Digital Age has been the mass production of data. It‚Äôs become such a recognized sensation that people started saying that ‚Äúdata is the new oil‚Äù. There are really two categories of data: public data and private data. The Internet is the largest oil well of public data and is unique because it‚Äôs an ever-increasing resource. Private data is mostly concentrated on private servers, especially in Clouds, and contains sensitive information that people either don‚Äôt want to freely share or don‚Äôt want seen. It shouldn‚Äôt really be surprising anymore that many of the largest companies in the world own the most data, like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Baidu.Most of the data gathered today is done through the use of applications, such as Google gathering data based off search results, or Facebook gathering data based off your social profile, or even Amazon gathering data based off people‚Äôs spending habits. Essentially, companies host applications that consumers willing use and then collect data metrics based off their activity. There are also open-source applications that anyone can derive metrics from like markets, sports, or open case records.However, to harness intelligence capable of making quick judgments like humans, there must be access to real-time data. Until recently, real-time data has been hard to come by, but now, thanks to some major innovations in sensor and actuator technology, it‚Äôs become a real reality. All types of sensor activity is possible, such as sensors that measure temperature, location, speed, acceleration, depth, pressure, blood chemistry, air quality, color, photo-scanning, voice scanning, biometrics, electric, and magnetic force. Normally, humans are required to take such measurements, but that is quickly changing due to the mass production of cheap, yet accurate sensors and actuators. They‚Äôre not only placed in the environment, but within machines, like industrial machinery and robotics, and within/on humans, like a Fit or high-tech pacemakers.If there is going to be an autonomous economy, there needs to be a river of real-time information constantly flowing. The only way that autonomous action is effective is if it can respond quickly with confident judgments. Having the ability to monitor intricate details in real-time about a facility, its equipment, the environment it operates in, and even its workers (humans or robots), is transformational on many levels and has yet to be seen in mass. Essentially, everything, both physical to non-physical, is being brought online as data into an interconnected web, hence the name, the Internet of Things. It‚Äôs the human senses in digital form.However, raw data is only as good as the filtering mechanism that analyzes it. Without proper analysis, applications would be like animals acting off instinct, which is why artificial intelligence is an important component of automation.Artificial Intelligence (AI):Whereas data is the fuel for intelligence, the brain is the engine that takes in data, cross-references it with previous data, sorts it into categories, makes judgments, triggers actions in the real world, and puts it into storage. The human brain is incredibly powerful and still remains a mystery to scientists. It‚Äôs the organ that truly separates humans from any other species on the planet, due to its cognitive abilities. As a result, replicating the human brain as a technology is going to be very complex and take a significant amount of time to master. However, breakthroughs are beginning to take place in the field of artificial intelligence, giving companies that ability to run software that mimics human intelligence in some form.According to Adelyn Zhou, a leading voice in AI and the Marketing Director for Chainlink, there are seven types of artificial intelligence:1) Act- systems that act based off rules like a smoke detector or cruise control.2) Predict- systems that are capable of analyzing data and producing probabilistic predictions based on the data, like targeted ads or suggested content.3) Learn- systems that make judgments based off predictions, such as self-driving cars that act based of sensor data coming in.4) Create- systems that create based off data, such as designing an art piece, architecting buildings, or composing music.5) Relate- systems that pick up emotions based of facial, text, voice, and body language analysis, such as voice to text application and facial scan technology.6) Master- systems that transfer intelligence across domains, such as recognizing that four different pictures all represent the same idea/word.7) Evolve- systems that can upgrade themselves at the software or hardware level, such as humans in the future having the ability to download intelligence into their brain like it‚Äôs software.The basic idea is that new software is able to take in new data, process it against huge databases of stored information, make judgments that lead to real word actions, and receive feedback that can used to learn from. The whole process is nothing more than a software algorithm that‚Äôs able to evolve the more it interacts with data. It‚Äôs no wonder AI is becoming the main focus of Google considering they have the most data on Earth.While most people might not think of streaming songs from Pandora or suggested videos from YouTube as artificial intelligence, that‚Äôs exactly what it is. YouTube servers offer a wide variety of videos on the platform, users click on videos they want to watch, they give feedback on those videos, such as a thumb up/down or leaving metadata in the form of how long they watched the video, and the feedback is then used to update the software algorithm. The AI software can also take someone‚Äôs activity and cross reference it with the data of other users who like similar videos, to then suggest better selections. Effectively, it‚Äôs self-evolving algorithm changing based on input data. This type of AI is referred to as machine learning.Some of the more recent advancements however, have come through the development of neural networks used for deep learning. Neural networks are a subset of machine learning that centers around algorithms modeled after the human brain, specifically recognizing patterns and categorizing/classifying information by comparing it to known information. Deep learning is a type of neural network that has layers based on related concepts or decision trees, where the answer of one question leads to a deeper related question until the data is properly identified.The main idea is to design software that can make decisions based off of data instead of human intervention. Today‚Äôs software perform simple functions based off inputs, but AI software take actions across industries and evolve in the actions it takes based of its ability to take in a much larger set of inputs. AI software is intelligence in digital form offered to the wider public as a technology. Most people only think of robots as AI, and while there are certainly intriguing breakthroughs in that field, the software is the key to it all because what‚Äôs a body without a brain?There are already many industries using AI software to increase their bottom line. One example is SAP HANA, an intelligent database that‚Äôs able to take in all types of information from the company, process it, and spots anomalies. Companies like Walmart use SAP HANA because it can process its high volume transaction records within seconds, all in one spot. It not only saves money due to a major reduction in the labor needed to reconcile accounts across different systems, but it spots errors before they happen and suggest leads for the company to pursue. It also aids in budget forecasting due its ability to cross reference real-time data with large silos of existing data. Companies are slowly beginning to run themselves, minus some managerial oversight.Governments are also leveraging AI technology to improve cities. One example is the transportation system in Pittsburgh, where instead of relying on pre-programmed cycles, lights have been equipped with sensors that monitor traffic movements and respond in real-time to maximize flow. It also happens to be the city where many automated cars are being tested, which use embedded sensors to monitor the environment, as well data feeds from traffic sensors to operate autonomously.With commoditized intelligence now being made possible thanks to copious amounts of data and intelligent algorithms, the final step is to erect infrastructure for it all to communicate on in real-time with little to no friction. That new infrastructure appears to be distributed ledger technology.Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT):Human intelligence is so remarkable because it‚Äôs collaborative, meaning the social reservoir of knowledge is a result of intelligence interacting with other intelligence. Having barriers between two intelligent systems slows down growth because it inhibits connections from taking place. The more connections that happen, the more intelligent something can become. In order to maximize connection in society, all systems need to be able to easily interact with one another so data and value can move freely within society.The ideal infrastructure for an autonomous economy requires a database, a processing layer, a transactional layer, and a connectivity layer, which allows any system to receive inputs and send outputs to any other system. The network must be secure, operate in real time, and provide confidentiality options when needed. It also must provide receipts for all parties involved, be cooperative with the law, and properly monetize the value on it. Finally, it must be be permissionless and public to facilitate the network effects needed for maximum connection.First, it‚Äôs important to understand the term distributed ledger technology, which is just an all-encompassing term for a family of technologies centered around shared distributed ledgers and decentralized databases.Blockchain & Other Shared Ledger TechnologyBlockchain, the most well known DLT, is a shared storage layer able to process its own transactions and store the results in a common ledger. It‚Äôs powered by a distributed network of computers all running the same open-source software. Besides initial setup and periodic maintenance performed by each individual running a client application, a blockchain is a completely automated and self-run network, able to reach perfect consensus, while leaving no central point of attack for malicious actors. In fact, it can be argued that blockchain as a technology is the most secure database in the entire world. No central authority is needed for a public blockchain, anyone can use the network and build applications on top of it, and transactions are peer-to-peer (P2P), instead of having intermediaries between parties. Similar to how the Internet blew up for data transfer due to its permissionless nature; public blockchains could have a network effect explosion as the dominant databases and mediums of exchange for both the human and machine economy.Blockchains are often differentiated by the way the network reaches consensus and who‚Äôs rewarded for helping achieve it. There are a variety of blockchain consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work (POW) in Bitcoin, Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) in EOS, Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) in NEO, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) in Stellar, and Proof-of-Stake (POS), which has yet to be fully achieved, but Ethereum is pushing to be the first. There are also permissioned blockchains, such as the IBM Hyperledger, that only allow certain parties to use the network, akin to a private consortium. There is a lot of doubt though about permissioned blockchains actually being beneficial once public blockchains become scalable and allow privacy. Similar to the Intranet vs. Internet debate, what‚Äôs likely to occur is that permissioned chains have their niche use case, but ultimately public blockchains will become the main highway of interconnection for value transfer around the world.There are other forms of DLT too, that offer similar proposals to blockchain. These include Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) like IOTA and NANO or technologies like Hashgraph and Holochain that use gossip protocols instead of full network consensus. The overarching theme though is that all these databases store and process data on a common distributed network. As Blythe Masters of Digital Asset puts it, it provides a ‚Äúgolden source of truth‚Äù.Smart ContractsThe second most known DLT are smart contracts, which are protocols within the blockchain that mimic legal agreements and courtroom judges. Economies require all types of agreements and arbitration of those agreements based of real world outcomes. Smart contracts are able to recreate this in the digital world by using if/then statements to trigger transactions based on the contract‚Äôs state. The basic premise is that a contract is coded just like it would be written, using if/then parameters. An example would be a derivatives contract where, if the product hits a certain price, then the customer gets paid out, but if not, then the customer pays the other party.While IoT gathers data and AI processes data, smart contracts are the software infrastructure that uses data to trigger actual actions, such as payments, transfer of data, or storage of an outcome. It‚Äôs comparable to the human handshake in a business deal or a human pressing the SEND button to trigger an action. Since smart contracts reside within blockchains, they gain all the security advantages that come along with it too. Smart contracts are really a functional transaction layer that triggers autonomous actions using data to create what can only be described as a self-run economy with automated movement of value. Smart contracts represent real-world action and trade.OraclesFinally, the more hidden, but extremely important DLT are oracles. Oracles are the bridges that connect all types of systems together. They are the Internet of the blockchain ecosystem, bridging the gap between the legacy world (off-chain) and the DLT world (on-chain). Oracles allow off-chain data, such as that sitting on the servers of big data providers, to be fed into smart contracts to interact with the contract logic. Oracles also allow smart contracts to push data onto other systems once the contract logic has taken place, such as a smart contract triggering a payment on an external system like SWIFT, PayPal, or sending files to another blockchain. Simply put, oracles are the connectivity layer that glues everything together so all systems can communicate.To achieve connectivity, oracles leverage Application Program Interfaces (APIs) as the end points of connection. It makes sense too because APIs have exploded in use over the last decade. A simple way to think of APIs to think of them as microservices that others can leverage instead of spending the time and money to code up their own. For example, to build Uber, someone could simply use a GPS API, a Payments API like Stripe, and an SMS API for messaging. It allows developers the ability to focus on the core code and functionality of their app and use add-on services through APIs for the rest.Finally, oracles need to have secure and reliable lines of communication between systems for automation to truly be trusted. The problem with most oracles today is that they are centralized, either through central oracle service provider or one of the parties in the transaction building their own . Centralization creates easy attack vectors for malicious actors and opens up the possibility of a service provider tampering with the data feed. A scary situation is one where a high value smart contract malfunctions because the centralized API service provider was hacked, had an employee tamper with the data feed, or went offline down for maintenance. Efficient automation is about limiting vulnerabilities because vulnerabilities require human intervention to clean up. It could get extremely messy too and lead to a chain reaction of failures all based off the same root cause.To truly solve the oracle problem, decentralization is key. Chainlink (LINK), a DLT startup, is currently the industry leader in aiming to provide a decentralized oracle network for trustless connectivity between systems using API middleware. It does so by decentralizing the lines of communication between smart contracts, limiting a central attack point, and by providing secure off-chain computation where oracles can‚Äôt see the details of transactions they‚Äôre servicing. Off-chain computation has the added bonus too of adding fast, cheap processing for smart contracts. Secure, confidential, and scalable transfer of data could be the last step in leveraging smart contracts to make real economic decisions in automated and intelligent ways. (Read more about Chainlink here)Putting it all together reveals a system with blockchain as a database and processing layer, smart contracts as a transactional layer with functionality, and oracles as a connectivity layer with added functionality. Theoretically, it can all be decentralized into an autonomous network with little to no security flaws. The last step is bringing to closer to real-time, which hasn‚Äôt been achieved yet, but off-chain computation, sidechains, and second layer solutions like lightning networks are bringing it closer to a reality.Before painting the full picture of how IoT, AI, and DLT synergistically come together. it‚Äôs important to recognize some of the other major macro trends happening in both technology and society that are further driving the world towards a fourth industrial revolution.Macro Trends:Most of the macro trends are all fusing around the same thread of an interconnected global economy that‚Äôs increasingly open, moving towards real-time, and being run by automation. The most obvious macro trend is globalization, as developments that grew out of the Internet have brought communication to real-time across borders and allowed affordable travel to the average consumer. In fact, calling people across the world is basically free now thanks to apps like Skype and WeChat and almost all countries are open to travel too. Cultural and technological barrier are quickly disappearing, especially as voice-to-text applications become popular.The second macro trend is Moore‚Äôs Law- the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years, aka the processing speed of computers double every two years. This phenomenon could be a leading factor in the development of scalable DLT technology. It could also be a leading driver in the development of intelligent robotics. Robotics itself is a growing industry that could displace most manual labor jobs, but combined with advancements in AI and fast computation, could really open the market for affordable robot uses. Many forms of robotics are already in use, like household robots that sweep and mop the floor or industry robots like those at Amazon warehouses that move around and fill orders.Another major macro trend is the development of increasingly better forms of biotechnology. The basic idea here is a merger of humans and machines by putting machines inside or on humans. There‚Äôs a ton of overlap here with IoT devices and could lead to future applications that monitor the health of different functions in the human body. Readings from the devices can help people maintain good health and possibly even be used to trigger smart contracts for health insurance discounts. In the more distant future, biotechnology could lead to brain-to-computer interfaces, where the mind is able to download intelligence like it‚Äôs software. Biotechnology is one of the largest trends heading into the future.Finally, the last major trend is the open-source movement. Laws are being passed all around the world mandating that companies and/or governments open up their APIs for outside entities to leverage, such as the PSD2 law in Europe requiring all banks to open up their APIs for fintechs to use, as well as President Obama passing the 21st Century Act, which mandates that starting in 2018 all electronic health records are to be made available through open APIs. There is also an open-source movement around software, with DLT technology being the premier example. Finally, knowledge and news are moving open-source using the Creative Commons license. The more open data becomes open, the faster the hive mind grows because it open up more chances for connection.ConclusionBased off the information presented, a picture is starting to take shape, with graphics showcasing just how the future might grow over the next fifty years. The model that‚Äôs beginning to take form is world where data is a resource of increasing supply thanks to large data providers, IoT devices, and the Internet. The data can be leveraged by AI algorithms that refine it and use it to take intelligent actions in the real world. These actions are facilitated by DLT technology that connect everything together, trigger the reconciling of trade, and record it all in a shared ledger. Once the networks are put in place, they run themselves and can ever grow smarter over time. This is the fourth industrial revolution.The human economy is not going to disappear completely, but it‚Äôs safe to say that the autonomous economy is going to eat into it more and more each year. Robotics are going to displace manual labor and data driven, AI enabled smart contracts are going to replace intelligent labor, such as lawyers, accountants, third party intermediaries, data entry positions, and insurance adjusters. It‚Äôs just the beginning too, as an immense amount of developers are likely to start flocking towards developing AI algorithms and smart contracts. The more people that get involved, the more velocity the movement picks up.While it‚Äôs a scary proposition thinking about all the labor loss on the near horizon, it‚Äôs a potentially freeing technology if implemented ethically. Humanity is going to be forced to seriously rethink social and economic systems in a post scarcity world. This problem will no longer revolve around production because there will be enough for everyone and it will be handled by machines. Instead, the problem will reside around distribution, which could become highly political, but is a necessary growing pain of a changing society.It should be noted that the technology is still very much in its infant stages and will require many developments before it sees wide scale implementation. That shouldn‚Äôt be surprising though, as every industrial revolution of the past has been a series of technological breakthroughs rather than one epiphany moment. It‚Äôs unsure what the future holds, but one thing that is for sure is that automation isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon, so it‚Äôs better to accept it and work with it than fight it to no avail. Remember, intelligence is the recognition of patterns, so the only question that remains is do you see the pattern and if so, will you evolve to take action from your understanding of it?The past cannot be changed, but the future is yet to be conquered‚Ä¶Follow me on Twitter: @Crypto___Oracle

172,The 30 Best Android Libraries and Projects of 2019,https://medium.com/better-programming/30-best-android-libraries-and-projects-of-2019-a1e35124f110?source=extreme_main_feed---------175-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"It‚Äôs been over a year since I released my last article about Android libraries. Now, I‚Äôm back with a summary of awesome libraries and projects released (or heavily refreshed) in 2019. They‚Äôre not in ranked order. Let‚Äôs begin!Coil is a really fresh approach to image loading on Android.The acronym of this library stands for coroutine image loader. The library is fast, lightweight (~1500 methods), easy to use, and modern, especially in comparison to libraries like Glide, Picasso, or Fresco. It supports GIFs and SVGs and can do four default transformations: blur, circle crop, grayscale, and rounded corners.Code example below:The documentation and code samples are more than enough to start using it without any hesitation. Everything is clear and easy. Currently the lib is in a version 0.9.5.Fun fact: During the last three months, I interviewed 14 candidates, and no one knew about Coil. Be cool, and impress your interviewer by mentioning Coil. Even Google made a mistake about an author when they wrote about Coil in their ‚ÄúLoading Large Bitmaps Efficiently‚Äù article. Regardless, it‚Äôs fixed now.This library has a really cool approach to an animated search view.It‚Äôs easy to set up and is customisable ‚Äî you can add your style‚Äôs set under styles.xml.The README is quite short, but I believe it‚Äôs OK. This is version 0.1, so I wouldn‚Äôt use it in production. Rather, I‚Äôd treat it like a great lib for a playground project to have some fun in.It was released under the Apache 2.0 license.This is a highly customizable calendar library, powered by RecyclerView.It has lots of features:The documentation is really comprehensive and full of examples. What‚Äôs more, there‚Äôs a sample app that showcases every feature of the library.
It‚Äôs written 100% in Kotlin and released under MIT license. If you need a calendar view in your application, I believe this one is good to go, despite the fact it‚Äôs still in version 0.3.2 (at the time of this article).This is a fresh approach to a navigation ‚Äî a light-weight library to easily make beautiful navigation bars with a ton of customisation options.It has many cool features:The README file is quite detailed and explains how to use all of the components to achieve this cool-looking UI. You can always check the sample app. The project was released under the Apache 2.0 license.This isn‚Äôt a library but a showcase application to present advanced UI animations achieved with and without MotionLayout.It‚Äôs a really interesting project ‚Äî with two correlated articles on Medium:Worthy reading for sure!SmoothBottomBar describes itself as ‚Äúa lightweight Android material bottom navigation bar library.‚ÄùThe library was implemented according to an Alejandro Ausejo Dribble project. Currently, it is in version 1.7, written in Kotlin under MIT license. The documentation is rather short but sufficient to use it quickly in your project. There is also a sample application.This is truly an outstanding project. Igor Wojda created a showcase application that presents a modern, 2019 approach to Android-application development using Kotlin and the latest tech stack.This project brings to the table a set of best practices, tools, and solutions:In my opinion, it‚Äôs really a great source. The README file is clear and comprehensive ‚Äî with additional graphs presenting an architecture, data flow, and CI. It doesn‚Äôt matter, whether you work on modularisation, clean architecture, tests, or setting up CI/CD tools, thanks to this project, you‚Äôll be always inspired. Kudos to the author.This is a library that provides a lightweight pop-up with tool tips, fully customizable with arrows and animations. You can see how it works below.It supports minSdk 16 and is released under the Apache 2.0 license with version 1.1.0. The documentation is full of examples and is also backed up by a sample showcase app.LiquidSwipe is a library that‚Äôs based on ViewPager and can be used to make beautiful on-boarding designs.The README file is comprehensive. Usage of the library is also quite easy and comes down to using LiquidSwipeViewPager instead of the normal ViewPager.
Currently, it‚Äôs on version 1.3 and is released under the MIT license, supporting minSdk 21 and above.This is yet another approach to image cropping for Android.The library has many cool features:The documentation is enough to get stared, but bare in mind, this is in version 0.2. The project is released under the Apache 2.0 license.Let‚Äôs stay with cropping tools for a little bit. Glimpse is a content-aware cropping library for Android, and it‚Äôs awesome that these kinds of libraries are created and open sourced.As you can see above, instead of center-cropping images blindly, Glimpse catches the right spot.But how? It uses TensorFlow Lite underneath with a proper model. What‚Äôs also great is it supports Coil and Glide. You should check out the README file for sure because it‚Äôs really extensive, and you‚Äôll learn a lot. It‚Äôs released under the Apache 2.0 license. Maybe it‚Äôs not ready for production yet, but I still highly recommend it.This is an animated and interesting approach to SeekBars.The RubberPicker library contains the RubberSeekBar and RubberRangePicker, inspired by Cuberto's rubber-range-picker for iOS.The docs will tell you how to start and also what‚Äôs on the to-do list. Maybe you‚Äôll find time to contribute to that project. Currently it‚Äôs in version 1.4, and it‚Äôs released under the MIT license.This library adds a fast scroll for your RecyclerView and more.The main features, according to the README file, are:‚Ä¢ Fully customizable: Override track, thumb, popup, animation and scrolling.
‚Ä¢ Easy-to-use defaults: Predefined default style, Material Design 2 style and animation.
‚Ä¢ Extensive view support: Out-of-box support for RecyclerView, ScrollView, NestedScrollView and WebView, plus any view with a ViewHelper implementation.
‚Ä¢ Window insets friendly: Support setting a separate padding for scrollbar.
‚Ä¢ Clean implementation: Decoupled touch handling, animation and scrolling logic.There‚Äôs also a preview app available on Google Play. The project has good documentation and is released under the Apache 2.0 license, so if you have a reason to include fast scroll ‚Äî e.g., on a contact list ‚Äî this library is a good choice.This is a library that provides a custom, animated Switch widget.It‚Äôs based on a Dribble design from Oleg Frolov and is released under theApache license 2.0. It supports Android KitKat (minSdk 19) and is quite straightforward to use.Despite the fact it was released in December 2018, I wanted to put this lib on my list because I believe it deserves to be. This library is simple and customizable. It contains a full-screen image viewer with shared image-transition support, pinch-to-zoom functionality, and swipe-to-dismiss gestures.The documentation explains how to use every feature. Also noteworthy: The library is compatible with all of the most popular image-processing libraries, such as Picasso, Glide, etc. It‚Äôs in a version 1.0.0. There‚Äôs also a sample project.Everyone knows Store. At least, they should. Currently we‚Äôre in the fourth iteration of this great library for async data loading and caching. According to the README file:‚ÄúA Store is a class that simplifies fetching, sharing, storage, and retrieval of data in your application. A Store is similar to the Repository pattern while exposing an API built with Coroutines that adheres to a unidirectional data flow.Store provides a level of abstraction between UI elements and data operations.‚ÄùYou can learm more about Store in the last Android Developers Backstage podcast: ‚ÄúEpisode 132: Storing data with Store.‚ÄùThis is another library for showing a placeholder of a View when content is loading.Take a look at how nicely animated it is. You can use it with a RecyclerView too. The documentation is short, but is shows its basic usage. There‚Äôs also a sample app. It‚Äôs in version 1.0.0 and released under the Apache 2.0 license.This library provides a Button with a built-in progress bar inside. The idea is not new, but this is a fresh approach to it.Main features:The process, including how the lib was implemented, is available here.
Currently, the version is 2.0.0, and it‚Äôs released under the Apache 2.0 license.This is an Android project allowing you to add a gradient view in the simplest possible way.The library supports API 14 and above and is released under the Apache 2.0 license. The README file is short, but it contains some good tips, like how to use it in Java and Kotlin. There‚Äôs also a helpful sample application.Contour is a typesafe, Kotlin-first API for complex layouts on Android from Square Engineering.According to their GitHub page:‚ÄúContour aims to be the thinnest possible wrapper around Android‚Äôs layout APIs. It allows you to build compound views in pure Kotlin without using opaque layout rules ‚Äî but instead by hooking into the layout phase yourself. The best comparison for Contour would be to ConstraintLayout ‚Äî but instead of defining constraints in XML you actually provide them as executable lambdas.‚ÄùThis is a really interesting idea, especially since this library tries to deprecate the old XML-Android approach. The documentation is really good, but please remember that:‚ÄúThis project is currently experimental and the API subject to breaking changes without notice.‚ÄùThis is a Model-View-Intent (MVI) framework for Kotlin and Android that‚Äôs developed and used by Babylon Health. It was inspired by ‚ÄúManaging State with RxJava‚Äù by Jake Wharton, RxFeedback, and Mosby.According to the README file:‚ÄúOrbit provides the minimum structure possible around your redux implementation to make it easy to use, yet leave you open to use RxJava‚Äôs power.‚ÄùThe framework is really well documented, with a thorough explanation of how it works and how to use it. Currently, it‚Äôs in version 3.3.0, and it‚Äôs released under the Apache 2.0 license. If you plan to start a new project and think about the MVI pattern, this is worth a try.This isn‚Äôt a new library, but it was refreshed in 2019. It helps you create a circular ProgressBar in the simplest possible way.The documentation is comprehensive and explains how to use the library. It also contains snippets of code and a sample app. The project was developed in Kotlin under the Apache 2.0 license. Currently, it‚Äôs in version 3.0.3.This is a view that tries to mimic the Top App Bar from Material Components for the Web. Basically, it dynamises an ordinary toolbar, increasing and decreasing its shadow when an associated view is scrolled.Actually, this view extends the CardView and adds an elevation to it. The project was released under the MIT license and is open for a contribution. It has proper documentation and a sample app.This isn‚Äôt a library but a lovely open-source application from Saket Narayan which, according to its README file, is:‚ÄúA WYSIWYG writer for crafting notes inspired by Bear. It uses markdown for styling and formatting text with a beautiful inline preview.‚ÄùPress was created as a proof of concept for exploring multiplatform projects in Kotlin, so this is great place to grasp how to write apps for Android, iOS, and macOS all at once. However, currently there‚Äôs only an Android version available.The project has a really good documentation that includes an explanation of UI architecture, custom views, DI ,and testing/debugging shared code. It was released under the Apache 2.0 license.‚ÄúAndroidColorX (i.e: Android Color Extensions) is an Android library written in Kotlin that provides color utilities as Kotlin extension functions. The library relies on AndroidX ColorUtils for some of its calculations.‚Äù ‚Äî via the AndroidColorX GitHub pageThis library provides extensions for:The best way to get to know this library is to check out its really comprehensive documentation. Currently, it‚Äôs in version 0.2.0, and it was released under the Apache 2.0 license.This library adds logic to a NestedScrollView, allowing it to react dynamically with an indicator when the scroll is changed.The README file contains all the information needed to start playing with the project ‚Äî like how to use the IndicatorScrollView, the IndicatorView, and IndicatorItem. Currently, it‚Äôs in version 1.0.2, and it was released under the Apache 2.0 license. It supports API 16 and above.This is a theme engine for Android.It allows you to change themes dynamically. It also defines some core themes: Theme.Cyanea.Dark, Theme.Cyanea.Dark.LightActionBar, Theme.Cyanea.Dark.NoActionBar, Theme.Cyanea.Light, Theme.Cyanea.Light.DarkActionBar, Theme.Cyanea.Light.NoActionBar. The README file is really good. It‚Äôs full of examples, and the project itself is released under the Apache 2.0 license.This is a library that implements animated, beautiful, and stylish material dialogs.The library supports two types of dialogs:Underneath, it implements Airbnb‚Äôs Lottie library to render After Effects animations into an applciation (mentioned in one of my previous articles).
The project is really well documented, and it was released under the Apache 2.0 license.This is a simple unidirectional data flow for Android and Kotlin. It uses Kotlin coroutines and is open to functional programming. It‚Äôs well described in this Medium article and documented here.Uniflow provides:Currently, it‚Äôs in version 0.9.5, and it was released under the Apache 2.0 license.This is a sample project you can use to see how to build a simple carousel with MotionLayout.The project doesn‚Äôt have any documentation. But still, you can check the code, which is pretty straightforward, and make use of it for learning purposes. It was released under the MIT license.That‚Äôs it. I hope you enjoyed the list and that some of the libs or projects inspired you. Till next time!WRITTEN BY"
173,What America‚Äôs epic electric vehicle charging system may look like,https://medium.com/mashable/what-americas-epic-electric-vehicle-charging-system-may-look-like-ee41fb300c55?source=extreme_main_feed---------176-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôve driven electric, you don‚Äôt want to go back.‚ÄùBY MARK KAUFMANThere are some 111,000 gas stations in the United States. One particular station in Texas boasts 120 gas pumps. Those pumps are probably put to good use, because Americans today are gulping fuel like never before: In 2018, the U.S. burned through 147 billion gallons of gasoline ‚Äî its highest amount ever.This prodigious gas consumption has bad consequences for the planet‚Äôs relentlessly warming climate, because the transportation sector is the leading contributor of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.To combat these emissions, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Andy Levin (both Democrats) introduced the politically ambitious Electric Vehicle (EV) Freedom Act last Thursday, which intends to create an unprecedented, nationwide system of powerful, fast-charging stations. The goal is to make charging an electric car as easy as filling up a tank of gas. Americans have been slow to adopt electric vehicles because of anxieties about how far cars can travel before running low on power. Electric vehicles only make up about 1.8 percent of cars purchased in the U.S. today.The legislation invites compelling questions about what such a transformative highway charging system would look like, and where the chargers would be built.‚ÄúA bill like this is extremely important,‚Äù said John Graham, a public policy expert who researches the future of automobiles at Indiana University.‚ÄúThis bill responds to what was a fundamental misunderstanding about how easy it would be to sell electric vehicles,‚Äù said Graham. Most Americans, he explained, don‚Äôt drive more than about 20 or 30 miles a day, so 10 years ago the prevailing theory was people would happily buy electric vehicles to fulfill most of their driving needs.But it turned out people focus on the longer, though rarer trips, when buying a car. Understandably, no one wants to run out of power on a remote highway, an angst dubbed ‚Äúrange anxiety.‚ÄùThe Electric Vehicle Freedom Act seeks to relieve this anxiety. It requires that ‚Äúa driver starting at any point along the Interstate Highway System within Hawaii, Alaska, or Puerto Rico can drive to any other point along the Interstate Highway System within that same State or territory without running out of charging power.‚ÄùTo make this happen, the federal government would subsidize the creation of a nationwide system of charging stations that can power electric vehicles many times faster than home chargers (although, that will depend on the type of car for now). The government would award money to companies that prove they can build and operate the colossal charging network. The price tag is still unknown, but it will undoubtedly be expensive.Generally, charging electric vehicles is much easier than gassing up cars. Unlike gas-powered vehicles, most electric cars are ‚Äúfilled up‚Äù while plugged in at home. Between 90 to 95 percent of charging is done at home, explained Willett Kempton, who researches electrical vehicle adoption at the University of Delaware.So, it‚Äôs unlikely that a nationwide system of electric vehicle charging stations will need to match the some 111,000 gas stations around today. Electric vehicle drivers often have full tanks when they leave their house! (Though, the bill says between 106,000 and 138,000 stations might eventually be needed to meet consumer demand.)Still, to erase range anxiety on road trips, ‚Äúwe need a tremendous amount more charging stations,‚Äù said Kempton.Where, exactly, might they go? One good place for charging stations would be at the state rest stops that already exist along well-trafficked highways, suggested Graham. That‚Äôs because an electric vehicle with fast-charging capabilities (right now, this doesn‚Äôt always come standard) can take at minimum 30 minutes to get a considerable amount of miles. Electric vehicles not equipped with fast charging capabilities can take hours to fully charge. It‚Äôs not going to be a five-minute operation, like at a gas station. (The bill anticipates electric cars with faster-charging capabilities in the future and requires charging times to incrementally speed up).‚ÄúYou maybe get a drink, maybe get a sandwich ‚Äî it‚Äôs a stop,‚Äù said Kempton. This could work well, because folks often take 30-minute stops on road trips anyways, he added.A massive rest stop along Interstate 95, the Delaware House Travel Plaza, is a superb example. The large, indoor stop offers a number of food options (though many aren‚Äôt too healthy), and critically, a couple charging stations. The state paid to put them in, and the concessionaire running the businesses inside pays for the electricity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a crazy idea for concessions to pay for electricity,‚Äù noted Kempton, as a travel stop naturally invites people inside to buy a cup of Starbucks and a sandwich. Right now, there‚Äôs no standard rate to charge electric cars at public stations, with operators setting their own prices as they see fit.There‚Äôs also a Tesla Supercharger station at this Delaware stop ‚Äî though it only charges Teslas. Tesla famously offers free supercharging for some of its customers (although CEO Elon Musk has said this isn‚Äôt a sustainable practice). Importantly, the Electric Vehicle Freedom Act won‚Äôt fund any charging station that can only power up vehicles from a particular manufacturer, like Tesla. The aim is to allow anyone to charge whatever electric vehicle they‚Äôre driving, similar to standardized fuel pumps for gas cars.The federal government, through this bill, can ensure that chargers have interoperability, so chargers will be compatible with a diversity of cars. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where government traditionally has played a role,‚Äù said Michael Kintner-Meyer, an energy and economics analyst at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).‚ÄúThe electric vehicle is coming.‚ÄùTraditional gas stations along interstates, too, could gradually adopt ‚Äî and perhaps one day completely transition to ‚Äî electric vehicle charging stations. ‚ÄúInconcept, an ‚Äòelectric gas station‚Äô could look no different from a gas station today,‚Äù said Matthias Preindl, who researches electric vehicles and batteries at Columbia University.The only big difference, Preindl noted, would be the time spent at these stations, just like charging at a rest stop. ‚ÄúThose [electric] gas stations could offer services and entertainment as part of their offerings,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou could have lunch and coffee.‚ÄùIt is possible to cut down charging times from 30 minutes for a full charge down to the 10-minute range, or less, by using chargers capable of pumping electricity at a much higher rate of energy, known as kilowatt-hours (kWh) ‚Äî along with batteries that can handle that speedy juicing. But don‚Äôt expect to charge that quickly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not technically practical,‚Äù said the University of Delaware‚Äôs Kempton. That would require chargers in the 300 kWh range, which would be a huge load on the electrical utilities that need to provide that energy, especially if you have many vehicles charging at the same time. (For reference, a typical house runs on 1.5 kWh.)Electric charging stations should aim for pumping out electricity at the 50 kWh to 100 kWh range, said Kempton. This will still put a load on the electrical systems providing this energy, but it will be ‚Äútolerable,‚Äù he said.Perhaps the biggest question of all, however, is who will own the charging stations. ‚ÄúThe U.S.won‚Äôt socialize recharging forever,‚Äù said Indiana University‚Äôs Graham, just like the federal government doesn‚Äôt run gas stations today. But the bill requires that the government choose which companies it will give taxpayer money to become creators, suppliers, and managers of hundreds of thousands of charging stations. The government must pick who will succeed in a major, transformative, and likely hugely lucrative project. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an uncomfortable process,‚Äù said Graham.The good news is the bill requires research from the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to best determine how to pay for the charging stations, and how to ally the government with private companies (like gas stations that could provide this ‚Äúelectric fuel‚Äù). This transportation research group is known for its objective, sound judgment.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really powerful way to get advice,‚Äù said Joseph Schofer, a transportation engineer at Northwestern University. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good sign.‚ÄùIn our hyperpolarized Congress, it‚Äôs unknown if this bill might one day succeed, especially given the Trump administration‚Äôs opposition to subsidizing electric vehicles. It‚Äôs telling that the bill doesn‚Äôt have a Republican cosponsor. Still, Schofer is hopeful.‚ÄúThis might be a bill that people can agree on because it‚Äôs relatively benign,‚Äù said Schofer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for the environment, employment, and equity.‚ÄùTo boost electric vehicle adoption, it‚Äôs almost imperative a charging bill like this works. As the last decade proved, you can‚Äôt have electrical vehicles without charging stations in distant and remote places. ‚ÄúWe need both,‚Äù said Columbia‚Äôs Preindl.Electric vehicles are a superb way to get people interested in slashing carbon emissions through electrification. (The bill plans for this energy comes from renewable energy sources ‚Äî though some of this energy will almost certainly come from increasingly dominant natural gas. Solar, wind, and geothermal are on the rise, but only provide around 9 percent of the nation‚Äôs electricity today.)‚ÄúTransportationis leading,‚Äù said the PNNL‚Äôs Kintner-Meyer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sexier to see a Tesla running down the road than seeing someone replace a gas furnace in a high-rise building.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are already on a path towards electrifying the transportation sector,‚Äù said Preindl. ‚ÄúThe electric vehicle is coming.‚Äù While electric vehicles may be popular in California, there‚Äôs a long way to go across the country.EVs come with a long list of merits. It‚Äôs a smoother drive. You don‚Äôt need to pay for oil changes. It‚Äôs quieter. You do most of your refueling at home. And you‚Äôre not contributing nearly as much to civilization‚Äôs still-rising carbon emissions.‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôve driven electric, you don‚Äôt want to go back,‚Äù said Delaware‚Äôs Kempton.Originally published at https://mashable.com.WRITTEN BY"
174,The Family Who Lived in Complete Isolation for 42 Years,https://medium.com/history-of-yesterday/the-family-who-lived-in-complete-isolation-for-42-years-6d24b8b39c83?source=extreme_main_feed---------177-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"he Lykov family belonged to a religious minority, the rascal, persecuted during the Tsarist Empire and, after 1918, by the Bolshevik regime. In the 1930s, after Karp Lykov‚Äôs brother was killed by a communist soldier, he and his wife, Akulina, and their two children, Savin and Natalia, fled to wild Siberia, where they took refuge in an area completely isolated from civilization. In the 42 years of isolation, the two had two children, born and raised in the Taiga, and their settlement was discovered by accident only in 1978.In 1978, a group of Soviet geologists on a mission to Siberia discovered a family that lived in the Taiga for several decades without anyone knowing about their existence. The Lykov family had not been in contact with other people for 42 years, nor did they know there was a Second World War. The Lykov family was discovered in the summer of 1978 by a helicopter pilot looking for a landing spot. He saw a lighted fence where there should have been nothing but a forest.This was proof that the area was inhabited, although the Soviet authorities had no one in the place. It was about 250 kilometers away from the nearest town, in a region of the Taiga that was not explored until then. The four helicopter geologists, who were to study the area, we're amazed by the pilot‚Äôs discovery and decided to investigate. Led by Galina Pismenskaia, geologists ‚Äúarmed‚Äù themselves with gifts but also with a gun.Near a stream, they discovered a hut. Little, with a tiny window, it didn‚Äôt seem appropriate to serve as a home. It had, however, five tenants. Geologists were greeted by a very old man, who lured them in, where they discovered that that poor, dirty hut was home to five people: 77-year-old Karp Lykov, and his children, Savin, Natalia, Dmitri, and Agafia. Karp‚Äôs wife, Akulina, had died of starvation fifteen years ago.Geologists wanted to offer food, tea, bread, sweetness and other things the old man knew from an early age, but which his children had never seen. Moreover, the children of the Lykov family had never met anyone except their parents. They knew that there were remote places where people lived in piles of tall buildings, they had heard that there were other countries besides Russia, but these were foreign concepts to them. They had learned to write and read from their mother, and the only books they had ever seen were the Bible and the Gospels that their parents had taken with them when they retired to the Taiga.In the 42 years of isolation, the Lykov family had a difficult life. They survived with difficulty in an extremely hostile environment and with limited tools. They had used a few Iberians for many years, but after they finally rusted, they had little more to cook than they would gather from the forest. When they were found, their staple foods were rye potato chips and hemp seeds. In the summer they found berries, but the food was still inadequate. Family members have always lived on the brink of subsistence and hunger.Only when the boy, Dmitri, grew up, he and his father were able to go hunting but even that was difficult, because they had no weapons available, and relied only on improvised traps. But Dmitri, geologists discovered, had developed an almost superhuman physical strength: he could hunt barefoot in winter and sometimes return to the hut after a few days, sleeping outside even at freezing temperatures.The Geologists informed the members of the Lykov family of major events that have taken place around the world in these 42 years of isolation. The members were not even aware that a Second World War had taken place and upon hearing that a man landed on the moon the family refused to believe what was for them a supernatural and miraculous theory.The Lykov family refused to leave their settlement, even if they had the chance to return to a more civilized world than the one they had left, where they could live in better conditions. However, they remained in contact with the geologists who discovered them. In 1981, three of Lykov‚Äôs four children died. Savin and Natalia died of kidney problems, probably caused by the diet they had lived with all their lives. Dimitri had sadly also died due to a bad case of pneumonia.Another reason why the Lykov family has also refused to return to the civilized world is that they thought that there is simply too much evil in the urban world and even how harsh life had been on them they lived a much happier life secluded. In 1988 Karp had died due to natural causes. Agafia is the last member of the Lykov family who is believed to still live secluded in Taiga even to this day if she hasn't died from natural causes.WRITTEN BY"
175,Re-imagining Working Life: The Tuesday to Thursday Workforce,https://medium.com/swlh/re-imagining-working-life-the-tuesday-to-thursday-workforce-6753f144551?source=extreme_main_feed---------178-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"A few years back I wrote the below. Reflecting on it now and the current situation we find ourselves in are the words truer now than ever before.Business and everyday life has taken a turn down a path we have not seen for years. The ability to adapt to prolonged lock-down periods may well not disappear for some years to come.So is it finally time to consign the the standard five-day working week to history.When the biomedical research charity the Wellcome Trust ‚Äî the world‚Äôs second wealthiest charitable foundation ‚Äî announced that it was considering introducing a four-day working week for its staff, it was meet with some laughter and didn't, at that time take off.The rest of the piece has been altered. It remains as it was first drafted but perhaps now this is the time to look closely at how we work and how we approach a work life balance.That followed the revelation that shadow chancellor John McDonnell has commissioned a study into the economic feasibility of making a four-day week the standard across UK industry and commerce.And while many worry that technologies like robotics and AI will force people out of work, the TUC used its conference last year to claim that the ¬£200bn boost to the economy such innovations could bring over the next decade would mean everyone could feasibly work less whilst earning the same.But as the case for an improved work-life balance strengthens, the question is ‚Äî are we being ambitious enough? While the campaign for reduced working hours has coalesced around the four-day week, should we in fact be setting our sights higher by pushing for a three-day working week instead? Could Tuesday to Thursday ever become the new Monday to Friday?This is not as radical as it sounds. As far back as the 1930s, the celebrated economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that by 2030, technological progress would mean most people could work just 15 hours a week and still enjoy incomes high enough to enjoy all the free leisure time they had.We‚Äôre not as far from this futuristic Keynesian world as you might think. One of the great anxieties of the early 21st century is that, due to a combination of population growth and digitised industrialisation, the supply of human labour now far outstrips demand. With intensive farming supplying the masses with food and automated machines taking care of production, there just isn‚Äôt that much left for people to do. There is even a movement pondering the possibility of a completely workless future.The anxiety around this is that it would require a radical readjustment of our entire economic model. As things stand, if there are not enough jobs to go round, then people can‚Äôt earn, and if they can‚Äôt earn they can neither providefor themselves nor take part in the consumer economy. For people who are wedded to this model of how things should be, having people out of work, economically inactive and, heavens forbid, reliant on state support is a frightfully inconvenient state of affairs.Perhaps one day a revolution in the economic order which decouples labour from economic participation will be inevitable. But as a stop gap in the meantime, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to follow the Keynesian idea and significantly reduce the standard working hours?In some respects, this is exactly what is happening in the UK, but neither consistently nor fairly. The current government is proud of its high employment figures, but it hardly does a very good job hiding the truth behind them, i.e. the number of people working part-time, entering the ‚Äògig economy‚Äô on zero hour contracts or leaving employment to work for themselves, often with no security whatsoever.And this reveals the challenge of reduced working hours ‚Äî many households relying on part-time work or casual work are struggling financially. Resistance to a four-day or three-day working week largely comes from people refusing to countenance a drop in their income.That is why it will be very interesting to hear the final conclusions from the shadow chancellor‚Äôs report into the four-day week. Hopefully, it will not rest on whether a wholesale reduction in hours is currently feasible, but will dig further into what would have to happen to allow people to work less but earn the same.There are plenty of good reasons why a wholesale reduction in working hours should make economic sense. As many people, from Keynes to the TUC, have pointed out, the extra efficiencies brought by technology should not threaten earnings ‚Äî if output remains the same, it shouldn‚Äôt matter how long people work, income should remain at the same level. Coupled with that, if people have three or four days off a week, they are more likely to come into work refreshed, happy and stress free, able and willing to work at maximum productivity.When you factor in the advantages of reduced childcare bills for young families and more solid jobs to go round, bringing people back into stable employment from zero-hours gigs, it is not too hard to imagine a scenario where reduced hours actually helps to stimulate the economy by giving more people more disposable income.It‚Äôs certainly a compelling vision ‚Äî the Tuesday to Thursday workforce, driving future prosperity thanks to a better work ethic, less work-related illness and more time to spend their spare money. Whether Keynes‚Äôs prediction of this sort of world arriving by 2030 will come to pass, that‚Äôs another question.WRITTEN BY"
176,Can You Afford a Moon Condo?,https://medium.com/swlh/can-you-afford-a-moon-condo-2f7073119bbd?source=extreme_main_feed---------179-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"When we lay on our roofs at night to look up at the stars, we don‚Äôt think ‚Äúwho owns that?‚Äù Well, most of us don‚Äôt, at least. But maybe we should.As the long arm of the law reaches beyond the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, we members of the human race must begin to think about what our future in the cosmos will look like. Stretching our minds beyond science, we must conceptualize the reality of life on other planets, on space stations, or on our own moon. Will we be able to attain the enduring, cooperative peace of Star Trek‚Äôs United Earth, or will we find ourselves warring for the resources in our solar system, like in James S. A. Corey‚Äôs The Expanse?Much of our fate will be decided in the early days, as we lay the legal groundwork for space exploration and colonization. And the decision as to whether our future will be peaceful or an unending struggle lies mostly with questions of property.Property defines the spaces in which we live and delineates areas in which we are welcome and unwelcome. National territory, sovereignty and jurisdiction, private versus public property ‚Äî each of these concepts will follow us as we strike out into parts unknown, just as they followed the Europeans who settled the Americas and divided up Africa.We have already begun to conceptualize what property will look like with regards to the moon, Mars, and the asteroid belt, Earth‚Äôs nearest prospects.The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, signed and ratified by 108 UN member nations, declares all celestial bodies free for exploration by all signatory states, and protects all of ‚Äúouter space‚Äù from claims of national sovereignty. A decade later, the Moon Treaty of 1979 attempted to take that protection a step further, banning ownership of any part of outer space by any private company or person ‚Äî however, it was only ever ratified by states incapable of spaceflight.Despite its failure ‚Äî or perhaps because of it ‚Äî the Moon Treaty raises a slew of pertinent questions and concerns. Should private companies, or private individuals, be allowed to lay claim to extraterrestrial property? It‚Äôs certainly easy enough to buy a ‚ÄúMoon deed‚Äù or a ‚ÄúMartian deed‚Äù on the internet, but do these private claims have any legal standing?And more importantly, should they?It seems silly to ask these questions when private claimants to extraterrestrial real estate as of yet have no enforcement mechanism. They can neither land on the moon nor live on it, so their land claims seem to us like obvious legal fallacies. But there may be no better time to ask these questions than right now, before the need for answers becomes urgent.The Outer Space Treaty declared all extraterrestrial territory a part of the common heritage of mankind, essentially decreeing that it be held in trust for future generations, and not exploited by any one national entity.There is debate, however, as to whether or not the concept of common heritage prohibits private parties from exploitation in the same way that it prohibits sovereign states. Those in favor of private development of space claim that the omission of any mention of private interests gives them carte blanche, while those opposed stress the fact that common heritage really does mean common heritage, no matter what the law says.In 2015, the United States passed the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which opened up the modern space exploration race to private citizens. It also protects the ownership by private companies of any resources recovered from space.This is a massive ‚Äî and double-edged ‚Äî development in space law. While the United States claims it is well within its rights to make such a decree, since the Outer Space Treaty only requires private activities in space be overseen by a state signatory, others are not so certain. There have been accusations that by passing this act, the United States has asserted its sovereignty in space. As space is technically international territory, some believe the only law which should govern it is international law.Nevertheless, the oversights in the Outer Space Treaty and the failure of the Moon Treaty seem to have left the door wide open for private prospecting. And that may mean that the future we‚Äôre looking at is not one of shared international prosperity, but one in which territory is divvied up between energy companies, tourist resorts, and exorbitantly-priced Moon condos.This possibility poses a problem that has already cropped up on Earth, with the development of the sea steading movement.Romantic ideas about mankind‚Äôs triumph over the final frontier are all well and good, but who exactly is included in this term ‚Äúmankind‚Äù? As far as sea steading is concerned ‚Äî and as far as this highly-privatized outer space is concerned ‚Äî ‚Äúmankind‚Äù will encompass only those rich enough to buy their place in the future.After all, space tourism, which only lasts a few hours, already costs tourists millions of dollars. It‚Äôs not hard to imagine what the cost of living in outer space will be, even just based on the cost of space exploration.Space as ‚Äúcommon heritage‚Äù is a nice idea in concept, but so far it seems not to have translated into reality. Even if our future space habitats follow in the legal footsteps of the sea steading movement, first gaining national and international approval for their private, autonomous settlements, there will be no place in space for the world‚Äôs poor ‚Äî except, maybe, as the maids who clean those exorbitantly-priced Moon condos.But it‚Äôs not all grim. Given the unprecedented scope of resources available in outer space, it may just turn out that humanity‚Äôs venture into the stars becomes a great equalizer. The tragedy of the commons, which logically prevents mutual ownership of land and resources on Earth, will cease to apply in the literally-inexhaustible vastness of space. And as the cost of space exploration goes down and the cost of extracting and refining raw material on Earth goes up, the economic inaccessibility of space will level out.The future is not so unclear as we might think ‚Äî nor is it uncontrollable. It is down to the laws we pass here on Earth to decide what humanity‚Äôs time in the cosmos will look like. Questions of property must be answered, and it‚Äôs best we answer them now, before it‚Äôs too late.WRITTEN BY"
177,How to Make Money During Tough Economic Times,https://medium.com/mind-cafe/how-to-make-money-during-tough-economic-times-692440d7de2c?source=extreme_main_feed---------180-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"The world has changed drastically. What was easy may have become impossible. What was complicated may be simpler than ever before.When your financial world has been turned upside down, how you make your money, so you can take care of your family, changes.Tough economic times are some of the greatest times in history. It‚Äôs where people are rattled. It‚Äôs where existing paradigms shift. This is the time to own your financial past and make money that you can use to work less if you choose.Right now, the power of understanding how money works has helped me. Many people are experiencing so much stress because of money. No one can predict a Black Swan Event. All you can do is keep a buffer so that you‚Äôre prepared when they do come and you can be calm as a result.The recession in 2008 helped me see tough economic times in a new light so that I could use the situation to never experience that level of financial pain ever again.Tough economic times are good for you. Here is how you can make money during these challenging periods.Tough economic times only help you if you start with believing in yourself. If you still think you have no valuable skills, a change in the economy won‚Äôt help you.What you believe about yourself shapes your earning capacity and the number of income streams you can have.The limit to your earning potential is controlled by you. When you believe that it‚Äôs not luck, but conscious hard work and a series of habits that will change your financial situation, you can make money from anything.They really should relabel the phrases ‚Äútough economic times‚Äù or ‚Äúglobal downturn‚Äù or ‚Äúdeep recession‚Äù with one phrase: opportunity season.It‚Äôs harder to make money during the good times.Everybody is calm and believes in what they‚Äôre doing. When the economy goes in the other direction, perfectly smart people start to doubt themselves, panic, be overcome by fear, and take radical actions that they haven‚Äôt thought through. This change in mindset is where the hidden opportunities come from.You make money from the change in the majority of people‚Äôs mindset ‚Äî from positive to deeply negative.Whatever you were doing during the good times, you want to double down.You want to add an additional income stream to act as a cushion against losing your main source of income or the terrors of deflation followed by hyperinflation.The ways to make money listed below are fairly obvious, but I‚Äôll name a few to remind you.I sucked at making money online. Even though the answers were somewhat obvious, I didn‚Äôt know where to start. The simple solution was to get around people who did.When I watched my friend make $400K USD from an eBook, and another friend make a living by selling music online, and another friend selling his favourite line of clothing through Instagram, it became almost ridiculous to think that I couldn‚Äôt do the same.Last year, I worked in a social media agency and spent my day talking to young entrepreneurs who all found creative ways to reach people and add value to their lives.Making money online can look impossible until part of your friendship circle is doing it and then it becomes ‚Äòpossible‚Äô.When tough economic times hit, you‚Äôve got to hustle a little harder. You don‚Äôt need to work 18-hour days or anything ‚Äî but upping your effort is necessary. Why?You‚Äôre going to be surrounded by an online world that tells you the sky is falling in and just surviving is a huge win.The news will say no to your dreams. Your boss will say no to your dreams. The TV will say no to your dreams. The hiring manager will overlook your dreams. Your friends and family may unconsciously block your dreams.Pushing against this resistance requires effort. Your effort level from before won‚Äôt be enough during tough economic times, because the chips will be stacked against you.Fight back and use all the effort you can muster up.Today I sold one eBook worth $20 and had to pay costs for hosting that ate up about $18 of that money. You could say that the $2 left is chump change and maybe it is. But Ayodeji Awosika said it better than I ever can:‚ÄòYou [might] see a tiny amount of money that barely covers a cup of coffee. I see a seed of another stream to allow me resources to continue to do what I love.‚ÄôMaking money online always starts small. You never wake up to millions of dollars from the sale of a bestselling book (and if you do, you won‚Äôt appreciate the money or the journey).It‚Äôs making the few dollars here, and the few dollars there, which helps you believe that you won‚Äôt always be slaving away like a dog. The small amounts of money compound to make large sums of money that make it look like it happened overnight.Helicopter money is where the government give you free money for doing nothing. Picture a helicopter with the president dropping money out over crowds of people in the streets and everybody taking home their own stack of cash.You can take the idea of helicopter money and use it to support you during tough economic times. How? Give some of what you earn away to people who need it. If all you do is build your own bank account during a recession, you‚Äôll become entirely selfish.The process of giving away some of your earnings teaches you the most important rule: you have enough money.If you never believe you have enough money, you‚Äôll keep endlessly chasing it until you‚Äôre the richest person in the graveyard with a Bentley Turbo buried next to you that you can‚Äôt drive to heaven.Give away money to people who need it so that you remember you have enough ‚Äî and so you have a reason to earn more money, so you can help more people in the process.A
downturn in the economy means an opportunity for you to do something that may not have been possible before. A recession is really just a change in seasons that brings with it new ways of making money.This can be the time you create a life for yourself where you get to work less and enjoy being alive, without having to worry about money so much.Use tough economic times to help yourself and others who need it.WRITTEN BY"

Donella H. Meadows explains in his book, Thinking in Systems: A Primer, ‚ÄúA system is a set of things ‚Äî people, cells, molecules, or whatever ‚Äî interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behaviour over time.‚ÄùWe all have systems (patterns or routines) for living. Your pattern of getting up in the morning, commuting to work, getting work done, going to sleep, spending time with your loved ones, spending your weekend or generally using your time is different from mine.Your system for living is either helping you get closer to the life you want or making it even more difficult for you to live your best life. Better systems create efficiency. and multiply your effectiveness.‚ÄúThe systems-thinking lens allows us to reclaim our intuition about whole systems and hone our abilities to understand parts, see interconnections, ask ‚Äúwhat-if ‚Äù questions about possible future behaviours, and be creative and courageous about system redesign,‚Äù argues Meadows.Peak performers consistently spend time discovering, upgrading, and measuring new systems for living a better life. They are in a perpetual state of growth and self-innovation.In his book, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind: 10 Unconventional Laws to Redefine Your Life and Succeed On Your Own Terms, Vishen Lakhiani explains, ‚ÄúExtraordinary minds understand that their growth depends on two things: their models of reality and their systems for living. They carefully curate the most empowering models and systems and frequently update themselves.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs the only way to continuous growth. Your success hugely depends on your accumulated systems and principles for living. To facilitate extraordinary results, aim to upgrade your systems for living ‚Äî rewrite your models of reality.Whatever your culture trained you to believe, you can choose to change it to match what you expect of yourself or your possible reality. Highly effective performers of our time do not need to seek validation to pursue their true north.Once you push yourself into something new that works or delivers real results, a whole new world of opportunities opens up. But you might get hurt. But amazingly when you heal ‚Äî you are somewhere you‚Äôve never been. Somewhere you never thought you could go.True progress and success in a world that expects you to follow convention is the understanding that your view of change and success is what created your current world and that you are capable of changing that reality if it‚Äôs not working in your favour.When an old belief no longer serves you, you have every right to swap it out, upgrade it, improve it, or update it. A lot has been figured out already, it‚Äôs our responsibility to find the best models for living a meaningful life and apply them to our personal circumstances.If you are not winning, change the rules. If you can‚Äôt change the rules, ignore them, find and apply new ones that bring out the best in you.If your current system for living is not helping you live your best life, build a new one or upgrade or update your current system.When building a system for living, ask yourself what tools, resources, information, or people you need to design a personal approach for living your best life.Start by reviewing your current ones and their impacts on your current life. You can track your decision-making process, daily habits, routines and actions for a few weeks by recording the important ones. Plan to eliminate redundancies.Once the review process is over, educate yourself about new models, principles or systems that are working for extraordinary minds or people you admire. 3 Shortcuts to High-Level Thinking is a recent article I wrote that can help you improve your thinking process. You can also read Shane Parish‚Äôs 109 Models for making Intelligent Decisions.Plan an upgrade phase of your life and start implementing the new set of models or systems ‚Äî try out new things at a specific time. You could consider an upgrade at the beginning of the week or month.Start reframing your perceptions, worldviews, or habits you rely on daily to take action then start revising them to fit a more affirmative and empowering model.Once you begin the process, track your actions. Get into the habit of regularly measuring your progress. You‚Äôll find what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not. Don‚Äôt be afraid to swap systems, if, after measuring, you find your current system isn‚Äôt working.‚ÄúSystems are never perfect. Our needs change; the obstacles we need to overcome or the goals we want to accomplish change. Systems can never be static. You won‚Äôt be able to build a system, do a little regular maintenance, and expect it to run along smoothly forever,‚Äù writes Annie Mueller of Asian Efficiency.

He argues that so called ‚Äògreen growth‚Äô ‚Äî the idea that we can decouple intensive resource use from economic growth ‚Äî is a myth. George Monbiot has shared a similar concern, echoing previous warnings by influential writers Naomi Klein and Paul Ehrlich.I‚Äôm going to focus on Hickel‚Äôs work, since it contains several related misconceptions that are nonetheless highly intuitive. In his article and across his other writings, Hickel makes three key basic claims:1. There are hard physical limits to how efficiently we can use resources. It follows that infinite economic growth is impossible on our physically finite planet.2. Empirical studies are showing that we cannot ‚Äòdecouple‚Äô resource use from economic growth, meaning we will run out of resources if economic growth continues.3. We can maintain high living standards even with zero global economic growth.Let‚Äôs look at each claim in turn.1. Is infinite growth impossible?In his article, Hickel claims that there are strict physical limits to how efficiently we can use resources, which means pursuing economic growth in the form of rising GDP will eventually exhaust all resources on the planet. Hickel relies on conclusions from three empirical studies that purport to demonstrate this, which I will unpack in my response to his second claim. But here I just want to clarify what exactly economic growth is. By doing so we can understand why economic growth does not in principle depend on unsustainable resource depletion, before examining if such future growth is an empirical plausibility.‚ÄòEconomic growth‚Äô refers to the increase in, and improvement of, goods and services that are useful to human beings. This is often conflated with what is called ‚Äòextractivism‚Äô: which is the obviously finite process of extracting material resources from the Earth to sell on the market. The former is a necessary process for the continuous flourishing of humanity, the latter erroneously conceives of nature as, in Naomi Klein‚Äôs words, a ‚Äòbottomless vending machine‚Äô.Since the Earth consists only of a finite amount of matter and energy, we clearly cannot indefinitely consume its contents without eventually drowning in waste or starving to death. But even this obvious insight contains a misconception. We never actually ‚Äòconsume‚Äô matter and energy in the first place. We are forever bound by the first law of thermodynamics, which dictates that matter and energy are never created or destroyed, only transformed.This brings us back to economic growth. Fundamentally, it is the process of human beings transforming matter and energy into more valuable forms via the development of theoretical and practical knowledge. It is ‚Äòeconomic value‚Äô which increases exponentially, measured (very)roughly by GDP. The crucial point is that while the extraction of finite physical resources cannot increase indefinitely on a finite planet, economic growth actually can.Steven Pinker describes the infinite potential of economic growth eloquently in his book Enlightenment Now:‚Äò‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a fallacy to think that people ‚Äúneed resources‚Äù in the first place. They need ways of growing food, moving around, lighting their homes, displaying information, and other sources of well-being. They satisfy these needs with ideas: with recipes, formulas, techniques, blueprints, and algorithms for manipulating the physical world to give them what they want. The human mind, with its recursive combinatorial power, can explore an infinite space of ideas, and is not limited by the quantity of any particular kind of stuff in the ground.‚ÄôOf course, it‚Äôs abundantly clear from history that most civilisations have failed miserably to generate and implement the requisite knowledge to provide for the needs and desires of their citizens. This brings us to Hickel‚Äôs empirical claim: that our own current trajectory is leading us to disaster.2. Prediction or prophesy?One might reasonably suspect that the promise of infinite economic growth would only be plausible for a sufficiently advanced civilisation ‚Äî particularly one that has managed to wean itself off fossil fuels. We should therefore ask if decoupling economic growth from resource use is likely to be feasible given our relatively primitive level of technological development.On Hickel‚Äôs account, things are not looking good. He cites several studies which suggest there is no way to avoid running out of resources if we continue with our current rate of economic growth.The main problem with these studies is that they tend to presume a certain fixed ‚Äòbiocapacity‚Äô of the Earth. This concept and the corresponding notion of humanity‚Äôs ‚Äòecological footprint‚Äô have many problems, the most fundamental of which is that they depend arbitrarily on our current level of scientific and technological development. This is because the maximum level of human consumption that our planet can support is not fixed by some natural law ‚Äî it depends entirely on the sophistication of our technology to convert raw materials efficiently into life-supporting forms.The very same lump of matter and energy has vastly different properties to us humans depending on the level of and quality of our knowledge. Major scientific breakthroughs therefore allow us to do dramatically more with less. One kilogram of uranium contains two to three million times more energy than the same amount of coal or oil, but this fact went completely unnoticed by everyone up until fundamental breakthroughs in physics in the 20th century.Similarly, the invention of desalination techniques unlocked the effectively boundless supply of seawater. While the rest of the Middle East suffers water shortages, Israel has a surplus ‚Äî thanks to advances that have reduced the costs of desalination by two-thirds since 1990.One study mentioned by Hickel calculated that we‚Äôll be using 95 billion metric tons of resources globally in 2050. But this figure is meaningless without a corresponding estimate of what fraction that is of the Earth‚Äôs total resources. And we can‚Äôt know what Earth‚Äôs total resources are because we cannot predict future fundamental technological advances.At one point Hickel declares that the sustainable level of global resource use is about 50 billion metric tons a year, without citing any source or justification. The authors of the 2012 study he references cited this same figure as a possible upper limit on global resource extraction, being roughly the level of extraction there was in 1992. But why choose this year? Because that was the year of the first United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In other words, it was picked out of a hat.Even where these studies make allowances for future improvements in how efficiently we use resources, they only allow for greater efficiency in the use of resources we currently know about. If the future is anything like the past, we will discover whole new ways to build and power things, and replace whole classes of raw materials we currently depend upon.Then there‚Äôs the fact that these studies‚Äô predicted improvements in resource efficiency are themselves woefully pessimistic. The most optimistic prediction in the studies Hickel mentions is that resource efficiency will double by 2050. But almost any consumer product we use today requires far fewer resources to build and run than their equivalent 32 years ago. While it‚Äôs a somewhat trite example, take the iPhone. This one product has replaced landline push-button phones, pagers, cameras and camcorders, calendars, alarm clocks, audio-recorders, flashlights, maps, GPS, credit cards, and more. We should only expect this kind of dematerialization to accelerate over the next 32 years, given the rapid advances being made in nanotechnology and materials science.This fundamental fallacy driving the pessimism of these studies was eloquently captured by David Deutsh in his book The Beginning of Infinity. In the chapter ‚ÄòUnsustainable‚Äô, Deutsch reflects on Paul Erlich warning his high school class in 1971 of the impending global ecological collapse, a tragedy which never came to pass:‚ÄòEhrlich thought that he was investigating a planet‚Äôs physical resources and predicting their rate of decline. In fact he was prophesying the content of future knowledge. And, by envisaging a future in which only the best knowledge of 1971 was deployed, he was implicitly assuming that only a small and rapidly dwindling set of problems would ever be solved again.‚ÄôIt‚Äôs perfectly acceptable and prudent to make predictions about future resource scarcity, so long as you remember that such predictions are based on our current level of scientific knowledge. Such analyses play a crucial role in motivating us to invest more in advancing our knowledge, but Hickel mistakenly interprets their findings as fatalistic signs that we must cease economic growth altogether. And this, as I‚Äôll show below, is simply not an option.3. A world with no growth?How might the world look if Hickel has his way, and global economic growth is brought to a halt? He thinks we‚Äôll be just fine, claiming that ‚Äòour planet provides more than enough for all of us; the problem is that its resources are not equally distributed.‚ÄôIt‚Äôs a claim often made: that the world is plenty rich enough for everyone, if only those wealthy fat-cats had the empathy to share their billions with the rest of humanity. Recently the distinguished British physicist Sir Martin Rees similarly exclaimed:‚ÄòWe have a billion people in the world in abject poverty, which could be alleviated by the wealth of the thousand richest people on the planet. That we allow that to continue surely says something significant about how much ‚Äî or little ‚Äî moral progress we‚Äôve made since medieval times.‚ÄôIn his critique of Hickel‚Äôs argument, Noah Smith dismissed the panacea of global wealth redistribution as a political and logistical impossibility. In his response, Hickel reassured Smith that we can indeed distribute global wealth with policies like introducing a global minimum wage, democratizing global economic governance institutions, implementing subsidies and tariffs in developing countries, cancelling national debts, or rolling out a global basic income.Hickel appreciates the political difficulties of implementing these policies, but the more important question is whether such measures can actually achieve their intended aims in principle.The notion that redistributing world income is the solution to global poverty is both intuitively plausible and spectacularly false. It makes sense to us on an emotional level when we are confronted with images of billionaires swanning around on mega-yachts on the Mediterranean, juxtaposed with children starving in a war-induced famine in Yemen. But we need to put this visceral imagery aside for a moment and look at some stark numerical realities.How much wealth is there in the whole world? Credit Suisse puts it currently at around $317 trillion USD. How much would each person in the world have if that were divided equally among all 7.6 billion of us? $41,710.To be clear, this is the amount of cash each human being would have if everything of economic value (houses, cars, furniture, spectacles, intellectual property, everything) was traded to aliens for cash in return. (Try to ignore the logical and inflationary issues of aliens forging vast amounts of US currency ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a thought experiment).As is comically depicted by Tim Urban on his blog Wait But Why, we would then all just be huddled naked together next to our equal piles of cash, which we would then presumably try to eat or burn for warmth. But suppose we could actually buy goods and services back from the aliens, at their current day prices. What could each of us afford? Perhaps a new car and some tanks of fuel, enough basic food supplies for a few years, a decent tent, warm clothes, and other survival equipment. That‚Äôs about it.No houses. No electricity. No internet. No schools, no hospitals, no government.In other words, we would all be living in what is generally considered today to be dire poverty. And this is presuming that all wealth is somehow convertible into cash, which it isn‚Äôt. Thus the aliens. In reality the vast majority of economic wealth does not exist in fungible, divisible, monetary form.Take the approximately one trillion dollars of value that the company Apple represents. You can‚Äôt divide up ownership of such a company equally among the world population and expect it to still exist in any recognisable form. And a company is one of the more abstract kinds of things one can own. Forget about divvying up something more physically tangible like a toy-making factory or a uranium mine.Economic wealth is something that needs to be created, by people, wherever they are situated. People in impoverished countries need better knowledge, skills, and institutions to create more economic wealth, if they are going to reach the living standards enjoyed in OECD countries. Those in advanced economies need to keep increasing their wealth in order to be able to tackle the increasingly complex challenges they‚Äôll be facing in the future.This doesn‚Äôt mean that we shouldn‚Äôt give generously to people in need. But we need to keep in mind the end goal: assisting them to achieve sustainable economic growth. Indeed merely redistributing wealth can end up crowding out the development of sustainable local economies, as the philosopher Larry Temkin has discussed.Going forward, there is no alternative to huge increases in global economic growth. Contrary to our strong intuitions, infinite economic growth is both logically and practically possible on our finite planet, and utterly necessary if we want to provide every person on Earth with a decent lifestyle. We should not be taken in by prophesies to the contrary, which have come and gone since the beginning of human progress itself.WRITTEN BY"
180,Is it time to end single-family zoning?,https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/is-it-time-to-end-single-family-zoning-56233d69a25a?source=extreme_main_feed---------183-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"At the heart of the movie ‚ÄúParasite‚Äù ‚Äî among the favorites for best picture heading into this weekend‚Äôs Academy Awards‚Äî is a tale of two cities.On one hand, we have a poor family living in a dirty basement apartment in a dense downtown area, the stench of subway attached to them, scraping free Wi-Fi signals in search of a chance to move up. On the other hand, we have a wealthy family living in a modern suburban home, with a sleek black car to chauffeur them around, a big green lawn to soak up the sun, and a high-tech security system to keep out dirty basement types (quite unsuccessfully, we later find, to horrific ends).To anyone interested in cities, such a premise can‚Äôt help but call to mind the complicated relationship between urban development and social justice ‚Äî especially since, in the U.S. at least, the word ‚Äúparasite‚Äù itself is deeply entrenched in this subject‚Äôs history. The term features prominently in the Supreme Court‚Äôs landmark 1926 ruling that established the basis for single-family zoning in America, in a disturbing passage that might as well have been the movie‚Äôs original treatment:‚Ä¶ very often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the district. Moreover, the coming of one apartment house is followed by others, interfering by their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon the smaller homes, and bringing, as their necessary accompaniments, the disturbing noises incident to increased traffic and business, and the occupation, by means of moving and parked automobiles, of larger portions of the streets, thus detracting from their safety and depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play, enjoyed by those in more favored localities ‚Äî until, finally, the residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a place of detached residences are utterly destroyed.Nearly a century into the story of single-family zoning, the plot is finally starting to twist. The City of Minneapolis and the State of Oregon both recently passed laws that loosen single-family regulations. California has proposed similar measures: some have failed (such as one encouraging denser development near transit), others have succeeded (such as ones encouraging backyard cottages). New bills in Maryland and Virginia also take aim.Given these trends, the moment is right for everyone concerned with the future of cities to revisit single-family zoning, and indeed, there‚Äôs an entire issue of the Journal of the American Planning Association dedicated to that very debate. Published in January, the issue features nine essays, representing 14 total planning voices, taking up the question of whether or not single-family zoning‚Äôs time has come ‚Äî and, if so, what to do about it.A quick primer: single-family zoning (commonly known as R1 in planning parlance) prevents a community from building any type of housing in a given area except a detached single-family home. It‚Äôs nearly ubiquitous in the suburbs, but it‚Äôs also a central city problem. In San Francisco, 38 percent of residential land is zoned as R1; in Seattle, it‚Äôs 80 percent. Together this pattern creates an imbalance across an entire metro area‚Äôs housing market.The pervasiveness of the rule is one of the reasons for its destructive social impacts, which have been documented in great detail. In brief, there‚Äôs compelling evidence that single-family zoning has damaged the environment by encouraging suburban sprawl and car reliance, worsened affordability by restricting housing supply, and undermined inclusion by keeping lower-income households out of high-opportunity neighborhoods.With this context in mind, two JAPA papers say it‚Äôs time for single-family zoning to go.One comes from UCLA planning and policy scholars Michael Manville, Paavo Monkkonen, and Michael Lens, who write: ‚ÄúIn the 21st century, no city should have any land where nothing can be built except a detached single-family home.‚ÄùThe other comes from planning scholar Jake Wegmann of the University of Texas-Austin, who hopes to see single-family zoning replaced by ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù housing. He writes: ‚ÄúFor members of the planning profession to make headway against the climate and inequality crises, they must cease defending the indefensible concept of single-family zoning.‚ÄùThe papers each make a powerful case for ending single-family zoning, and are recommended in full. But in the interest of summary, here are six of their strongest points:People can still build single-family homes. One of the most common arguments for keeping single-family zoning is that most people prefer single-family homes. That‚Äôs increasingly not the case, as seen by the premiums found in walkable urban neighborhoods, and studies show a desire for denser living even in car-friendly areas. But even if that were true, it wouldn‚Äôt be a good argument for single-family zoning, because removing the rule doesn‚Äôt prevent such housing from being built. If people still wanted these homes, developers would continue to build them. They‚Äôd just be allowed to build other types as well ‚Äî in response to household preference.Communities can still prevent Manhattanization. A primary goal of ending single-family zoning is to help new households move into neighborhoods they can‚Äôt currently access. That push for more housing is not to be mistaken with an invitation for skyscrapers. A community can still impose height restrictions without precluding the creation of alternative housing types, such as accessory dwellings or multiplexes. Cities like Washington, D.C., employ such restrictions and still generate loads of dense development, as well as single-family homes. And, as the UCLA scholars point out, Paris has a height restriction without much of either extreme: single-family or skyscraper.The missing middle can unlock affordability. At its core, this push for more middle-density development is really a push for more housing affordability. Wegmann points to a recent case in Austin, where a developer used a zoning loophole to build six homes on a lot that would normally house just two single-family homes. Each sold in the mid-$400,000 range ‚Äî or $200,000 less than the area average. While that‚Äôs still beyond the reach of many low-income households, creating more middle-income options ultimately frees up public resources to focus on creating affordable housing for those most in need.There‚Äôs a sustainability case for the missing middle, too, with evidence showing that significant carbon savings come from converting low-density development to medium-density.Upzoning won‚Äôt necessarily spoil housing investments. While single-family zoning successfully protects housing investments, Wegmann argues that‚Äôs not the role of planning, which should instead focus on creating more sustainable and equitable cities. And the UCLA scholars point out that upzoning an area can increase property values as well, by raising land prices for developers. ‚ÄúThe question, then, is not whether homeowners will receive windfalls,‚Äù they write. ‚ÄúIt is whether those windfalls will come from maintaining housing scarcity or enabling housing abundance.‚ÄùExisting tenants can be protected. Both papers acknowledge that ending single-family zoning could lead developers to build more housing in lower-income areas, where land is less expensive, ultimately displacing long-time or low-income residents. That‚Äôs a very real possibility, and one that should ‚Äî and can ‚Äî be safeguarded through rental protections. The UCLA scholars also note that single-family neighborhoods aren‚Äôt typically the ones facing these risks: only 4% of detached single-family homes in the U.S. hold renters with incomes less than $25,000 a year, according to 2017 Census figures.Infrastructure strains can be managed. More people means more competition for shared space and shared infrastructure. The papers argue that these concerns can be managed in ways that balance the risks with the benefits. Parking shortages can be handled by allowing non-covered spaces or limiting on-street permits. More utility users also means more revenue for upgrades or maintenance. Family-friendly designs can keep higher-density communities safe and welcoming for kids. And the alternative to ending single-family zoning ‚Äî pushing development further away from dense cores ‚Äî creates new infrastructure strains of its own.The rest of the special issue featured contributions that augmented, or in some cases attacked, the points made above. Again, in the interest of brevity, these will be summarized by their key points, but many of the full papers are worth reading.Minneapolis shows the path forward. Paul Mogush and Heather Worthington, planners from City of Minneapolis, explained how they dented the R1 armor. First, they studied its history and confirmed the impact that restrictive zoning had on minority households. Then they settled on what they call an ‚Äúobvious‚Äù first step toward improving housing equity: ‚ÄúStart by reversing the regulations that planners began using a century ago to stifle opportunity for people of color.‚Äù Minneapolis now encourages the missing middle by allowing at least three residential units on each parcel throughout the city and multifamily buildings ‚Äúby right‚Äù near transit hubs. And to address displacement concerns, they committed to affordable housing investments and tenant protections.Maryland isn‚Äôt so sure. Gerritt Knaap and Nicholas Finio, planners at the University of Maryland-College Park, aren‚Äôt sure their state will ultimately approve a Minneapolis- or Oregon-style law encouraging denser development, based on informal discussions with local government, developers, and even environmental groups ‚Äî none of whom supported such measures. The reasons varied from legitimate concerns, such as serving low-density areas with transit and overcrowding schools, to more surprising responses, such as a vague distaste for ‚Äúactivist‚Äù planning. ‚ÄúNeedless to say, without support from these groups, it seems unlikely single-family zoning will be banned in Maryland any time soon,‚Äù they conclude.(It‚Äôs unclear whether the responses preceded Maryland‚Äôs latest proposal, which does try to address many common concerns.)Incremental change is wiser. Glen Searle and Peter Phibbs, planning scholars at the University of Sydney, noted how unusual America‚Äôs zoning rules are. By contrast, in Sydney, planners actively pursue the missing middle. Still, they expressed caution against going from such a high share of single-family zoning to eliminating it. Their most persuasive point is that removing the rule might unintentionally promote more car use, since communities will now have more people living in places where transit is tough to provide. For this and other reasons, they suggest instead a ‚Äúmodified set of rules‚Äù in areas that are already suitable for greater density.Political capital is better spent elsewhere. Arnab Chakraborty, urban planning professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, questioned whether ending single-family zoning alone would really improve affordability or help low-income households move to high-opportunity neighborhoods. (To that point, raised elsewhere, others agreed that ending R1 is necessary but not sufficient.) Calling for a ‚Äúmore measured approach,‚Äù Chakraborty cautioned that tackling single-family zoning will require enormous amounts of political capital that could better be deployed elsewhere, such as targeted affordability programs.Focus on undeveloped areas. In the most contentious essay, Lane Kendig of the Kendig Keast Collaborative planning firm calls ending single-family zoning a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù and a ‚Äúfacile remedy‚Äù for affordability. Kendig essentially argues that because ending single-family zoning will not end income-driven segregation, there‚Äôs no point. (To such points, the UCLA scholars reply that just because people commit crimes with a knife doesn‚Äôt mean governments shouldn‚Äôt pursue gun control.) Instead of battling for greater density in existing single-family areas, Kendig suggests focusing on undeveloped land and replacing conditional zoning rules that invite local opposition with performance-based zoning (a good idea, discussed more below), inclusionary zoning, and affordable housing mandates.Ethics demand a change. Taking a strictly professional angle, urban studies professor Anaid Yerena of the University of Washington says planners have an ‚Äúethical responsibility‚Äù to eliminate single-family zoning. Yerena quotes from the American Institute of Certified Planners Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, which states: ‚ÄúWe shall seek social justice by working to expand choice and opportunity for all persons, recognizing a special responsibility to plan for the needs of the disadvantaged and to promote racial and economic integration.‚Äù To Yerena, eliminating single-family zoning is an obligation ‚Äî ‚Äúnot merely a matter of choice.‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs needed most are new housing models. In perhaps the issue‚Äôs most persuasive piece, urban planning scholar Harley F. Etienne of the University of Michigan says abolishing single-family zoning isn‚Äôt enough to change a century of entrenched land use patterns and cultural attachments. Instead, planners need to go even further and offer a new model of development that ‚Äúenables the public to aspire to a different mode of housing tenure.‚Äù This new model must encourage middle- and low-income housing, give these households access to good schools and jobs, and provide pathways for them to catch-up on the generations of wealth-creation they‚Äôve missed out on. Until such a housing model comes along, writes Etienne, ‚Äúwe do not stand much of a chance.‚ÄùSingle-family zoning is a policy challenge that needs a policy solution. It‚Äôs not something technology can address on its own. But there are still a set of urban planning innovations (including some being development by Sidewalk Labs) that can advance the conversation in constructive ways ‚Äî especially for single-family zoning in urban areas suitable for transit or greater density. These tools can make the spurious arguments for single-family zoning harder to defend, help evaluate or even relieve the legitimate concerns, and expand the menu of housing options.Here‚Äôs a few we‚Äôre working on:Flexible apartments. To the critical point raised by Etienne, right now the collective American housing ideal tends to follow a reliable trajectory that ends in suburban home ownership. Of course, that‚Äôs not true for everyone, and it‚Äôs increasingly less true across the country, but it remains the model of record. Breaking that pattern requires new urban housing options that can follow a household across a lifetime. That could mean flexible furniture that makes 500 square feet feel like 650; flexible units that can expand as a family grows (or contract as nests empty); and shared building spaces or neighborhood amenities that make square footage just one of many factors guiding a housing choice. Or it might mean financing models that help households generate home-value, such as shared equity programs that let tenants own a small share of a place ‚Äî with a smaller down-payment ‚Äî while renting the rest.Factory-driven affordability. Some of the more cautious papers noted that zoning alone won‚Äôt unlock affordability, and it‚Äôs true that improving affordability requires pulling all sorts of policy levers. One of the strongest cards local government can play comes through its sale of publicly owned land, especially around transit hubs, to generate more affordable housing. As factory-driven construction methods improve, accelerating the pace of development projects, the value of such land stands to rise. The public sector can capture this value and ensure the creation of affordable housing in a few ways. One promising approach is to establish a housing trust fund that ‚Äúlock-boxes‚Äù land premiums for affordable units, ensuring a steady source of funding over the long term.Outcome-based zoning. Even opponents of ending single-family zoning (like Kendig) recognize the problems that arise when communities can reject new housing development for arbitrary reasons. At the same time, even strong proponents of abolishing this rule recognize that households deserve some basic assurances of neighborhood character ‚Äî preventing, as Wegmann says, a smelting factory from moving in next door. Moving toward an outcome-based zoning system makes it possible to offer basic protections around common priorities like air quality, noise, or public health without the broad strokes of single-family zoning. Officials can set thresholds according to community preferences, then measure them via manual checks or environmental sensors. It‚Äôs the neighborhood character outcomes that should matter most, not how a particular development achieves them.Generative neighborhood design. Going all the way back to 1926, proponents of single-family zoning have voiced concerns around things like blocking sunlight or reducing open space. These community needs can often stand in conflict with developer needs around density and total housing units: increase a building height in one place, create shadows in another. The common way of weighing these tradeoffs is for developers or planners to commission a small handful of neighborhood designs, at a very high cost. But advances in computational design make it possible to simulate millions of planning scenarios and identify many options that satisfy all project priorities, from developers and communities alike. And such tools also make it possible to discuss these options openly and transparently.On-demand mobility instead of parking. Parking can be one of the most contentious issues that block new developments in single-family areas, with existing residents worried about having a space for their car. Setting aside the validity of such concerns ‚Äî which effectively place the rights of cars above the opportunities of people ‚Äî it‚Äôs true that single-family areas tend to require a car, given that transit service just can‚Äôt offer the same mobility freedom. But in new developments near transit stations, in particular, it‚Äôs possible to replace parking requirements with a package of on-demand mobility options (such as ride-hail or bike-share) that offer the same convenience as owning a car, at a comparable or even lower price, without requiring a parking space.At one point in the movie ‚ÄúParasite,‚Äù a character says something to the effect of: the best plan is no plan. The urban planning profession probably wouldn‚Äôt agree, but then again, if this special issue is any indication, it also wouldn‚Äôt have a consensus that the best plan is single-family zoning. The debate is clearly just heating up.Follow Sidewalk Labs with our weekly newsletter and our podcast, ‚ÄúCity of the Future.‚ÄùWRITTEN BY"

T‚ÄôS NBA TRADE DEADLINE WEEK! The trade deadline is earlier now since the league moved the deadline up before the All-Star Break, so teams have until only Thursday afternoon to make their big move.There are a million trade articles, and all the most likely trade names are being discussed. I don‚Äôt have much to add to that discussion. But there are four legit NBA stars I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned a ton that I think could be sneaky trade targets this week, four top-50 guys worth considering.Just to be clear, there are no rumors or sources here, just sheer irresponsible speculation. It‚Äôs NBA Trade Deadline week! Let‚Äôs have some fun. Here are four stars that might make sense to move and a few deals that could make sense‚Ä¶I‚Äôve had my eye on Myles Turner from the moment the Pacers drafted Goga Bitadze this summer. Bitadze has been good in limited minutes and projects as a quality all-around starting center, and probably soon. That gives Indiana three legit NBA big men, including newly-minted All Star Domantas Sabonis.Indiana has quieted some questions about how well Sabonis and Turner can play together this season, but I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a perfect fit. And even if it does fit, Sabonis just got a fat $75-million extension. Turner makes $72 million over these next four years, and both he and Bitadze cost a first-round pick (and Sabonis came partly at the cost of Paul George, albeit with Victor Oladipo). That‚Äôs just a LOT of investment in big men in the modern NBA.Myles Turner is pretty good. But so are Sabonis and Bitadze, and Turner makes the most sense to trade. Indiana has an All-Star in Sabonis and just got its other All-Star back in Victor Oladipo. Malcolm Brogdon has slowed down since his injury, but he was playing at an All-Star level early this season too. Turner was listed as an All-Star candidate himself a year ago.The Pacers wouldn‚Äôt just trade Turner to dump him. He definitely has positive value, and in many senses, it might make sense to wait until the summer or beyond to trade Turner, when Bitadze would be more ready for a bigger role. But Indiana might see a real window to win the East this year. If they think they can hang with Milwaukee, there‚Äôs no reason they can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre the #2 team in the East, especially with Oladipo back and maybe another addition in a Turner trade.So what sort of Turner trades might be out there?The Celtics need a center. Enes Kanter, Daniel Theis, Vincent Poirier, and Romeo Langford get there on salary. But that‚Äôs a pretty weak haul for Indiana, even if it brings Romeo back home and replaces the center minutes on bargain contracts.The Nets could offer Caris LeVert, a nice fit at small forward for the Pacers. Turner would be an upgrade at center for Brooklyn, but then they‚Äôd be stuck with DeAndre Jordan and Jarrett Allen on the trade block in need of a wing.The Lakers are a popular big man destination, but they don‚Äôt have much positive value to offer. Not enough for Turner.Their L.A. rivals are a more intriguing partner. The Clippers can offer Ivica Zubac on a cheap contract as a viable third big man for the Pacers. They could add in Moe Harkless or Rodney McGruder, the type of wing defender the Pacers lack right now, and can also sweeten a deal with Jerome Robinson, Mfiondu Kabengele, and/or this year‚Äôs first-round pick. There‚Äôs no blue chipper there, but that‚Äôs a bunch of positive assets.DeMar DeRozan would be an interesting Pacers addition. A team of Brogdon, Oladipo, DeRozan, and Sabonis is pretty fascinating and feels like a real playoff threat, and the Pacers and Spurs have some trade history. Indiana would need to include Doug McDermott to match salary. Do the Spurs want Turner with LaMarcus Aldridge? Maybe not, but he might be a long-term answer and give San Antonio a core of Turner, Dejounte Murray, and Derrick White to build around.And we haven‚Äôt even gotten to my three most intriguing Turner destinations.What about the Kings? What if Sacramento offered Dewayne Dedmon or Richaun Holmes along with Bogdan Bogdanovic? Dedmon and Bogdanovic are both really interesting fits in Indiana. Dedmon gives them the stretch big they wish Turner was, and Indiana will have the cash this summer to sign Bogdanovic and let him create off the bench.The Pelicans could work too. New Orleans can return Derrick Favors in a deal as an ideal Turner replacement for this season, but what else would the Pacers ask for? The Pels have a slew of young players and picks. Turner seems like a pretty nice fit next to Zion Williamson long-term. We‚Äôll get back to this one.The Hawks seem like the perfect fit. Atlanta badly needs a defense-first big man, and Turner fits pretty well next to John Collins. The Hawks can return Alex Len as a short-term center replacement, plus plenty of expiring salary fodder. So what‚Äôs in it for Indiana? You figure Trae Young, De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, and Collins are probably off the table. Would the Hawks give up Kevin Huerter? If not, it might mean Cam Reddish and/or a pick. Reddish is the exact sort of talented wing Indiana has developed many times over the years, and a lottery-protected Brooklyn pick is a nice moderate asset.A lot of those deals will be there this summer. Most of them, really. But if Indiana thinks a piece can help them now, the East window might be more open now than next year, once Kevin Durant is back for Brooklyn.Hey, speaking of which‚Ä¶Spencer Dinwiddie is one of my favorite trade pieces. He‚Äôs an a terrific contract at three years and $34 million, with a player option that likely means it expires in summer 2021, when everyone wants cap room.Dinwiddie is a league-average starting point guard on a real bargain contract. He had a real All-Star case this season and was putting up huge numbers with Kyrie Irving out, 25 points and 7 assists a game.But just how valuable is Dinwiddie to Brooklyn? He‚Äôs super valuable this season, but who really cares about this season for the Nets? This season was lost the moment they signed Kevin Durant. Every move Brooklyn makes should be geared toward next season, even if that means missing the playoffs this year.For next season, the Nets will plan to start Kyrie Irving, Caris LeVert, Kevin Durant, and either DeAndre Jordan or Jarrett Allen. Heck of a team. You know who doesn‚Äôt fit on that team? Spencer Dinwiddie. Oh sure, he‚Äôs super valuable for 20 regular season games when Kyrie is hurt, but that team is building for ceiling, not floor, and its ceiling has Kyrie playing 35 minutes. That leaves 13 point guard minutes for Dinwiddie when the games matter most, plus a few more that don‚Äôt fit that well next to Irving, since Dinwiddie isn‚Äôt a great shooter.The unfortunate truth is that Dinwiddie doesn‚Äôt fit where this roster is heading. Brooklyn can get by with a cheaper backup point guard. If you had that core above, what would you want to add for a team that will have championship aspirations next season? I think you want shooting and defensive wings and forwards. And you might already have shooting if you keep Joe Harris around. What you don‚Äôt need is one more guy that needs the ball in his hands to be useful.One of my absolute favorite fake trades is Spencer Dinwiddie for Aaron Gordon. That one‚Äôs really intriguing for both teams. Aaron Gordon is on a declining contract, which will become super valuable to a cash-strapped team like Brooklyn. Couldn‚Äôt he come in an be Draymond lite for this team? Gordon is a poor match as a go-to scorer but a pretty interesting as a third or fourth option that focuses on defense. Isn‚Äôt a Brooklyn lineup with KD and AG as its bigs pretty interesting? For Orlando, they haven‚Äôt had a good point guard for years, and Gordon is redundant with Jonathan Isaac and their centers around. Maybe Markelle Fultz develops into that option, but isn‚Äôt Spencer Dinwiddie a nice in-between option that boosts their playoff hopes?There aren‚Äôt as many other great options, because most teams have a point guard they‚Äôre already committed to.Minnesota and Robert Covington make sense. Dinwiddie would give Karl-Anthony Towns a real pick-and-roll partner for the first time ever, and RoCo is the exact sort of 3-and-D wing that would fit perfectly in Brooklyn. The bargain contracts match up perfectly too. Dinwiddie isn‚Äôt a perfect timeline fit in Minnesota but he fits well if the Wolves use their high pick this summer on one of the many lead guards available and need a few years to develop him.I really like Otto Porter as a fit here too. I really like Otto Porter, period. He was one of my most intriguing trade targets and would‚Äôve had his whole section here, but he‚Äôs always hurt. Porter is expensive too, but he could opt out this summer and sign a long-term deal that fits better. Again, Porter (if healthy) is an absolutely ideal fit in Brooklyn, and Dinwiddie would finally give Chicago a point guard next to Zach LaVine, with Coby White a better fit off the bench. Chicago could even return Tomas Satoransky on a similar contract as a valid bench point guard and someone that could play next to Irving too.The real crown jewel would be Jrue Holiday. But Dinwiddie isn‚Äôt a great timeline fit in New Orleans, and Brooklyn probably doesn‚Äôt have enough other assets to intrigue the Pelicans.Three-and-D wings are hard to come by. And that‚Äôs exactly why Brooklyn should take advantage of Spencer Dinwiddie‚Äôs value and trade for one.There‚Äôs another reason the Nets should trade Spencer Dinwiddie soon ‚Äî because Brooklyn needs the same thing as Golden State, with those teams competing for the same missing 3-and-D wing piece with an eye toward building a 2020‚Äì21 championship roster.Russell costs a lot more than Dinwiddie. He‚Äôs under contract for four years and $117 million, a max deal.Golden State‚Äôs lineup next year will be Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and a center ‚Äî plus a fifth player. Do you really think they believe that fifth player is D‚ÄôAngelo Russell? I don‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm not sure why they would. Like Brooklyn, this team has plenty of ball handling when it‚Äôs whole. They need shooting and defense, not a guy that wants the ball all game.The Warriors need the exact same thing as the Nets, so the same guys are good options.You‚Äôve already read a hundred articles about a possible DLo deal for a Robert Covington package. There are a hundred because it makes sense. RoCo is a perfect fit.So is a hypothetically healthy Otto Porter. Actually Porter would be absolutely lethal for Golden State ‚Äî like what Harrison Barnes was supposed to be, except not sucky. DLo and LaVine would be a sieve defensively, but that‚Äôs Chicago‚Äôs problem and it‚Äôs never stopped them before.The Aaron Gordon fit isn‚Äôt as strong here since the Warriors already have actual Draymond, but he‚Äôs still interesting. Mo Bamba is a pretty fascinating fit too. Would the Magic give up Gordon and Bamba for a young star point guard? Probably not, but it can‚Äôt hurt to find out.Miami is another interesting option, if the Heat are willing to part with Justise Winslow. He fits at small forward, and a deal with something like Winslow, Kelly Olynyk, and Kendrick Nunn could work. That would give the Warriors three pieces that fit pretty well, but would Miami do it? They seem hellbent on keeping long-term salary off their roster, but DLo, Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo is a pretty strong quartet.The most interesting trade I never hear anyone talk about is D‚ÄôAngelo Russell for Jrue Holiday. Do you realize how devastating the Warriors would be (again) with Holiday next to Steph, Klay, and Draymond? He is the PERFECT fit in that role.Holiday is one of my favorite guys in the NBA, and it feels like people are finally noticing how valuable he is. I did an NBA redraft this summer and I rated Holiday among my top-25 players. His defense and versatility make him a strong addition to literally any NBA roster.And New Orleans isn‚Äôt going to give him away. But isn‚Äôt it weird that all the Holiday trade rumors focus on the team getting Jrue? Why not think about what New Orleans would want if they traded Holiday?If you‚Äôre the Pelicans and you know you are building around a future with Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson, what would you want? You‚Äôd want an elite young point guard, a stud defensive center, and (as always) help on the wing. Lonzo Ball could still be that point guard, and Jaxson Hayes the center, but the jury‚Äôs out.Look around the league. What plausibly attainable young players should the Pelicans target in a trade? Guys like Trae Young, Luka Doncic, and Jayson Tatum ain‚Äôt going anywhere. Ja Morant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander aren‚Äôt on the trade block. De‚ÄôAaron Fox is out. Ben Simmons doesn‚Äôt fit, even if he‚Äôs available. Donovan Mitchell? Nope. Jaylen Brown? Maybe. But the truth is that D‚ÄôAngelo Russell is actually one of the best fitting actually acquirable young players in the league for this roster.Holiday on the Warriors would just be unfair, maybe extending Golden State‚Äôs window by another couple years ‚Äî enough so for the Warriors to add in Eric Paschall or even this year‚Äôs draft pick to get the deal done, if necessary. Would the Pelicans really say no to DLo and the Warriors first for a guy that will be too old to be part of a real Zion and Ingram future?Of course, that‚Äôs all assuming one important thing ‚Äî that Brandon Ingram is definitely part of that future‚Ä¶Wait, what?Now hear me out.You probably think there‚Äôs no WAY the Pelicans would trade Brandon Ingram. Ingram was just named an All Star amidst a breakout season in which he‚Äôs averaging 25 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists a night on 47/40/86 shooting.Ingram is still just 22 years old, and if those numbers are legit, he‚Äôs suddenly one of the best young prospects in the league. You don‚Äôt trade away an asset like that, do you?Well‚Ä¶ you might. You might if you‚Äôre concerned about Ingram‚Äôs long-term health viability. Remember, this is a player that just had blood clot issues that cast a shadow over this season. I don‚Äôt have any special medical insight here, but if the Pels fear Ingram‚Äôs long-term value medically, they might be hesitant to commit to him.They might also wondering if the shooting is real. After all, Ingram shot 33% from deep and 66% from the line the past three seasons before his shooting explosion this year. Shooting can just be variance sometimes, and if Ingram‚Äôs shooting fades to average or below, his value might too. But Ingram has taken 281 threes this year and is still over 40% ‚Äî that‚Äôs not a fluke. Neither is 86% on 280 free throws. Those are significant samples. Probably.Beyond that, maybe New Orleans just doesn‚Äôt think Ingram is the right fit. After all, this is 100% Zion Williamson‚Äôs team, not Ingram‚Äôs. Maybe they feel Ingram isn‚Äôt the right skill set next to Zion. Maybe they think he‚Äôs an alpha mentality that won‚Äôt adjust well in a lesser role.One thing that‚Äôs certain ‚Äî Brandon Ingram will be making max money starting this summer. Ingram will be a free agent, and it‚Äôs an absolute stone cold lock that any number of teams will offer him a max deal this summer. New Orleans owns Ingram‚Äôs restricted rights, so they can match any deal, but they need to know they‚Äôll be paying him max money if they want to keep him. Ingram is already better than Andrew Wiggins, so there‚Äôs no real worry of a Wiggins-Towns type pairing here, but what if New Orleans isn‚Äôt sure they want to give Ingram that max contract?If they‚Äôre not, they might think about moving Ingram now, before the deadline, to one of those summer free agent destinations that‚Äôs interested in wooing Ingram now.One possible destination could be Indiana. Remember the Myles Turner deal above? What about a deal built around Turner plus something for Ingram and Derrick Favors? The Pacers would have Brogdon, Oladipo, Ingram, and Sabonis, although they‚Äôd have a pretty hefty tax bill once they start paying Ingram. What else would Indiana have to add? Turner sure seems like a nice fit next to Zion, so that‚Äôs a good start. Indiana doesn‚Äôt have much else that fits, including no first-round pick this year (they traded it for Brogdon). Probably not enough juice there.Charlotte and Cleveland also fall under the ‚Äúnot enough juice‚Äù category. The Cavs would have to build an offer around Darius Garland or Collin Sexton plus a pick. The Hornets could offer P.J. Washington, Devonte‚Äô Graham, and/or a pick. You never know what single player the Pelicans might love, but none of those seem like they move the needle enough.Memphis is super intriguing but only in a way that makes a deal untenable. The Grizzlies would surely love to add Ingram to a core of Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Brandon Clarke ‚Äî but that requires putting together a decent offer that doesn‚Äôt include those three. Memphis can‚Äôt trade their pick (Boston already owns it), and a pick three years from now isn‚Äôt doing the trick. Neither are DeAnthony Melton and Dillon Brooks. Would the Grizz part with Brandon Clarke? I‚Äôm drooling over a Zion-Clarke partnership, but New Orleans had multiple chances to do that themselves in the draft and didn‚Äôt bother.This is a bit more outlandish, but who says no to an Ingram-JJJ swap? It‚Äôs hard to build a more perfect hypothetical fit next to Zion than JJJ, to the point that I‚Äôd even consider adding in another pick or asset to get the job done if I were New Orleans. But I don‚Äôt see Memphis taking that deal ‚Äî especially if they think they can just sign Ingram for free this summer.That‚Äôs a real problem with an Ingram deal, admittedly. The moment the Pelicans start quietly offering Ingram around, any interested team should get very suspicious. Suspicious that there‚Äôs something they don‚Äôt know about Ingram, and suspicious that the Pels don‚Äôt want to sign Ingram long-term, meaning they might be able to get him for free if they‚Äôre patient.But that‚Äôs no fun, so who else is in play?Portland could offer Anfernee Simons plus pieces like Zach Collins, Nassir Little, and/or a pick. Simons has been the worst PIPM regular in the league, but he‚Äôs a pretty intriguing attacking guard prospect. Or, what if Portland offers up C.J. McCollum instead? McCollum and Holiday is a pretty interesting partnership along with Zion. The Pels would need to add a lot of salary and value. Probably not.If New Orleans is worried about Ingram‚Äôs fit, they might like Mikal Bridges a lot more. He‚Äôs a better defender and, hypothetically, a better shooter, and he needs the ball less. Would Phoenix offer both Bridges and Kelly Oubre? Would Bridges and a pick be enough?Atlanta is my most intriguing Ingram destination if he leaves this summer. The Hawks badly need a second handler, and his newfound shooting would be a huge bonus. Trae Young plus Brandon Ingram would really be the start of something. Would Atlanta give up John Collins, a potential All Star, and does Collins fit next to Zion? How about Kevin Huerter? They probably don‚Äôt move De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, and the Pels already passed on Cam Reddish. Atlanta does have all their own picks. Unless New Orleans wants Collins, who isn‚Äôt a great fit, I‚Äôm not sure the right deal is there.The most interesting deal might actually be New York. Ingram could be the face of the Knicks franchise, and Mitchell Robinson looks theoretically like a monster defensive center and a perfect fit next to Zion. Would the Knicks part with R.J. Barrett too? And would Zion want his old Duke running mate back? Isn‚Äôt R.J. Barrett just an underdeveloped Brandon Ingram right now? R.J. and Mitch is tantalizing, but there‚Äôs so much risk involved in both sides.The Knicks would probably prefer to keep Barrett and pair him with Ingram. Maybe they offer Kevin Knox with Mitch. They probably throw in Dennis Smith or Frank Ntilikina, not that adds much. New York has all their draft picks, too. If they want Ingram and want to make sure they can keep him this summer, what would they give up for him? They have enough pieces to make a tantalizing offer.In the end, it would admittedly be quite shocking to see Brandon Ingram get moved. Even if the Pelicans are secretly ready to move on from him, there‚Äôs a path to doing that later ‚Äî by doing exactly what the Bucks did with Malcolm Brogdon last summer. New Orleans can wait til the summer, make sure that max Ingram offer is out there, then use their matching ability to work a sign-and-trade. That also buys the Pelicans 30 more games to see how everything works now that Zion is healthy ‚Äî and maybe make a playoff push, too.The reality is that none of these four guys are likely to be moved this week.But they could!!And all the Trade Deadline speculation is half the fun anyway‚Ä¶ ‚ñ†Follow Brandon on Medium or @wheatonbrando for more sports, television, humor, and culture.

182,How to Build the Speedy Home Wi-Fi Network of Your Dreams,https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-build-the-speedy-home-wi-fi-network-of-your-dreams-489dece25480?source=extreme_main_feed---------185-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"ven if you‚Äôre paying for decent internet, there‚Äôs always that one corner of the house where Netflix stutters and buffers. Solving this problem and getting the absolute best speeds throughout your home can‚Äôt be done with standard hardware. It requires building a custom network.I came to this realization last year when I upgraded to a 1.5Gbps fiber connection. Fed up with the dead spots, I went down a rabbit hole in pursuit of the fastest, most reliable network I could build. Consumer-focused hardware such as Google Wifi and Eero don‚Äôt provide much control. Home mesh tools like Nest Wifi are designed to help plug holes in your Wi-Fi but aren‚Äôt generally focused on maximum speed and coverage. The best solution I found was Ubiquiti‚Äôs UniFi devices ‚Äî business-grade network hardware that can be used at home.I first heard about UniFi devices through Twitter, but what hooked me were the communities of passionate fans in places like Reddit‚Äôs /r/ubiquiti who post pictures of the fancy dashboards and elaborate home Wi-Fi setups they‚Äôve built with the products. It wasn‚Äôt long after I started following these communities that I started plotting my own dream network. While there are other options, like MikroTik or Linksys, Ubiquiti offers an end-to-end ecosystem that‚Äôs much more user friendly.With my home network makeover, I‚Äôm now able to get a solid 700Mbps-plus of wireless internet speeds, reliably, without any dead zones, whether I‚Äôm in bed watching Netflix, downstairs in the kitchen, or anywhere else in my house. (That‚Äôs still not quite the 1.5Gbps I‚Äôm paying for, but it‚Äôs a huge improvement considering my ISP provides a router with wired ports capped at 1Gbps.) My custom network is reliable, and I can make infinite Wi-Fi networks‚Äîa separate network for guests, for instance‚Äîand control them remotely.Building a network like this isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart. It takes a bit of learning and a willingness to spend some money on hardware. It also requires a shift in thinking: You‚Äôre building a network made up of multiple pieces, rather than plugging in a single device. But if you‚Äôre willing to make the investment in better Wi-Fi, have a technical mind, and are up for a challenge, it‚Äôs simple enough to learn.UniFi devices work a little differently than traditional home networks. Each device in the network is a distinct piece that operates independently.Here are the pieces you‚Äôll need to get started:This is the software that acts as the network‚Äôs centralized brain and allows you to control and set up multiple individual network devices from a single interface. In a UniFi network, the controller is responsible for the settings of each device, which aren‚Äôt able to do much independently.This is the device your internet connection comes into ‚Äî likely from a router provided by your ISP. It provides firewall protection and insights into your network, like which websites are being used the most and the quality of the Wi-Fi signal for each computer on your network.The benefits of a gateway can be hard to wrap your head around at first, but it‚Äôs an important piece of the setup that I recommend for getting the most out of UniFi. Generally speaking, you plug your ISP‚Äôs modem into one port on this device and your internal network on the other side, separating the two entirely.You‚Äôll plug hardwired devices into these ports to extend your network.These hubs beam the actual wireless network to devices like your laptop or phone.You have two options when it comes to choosing a controller for your custom Wi-Fi network. A standalone controller, called the Cloud Key ($179), hosts the UniFi software and controls your other devices. A newer option, introduced in 2019, is an all-in-one device called the Dream Machine ($299), which combines the controller, gateway, and access point.If you‚Äôre new to building complex networks, I highly recommend the Dream Machine. It is much easier to set up and run.If you have a UniFi Dream Machine, it already includes a gateway. If you‚Äôve gone the traditional controller route, you must buy a gateway separately, adding to the total cost. You have a few options: the UniFi Security Gateway ($139), the UniFi Security Gateway Pro ($344), or the high-end all-in-one UniFi Dream Machine Pro ($379), a supercharged version of the Dream Machine focused on raw speed and doesn‚Äôt include an access point like the base model.The easiest way to make this decision is to look at your internet speed. If it‚Äôs under 750Mbps, the UniFi Security Gateway won‚Äôt cap out your speeds with its limited processing power. If you‚Äôre on 1Gbps, the Security Gateway Pro is a better choice. Anything higher makes the Dream Machine Pro the only good option.To allow all of your devices to communicate with one another, you‚Äôll need a piece of hardware with a bunch of ports, called a switch. Your Wi-Fi hubs, or access points, will plug into this device in order to connect to the network. Because the hubs include a technology called Power over Ethernet (PoE), which sends enough electricity over the network cable to power up the device on the other end, they don‚Äôt need to be plugged into a power socket.UniFi network switches come with varying numbers of ports. For a small home network with only a few wired devices, the UniFi Switch PoE 8 ($199) is more than adequate. For larger networks or to future-proof your setup, there are 16-port ($299) and 24-port options ($399).If you chose the Dream Machine controller route, you already have one access point, but the entire reason to invest in a system like this is to cover your home with Wi-Fi, and you‚Äôll need two or more access points to get the most out of UniFi. You can connect these either via an Ethernet cable or wirelessly (called Wireless Uplink in UniFi‚Äôs software), but at the cost of some speed and reliability.Here are some popular options:If you‚Äôd like to mount on a wall or roof: UniFi nanoHD ($179). The nanoHD is a tiny round access point that includes a kit for mounting it directly on a roof or wall.If you have in-wall Ethernet already available: UniFi In-Wall HD ($179). For homes that already have ethernet ports in the walls, the UniFi In-Wall options are fantastic, as they can be installed right on top of the existing Ethernet faceplate. If you have ports available, this is the best choice.For everything else: UniFi FlexHD ($179). For renters like me or for those who don‚Äôt want to mount their devices, the FlexHD is a cute access point that‚Äôs about the size of a Coke can. It can stand up on its own and be tucked away out of sight or mounted on all sorts of things, including poles. It‚Äôs even waterproofed for outdoor use.Other options: If you head to the Ubiquiti store, you‚Äôll notice there are a ton of options available. That‚Äôs because UniFi works for everything from elaborate home Wi-Fi to stadium-sized venues, and the company provides different products for each use case. The UniFi HD ($349), for example, supports a theoretical 1,000 users connected at once.Here is what my own home network looks like:The UniFi Dream Machine simplified getting started. Once I plugged it in and typed in a URL, I found myself on an easy-to-use setup wizard. From there, I added the other hardware, piece by piece. I put a UniFi Switch 24 PoE hidden in the basement to act as the core of the network. I chose UniFi FlexHD and nanoHD access points‚Äîone for the first floor and one for the basement.Because our home is rented and isn‚Äôt wired for network cables, it was a little challenging to get physical wires to the places I needed.My solution, likely to the dismay of any advanced readers, was rather crude: massive, cheap rolls of flat Ethernet cables that I jammed in windows and ran on the outside of the house, which works well enough but isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd recommend if you can avoid it.Now I have control over every minute detail of my home network. A ‚ÄúWi-Fi experience‚Äù score, for example, shows how a device is experiencing connectivity, with lower scores indicating a dead patch or difficulty connecting. I can create infinite separate Wi-Fi networks, which I‚Äôve done to create a guest network and to separate internet of things devices from those on my main network to ensure smart appliances aren‚Äôt able to snoop into my other devices without my knowledge.The best feature by far is the ability to control multiple UniFi networks remotely. This is useful for quickly fixing something at home while I‚Äôm traveling, for example.By the standards of the UniFi geeks on Reddit, my system is not very complex, but it‚Äôs simple to grow if I move into a larger home in the future, and it allows total control. Unlike a modern consumer-focused meshing product like Google‚Äôs Nest Wifi, which requires logging in with a Google account to use it, I‚Äôm in control of my data and responsible for it.And if nothing else, learning about networking and building out a future-proof setup is a fun hobby.WRITTEN BY"
183,A Heuristic Derivation of Einstein‚Äôs Gravity Equations,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-heuristic-derivation-of-einsteins-gravity-equations-8d3659c8a46c?source=extreme_main_feed---------186-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"The general theory of relativity has a distinctive aesthetic appeal to all those who have seriously studied it. The English theoretical physicist Paul Dirac, one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century once remarked:‚ÄúThere was difficulty reconciling the Newtonian theory of gravitation with its instantaneous propagation of forces with the requirements of special relativity; and Einstein working on this difficulty was led to a generalization of his relativity ‚Äî which was probably the greatest scientific discovery that was ever made.‚Äù‚Äî Paul DiracThe great Soviet physicists Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz wrote in their book ‚ÄúThe Classical Theory of Fields‚Äù:‚ÄúThe theory of gravitational fields, constructed on the basis of the theory of relativity, is called the general theory of relativity. It was established by Einstein and represents probably the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.‚ÄùIn this essay, I will follow very closely this remarkable article by Chandrasekhar (any omitted or unclear detail can be found in it) and try to clarify some of the reasons that led these great scientists to make such strong statements.In Newton‚Äôs mechanics, there are two concepts of mass, namely, inertial mass and gravitational mass. The former is a measure of resistance to an applied external force (according to Newton‚Äôs second law). The latter is a source of the gravitational field and also the reaction to the field produced by another massive body.Two masses m and M at a distance R from each other attract each other with the magnitudeBy Newton‚Äôs second law, the acceleration experienced by m (or equivalently M) reads:The fact that a does not depend on m implies that the mass ratio above is a universal constant. From that one infers that inertial and gravitational masses have equal magnitude.Consider the illustration below:As the clocks move upwards, the intervals measured by A and B have, according to the special theory of relativity, the following relation with the corresponding interval in the clock C which is in free space:Combining both expressions we obtain:where we used Torricelli‚Äôs equation and the definition of the gravitational potential:Now, if we take the clock B to a location x where there is no gravitational field, the expression above becomes:In special relativity, we learn that the Minkowskian interval has the form:where dœÑ is a measure of the so-called proper time. The proper time along a world line (the path that an object traces in spacetime) is the time as measured by a clock following that line.As shown in Fig. 3, worldlines in spacetime can be of three kinds (see this link for more details):The proper time interval dœÑ is dependent on the properties of spacetime. In a region of spacetime where Eq. 2 is valid, we can substitute it in Eq. 3 to get:Now consider a coordinate transformation to a uniformly accelerated frame. The new x and t becomeThe y and z remain the same. The Minkowskian interval Eq. 3 expressed in this coordinates reads:Now, choosing times the time to be less than or equal to c/g in the transformation equations Eq.5, and performing a simple expansion, the new spacetime interval Eq. 3 becomes:Note that this has the same form as Eq. 4. Hence, we see that transforming to an accelerated frame is equivalent to introducing a gravitational field which corroborates the principle of equivalence.Until now, we have only considered small deviations from the flat Minkowskian metric. Following Einstein, we make the assumption that in general (not only for small deviations) the presence of a gravitational field distorts the geometry of spacetime. More precisely, Einstein‚Äôs theory of gravity assumes that in the presence of gravitational fields, spacetime becomes a smooth pseudo-Riemannian manifold endowed with a spacetime interval of the form:In Minkowskian spacetime, particles move in straight lines with uniform velocity:Still in the absence of gravity let us make the following transformation into a curvilinear system of coordinates:The spacetime interval becomes:where:The equation of motion Eq. 10 becomes the ubiquitous geodesic equation:where the objectsare called Christoffel symbols.The Christoffel symbols generate (in Eq. 14) an ‚Äúapparent‚Äù acceleration that is merely a consequence of using curvilinear coordinates to describe linear motions in Cartesian coordinates. But they are in fact inertial accelerations (such as for example the Coriolis acceleration). But according to the principle of equivalence, all accelerations, both the ones derived from inertial forces and the ones derived from gravitational forces, are, in origin, metric: gravity distorts the spacetime geometry (which is a quasi-Riemannian manifold with an associated metric) and particles move on spacetime in geodesics given by Eq. 16.In Newtonian physics, the equations describing the gravitational field are formulated in terms of the gravitational potential U. When gravity is absent, one merely has U=0; when there is a massive body, but the test particle subject to its field is outside the body, one has ‚àá¬≤U=0; in regions where there is matter, the equation becomes ‚àá¬≤U =4œÄGœÅ.Let us see how to generalize these three equations to the context of general relativity. First, consider a particle moving according to the equation of motion Eq. 16. If Eq. 16 can be transformed into Eq. 10 by some change of coordinates, it means that the particle is not in a gravitational field. Likewise, for gravity to the present, the Christoffel symbols cannot vanish after any coordinate transformation. Using the law of transformation of the Christoffel symbols, it is easy to show that a general coordinate transformationwill make all Christoffel symbols vanish only if the equationhas a (nontrivial) solution for the four transformations fs in Eq. 17. This occurs provided the so-called Riemann-Christoffel tensor vanishes. The latter is given by:We conclude that the condition for the gravitational field to be absent is:This equation is the general relativistic version of the Newtonian equation U=0. It can be shown that the simplest generalization of ‚àá¬≤U=0 is the contraction of Eq. 20, namely:This vanishing object is called the Ricci tensor. The final step is to determine the generalization of the right-hand side of ‚àá¬≤U =4œÄGœÅ. The first object that comes to mind is the energy-momentum tensor. We know from special relativity that its derivative vanishes. But general relativity is a covariant theory, so the vanishing of the standard derivative is not enough: we need the covariant derivative of T to vanishwhich is satisfied in all systems of coordinates. But the covariant derivative of the Ricci tensor is nonzero. This is fixed by introducing a related tensor, namely, the so-called Einstein tensor, whose covariant derivative vanishes.The Einstein law of gravitation becomes, therefore:The constant k can be obtained by demanding the in the limit of c ‚Üí ‚àû, Newton‚Äôs equations are recovered (for details see Chandrasekhar).My Github and personal website www.marcotavora.me have some other interesting material both about physics and other topics such as mathematics, data science, and finance.

184,Lasting Love Comes Down To One Choice,https://medium.com/mind-cafe/lasting-love-comes-down-to-one-choice-ab90d6d5f9be?source=extreme_main_feed---------187-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"Once upon a time, I dated a man we‚Äôll call Brad.Brad came to me with excitement one day, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do these 36 questions posted by the New York Times! They‚Äôre supposed to create deep intimacy between two people.‚ÄùBeing the highly emotional creature I am, I was in.The researchers who designed the questions claimed they would make two people fall in love. They started light and simple and slowly became more profound.So Brad and I gave them a shot. And though the questions helped us understand each other on a deeper level and even shed some tears, we did not fall in love.Which perplexed me; when we broke up, I thought back to the questions. It felt like he peered into my soul, took a look around, and decided it wasn‚Äôt for him. Leaving me behind thinking, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt share that stuff with just anyone!‚ÄùBut that was two years ago. And though we did not fall in love, I‚Äôve had many men to make up for him. Seven to be exact. Seven men that, at the respective times, claimed to love me until the end.So why then, am I just with one man? Why is it that the guy I call my boyfriend prevailed over the others?Well, obviously, each failed relationship had its own unique defects.Maybe a better question is, why can I believe the love that is offered to me this time?Loving is a unique ability only humans can create awareness around. It‚Äôs an art because we can improve upon the skill, sort of like a craft.As the author, Gary Chapman, stated, ‚ÄúFalling in love is easy. Staying in love ‚Äî that‚Äôs the challenge.‚ÄùBut to even consider staying in love, we have to make a choice:At the low points, in the time of doubt, will we keep choosing love? And are we willing to do so even if the person may not choose us one day?The uncertainties in love are scary.How can we know someone will make a great partner? Father? Bingo teammate well into retirement?How can we know we won‚Äôt be betrayed? Our hearts not crushed? Our love not taken advantage of?And the answer is plain and fucking simple: we don‚Äôt.We don‚Äôt know how our lives will play out, and that runs true, especially when it comes to love.But just because we can‚Äôt be certain, doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt try.Loving is a choice. You find a person that makes your heart flutter and whose company you thoroughly enjoy; you understand each other; you could see yourself growing old with them.So you choose them; you choose a life with them. But it won‚Äôt be the only time you‚Äôll have to choose them.Because the doubt will creep in. They‚Äôll eventually hurt or disappoint you.And the choice really comes down to your capabilities and willingness of working through the inevitable low points, because being with them surpasses everything else.I hear my current boyfriend‚Äôs words trickle out of his mouth, ‚ÄúI love you, and I want to be with you forever.‚ÄùBut how do I know his words of forever are true? I don‚Äôt. But I can trust that he‚Äôs choosing me, and that‚Äôs the biggest part of this equation.He chooses me. I choose him. That equals, I hope, lasting love.We have open and honest communication, regularly checking in on one another. We both have the ability to speak our emotions, fears, and appreciations of one another. We acknowledge the hard times will come, but we‚Äôre certain we have what it takes to get through them.And all of this wrapped up into a package labeled our love seems like it will withstand time more than passion and lust ever would.But all because we are both making a choice.Recently, I came across a Tedx Talk spoken by a woman that did a questionnaire with a man that led them to fall in love. That woman, Mandy Len Catron, wrote the initial article that made famous those 36 questions Brad and I asked each other.Readers wanted to understand the magic of Catron‚Äôs relationship‚Äôs success; everyone wanted to know if the two were still together.But Catron was wary of answering because the success of their relationship wasn‚Äôt based on 36 questions designed for creating love.The success of their relationship hung on one main thing: a choice.The two chose to love each other.Just like Brad and I chose not to.Just like my current boyfriend and I choose to.Sure, love is a bit more nuanced. But lasting love, I believe, is not.You‚Äôll never find a perfect person who won‚Äôt disappoint. Every single relationship is going to have its lows.And then those lows come, you‚Äôll have to make a choice.In the end, that‚Äôs the secret to lasting love.Want more advice?

185,My Favourite Web Developer Interview Question: Do you really understand arrays?,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/my-favourite-web-developer-interview-question-do-you-really-understand-arrays-dd9a45f9ce32?source=extreme_main_feed---------188-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"In my corner of web development, we expect web developers to be familiar with both PHP and Javascript. I‚Äôve found this one simple question tells me if a developer truly understands the tools they use every day:Q: What are the similarities and differences between arrays in Javascript and PHP?It‚Äôs one thing to be able to cut code. It‚Äôs another thing entirely to be able to understand the bones of the languages you work with.This single question tells me volumes. See, almost every major programming language has arrays, and it would be easy to assume that they‚Äôre all more or less the same. Many programmers do.This is an incorrect assumption that leads to a plethora of subtle errors, wasteful code, and failures to use a language‚Äôs strengths most effectively.C is not the first programming language, but it‚Äôs the most influential. Many developers first learned on C in university. Both PHP and Javascript derive, at least in part, from C. So there is a passing resemblance, and it‚Äôs a good reference point to show how far arrays have come since 1972.In C, arrays are strongly-typed, and of a fixed length.This is an array. It can only hold integers, and can hold at most 10 elements.To use this array, we iterate over it with a for loop ‚Äî a pattern that‚Äôs been needlessly replicated across programming languages:This doesn‚Äôt look alien to a Javascript or PHP developer, and therein lies the danger.You‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking arrays in Javascript are similar:They are not. This is patently impossible in C:In Javascript, arrays have variable length, and the contents are untyped ‚Äî just like any other variable in Javascript. The language takes care of the memory management, so our array can grow and shrink without having to worry about it ‚Äîan array in Javascript is really a list.Iterating over an array can be done badly (or naively):But the old-school C approach to iterating over an array is unnecessary. There are unnecessary intermediate variables, there‚Äôs the potential for errors stemming from undefined or invalid values(is there actually a value defined in fibonacci[10] ? Is it even an integer?)But Javascript is better than that. Arrays aren‚Äôt just arrays ‚Äî just like functions, they‚Äôre first-class objects in Javascript, and they have class methods for handling these sort of things usefully:That‚Äôs much better!In addition, Javascript arrays aren‚Äôt fixed in length like C arrays are, which allows them to grow in interesting ways. You can pop the last element of an array out of the back, and push elements in. You can remove elements form the front by shifting, or add them by unshifting. You can use a different combination of these to treat a Javascript array like a stack or a queue, depending on your use case.Arrays in PHP almost look like Javascript.Like Javascript, they‚Äôre of variable length, and weakly typed. You‚Äôd be tempted to think they‚Äôre the same.Lambda functions aren‚Äôt quite as elegant as Javascript (as of ES6) but it‚Äôs functionally equivalent to our earlier sample.You can also use Javascript‚Äôs push and pop (array_push, array_pop ) and shift and unshift too ( array_shift, array_unshift )But you can‚Äôt do this in Javascript (or C):In PHP, arrays are technically hash tables or dictionaries. They use keys to store values, and keys can be any primitive: such as int, float, or strings. Because it‚Äôs a dictionary, looking up a value by any key is extremely efficient ‚Äî it happens at O(1) time.It means you PHP arrays can function as an easy look-up table.PHP arrays give you all sorts of flexibility. PHP arrays can be sorted by keys and sorted by values. You can flip an array, reversing keys and values, which can give you all sorts of lookup efficiencies. Finding a particular value anything in a regular unsorted array is O(n) because you need to check against every single value in the array.Finding a particular value in PHP can be O(1) quite easily:You can do this sort of thing in Javascript, of course, but arrays won‚Äôt get it done for you ‚Äî you‚Äôd need to use an object. But that comes with its own trade-offs: you don‚Äôt get regular array operations that involve ordering like sorting and pushing/popping/shifting.Iterating over PHP arrays are much simpler and safer, too. You could use a for loop like in C, but why would you? PHP solves the problem of variable lengths and types by giving you foreach loops:The loop destructures both key and value, so you could manipulate both.For the record, you could use higher level functions as in Javascript above, but in PHP, arrays are not first-class objects, so it requires some core methods:This is functional ‚Äî pun unintended ‚Äî but not as elegant. If you want to code this way (and there are some good arguments for it) you might turn to a library such as Laravel‚Äôs Collections. But PHP also allows you to create objects that function like arrays (that you could use in, say, a foreach loop).If PHP is your main programming language, you can often forget exactly how much power is embedded in this most basic of language constructs.But put simply: arrays are PHP‚Äôs more underrated and unassuming superpower.Q: What are the similarities and differences between arrays in Javascript and PHP?A: In PHP and Javascript, arrays are weakly-typed lists of variable length. In Javascript, arrays are keyed and ordered by integers. In PHP, arrays are sortable lists and searchable dictionaries. Keys can be of any primitive type, and arrays can be sorted by key OR by value.WRITTEN BY"
186,These are the types of relationships that you should avoid at all costs,https://medium.com/lady-vivra/the-relationships-you-should-avoid-4d2befa2e1db?source=extreme_main_feed---------189-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"by: E.B. JohnsonA
ll of us want very different things from our relationships, and that‚Äôs okay. Some of us want partners that hold our hand on grand adventures, and some of us are looking for something more simple. Whatever you‚Äôre looking for, the way you see relationships as a whole will go a long way into defining your closest and most intimate partnerships. The secret is knowing what you want, and cultivating the behaviors and traits that you would like to see in an ideal partner.Our partners don‚Äôt rescue us and they don‚Äôt change us. We are the only people who can do that for ourselves. For this reason, it‚Äôs important to come into our partnerships open, well-adjusted and whole ‚Äî but that asks of us to face our emotional baggage and deal with the insecurities of our pasts. If we want to build better relationships, we have to be better partners. That‚Äôs a transformation that can only come from within, however, and it can only come as a result of hard work and a commitment to change the way you see your partner and partnerships.The relationships that comprise our inner circles can make a huge difference when it comes to how we see ourselves and the world around us. Boyfriends, girlfriends, wives, husbands and partners offer us everything from emotional support to companionship, but it is possible to find ourselves giving little pieces away until we‚Äôre compromised past the point of return. Avoiding this means building better relationship perceptions, and that‚Äôs a journey that begins within.Our romantic relationships are complex and dynamic. We fall in love quickly and we can fall out of love just as quickly. When we love, we love deeply and that can often cause us to overlook critical red flags and warning signs that are best faced head-on and in the moment. Part of forming happy and lasting relationships is learning how to confront issues in those relationships as they happen, something that takes both time and understanding to carefully manage.Though we often claim to be blindsided by our good love gone wrong, more often than not, there are a number of critical moments we ignore along the way. When our partners aren‚Äôt right for us, they have a funny way of showing us that truth, but it takes a dose of radical honesty to see these warnings for what they are. To see these red flags for what they are and accept them, we have to start loving ourselves and setting boundaries both inside and out. Only when we learn how to love ourselves can we truly start loving others and receiving the love we deserve.Not all relationships are created equal. While the right relationships can bring joy, tranquility and even a sense of security into our lives, the wrong one will unravel it in a number of ways. From controlling relationships, to outright abuse, these are the most toxic types of partnerships that are to be avoided at all costs.One-sided relationships are toxic, and leave little room for both parties to create transformative or meaningful experiences within their partnerships. When one partner takes all the control, they take away the independence and value of the other party. Though we all want what‚Äôs best for our partner, we also have to respect their right to be who they are and express themselves in the way that is natural to them.Ever had one of those relationships that light you on fire from the moment you meet? More often than not crazy, over-the-top and passionate relationships burn hard and fast, but they can quickly lead to something toxic that burns down the rest of our life. When we lean too hard into these types of relationships, we can find ourselves getting obsessed and quickly losing sight of our own strengths and individuality.Bullying in relationships isn‚Äôt natural, normal or healthy. If your partner demeans, belittles or otherwise pushes you around ‚Äî you‚Äôre dealing with an abusive relationship, not a passionate one. Though a bully might try to conceal their tactics beneath the guise of ‚Äúcare‚Äù, their main priority is keeping power, and they‚Äôll use whatever tactics they need to achieve that end. Bullying is a favored tactic of abusers and narcissists alike.Critical relationships aren‚Äôt comfortable, and they cause us to doubt ourselves and the way we see partnerships in general. A partner who constantly criticizes you is looking to demean your sense of self and increase your dependence on them and their opinions. In order to build equitable and healthy relationships, we have to respect one another and offer only critiques that are necessary, wanted, kind and warranted.Dramatic relationships full of explosive arguments and constant blow-ups are a waste of time and distracting to the journey that we‚Äôre on. When we engage in relationships that are based all around the drama, we find ourselves battling tough emotional turmoil and constant fallout that can lead to a doubting of self and a doubting of our partners and relationships. Drama doesn‚Äôt indicate true love ‚Äî it indicates true dysfunction.Found yourself obsessed with someone after only knowing them for a short time? As tempting as it might be to consider this the real-deal, obsession is not love, and should be avoided at all costs. Obsession is unhealthy, and can force us to absorb into our relationship in a way that completely destroys our sense of purpose and self. Without direction, we flounder whenever we‚Äôre separated from our partners and fail completely when faced with challenges on your own.The enabling relationship is an especially toxic one, and one which can quickly turn into something far too codependent. Enablers encourage toxic behavior in their partners, or go out of their way to ensure that they continue in patterns that keep them chained to the same place in life. This might be due to their own insecurities, but it may also come from an insidious need to keep you controlled or otherwise weakened, vulnerable or reliant.Punitive parenting occurs when one partner assumes the role of a ‚Äúparent‚Äù within the relationship, monopolizing control and dishing out punishment whenever their demands aren‚Äôt met. The punitive partner isn‚Äôt concerned about the other person‚Äôs needs, or even communicating ‚Äî effectively ‚Äî about their own needs. It‚Äôs only a matter of time until the resentment builds between both partners, leading to inevitable implosion.Though we should feel secure in our relationships, we shouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable enough to give up on ourselves, our dreams or our values. Relationships that feel like your favorite pair of slouchy sweatpants feel nice at first, but in retrospect you realize that they were keeping you and preventing you from achieving better opportunities for yourself. Comfort doesn‚Äôt equal happiness and vice versa. Being too comfortable can hold us back from real love.Truth and authenticity are the cornerstone of any solid relationship, and without them ‚Äî cracks are guaranteed to show. It‚Äôs impossible to work together and grow together as a healthy couple when one (or both) partner(s) are cloaking reality in their omissions or outright subterfuge. When we lie to each other, we can‚Äôt identify problems and we shut down the channels of communication. Without trust, no one can move forward in good faith.We learn our bonding behaviors when we‚Äôre young, and we continue to test and refine those patterns over time. The things we take on in childhood can follow us throughout our lives, but there are also a number of other places that we learn the toxic relationship patterns that keep us stuck, scared and searching for some shred of happiness in eternal night.We live in a society that constantly tells us that our worth is a direct correlation of our relationship status. From adverts to movies‚Äî romantic relationships are made up to the backbone of happiness. Holding those beliefs can get you stuck in some unhappy situations. Clinging to relationships because you‚Äôre too scared to be alone is no justification. It‚Äôs natural to want a partner, but it doesn‚Äôt define our happiness. Making your happiness dependent on another person will always result in failure. Learning how to make yourself happy, though? That lasts forever.If you can‚Äôt respect yourself, it‚Äôs hard to find other people that will respect you either. Feeling good about ourselves is important; loving ourselves even more so. Poor self-esteem is one of the number reasons people find themeselves trapped in relationships that don‚Äôt suit them, but that self-esteem too comes from a number of different places. We might suffer from poor self-esteem because of past relationship experiences, or we might suffer from low self-esteem because of traumatic childhood experiences. Whatever your reason, it‚Äôs imperative that you identify it and correct it in order to thrive and break free of your poisonous passions.As humans, we‚Äôre creatures of habit, but those habits can quickly become corrosive or self-defeating. The real problem, however, is that even when that‚Äôs the case ‚Äî we often don‚Äôt walk away. Why? Because the familiar is more comfortable than the unfamiliar; a known bad is perceived to be safer than an unknown potential good. Our patterns and our routines hold an important role in our lives. However, just because we do something doesn‚Äôt mean it should be done; and it certainly doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt a better way to do things in future.You can avoid these toxic relationship pitfalls, by learning how to transform the way you see relationships and understand them. When we come into our partnerships as better partners, we release the need to control and be controlled, and we also lose our need to be defined by someone else. Finding the perfect partner requires turning ourselves into that partner first, but that means digging deep.When it comes to our relationships, we spend a lot of time imagining the other person, but we rarely spend a great amount of time considering ourselves as partners within those same imaginings. If we want the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù partner for us, we need to spend more time working on ourselves so that we can match the quality of partner we are trying to bring into our lives. We attract what we put out into the world around us. Wanting the perfect partner is fine, but you have to be that person to bring that person into your life.Before you go searching for meaning in another person, get to know yourself first. Be real about who you are in a partnership, and be honest about what you ideally want from a relationship. Commit to becoming the kind of partner that attracts faithful, honest, ambitious and open people. Cultivate behaviors that allow you to fill your social circles with the good, the heartfelt and the genuine.Everything in this life is about energy and action. Drawing quality people (and thus quality relationships) into our lives requires having good energy, and using that energy to inspire good and positive action. The more you put these good works into the world around you, the more they will grab the notice of other good people who are looking for partners with those qualities. Good, honest and hard-working people don‚Äôt just fall out of the sky. They‚Äôre around other good, honest and hard-working people. So be the partner you want to attract and start living in line with your true purpose.Our emotional baggage goes a long way in undermining our overall happiness and wellbeing, but it can really cause some serious snags when it comes to our relationships. We have to resolve our emotional baggage, or risk finding ourselves in partnerships that are obsessive, short-lived or otherwise fueled by the insecurities and shortcomings we focus on in ourselves.Don‚Äôt jump into a relationship and expect it to ease the pain you are fleeing from in your past. If you‚Äôre still hung up on an ex, a new partner won‚Äôt erase that ‚Äî they‚Äôll just distract you from it for a little while. Likewise, emotional and mental disorders cannot be healed by ‚Äúlove‚Äù. They can be managed by us, however, and utilized in ways that make us better partners.Let go of your emotional baggage before you join your life with someone else‚Äôs. Our partnerships require us to closely intertwine ourselves with people who are also dealing with their own adversities in our lives. It is unfair to saddle someone else with the expectation of our own emotional healing. Don‚Äôt make your pain someone else‚Äôs burden. Heal yourself, and through that healing find emotional balance and better ways to connect.The past is an important place to start when looking to improve the way we see relationships. Our pasts contain the experiences that form our ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù, or the general level of understanding and acceptance we have about life. If you come with past filled with turbulent childhood memories, or partnerships that hit the rocks more-often-than-not, then chances are you‚Äôve come to see relationships as a battle ground ‚Äî rather than a mutual celebration of love, companionship and commitment.If you‚Äôre struggling with relationships that keep taking a tumble, or you find yourself struggling to trust your partners (no matter what), it might be a sign that you need to take a look at your past. Start at the beginning, and consider any little things that might have made you view relationships as challenges, rather than benefits. Things like divorce, abuse and even neglect from our parents can go a long way in shaping how we see not only ourselves, but our partners too.Work backward, and find a way to untangle all the knots of heartbreak that tell you it‚Äôs not safe to trust, or not safe to love. If you‚Äôre someone with mile-high walls, dig down to the foundations of those walls and really breakdown the events that told you (and your subconscious) that relationships were dangerous, rather than safe. Sometimes, the help of a mental health professional can go a long way in helping us to untangle these knots safely, but meditation and mindful journalling are great places to start too.Many of us mistakenly fall into relationships believing it will provide some sort of salvation from the things that plague us. The problem with this, however, is that it leads to inevitable let-down. That‚Äôs because there is no one who can save us but ourselves, and there is no one who can understand our problems as intimately as we can. Our lives are our responsibility, and we have to accept that in order to attract quality partners.Stop looking for some sort of fairy-tale champion to swoop in rescue you. If you feel like life is overwhelming you or dragging you down, figure out what‚Äôs going wrong and then figure out your own way back to the shore.No matter how much we might love someone ‚Äî and no matter how much they might love us back ‚Äî they cannot give us self-confidence, can they can not give us our ambition, and they cannot give us our abilities or our worth. Those are things are completely determined by us, and us alone. We are the masters of our own lives, and we are in control of how happy or sad we are within those lives. Partners do not make us happy, but they can contribute to the greater sense of joy we get from the overall experience of joy.Along the lines of salvation, happiness is another factor in this life that we mistakenly contribute to having a partner alone. Relationships (on their own) cannot make us happy. If partnerships alone were all that was needed for joy, there wouldn‚Äôt be so many people in therapy. Our romantic relationships are complex, and while they can certainly add to our overall experience, they cannot define us and they cannot fill that nagging hole inside.If you are sad outside of your relationship, you‚Äôre going to be sad in your relationship. Think about your ideal partner. Are they happy? Sad? A complete misery to be around? If we want happy, well-adjusted partners: we have to be happy, well-adjusted partners. Putting the expectation of your happiness on someone else isn‚Äôt only unfair ‚Äî it‚Äôs selfish too.Find happiness internally and stop expecting the outer world to give it to you. We make the conscious choice each day to see this world how we want to see it. We can take in the misery around us and allow it to absorb us, or we can make the choice to be happy and find our way to building a life that is entirely our own (and fulfilling). Before you go searching for a partner to give you that joy you‚Äôre looking for, try cultivating it for yourself.Perhaps the biggest mistake we make before bumbling into any relationship is not spending enough time considering who we are and what we want. More often than not, we find ourselves in toxic and poisonous relationships because we bumbled into them while stumbling through life. Bumbling and stumbling happens when we don‚Äôt have a clear plan in sight and we don‚Äôt have a plan. When you‚Äôre lost, you meet other lost people along the way. No one knowing where you going, you find yourselves in places neither wanted to go.Spend some time getting to know yourself, and spend some time getting familiar with what you really and truly want from your life ‚Äî and any relationships that might exist within in. Don‚Äôt shy away from your truths, and don‚Äôt allow the opinions and pressures of others push you in any direction you don‚Äôt want to go.Only when you are brutally honest with yourself can you attract the right partners who want the same thing. If you want flowers and picket fences and 2.5 kids ‚Äî be honest about that, and don‚Äôt hide that in an attempt to make the wrong person fit. Be who you are, and through that authenticity find those who truly align with you and your journey. Relationships that stand the test of time aren‚Äôt forged through personal similarities or sheer will alone. They‚Äôre managed by the unification of two people who are seeking the same things from their lives.Finding the perfect partner is hard, and it‚Äôs not made any easier by trying to overcome the daily challenges of modern life. We want a relationship that adds stability and joy to what we‚Äôre trying to build, but that often takes a lot more internal work than we realize. If we want the perfect partner, we have to be the perfect partner, and that takes getting real about what‚Äôs holding us back.Attract the perfect partner by becoming the perfect partner. Work on yourself from the inside out and identify the things in yourself that you want from your future partners. Let go of your emotional baggage and make peace with your past, so you can come to the table with a clean slate and the ability to honestly and earnestly connect with someone with your insecurities and hangups getting in the way. Stop expecting your partners to make you happy and create that happiness in yourself. After all, we have to be what we want to attract into our lives. Happy, confident people attract other happy, confident people. Spend some time falling in love with you and spend some time getting to know (inside and out) what you want from your partner and your relationships.WRITTEN BY"

eumorphism is predicted to be one of the top 2020 UI design trends. You might have seen it everywhere as a Dribbble shot. Neumorphism is a play on words based on New + Skeuomorphism. It is a style that uses blur, angle, and intensity of an object‚Äôs shadow to highlight the object. It‚Äôs a design that looks realistic, futuristic, modern, appealing and extremely breathtaking due to its soft shadow and overall appearance.But let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs not the most practical design for actual use. Try building and releasing a product that has used Neumorphism as its main style, and you‚Äôre most likely going to frustrate everyone ‚Äî including your developers, users, and accessibility users (There are currently 57 million Americans who have a disability of some sort with 54% of adults living with a disability go online. Disabled users are NOT a myth.) ‚Äî [Source: W3.org]According to W3, Web and Mobile accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web and Mobile, including:Neumorphism alone does not support cognitive, physical and visual disability, as it is.Let‚Äôs dig in as to why Neumorphism and Accessibility can‚Äôt get along.Disclaimer: I am not an accessibility or neumorphism expert. This article was initiated for sharing ideas and thoughts on Neumorphism. The Dribbbel shots used below are only intended to be examples to highlight my points on the matter. I do not intend to bash, insult or make fun of any designer below. Do not send them hate. If your design is listed below and you‚Äôd like it to be removed, please feel free to send me a message.When you design a button with an important CTA, you often consider and take note on the contrast ratio to make it stand out, as well as easily readable on the page. However, with Neumorphism, there‚Äôs no such thing as contrast ratio, because the button IS the same material as the background. The only thing that separates them is the angles and a variety of soft shadows.According to the W3.org on Mobile Accessibility:Mobile devices are more likely than desktop/laptop devices to be used in varied environments including outdoors, where glare from the sun or other strong lighting sources is more likely. This scenario heightens the importance of use of good contrast for all users and may compound the challenges that users with low vision have accessing content with poor contrast on mobile devices.The WCAG 2.0 success criteria related to the issue of contrast are:1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA) which requires a contrast of at least 4.5:1 (or 3:1 for large-scale text) and1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) (Level AAA) which requires a contrast of at least 7:1 (or 4.5:1 for large-scale text).Because of the contrast difference between elements and the visual background being too minimal (as well as too subtle), people with vision loss, blindness or color blindness will encounter great difficulty interacting with the screen.Normally, objects with shadow are often highlighted more as compared to those without. But with Neumorphism, most of the elements float and stand out, competing with one another on a single screen. It‚Äôs much harder to perceive the exact hierarchy design, which then leads to the screen lacking a proper focal point and thus, creating confusion in eye tracking. Missing hierarchy on the screen has a significant effect on the user‚Äôs decision-making process, as well as their thought process. Therefore, with multiple actionable items but missing the design hierarchy and focal point, it creates a barrier that hinders understanding for users to comprehend what‚Äôs happening on that screen which may result in confusion and poor judgment. A good UI/UX doesn‚Äôt require users to think.Cognitive and learning disabilities impact how people process information. For example, they can affect people‚Äôs perception, memory, language, attention, problem-solving, and comprehension. Terminology for categories and conditions varies, and includes intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dementia, dyslexia, and more.‚Äî [Source: W3.org]Can I click on that?What is selected?What is not?Is this clickable?Or is it not?The object‚Äôs stages are decided and identified by the inner/outer shadow. Since Neumorphism plays around with various shadow tones and angles, one can‚Äôt help but wonder where the fine line between what is clickable and what is not.Every product that applies Neumorphism could have their own rule of UI stages depending on the product‚Äôs function and requirements; but with the different levels of shadow, angles, and float level, Neumorphism creates confusion for users due to lack of consistency, disoriented actionable items which ultimately creates a physical barrier for disabled users.Elements that trigger changes should be sufficiently distinct to be clearly distinguishable from non-actionable elements (content, status information, etc). Providing a clear indication that elements are actionable is relevant for web and native mobile applications that have actionable elements like buttons or links, especially in interaction modes where actionable elements are commonly detected visually (touch and mouse use). Interactive elements must also be detectable by users who rely on a programmatically determined accessible name (e.g. screen reader users)‚Äî [Source: W3.org]The Neumorphism trend which started at Dribbble, should end at Dribbbel; because while it‚Äôs undoubtedly an eye-candy trend, it‚Äôs not practical in the real world.Designers have the freedom to practice and explore whichever trend or style they are inclined to‚Ä¶I‚Äôm simply here to show and explain why Neumorphism and Accessibility can‚Äôt go hand-in-hand. I‚Äôm not here to stop you from practicing your design skill (If anything, I encourage everyone to practice their skills and explore their ideas but hopefully, with thoughts on the effect it may have on disabled users).However, I‚Äôve said this before in another article and I‚Äôll say it again: It‚Äôs 2020, and as a designer, I think we have to reevaluate the way we design when it comes to designing an actual product. We cannot design ‚Äúfor everyone‚Äù but leave out disabled users. We have a long way to go with accessibility and making all digital products accessible, but it has to start somewhere. For instance, it could start with us leaving Neumorphism behind, while focusing on developing a design that is aesthetically pleasing but practical and realistic from hereon.Thank you.WRITTEN BY"

Schools have closed. Mass social gatherings have been cancelled. Many have voluntarily self quarantined.For many of us, our daily routines have been turned on their heads.From what we know so far; the healthier you are, the more efficiently your body will be able to fend the virus off, should you come into contact with it.Now, there are some things that we simply have no control over. We can‚Äôt help how old we are. We can‚Äôt help having a preexisting condition.One thing that is within our control is to keep the body we have as fit as possible. One way we can achieve that is by taking just a few minutes a day to make sure we‚Äôre still moving it around, especially during a time when it‚Äôs probably not very high on the priority list to make it to the local gym every other day.Why should exercise matter during a time like this? Your immune system.Just like a healthy diet, exercise can contribute to general good health and therefore to a healthy immune system. It may contribute even more directly by promoting good circulation, which allows the cells and substances of the immune system to move through the body freely and do their job efficiently. ‚Äî Harvard Health PublishingAside from avoiding large gatherings, not touching our faces, and washing our hands a lot; investing in a strong immune system is one of the best precautionary measures we can take.Below is a bodyweight circuit that‚Äôs part of a program I‚Äôve been writing for an upcoming e-book. If you‚Äôre currently housebound, this is a great way to keep the blood flowing that requires nothing more than a resistance band takes less than 20 minutes to complete.*Note: I‚Äôve provided links to very brief, easy to understand tutorials of every exercise you may not have heard of before; simply click on their names.Rest 60 sec.This is a full body workout that takes a ‚Äútop-down‚Äù approach.

189,Gauging the NBA Buyout Market and How It Will Affect the Playoff Picture,https://medium.com/sportsraid/nba-buyout-market-affect-playoff-picture-2020-basketball-marvin-williams-mkg-valentine-harkless-thompson-812588cbe2e4?source=extreme_main_feed---------192-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"W
ITH THE 2020 NBA TRADE DEADLINE BEHIND US, it‚Äôs time to turn our attention to the buyout market. I‚Äôm still waiting for an oral history on when Buyout Market Season became a thing ‚Äî does anyone remember this more than like seven years ago?? ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a big part of the NBA calendar now. The Trade Deadline passes, lottery teams turn their attention toward a youth movement (aka tanking), and veterans are cut loose to be signed by playoff contenders.Already, the Charlotte Hornets bought out both Marvin Williams and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Williams would have been one of the top names on the buyout market. He‚Äôs now headed to the 45‚Äì7 Milwaukee Bucks, which hardly seems fair, but that‚Äôs how this stuff works. The rich get richer. The Los Angeles Clippers cleared a couple roster moves in anticipation of the buyout market, while teams like the Houston Rockets and Philadelphia 76ers are perilously thin in need of some depth and versatility.So which players will actually get bought out? I‚Äôll leave that to Woj and Shams with all their sources. You never know what players are willing to leave money on the table to play for a contender. We can only guess, for now.I scoured the league for intriguing buyout options and destinations, and these are names that intrigue me the most‚Ä¶These are veterans you‚Äôre familiar with, good enough that they might actually make a difference on a playoff team, but a buyout looks unlikely.Atlanta just added Jeff Teague a few weeks ago and has badly needed a backup point guard all season. Nic Batum still has a huge player option for next season he‚Äôd be foolish to turn down now. Aron Baynes had a great start of the season but is now behind Deandre Ayton, but Phoenix seems determined to keep him around.I‚Äôd love to see Vince Carter ask out so he could sign with a contender. How much fun would it be to see Vince get one more playoff run with the Clippers or Bucks? But Carter has always said he‚Äôs not a mercenary, and you have to figure Atlanta will honor his wishes and let him play this one out.Derrick Favors is the best player in this entire article, and he could legitimately change the title picture were he available. But even though he‚Äôs on an expiring deal, it seems like the Pelicans would like to keep him around and hope to re-sign him next year, or they could‚Äôve moved him for positive value at the Trade Deadline. If Favors did come available and signs with someone like the Clippers or Celtics, it‚Äôd be a game changer.The Blazers are only two games back from the Grizzlies in what is starting to shape up as a two-team race for the West 8-seed. Barring a significant Damian Lillard injury, Trevor Ariza and Hassan Whiteside ain‚Äôt going anywhere. Ariza has played super well for Portland, scoring 10ppg on 51/40/92 shooting. He‚Äôd help a lot of playoff rotations if he gave up his $1.8-million guarantee for next season and made himself available on the buyout market.Whiteside and Ian Mahinmi are kind of whatever. They feel more like regular season big men depth.Reggie Jackson is a name that‚Äôs starting to get some buzz, now that the Pistons appear to be ready to tank, but where does he get real playing time? None of the playoff teams are really ready to give out point guard minutes right now, so Jackson may need to wait for an injury to a key player that could leave some team desperate.E‚ÄôTwaun Moore is the most interesting name so far, to me. He‚Äôs a career 39% three-point shooter that slots into most rotations as a 3-and-D wing, and he‚Äôs on an expiring contract for a Pelicans team five games back from the 8-seed. New Orleans has a lot of young talent, probably too much to bring Moore back next season. If the Pels take another swoon and fall out of the race, Moore would be one of the more intriguing potential buyout candidates.Yeah, you know these guys. They‚Äôre just out there standing by, waiting for their cell phone to ring. Waiting‚Ä¶ waiting‚Ä¶ still waiting‚Ä¶I listed these names in order of their intrigue. Darren Collison is by far the best on the list and the only definitely positive player. He was a heavily rumored target to one of his hometown L.A. teams but has reportedly decided to stay retired. It‚Äôs telling that that feels like a huge miss for the Lakers.The Lakers are a likely destination for any number of these other guys. Notice how many of them are former LeBron teammates? Already, J.R. Smith and Dion Waiters have been rumored Lakers targets. Gross. The guys at the bottom of that list are chuckers that didn‚Äôt help teams much even when they weren‚Äôt old and washed.Kenneth Faried feels like a regular season rotation big that watches in April and May. C.J. Miles can shoot but can‚Äôt stay on a court. Iman Shumpert at least plays defense, so at least he might play a few playoff minutes.Jeff Green is the best free agent available, in theory. Of course, everything about Jeff Green has always been theoretical. Every team needs a versatile forward, and some team will inevitably talk themselves into Green. It won‚Äôt work out. Never sign Jeff Green.You want one of these guys? Go ahead, have at it.I don‚Äôt see much here, though it‚Äôs hilarious that three Knicks top a list I again ranked in order of most intriguing. Bobby Portis is talented and has a big game about once every 25 nights. Wayne Ellington and Reggie Bullock can shoot, and plenty of teams are happy to add a shooter.No one here is playing real playoff minutes. Let‚Äôs move on.After all that mess, these are the 10 most interesting potential names on the buyout market, counting them down from 10 to 1. Note that these are in order of intrigue, not necessarily in order of how likely they are to be bought out. I‚Äôll leave that to the guys with all the sources.Marvin Williams would have ranked near the top of the list, but he‚Äôs already headed to the Milwaukee Bucks. Here‚Äôs the best of what‚Äôs left‚Ä¶Everyone wanted Marcus Morris at the Trade Deadline, so maybe the losers will settle for his twin brother? Kieff is certainly the worse player at this point and can‚Äôt stay healthy, but he brings an edge to a team (for better and for worse) and adds versatility.Crabbe is a career 38.8% three-point shooter and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs basically it. You need someone that can shoot and literally not do anything else on a basketball court? That‚Äôs Allen Crabbe, who I rate slightly ahead of Ellington and Bullock for reasons I can‚Äôt really defend. He‚Äôs been part of positive offenses before, so maybe a team like Houston or Philly could add him off the bench.MKG has already been bought out, with Dallas a rumored destination. Kidd-Gilchrist is a former #2 pick with legitimately great defensive ability, but he‚Äôs never found enough offense to stay on the court. He‚Äôs 28-for-100 on threes in his career, which is basically one week for Russell Westbrook. Actually, Houston is an intriguing destination. Could MKG bang at center and play a weird Capela type role? I‚Äôm much more intrigued in him as a theoretical big than as a wing. I need four shooters around him to make him viable.Henson posted a 156 offensive rating in his one game with the Pistons after being traded for Andre Drummond, so there‚Äôs that. Henson is a pretty solid defender that could fill a role somewhere as a rim runner. Dallas?Look, I‚Äôve always liked Kent Bazemore too, but he is about the dictionary definition of a replacement player. Baze is one of those guys you think of as a 3-and-D guy, but his defense his slipped with age and he‚Äôs only ever been an average shooter. In eight season of NBA ball on five teams, Bazemore has a career high of 101 offensive rating. That‚Äôs really bad. Baze is one of those guys everyone would get excited about being available but he‚Äôs just not that good.The Kings just traded for Len but they were really trading to get off Dewayne Dedmon and besides, it‚Äôs the Kings, so you never know. When it comes to NBA centers, my opinion is that there‚Äôs around 15 everyday starters and then something like 30 or 40 guys in the next tier. Len is in that group, and that makes him a useful addition to a team like the Clippers, Celtics, Rockets, etc.Maybe I‚Äôm stuck living in the past on this one, but as long as Taj Gibson is playing ball, I still think of him as a winner. The game has passed Gibson by in some ways since he can‚Äôt shoot and isn‚Äôt particularly big, but he‚Äôs still a mean defender that can be great for stretches, and he‚Äôs almost always part of an efficient offense. It‚Äôs just not that hard for me to imagine Taj playing a few big, emotional minutes for some team in the first or second round.You can tell this buyout market is hopping when Denzel Valentine is a top-3 potential option. I‚Äôm just not ready to give up on Denzel. He can dribble and pass, he‚Äôs a versatile defender and quality shooter, and he has a really high basketball IQ. Valentine is a guy I‚Äôve always thought would be better with better teammates around him, where his team defense and IQ are more valuable. I still feel like he could be a really nice seventh man for a good team, running the bench offense. I‚Äôd really like to see what he looks like on a real NBA team before I give up on him for good.Tristan is a guy I‚Äôve had my eye on all season long. I thought he was an intriguing Trade Deadline target even though every Cavs fan is certain they plan on keeping him, and I‚Äôd finally given up hope before Cleveland traded for Drummond. What‚Äôs left for him now? The Cavs owe two-thirds of their cap to centers, and it‚Äôs hard to see Thompson back next fall. As a Rich Paul client, maybe it‚Äôs time for TT to use his connections and move on. Perhaps he thinks he has enough money and is ready for another title run.I would‚Äôve bet anything before the season that Thompson would end up with LeBron in L.A., but they may not need him the way Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee are playing. He could head to L.A. anyway and make a title-swinging impact for the Clippers, and I‚Äôd love him in Houston, Boston, or Dallas too. Thompson‚Äôs averaging a career-high in both rebounds and points, and he‚Äôs a versatile defender that sets hard picks and rolls well. If he does hit the buyout market, he‚Äôll be a scene-changing addition for whoever nabs him.I didn‚Äôt think Harkless was a huge loss for the Clippers when they included him in the Marcus Morris trade, but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the Clippers ‚Äî they already have super elite wing defenders that can also play offense, and Harkless probably can‚Äôt stay on the court once the calendar hits June.But for a team with less realistic hopes of June ball, Harkless is still a pretty intriging option. He‚Äôs a true elite wing defender and will especially be a target for West teams hoping he can guard LeBron, Kawhi, and PG. The problem, of course, is that Harkless is a career 32.6% three-point shooter and doesn‚Äôt do much on offense, so it takes the right fit.That might rule out Houston, who would rather outscore LeBron and Kawhi than defend them. Dallas is an obvious fit. Harkless is a better Dorian Finney-Smith or maybe they just play them both. But the Mavs upside still feels like a hard-fought round one series. Could Denver be a possibility? Will Barton has faded fast, and the team‚Äôs wing rotation is still a bit shaky. They certainly don‚Äôt have that one go-to defender.My sleeper destination is the Oklahoma City Thunder, basically as the Andre Roberson the team has never gotten since Roberson got hurt. Do you want to play against a lineup of Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Moe Harkless, Danilo Gallinari, and Steven Adams? I sure don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs plenty of injury downside in that lineup but it‚Äôs pretty nasty on both ends, and I think that team could go toe-to-toe with any non-L.A. team out West and maybe even push the Lakers or Clippers.So could Moe Harkless or Tristan Thompson be the missing piece that changes the playoff picture? Only one way to find out‚Ä¶ ‚ñ†Follow Brandon on Medium or @wheatonbrando for more sports, television, humor, and culture. Visit the rest of Brandon‚Äôs writing archives here.WRITTEN BY"
190,"Scientists Are Starting to Take Warp Drives Seriously, Especially One Specific Concept",https://medium.com/@anubhavchaurasia/scientists-are-starting-to-take-warp-drives-seriously-especially-one-specific-concept-dd24bbc6d6a0?source=extreme_main_feed---------193-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"It's hard living in a relativistic Universe, where even the nearest stars are so far away and the speed of light is absolute. It is little wonder then why science fiction franchises routinely employ FTL (Faster-than-Light) as a plot device.Push a button, press a petal, and that fancy drive system ‚Äì whose workings no one can explain ‚Äì will send us to another location in space-time.However, in recent years, the scientific community has become understandably excited and skeptical about claims that a particular concept ‚Äì the Alcubierre Warp Drive ‚Äì might actually be feasible.This was the subject of a presentation made at this year's American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Propulsion and Energy Forum, which took place from August 19th to 22nd in Indianapolis.This presentation was conducted by Joseph Agnew ‚Äì an undergraduate engineer and research assistant from the University of Alabama in Huntsville's Propulsion Research Center (PRC).As part of a session titled ""The Future of Nuclear and Breakthrough Propulsion"", Agnew shared the results of a study he conducted titled ""An Examination of Warp Theory and Technology to Determine the State of the Art and Feasibility"".As Agnew explained to a packed house, the theory behind a warp propulsion system is relatively simple.Originally proposed by Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994, this concept for an FTL system is viewed by man as a highly theoretical (but possibly valid) solution to the Einstein field equations, which describe how space, time and energy in our Universe interact.In layman's terms, the Alcubierre Drive achieves FTL travel by stretching the fabric of space-time in a wave, causing the space ahead of it to contract while the space behind it expands.In theory, a spacecraft inside this wave would be able to ride this ""warp bubble"" and achieve velocities beyond the speed of light. This is what is known as the ""Alcubierre Metric"".Interpreted in the context of General Relativity, the interior of this warp bubble would constitute the inertial reference frame for anything inside it. By the same token, such bubbles can appear in a previously flat region of spacetime and exceed the speed of light.Since the ship is not moving through space-time (but moving space-time itself), conventional relativistic effects (like time dilation) would not apply.In short, the Alcubierre Metric allows for FTL travel without violating the laws of relativity in the conventional sense. As Agnew told Universe Today via email, he was inspired by this concept as early as high school and has been pursuing it ever since:""I delved into mathematics and science more, and, as a result, started to become interested in science fiction and advanced theories on a more technical scale. I started watching Star Trek, the Original series and The Next Generation, and noticed how they had predicted or inspired the invention of cell phones, tablets, and other amenities.I thought about some of the other technologies, such as photon torpedoes, phasers, and warp drive, and tried to research both what the 'star trek science' and 'real world science equivalent' had to say about it. I then stumbled across the original paper by Miguel Alcubierre, and after digesting it for a while, I started pursuing other keywords and papers and getting deeper into the theory.""While the concept was generally dismissed for being entirely theoretical and highly speculative, it has had new life breathed into it in recent years. The credit for this goes largely to Harold ""Sonny"" White, the Advanced Propulsion Team Lead for at the NASA Johnson Space Center's Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory (aka. ""Eagleworks Laboratory"").During the 100 Year Starship Symposium in 2011, White shared some updated calculations of the Alcubierre Metric, which were the subject of a presentation titled ""Warp Field Mechanics 101"" (and a study of the same name).According to White, Alcubierre's theory was sound but needed some serious testing and development. Since then, he and his colleagues have been doing these very things through the Eagleworks Lab.In a similar vein, Agnew has spent much of his academic career researching the theory and mechanics behind warp mechanics. Under the mentorship of Jason Cassibry ‚Äì an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and a faculty member of the UAH's Propulsion Research Center ‚Äì Agnew's work has culminated in a study that addresses the major hurdles and opportunities presented by warp mechanics research.As Agnew related, one of the greatest is the fact that the concept of the ""warp drive"" is still not taken very seriously in scientific circles:""In my experience, the mention of warp drive tends to bring chuckles to the conversation because it is so theoretical and right out of science fiction. In fact, often it is met with dismissive remarks, and used as an example of something totally outlandish, which is understandable.I know in my own case, I initially had grouped it, mentally, into the same category as typical superluminal concepts, since obviously they all violate the 'speed of light is the ultimate speed' assumption.It wasn't until I dug into the theory more carefully that I realized it did not have these problems. I think there would/will be much more interest when individuals delve into the progress that has been made. The historically theoretical nature of the idea is also itself a likely deterrent, as it's much more difficult to see substantial progress when you are looking at equations instead of quantitative results.""While the field is still in its infancy, there have been a number of recent developments that have helped. For example, the discovery of naturally occurring gravitational waves (GWSs) by LIGO scientists in 2016, which both confirmed a prediction made by Einstein a century ago and proves that the basis for the warp drive exists in nature.As Agnew indicated, this is perhaps the most significant development, but not the only one:""In the past 5-10 years or so, there has been a lot of excellent progress along the lines of predicting the anticipated effects of the drive, determining how one might bring it into existence, reinforcing fundamental assumptions and concepts, and, my personal favorite, ways to test the theory in a laboratory.The LIGO discovery a few years back was, in my opinion, a huge leap forward in science, since it proved, experimentally, that spacetime can 'warp' and bend in the presence of enormous gravitational fields, and this is propagated out across the Universe in a way that we can measure. Before, there was an understanding that this was likely the case, thanks to Einstein, but we know for certain now.""Since the system relies on the expansion and compression of spacetime, said Agnew, this discovery demonstrated that some of these effects occur naturally.""Now that we know the effect is real, the next question, in my mind, is, 'how do we study it, and can we generate it ourselves in the lab?'"" he added. ""Obviously, something like that would be a huge investment of time and resources, but would be massively beneficial.""Of course, the Warp Drive concept requires additional support and numerous advances before experimental research will be possible. These include advances in terms of the theoretical framework as well as technological advancements.If these are treated as ""bite-size"" problems instead of one massive challenge, said Agnew, then progress is sure to be made:""In essence, what is needed for a warp drive is a way to expand and contract spacetime at will, and in a local manner, such as around a small object or ship. We know for certain that very high energy densities, in the form of EM fields or mass, for example, can cause curvature in spacetime. It takes enormous amounts to do so, however, with our current analysis of the problem.On the flipside, the technical areas should try to refine the equipment and process as much as possible, making these high energy densities more plausible. I believe there is a chance that once the effect can be duplicated on a lab scale, it will lead to a much deeper understanding of how gravity works, and may open the door to some as-yet-undiscovered theories or loopholes.I suppose to summarize, the biggest hurdle is the energy, and with that comes technological hurdles, needing bigger EM fields, more sensitive equipment, etc.""The sheer amount of positive and negative energy needed to create a warp bubble remains the biggest challenge associated with Alcubierre's concept. Currently, scientists believe that the only way to maintain the negative energy density required to produce the bubble is through exotic matter. Scientists also estimate that the total energy requirement would be equivalent to the mass of Jupiter.However, this represents a significant drop from earlier energy estimates, which claimed that it would take an energy mass equivalent to the entire Universe. Nevertheless, a Jupiter-mass amount of exotic matter is still prohibitively large. In this respect, significant progress still needs to be made to scale the energy requirements down to something more realistic.The only foreseeable way to do this is through further advances in quantum physics, quantum mechanics and metamaterials, says Agnew. As for the technical side of things, further progress will need to be made in the creation of superconductors, interferometers, and magnetic generators. And of course, there's the issue of funding, which is always a challenge when it comes to concepts that are deemed to be ""out there"".But as Agnew states, that's not an insurmountable challenge. Considering the progress that has been made so far, there are reason to be positive about the future:""The theory has borne out thus far that it is well worth pursuing, and it is easier now than before to provide evidence that it is legitimate. In terms of justifications for allocation of resources, it is not hard to see that the ability to explore beyond our Solar System, even beyond our Galaxy, would be an enormous leap for mankind. And the growth in technology resulting from pushing the bounds of research would certainly be beneficial.""Like avionics, nuclear research, space exploration, electric cars, and reusable rocket boosters, the Alcubierre Warp Drive seems destined to be one of those concepts that will have to fight its way uphill. But if these other historical cases are any indication, eventually it may pass a point of no return and suddenly seem entirely possible!And given our growing preoccupation with exoplanets (another exploding field of astronomy), there is no shortage of people hoping to send missions to nearby stars to search for potentially habitable planets. And as the aforementioned examples certainly demonstrate, sometimes, all that's needed to get the ball rolling is a good push‚Ä¶WRITTEN BY"
191,Don‚Äôt Try to Fix Anything Right Now,https://forge.medium.com/dont-try-to-fix-anything-right-now-eb28b99816e2?source=extreme_main_feed---------194-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"t‚Äôs been a little fascinating and a little concerning to see just how many of us have turned into anxiety-fueled experts as pandemic anxiety has taken hold over the past week. My social media feed is now full of new epidemiologists, homeschool specialists, and armchair psychologists, all offering solutions for how to survive social isolation or educate a bored child.Right now, we‚Äôre all getting creative with our plans for how to make it through the day. But as much as we may pretend to have things under control, none of our fretful grasping for solutions can answer the big questions: What‚Äôs going to happen? When will life go back to normal? Will it ever?I often tell my therapy clients that as a general rule, humans are terrible at dealing with uncertainty. Even those of us who don‚Äôt identify as Type-A, always-in-control planners still draw comfort from knowing what‚Äôs ahead ‚Äî and, often, spiral when we realize we don‚Äôt.But the ability to sit with uncertainty isn‚Äôt just a valuable asset. In these unpredictable times, it‚Äôs a necessity. It‚Äôs what keeps us from trying (and failing) to control everyone else‚Äôs behavior. Or trying (and failing) to motivate the people around you, or calm them down, or get them to take your unsolicited advice.Here are two steps you can take to cultivate a skill that‚Äôs never been more vital.In times of distress, your anxiety wants you to solve problems as quickly as possible. When the world is burning, it‚Äôs normal to run to the closest fire and stomp the hell out of it.But then there‚Äôs another fire to put out, and another one next to it, and another. Anxious fixing is attempting to take on the impossible task of extinguishing them all. The trouble with this approach is it doesn‚Äôt get you to where you want to be: someplace stable.Of course I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt fight toward small victories. Right now, cooped up at home, those can feel like the only way to get through the day. Sign the kids up for a virtual art class if it gives you a much-needed break for a few hours. Cook enough soup to feed a small army if it helps you channel some of your stress. But notice when you start falling into the mental trap of believing you can fully problem-solve your way out of a pandemic.Identifying your own anxious fixing requires you to sit with a little bit of discomfort. It‚Äôs uncomfortable to accept this new reality as something that we can‚Äôt bend to our will. But this temporary discomfort, this willingness to not fully fight against the anxiety you feel in the moment, can help you achieve long-term calm when facing the unknown.Cognitive flexibility is perhaps one of the greatest tools to have in a time of uncertainty. There are two components to cognitive flexibility: one, being able to change how you think about a problem, and two, being able to let go of solutions that aren‚Äôt working.Rigid thinking is the opposite of cognitive flexibility. And the more anxious you are, the more difficult it is to acknowledge that the square peg just doesn‚Äôt fit in the round hole. Let‚Äôs say, for example, that someone decided that running three miles a day is the key to maintaining their mental health during the pandemic. But if they can‚Äôt seem to hit this distance each day, or if running doesn‚Äôt actually make them feel better, they need to be able to pivot toward alternative solutions.To increase your cognitive flexibility, you can ask yourself two questions: What am I doing, and how effective has it been? If your attempts haven‚Äôt been effective, consider a different solution, or challenge yourself to think differently about the problem. Over time, it will become easier to change course. You‚Äôll also be kinder to yourself as you navigate a crisis. People who focus on responding nimbly to the reality of the day can better sit with the uncertainty of tomorrow.You can‚Äôt control the future, but you can begin to work on the version of yourself that you carry into that future. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWho do I want to be three months from now? How would I be responding to scary events, or anxious people?‚Äù This self-focus is its own form of doomsday prepping, one that is probably more useful than moving into the woods or hiring a psychic.This preparation can feel like slow and boring work. It requires you to show up every day and try to be the most mature, least reactive version of yourself. It asks you to recognize how your anxious fixing gets in the way of flexible thinking and creative solutions.No one knows when things will get better, but this much is certain: any effort to manage your anxiety and do your best thinking will not go to waste. Your stockpiled food may expire, and your to-do list may become irrelevant, but you can always work on being a resource to your future self.WRITTEN BY"

While native development is positioned as AAA technical solution, it has some disadvantages that create market space for cross-platform apps to come in. In general, native development requires more effort from the development team to accomplish the project but it gives full control over tricky technical stuff under the hood. On the other hand, if you choose cross-platform, it can significantly speed up the development process due to a common code base, make project support easier and reduce expenses for development.One more advantage of native over cross-platform development is performance. In the technical world, you can encounter ‚Äúcross-platform apps are slow‚Äù stereotypes. We decided to test if it‚Äôs true and to what extend cross-platform apps are slower than native.In this article, we share the results of performance tests showing mathematical calculations of number Pi implemented in native and cross-platform approaches.iOSiOSAndroidAndroidPlease let inVerita know if you struggle with picking a mobile tool for development, always happy to help.Authors:Ihor Demedyuk, Co-founder and CTO @ inVeritaNazar Tsybulskyi, Flutter evangelist @ inVeritaWRITTEN BY"
193,My Therapist Says No One Cares,https://elemental.medium.com/my-therapist-says-no-one-cares-baf7297b272e?source=extreme_main_feed---------196-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"This story is part of My Therapist Says, a column about advice from therapy that stuck.hen I was laid off for the third time, I allowed the setback to swallow me into a pit of pervasive depression and anxiety. I was having an early thirties existential crisis: Where did I go wrong? How will I fix it? Am I too old to fix it?And mostly: What will they all think?Don‚Äôt ask me who ‚Äúthey‚Äù are. I have no idea. Sometimes I would obsessively scroll through my Instagram followers, pondering how each person would interpret my bad news. Thanks to the platform‚Äôs selective algorithms, most of those people had no idea what I was doing anyway. But no one could convince me otherwise. Not my friends. Not my partner. Not the decades of parental figure and PSA advice: Don‚Äôt care about what other people think of you! I had nightly visions of ill-willed former colleagues cackling over cocktails as they saw my life fall apart via social media. Distant friends and casual followers watching in real time as my veneer of togetherness melted away. Twice-removed family gossiping over Thanksgiving dinner, saying, ‚ÄúOh did you see? Rachel lost her job and life direction ‚Äî again.‚ÄùI fell into a severe depression shortly after the layoff. Compounded with other bad news, I had completely burnt out. I wasn‚Äôt able to process simple tasks. I would forget information mid-conversation and find myself in rooms without remembering how I got there. I told myself I was fortunate not to have thoughts of suicide, but I still allowed myself to think: Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if I just didn‚Äôt have to exist?Externally, I turned into a one-woman self-help machine, spouting sage advice for surviving a layoff on social media (I was an expert now!) and advising my fellow laid-off colleagues on finding jobs and benefits (‚ÄúBut really, how are you?‚Äù). I was fine. Really. No need to worry about me! Nothing to see here!always had big hopes, big dreams. Bigger than the suburban Connecticut town where I grew up. I couldn‚Äôt wait to be in a place where I was finally understood and fit in. Then I would be a big success with a big job in a big city with a big bank account. This is great fuel to push through unexciting entry-level jobs and shoebox-size New York City apartments, but it created a strict binary measure of success: Anything less than big would be a failure.The fear of the people who saw me when I believed in any of those big dreams kept me up at night. To me, I had failed ‚Äî and they all knew about it.‚ÄúPeople will be like, ‚ÄòBut she had so much promise!‚Äô‚Äù I moaned tearfully to my therapist.‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell you a story,‚Äù my therapist said. Years ago, before my therapist met with her very first client, she had a meltdown. She worried she would ruin this client‚Äôs life. She would give bad advice that would cause them to do something drastic or hate her or hate themselves.‚ÄúNo one cares,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúThose people you think care so much about what you‚Äôre doing and where you are in life ‚Äî they don‚Äôt.‚ÄùHer advisor replied: ‚ÄúNo matter what you say, it‚Äôs not going to change their life today. They‚Äôre going to do what they want anyway. They do not care about you.‚ÄùShe was taken aback. ‚ÄúThey do not care about you‚Äù felt so harsh and finite. But it was also freeing. It cut the pressure that she, personally, would be the driving force to cause this client to fall into a pit of despair or rage.(Full disclosure: I‚Äôm not a therapist, and I‚Äôm not sure if I fully accept this mantra to approach the practice. But in the context of my circumstance, it brought clarity.)‚ÄúNo one cares,‚Äù my therapist now told me. ‚ÄúThose people you think care so much about what you‚Äôre doing and where you are in life ‚Äî they don‚Äôt. People have their own things going on. Unless you are a massive part of their personal life, they do not give you and your troubles and triumphs more than a second thought.‚ÄùFuzzy, random details of other people‚Äôs recent life changes, good and bad, shuffled through my mind. Our constant update culture is an endless data dump. Some news felt important or interesting or sad for a moment. But just a moment or two. Sure, a lot of the time I cared. But permanent, recurring space in my brain was reserved for those irrevocably intertwined into my life. It wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt care about the angst and pleasure of my community. I just had too many of my own things to care about.Why did I believe their experience with me was any different?Don‚Äôt get me wrong: It‚Äôs not incorrect to assume everyone is gossiping about each other all the time. Research says nearly 80% of social interaction is made up of gossip. Gossip is fundamental to the way we bond and share information ‚Äî a survival skill critical to our evolution.But there are layers and layers of cognitive distortions ‚Äî catastrophizing, fortune-telling, pick your poison! ‚Äî that gets us from ‚Äúpeople gossip all the time‚Äù to ‚Äúpeople gossip all the time about me.‚ÄùEnding a lifelong belief that your worth is determined by your community‚Äôs perception of you is a difficult thing to do. It‚Äôs a very difficult thing to do. I‚Äôm still working on it. I give myself a daily, counterintuitive pep talk: No one cares!Sure it‚Äôs cringeworthy to realize your #MeatlessMonday and third job loss are weighed the same in the eyes of your peers. But other people‚Äôs problems and news are just that. They belong to other people.A big part of accepting that people don‚Äôt care is not caring about whether or not they do. It gives way to space to remember that you have control over the person whose care should matter the most. A hint from my therapist: It‚Äôs yourself.WRITTEN BY"
194,You Should Be Eating More Canned Fish,https://heated.medium.com/you-should-be-eating-more-canned-fish-bbf84969b063?source=extreme_main_feed---------197-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"W
henever I bring up my love of canned fish, my friends and colleagues morph into picky children.Canned seafood has a bad reputation in the United States, and it‚Äôs not just anecdotal: On an annual basis, the average American consumes about 3.5 pounds of canned seafood, a number that‚Äôs been steadily falling over the last three decades. Meanwhile, the average Spaniard polishes off nearly three times that.I wasn‚Äôt always a canned fish lover. A friend of mine recommended sardines during one of my sporadic efforts to work out often and eat well. He raved about the health benefits, cost-effectiveness, and convenience of these protein-packed little cans. I tried them out, and, well, I liked them. I didn‚Äôt love them, but I liked them enough that they became part of my diet.It wasn‚Äôt until I went on a trip through Southern Europe that my love story began.People in Spain and Portugal love canned seafood, or conservas. I knew this prior to visiting, but I didn‚Äôt quite understand the extent to which conservas were appreciated. At a tiny tapas bar in Barcelona called Quimet & Quimet, it all began to make sense. The only options for food and drink were wine, spirits, and canned seafood.It wasn‚Äôt just sardines and anchovies, but razor clams, stuffed baby squid, mussels, and more. Each fish and mollusk was handled and plated with expert care. I was hooked.Feel free to make fun of me for being a stereotypical millennial, but one of my favorite preparations is drained sardines or mackerel on top avocado toast with lemon, cracked black pepper, and pickled red onions.For nearly two centuries, canned seafood has been viewed as a delicacy in Southern Europe. Rather than processing low-quality fish parts (i.e., some of the canned tuna you‚Äôd find in a U.S. grocery store), artisan producers use their highest-quality yields, carefully clean the product, cook them to perfection, and preserve them at peak freshness. In these regions, conservas are often seen as a gourmet preparation that is of even higher quality than fresh seafood. It‚Äôs similar to cured meats like jam√≥n ib√©rico; because of the preservation process, the end product is very different and much more valuable than fresh Iberian pork. Canned seafood is oceanic charcuterie.While many Americans associate canned food with tough times and wartime bunkers, those in Spain and Portugal see the cans as small packages of gold, and they‚Äôre often willing to pay the price. For example, a 4-ounce can of almejas, the most expensive Galician clams, can set you back nearly $80.Yes, some canned seafood is a delicacy, but most of it is more wallet-friendly. It‚Äôs also a healthy, sustainable, and convenient food choice.With high protein content and rich omega-3 fatty acids, it‚Äôs no secret that a fish-heavy diet welcomes a range of health benefits. The canned varieties, however, are nutritional powerhouses. For starters, oilier varieties of fish, such as sardines, anchovies, and mackerel, are among the highest sources of omega-3s that you‚Äôll find at a grocery store.So you eat the bones? I get it. Many people get squeamish about eating tiny fish bones, as is to be expected when eating whole sardines. While you can buy boneless, skinless sardine filets, it‚Äôs worth noting that not only are the bones almost unnoticeable, but a single can of sardines can make up for as much as 35 percent of your daily recommended calcium intake, thanks to the little bones.It‚Äôs also worth reaching for the smaller fish because they‚Äôre on the bottom of the food chain. Unlike tuna, sardines and anchovies are low in mercury, a neurotoxin that‚Äôs particularly dangerous for children and pregnant women. Smaller fish are also more sustainable.Gavin Gibbons of the National Fisheries Institute notes that ‚Äúevery species has its own sustainability tale, but from mussels to tuna, canned seafood often has a very good story to tell.‚Äù‚ÄúThe vast majority of tuna stocks are healthy and abundant, and mussels, I mean, come on, they literally clean the environment.‚ÄùCanned seafood also does not require refrigeration. This means that canned seafood can be transported and stored using much less energy than fresh or frozen products. Additionally, while the flavor may begin to degrade over time, many varieties of canned fish are considered non-perishable and can be safely stored for up to five years, reducing food waste.While the U.S. may be slow to catch on, canned fish is beginning to have a moment. The global canned seafood market is expected to grow to $36.70 billion by 2021, up from $29.75 billion in 2016.According to Jonathan Harris, owner of La Tienda, an importer of Spanish products, his company‚Äôs canned seafood sales in the United States are at an all-time high. Harris attributes this to more Americans visiting Spain, a rate that increased by 11.8 percent in 2018, in addition to an overall interest among Americans in adding healthier foods into their diets.‚ÄúThere are a huge amount of Americans that are now visiting Spain ‚Äî Barcelona being a premier destination, and conservas is a tradition in that area,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúBroadly, Spanish food is becoming more well-known, and people are eating more seafood in the U.S., kind of as a health thing, and they are looking for quality.‚ÄùLa Tienda offers a wide array of canned seafood products that can be shipped to your doorstep. Not only has Harris noticed an increase in sales of familiar items like tuna and sardines, but he‚Äôs also seen a spike in sales of angulas (baby eels) and razor clams, both of which were unpopular in the U.S. until recently.Based on the ease of shipping non-perishable cans, there are quite a few online sources for getting great products in addition to La Tienda, such as Caputo‚Äôs, Portugalia Marketplace, and even Amazon. But before rushing to make an online purchase, consider checking out a local specialty store if you have one in town. Any store that sells artisanal cheeses and other products imported from Europe will likely carry a few varieties of canned fish, and may be able to provide some insights. Even Whole Foods has a few options, from entry-level anchovies to interesting products like canned octopus or Jos√© Andr√©s-branded mussels and uni.When it comes to eating and serving canned fish, keep it simple. Some canned fish already comes coated in all the flavor you‚Äôll need, including extra virgin olive oil, tomato sauce, escabeche sauce, white wine and herbs, lemon, and padron peppers. Otherwise, the seafood can be the condiment ‚Äî most notably anchovies, which impart salty, umami flavors in many Italian recipes.Feel free to make fun of me for being a stereotypical millennial, but one of my favorite preparations is drained sardines or mackerel on top avocado toast with lemon, cracked black pepper, and pickled red onions.Grab a few cans and give it a try. And don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself if you‚Äôre not into it right away. Even La Tienda‚Äôs Harris wasn‚Äôt always a conservas connoisseur; he went through the same transition.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a conversion experience for people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been fed such poorly prepared canned seafood that we see it as a cheap source of protein, rather than something to really savor. Once you open one of these cans, it can really open your eyes and can really change how you think. I know because it happened to me.‚ÄùWRITTEN BY"
195,What Happened When I Rage Quit My Job,https://medium.com/refinery29/what-happened-when-i-rage-quit-my-job-cbd07918a069?source=extreme_main_feed---------198-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"By Ludmila LeivaIt can be surprisingly easy to stick around at a job you don‚Äôt like. After all, there‚Äôs a comfort that comes with a steady paycheque or cushty benefits, and that can often outweigh the nagging feelings of restlessness you may be experiencing.It‚Äôs a phenomenon millennials know all too well: In recent years, millennial disengagement at work has been reported to be as high as 71%. Today‚Äôs young workers are increasingly seeking things like a good workplace culture, work-life balance, and remote work options. But many workplaces just aren‚Äôt delivering, and as a result many millennials aren‚Äôt happy in their jobs, whether they‚Äôre dealing with bad management, a toxic office culture, or lack of diversity and inclusion. And though some have options (have you ever heard of taking a stress leave?), there are others who reach a boiling point and just quit.In recent years, the rate at which workers quit their jobs has increased, reaching 2.4% in May 2018, the highest level since April 2001. And while some disgruntled employees are able to give the standard two weeks‚Äô notice, others who find themselves at the end of their proverbial rope abruptly quit on the spot.So what happens after you ‚Äúrage quit‚Äù? And is it worth it to leave your job in such a way? Ahead, we talked with eight women who rage quit their jobs to shed some light on how it went, and what they learned from the experience.‚ÄúShe reminded me about the noncompete, and I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be working in TV ever again.‚Äù‚ÄúIn 2012, I worked for a television station with a reputation for working people into the ground. The recession had caused newsrooms to be cut, and ours was no different. We had a small staff, unreasonable expectations, and harsh criticisms from management despite the fact that every employee was overworked. Nothing was ever good enough.‚ÄúI‚Äôd tried to put in my two weeks‚Äô notice a few months before the walkout, but my boss begged me to stay, promised to change, and even gave me a couple extra days off to recoup. I agreed but started applying for other jobs because I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last.‚ÄúThe day I came back to work, no one from management bothered to speak to me. Typically, we had a daily 2 p.m. editorial meeting. But that day we‚Äôd had a small storm system move in, so everyone was busy and we didn‚Äôt meet. I got zero feedback or assistance from managers and had only one reporter for the 10 p.m. show I was producing.‚ÄúWhen I met with my news director at 6 p.m. to go over my show, she criticised, berated, and belittled me because the show I‚Äôd put together ‚Äî with no help and very few resources ‚Äî wasn‚Äôt good enough for her. Despite the fact that I was fuming, I took a deep breath and went back to my desk to regroup.‚ÄúI sat down, shaking with rage. I thought, ‚ÄòI want to quit, right now. I just want to walk out.‚Äô I told myself to calm down and count to 100, so I did, but I still felt the same way. So I grabbed the few personal belongings on my desk, my coat, and my purse and marched back into my boss‚Äôs office. I told her I was done and was leaving and not coming back.‚ÄúMy boss asked me to come in and sit down and talk, and I told her I had nothing to talk about. She reminded me about the noncompete clause in my contract, and I told her it wasn‚Äôt a problem, that I wouldn‚Äôt be working in TV ever again, and walked out.‚ÄúI had a little bit of a safety net because I‚Äôd just moved in with my boyfriend and had gotten a tax-refund check. But I had no real savings to fall back on. Luckily, the very next day I got a call to interview for a job I‚Äôd applied for a month prior, after a really bad day. I got that job, was quickly promoted, and doubled my salary in just five years.‚ÄúOverall, I learned that I don‚Äôt deserve to be treated like crap. I have value and I‚Äôm worth fighting for. It was literally one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made. I also found out that my coworkers had dubbed my move ‚Äòpulling a Kelly C.‚Äô Whenever someone would have a really bad day, they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòMan, I really wanted to pull a Kelly C. today.‚Äô Apparently, it still lives on, even though I‚Äôve been gone for so long.‚Äù‚Äî Kelly, 39, Public Relations, Norman, OKOne day after a shift, I talked to my manager and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is for me.‚Äù‚ÄúAfter graduating at 22, I got hired at my ‚Äòdream‚Äô hospital. I was so excited in the beginning because I thought that I had everything I wanted. But as a new nurse, I felt like I didn‚Äôt know anything. On top of that, I was taking care of the pediatric population. It was heartbreaking for me to take care of sick children, especially knowing that I couldn‚Äôt do anything more for them.‚ÄúThree months in, I was close to completing orientation but realized I wasn‚Äôt happy. I wasn‚Äôt eating or sleeping, had lost weight, and was so unhealthy. One day after a shift, I talked to my manager and said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think this is for me.‚Äô The next day I went to HR, and that was done.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a backup plan and had loans to pay. I quickly fell into a deeper depression ‚Äî but I knew that I had to take care of myself first. I saw a psychiatrist for the first time ever, and with the support of my family, I focused on taking care of myself. During that time, I decided not to go back into nursing yet. After five months, I started as a store associate in retail. Even though I was making less than half of what I would‚Äôve been making as a nurse, I needed to make even a little bit of money. Two months after I started that retail job, I started working as a registered nurse again at a long-term-care facility.‚ÄúI worked there for three months, but I dreaded going in every day. They wanted me to work 16 hours every day because we were always short-staffed. I did not feel safe working there, and I wasn‚Äôt alone. Another nurse said that she had been putting in applications for other jobs every night.‚ÄúOne day, I had enough. And I wrote my resignation letter, put it in my supervisor‚Äôs mailbox, and never looked back. Now, I have been working at an outpatient clinic for over two years, and I love it. I am even back in school to get my master‚Äôs to become a nurse practitioner. This experience taught me that it‚Äôs okay to take risks.‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt quit, I would still be unhappy with my job and probably would not have addressed some mental-health issues I have. Some days I don‚Äôt feel like working because I don‚Äôt want to get out of my comfy, warm bed. But once I‚Äôm here in my office, everything feels right.‚Äù‚Äî Katie, 26, Registered Nurse, Philadelphia, PA‚ÄúI basically threatened to sue for gender discrimination if they didn‚Äôt give me a severance package.‚Äù‚ÄúA long time ago, when I was working for a major TV station, I‚Äôd been dealing with a shitty work environment and gender discrimination, and talking to HR did nothing. I‚Äôd been ‚Äòsideways‚Äô demoted and lied to regularly. My boss was also sleeping with the person working for me, which made things even more unpleasant.‚ÄúOne day my boss called me into his office to give me a random review. It was so beside the point and obviously done just to annoy me that I lost it. I quit on the spot and basically threatened to sue for gender discrimination if they didn‚Äôt give me a severance package.‚ÄúLooking back, I think my boss was relieved. I‚Äôd complained to HR about issues I had with him (as had other women in the company), so they didn‚Äôt want to fire me. I ended up getting three months‚Äô pay and six months of health insurance. I packed my desk (although I‚Äôd taken most of everything home by then) and never came back.‚ÄúAfterward, I ended up going back to university and got a master‚Äôs in writing and education. This experience changed my life forever. It taught me to address an awful work situation much earlier and with more up-front honesty ‚Äî I‚Äôve found even when people agree with you, they still don‚Äôt want to stand out and complain. It also taught me to protect myself and my interests first.‚Äù‚Äî Leigh, 46, Writing & Business Mentor, Atlanta, GA, & Salta, Argentina‚ÄúI told him that I quit and didn‚Äôt want to finish the rest of my shifts.‚Äù‚ÄúI worked at a restaurant that was very corporate and had a lot of rules (i.e., bring in a dry-cleaning tag to prove you‚Äôve washed your white button-down uniform shirt). Guests were in charge and could have anything they wanted, including any alteration to the menu.‚ÄúIt was Valentine‚Äôs Day lunch, and we were told that we had to switch out our normal uniform ties for Valentine‚Äôs Day ties. I was already miserable and sleepless, and the tie didn‚Äôt help. Later that afternoon, after a couple who hadn‚Äôt treated me well got up to leave, I didn‚Äôt find any evidence of their payment. Little did I know they‚Äôd paid cash with a manager. Instead of asking my manager if they‚Äôd taken payment for the table, I chased the couple out the front door.‚ÄúOnce it was clear that they had paid and I just hadn‚Äôt seen it, the man complained to my manager for embarrassing him on Valentine‚Äôs Day in front of his date. I cried in the kitchen, and my manager seemed furious. The man was presented with a gift card and was told that I would be reprimanded for what I did.‚ÄúThe next morning, I was asked to come by at 8 a.m. to speak to my general manager. To my surprise, he did not want to fire me. He told me I was a good server and issued me a write-up. But I realised I couldn‚Äôt take it and slid the write-up back to him. I told him that I quit and didn‚Äôt want to finish the rest of my shifts.‚ÄúAt the time, I had absolutely no money saved but was afraid to work at another restaurant, fearing my reputation would be spoiled, so I applied to work the late-night shift at a hip book store that was open until 2 a.m. Two weeks later, I got the book-store job, making ¬£7 an hour. I could barely afford rent, and while my mum was able to help me a little here and there, I was mostly on my own.‚ÄúAfter a couple of months, I applied to work at another restaurant that gave me much more leeway to focus on my writing. Today, I still work in the restaurant industry as a means of supporting my writing career, and despite a few pain points here and there, I really love it. I‚Äôm more comfortable in my role and less resentful of my lot in life. I think now, being older and more experienced, I‚Äôm much less prone to flying off the walls. I‚Äôm more calm and collected.‚ÄúI learned that waiting tables can be both great and terrible, but at the end of the day, I do it to support my writing. It‚Äôs my choice; I could go work in an office doing something menial as hell, and don‚Äôt even get me started on what that rage quit would look like.‚Äù‚Äî Leah, 27, Freelance Journalist & Restaurant Server, Brooklyn, NY‚ÄúI drafted an email saying that I was putting in my notice.‚Äù‚ÄúI worked thankless hours as an estate manager for a private family, whom I had been with for just over seven years. I was extremely comfortable, but the hours and travel were getting too long and tedious, and there was no sign of slowing. In the previous month leading up to me quitting, my father had been hospitalised, with a long recovery ahead, and I just began a new relationship ‚Äî I felt pulled in a million different directions and was incredibly drained mentally and physically.‚ÄúAfter I wrapped a project way ahead of schedule, my boss immediately asked me to begin a new long-term project, and I really just lost it. I drafted an email saying that I was putting in my notice. She tried every which way to get me to stay, but I really needed to let go of the job as it was no longer serving me.‚ÄúHowever, I had no backup plan. My father immediately told me that what I had done was a huge mistake, and still reminds me of the time I was ‚Äòreckless‚Äô and quit my job at 30 with no plan. I had decent savings at the time, which I blew through very quickly after taking myself to Costa Rica for over two months.‚ÄúI began looking for remote and freelance jobs to tide me over while I was traveling, and when I returned, I was in a mountain of debt and I struggled to figure out the next steps. While I was never essentially unemployed, I was working a job that did not even come close to paying my expenses for six months. Eventually, I transitioned into the hospitality industry, where I work now.‚ÄúI learned from this experience that while getting paid a boat-ton of money sounds really lovely, it often comes at the expense of your sanity. I also learned that having a savings account is crucial to quitting any job. The more you have stashed away, the more you can think of actually leaving any place on a whim.‚Äù‚Äî Kristen, 31, Property Operations, Brooklyn, NY‚ÄúI had a thought that never crossed my mind before: I told him I was going to quit the exact same day.‚Äù‚ÄúBecause of love, I moved to Los Angeles after working for over eight years at the best hospital in New York. I started a job (that came with a huge pay cut) at an academic medical centre that came with the promise of running an entire clinic. In the interim, my husband and I incurred ¬£15k in debt from moving, purchasing furniture, and the other expenses that come with starting a new life.‚ÄúOur original intent was to pay off our debt before we made any career decisions. However, one day the chair of my department sent me a strange text message out of the blue, undermining all the work that I did (like increasing patient volume by 33% for a niche program, increasing national awareness, and increasing patient satisfaction). After a series of texts, he followed up asking whether or not I liked my job. The subject matter seemed unusual to discuss through text.‚ÄúI texted him back and told him that I liked my job, was dedicated to the work that I did, and respected his leadership. I also stated that his message was quite discouraging, especially after I‚Äôd received multiple compliment letters from patients. This led to a phone call, where he spoke to me in a manner that I have never been spoken to before ‚Äî filled with misogyny. He not only belittled me but spoke to me in a way that he would never have spoken if I were a man.‚ÄúAn hour later, I went to lunch with my husband, and in the middle of our meal, I had a thought that never crossed my mind before: I told him I was going to quit the exact same day. He told me that we would have to give up the car and the apartment if I decided to move forward with it, but said he would support me regardless. I went back to the office, wrote my resignation letter, and packed up my belongings. At the end of my shift, I handed the key to the office, my ID, and my resignation letter in an envelope to my direct supervisor.‚ÄúAs soon as I told my supervisor I was resigning, the first three questions she asked me were:
‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt want to work anymore? You don‚Äôt like your job? Does your husband know?‚Äô I explained that I actually loved my job but could no longer work in an intimidating environment. Two days later, I received a phone call from two female physicians: They knew exactly who had caused my unexpected leave, and stated this wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident.‚ÄúQuitting my job has caused financial turmoil in our household, as we were on the brink of losing everything we had worked so hard to build. Besides the physical things, like our apartment and the car, I lost my sense of self-worth and had to rediscover who I truly am. But then I did something I was extremely scared to do; for the first time in my life, I shared my experience with others.‚ÄúI was surprised by the outpouring of support by strangers who shared their own experiences with me, letting me know that I wasn‚Äôt alone. What I learned most from quitting is that no one deserves to ever be treated as less than a human being and that no matter what we struggle with, if we are brave enough to share our experiences, others will come to our aid to let us know that we are not in it alone.‚Äù‚Äî Angie, 30, Registered Nurse Program Administrator, Los Angeles, CA‚ÄúI‚Äôd had a resignation letter sitting in my Google Drive.‚Äù‚ÄúWorking as a figure-skating director, I felt overworked and tired. I was in love with certain parts of my job, but I knew that it was affecting my mental health in a negative way. I would go home late at night and dream about my work the next day. Sometimes I would break down and cry about it.‚ÄúI‚Äôd had a resignation letter sitting in my Google Drive, and the night before [quitting] I called my mother in Maryland to let her know my plans. I had no real safety net, so I needed to know that if things got really rough, I had somewhere to go. The next day I printed out the letter and went straight to HR. I explained that I was ready to move on, and that was it.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a backup plan and had a really bad summer working at an internship that paid minimum wage. I couldn‚Äôt afford to survive, and my rent was two months late, but I am so thankful I didn‚Äôt get evicted. I prayed that things would get better. For a majority of the summer, I ducked under the turnstiles to commute and ate ramen. Still, I did not regret quitting my job.‚ÄúI knew I had to keep my faith, and now I have three art residencies that are supporting my dreams. This experience taught me to always follow my gut. When a situation does not feel right, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith.‚ÄúThings got really hard after rage quitting, but the rewards that have come since have been absolutely mind-blowing. At the time, I did not feel comfortable telling friends, but now that I am on the other side, it‚Äôs a lot easier to talk about. I learned how to let go of my pride, and how to just be. In the process, I learned how to survive and stand up for myself and my beliefs.‚Äù‚Äî LaTasha, 26, Artist, New York City, NY‚ÄúA week later, the CEO yelled at me over a trivial matter, and I flew into a rage.‚Äù‚ÄúTwo years ago, I worked for a tech startup in San Francisco. I found out by accident that the CEO of my company had been arrested and was on trial for 15 felony counts of domestic abuse against his girlfriend, whom I knew.‚ÄúI went to HR, and they concocted a cover-up involving a fake email to try and convince me the arrest I had uncovered didn‚Äôt exist. Two weeks later, I checked the San Francisco Superior Court website and searched his name. Of course, [I confirmed that] it wasn‚Äôt fake and he was in fact facing charges from the district attorney.‚ÄúI decided not to quit on the spot, because I had a move planned two months from then anyway. But a week later, the CEO yelled at me over a trivial matter, and I flew into a rage, bringing up the felony counts he was accused of. His first reaction was to try and convince me that the ‚Äòrumours‚Äô I‚Äôd heard about his arrest were untrue. After I pulled out my phone and read the felony counts, he simply said, ‚ÄòOkay, I think we‚Äôre done.‚Äô‚ÄúHe then printed out a contract stating that day would be my last, and assured me that I would be compensated for another two weeks. Afterward, however, a friend of mine who was part of the HR team told me that the CEO was telling everyone at the company that he was going to sue me for defamation. This would have simply been a tactic to force me to lose thousands on lawyer fees, since the arrest was a matter of public record and he must have known he wouldn‚Äôt win. In the end, we never ended up speaking again.‚ÄúLooking back, I have zero regrets! I had savings and was planning to move to New York City for my boyfriend‚Äôs medical school anyway, so there weren‚Äôt any repercussions. My career has proceeded, and I‚Äôm actually going to law school next year. This incident was in many ways the catalyst for me deciding to pursue a career in criminal litigation.‚ÄúAfter this experience, I have a much less personal relationship to work now. While I‚Äôm extremely happy with my current CEO and company, I also understand that my job is not my friend, it‚Äôs my job. At the end of the day, any company will look out for itself, and I think that employees should be aware of this and be looking out for themselves, too.‚Äù‚Äî Elaina, Content Marketing in High Tech, 27, New York, NYOriginally published on refinery29.com.WRITTEN BY"
196,Mark Bittman‚Äôs Master List of Interchangeable Ingredients,https://heated.medium.com/put-this-list-on-your-fridge-21284a3cddfa?source=extreme_main_feed---------199-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"For the rest of March, Heated is focused on cooking. With so many Americans holed up at home for an indefinite period, we want to highlight recipes, tricks, and techniques to make life easier during these uncertain times. We‚Äôll still run profiles and reported stories, but we‚Äôre trying to meet people where they‚Äôre at: in their kitchens.P
eople ask me ALL the time, ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt have X, can I use Y?‚Äù X = rosemary, Y = Thyme. X = sherry vinegar, Y = red wine vinegar. X = apples, Y = pears. You get the idea: They‚Äôre asking about ingredient substitutions, but really they‚Äôre requesting permission to ignore or defy parts of a recipe. My answer, 99.9 percent of the time, is ‚ÄúGo for it!‚Äù

Learning to swap in ingredients that we have on hand for ones that might require an added expense or an extra trip to the store is one of the most powerful things we can do as cooks. It makes us flexible and adaptable in the kitchen, which (I‚Äôm convinced) is the most sustainable, productive, and enjoyable way to cook. This list of interchangeable ingredients, below, is a good place to start: a rundown of pantry and fridge items (featuring lots of produce) with suggestions for what to use in their place when they‚Äôre called for in a recipe but you don‚Äôt have them around.

Here‚Äôs what this list is not: 1) Comprehensive; I wanted to keep it manageable to start. 2) Foolproof; cooking times and quantities can vary, and some of the substitutions will require your better judgment (for instance, wine can be a wonderful substitute for stock if you need to deglaze a pan, but is less appropriate for making soup). It‚Äôs not a silver bullet, but a way to build stronger habits in the kitchen; not a call to replace recipes, but a tool for making the recipes we use much more useful.Whenever a recipe calls for something you don‚Äôt have, use this list for Plan B. The ingredients, not in bold can be substituted for those in bold and vice versa. Cooking times may vary a bit, but building some flexibility and adaptability into your everyday cooking will not only make it faster but more enjoyable.

197,Virtual Therapy: Games vs Depression,https://medium.com/super-jump/virtual-therapy-games-vs-depression-bfa4d6fcb312?source=extreme_main_feed---------200-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"A
lmost all of us have some history with depression. A lot of us are struggling with it ourselves, others are watching a friend or loved one struggle with it every day. More than 16 million American adults battle with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), making it the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for individuals aged 15 to 44, with the majority being women. Luckily, the stigma surrounding this diagnosis has been reduced greatly in recent years, with the general understanding shifting from an individual struggling with depression being ‚Äúweak minded‚Äù to the notion of depression being a biological issue. This development in fundamental realization about depression has opened up the doors to a plethora of studies and treatments. The innovations in how we tackle depression take many forms; pharmaceutical improvement, studies into unconventional regimens such as meditation, physical treatments like leading a more active lifestyle, breakthroughs in cognitive behavioral therapy, and examinations into seemingly the world‚Äôs new favorite pastime ‚Äî video games.Anyone who has bested Ornstein and Smough in Dark Souls (seriously, get out of here with your Dragonslayer Spear,) completed a particularly difficult puzzle in The Witness, or seen their name pop up at the top of the leaderboards after a match in Battlefield or Call of Duty has felt the incredible sense of accomplishment these achievements create. However, gaming may hold deeper secrets to our psyche than strictly a profound sense of triumph. Gaming is a relatively new activity for humanity, and as such studies pertaining to the effects on the brain are still in their infancy. We know it affects attention and improves memory by actually enlarging the hippocampus ‚Äî the region of the brain responsible for memory and learning. Playing games has a profound effect on healthy brains, so what about using it as a treatment for those with disabilities? A group of New Zealand researchers in the University of Auckland, along with a partnership with Metia Interactive, sought to answer that question. Their idea was to develop a game to help those with mild to moderate depression, titled SPARX.SPARX (an acronym that stands for ‚ÄúSmart, Positive, Active, Realistic and X-factor thoughts) is a fantasy role-playing game designed specifically to teach young people suffering from depression strategies to manage and overcome their condition. To oversimplify a very complex idea, SPARX set out to teach those suffering from depression the essential steps of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) by presenting them in an engaging and interesting way, without the players being fully aware it‚Äôs happening. This is accomplished by tasking the player with traveling to seven different regions ‚Äî called ‚Äúprovinces‚Äù ‚Äî to defeat the ‚ÄúGNATs‚Äù (Gloomy Negative Automatic Thoughts). This ultimately restores balance and destroys the ‚ÄúGloom‚Äù that has permeated the world, with the rewards oftentimes being the next step in that individual‚Äôs CBT. These tasks are cleverly hidden throughout the game world, dressed up as standard fantasy RPG flare; convince a gatekeeper to let you pass, use keys to solve a puzzle, or use magic to physically fight the GNATs and overcome the Gloom. However, each of these quests hold important messages and skills for overcoming depression, and are presented in a way that is captivating and ‚Äî importantly ‚Äî respectful to the player.The success rates of SPARX are pretty astonishing. Of the 168 participants, about 44% of those who played claim they completely recovered from depression, while 26% claim the same thing from getting only standard treatment. On top of that, 66% of the gaming group saw a reduction in symptoms of 30% or more, compared to 58% of participants in traditional therapy who saw the same reduction in symptoms. Those numbers are nothing to scoff at, and certainly show promise in the future of treating these ailments. It would seem part of the success of SPARX is in the idea of gaming itself. Sitting down with a therapist at any age can be a daunting task, often times being wrongly stigmatized and ridiculed, especially for teenagers and young adults. If these individuals are able to combat depression at their own pace however, the results seem to be more positive.SPARX is an incredible step in using games as medicine, but it‚Äôs also a game designed specifically to treat depression. The broader gaming medium is composed almost exclusively of games as entertainment, save games like Brain Age. Are these more standard experiences able to shape the way the mind handles roadblocks like depression? A study was published in 2018 by the University Medical Center of Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany that tested 68 random individuals with depression and tasked them to play an endless runner action game called ‚ÄúBoson-X.‚Äù Prior to the study commencing, the participants ‚Äî who‚Äôs median age was 46 with 47 of the 68 participants being female‚Äî were subjected to multiple questionnaires in order to understand what type of depression they had as well as eliminating those individuals who suffered from several disorders, such as schizophrenia, as the test was strictly to test for depression.The test had participants play Boson-X for a varying amount of time every week, recording their play time and sending in the results. After the trial was over, a posttest was given to evaluate both how the participants felt and certain cognitive functions like rumination, objective and subjective cognition, and spatial tasks. Their findings coincide closely with those found by the New Zealand researchers. They found that the 34 participants who played Boson-X typically showed fewer symptoms of depression than those who hadn‚Äôt, specifically in the concept of rumination. Rumination is the focused attention on the symptoms of one‚Äôs distress, and on its possible causes and consequences, as opposed to its solutions. Those who participated in playing Boson-X showed improvement in breaking their rumination, being less likely to fall into a rumination cycle and continue their depressive episode. They also showed higher levels of what‚Äôs known as subjective cognitive ability, thus reducing Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI.) SCI is when an individual reports a worsening of their thinking abilities, but the decline cannot be verified by standard tests. With an improved subjective cognitive ability, individuals are less likely to feel as though their thinking ability (including memory) has worsened, therefore feeling more confident in their decisions and their planning. Both SCI and rumination are linked to depression in a substantial way, and the conquering of these obstacles is a major step into getting past one‚Äôs depression.The study has its drawbacks though. It had different affects on those who play video games regularly, for example. While still improving their mood, those who game regularly had a less profound change in their depression over those who didn‚Äôt. In addition, many participants did not submit all of the information necessary, such as forgetting to log their total playtime for the week, or not sending the playtime in at all. The study also does not survive multiple comparison connection, or when one re-calculates probabilities obtained from a statistical test that is repeated multiple times. Essentially, the results of this study are not concrete. It‚Äôs simply one test showing the possible benefits of gaming toward depression, and is meant to pave the way for more studies in the same vein. Regardless, the study concludes by saying, ‚Äú‚Ä¶video games provide a promising, novel, and highly practical therapeutic intervention for those with depression.‚Äù Despite the discrepancies, the study yielded positive enough results to convince the researchers that further investigation is required. They appear confident that the study shows promise.Both of these studies are adamant in stating that video games, at least in their current state, are not a sufficient replacement for standard therapy, be it cognitive behavioral or psychotherapy. While these studies are in no way conclusive evidence that gaming is the next big step in the treatment of the plague that is depression, they certainly augur towards positive utilization of the tools at hand for a brighter future with the illness. The more you dig into research for how gaming can improve your mental health, the more you find conclusions from researchers suggesting that there are serious mental benefits to playing games, even beyond the treatment of depression. For example, casual puzzle games like Bejeweled or Candy Crush are shown to reduce stress and anxiety, while games like Elude and Depression Quest attempt to represent the mindsets of those who suffer from depression, their developers communicating their story to those who may not understand using gaming‚Äôs interactive medium. Studies such as those done in New Zealand and Germany are starting to lay the groundwork in revolutionizing the ability to intertwine an activity we love with the capability to make a serious positive impact on us and the people around us. Even though we only have a rudimentary understanding of the long-term effects of how gaming changes the mind, we may soon see recommendations from medical professionals to get a little bit of gaming in to keep up with our daily health. If we‚Äôre able to receive genuine, quantifiable medical benefits for the wider world while still receiving the enjoyment we get from gaming, it would be a win-win for humanity as a whole.Hello everyone!

198,Vision Forecast 2020: AR Execs Weigh in on Recent Industry Milestones & What We Can Expect in the‚Ä¶,https://medium.com/@NextRealityNews/vision-forecast-2020-ar-execs-weigh-in-on-recent-industry-milestones-what-we-can-expect-in-the-2d4a34c074a2?source=extreme_main_feed---------201-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"The year 2019 was filled with all the normal peaks and valleys of the tech business cycle, but this year was particularly important in a space as relatively young as the augmented reality industry.What once seemed like a vast fertile bed of mobile AR apps, powered by Apple‚Äôs ARKit and Google‚Äôs ARCore turned out to be just a small beachhead in the mobile component of immersive computing.Meanwhile, the high-end AR players at the top of the mountain swapped places, as one replaced its aging headset with a brand new device that became the state of the art, while the other experienced a surge of new apps, but even more doubts as its funding runway and market strategy has been placed in doubt.And operating mostly under the radar of all but the most vigilant AR insiders were the mid-tier AR smartglasses makers, making strides toward normalizing AR wearables for both enterprise and general consumer users.Of course, many industry watchers are still keeping a close eye on Apple, with rumors of its AR smartglasses still freshly stoked by analysts and leakers. And, because of the history of the iPhone and its imitators, there are expectations that any smartglasses product from Apple will be swiftly matched by imitators. But some, particularly in China, are already getting a headstart.We frequently offer our take on where the space is going, but we thought it would be valuable to pluck some of the top people working behind the scenes in the AR business to see exactly what they think about what happened this year, and what may be in store for 2020.‚ÄúThe best thing that happened is that AR continued to go far beyond the ‚ÄòPok√©mon Go‚Äô entertainment app, to enterprise AR being deployed everywhere ‚Äî from the manufacturing floor, to product development, sales and marketing, service and training, and more.‚ÄúAlso, advancements in AR devices continued to democratize AR. Digital eyewear is one of the biggest challenges to overcome for adoption of AR in the industrial enterprise, and 2019 had some great news. Beyond being the way people will consume AR content, digital eyewear will become a way to instrument what people actually do ‚Äî think of it as IoT for people, turning bits and bytes into and sounds and sights, and vice versa. Whereas machines have become more effective components of the enterprise via their connections to remote information sources and each other, the human side of this equation hasn‚Äôt benefited the same way.‚ÄúAR is the answer to how we connect people to the Internet. People don‚Äôt have an Ethernet port, but now they have AR devices that serve the same task of converting digital to analog and back again. People can now basically use a device that supercharges their senses. With digital data streaming down from the cloud converted to analog signals, you can see and hear with your senses, and meanwhile when you speak with your voice or move your hands around, the analog signals you‚Äôre creating get converted back to digital data and sent up to the cloud.‚Äù‚ÄúIncrease in partnerships [and] increased collaboration between big companies, start-ups, and developers has been driving the creativity and innovation we‚Äôre seeing in the space. With more developer kits and a growing community in the space, it is this interdisciplinary approach to creation that drives change.‚Äù‚ÄúThe best thing that happened in the AR space this year is by far: the availability of Microsoft‚Äôs HoloLens 2. It signals a tipping point for AR and wearables in 2020 as Microsoft is clearly taking aim at the enterprise market. As a result, more Fortune 100 businesses, and even the U.S. military, will be able to use the device to start exploring what AR is truly capable of in the enterprise.‚Äù‚ÄúThe best thing that happened in the AR space in the past year is the industry-wide recognition of AR‚Äôs real use cases in the commercial and industrial spaces. To address this huge market potential, we saw large firms join forces with specialized AR startups to apply their technology ‚Äî which was previously relegated to gaming and entertainment ‚Äî to use cases that have real, tangible benefits that move society forward.‚ÄúTech like Healium AR, an app that helps veterans manage their anxiety or the HP/Educause Campus of the Future project that investigates uses for AR and VR tech in higher education are examples of what happens when AR‚Äôs capabilities are focused on progressing humanity.‚Äù‚ÄúThe best thing that happened in Augmented Reality in 2019 in my mind was the ARKit 3 update by Apple. On top of showing continued commitment from Apple to Augmented Reality, ARKit 3 offered a great leap forward in the AR capabilities of the iPhone leading to significantly more stable and powerful AR experiences. Having been involved in the AR industry since before ARKit was launched, it is amazing to see how far we have come in the last 3 years.‚Äù‚ÄúAs someone with a vested interest in the industry, a great thing to see in 2019 was a large number of consumer electronics companies announcing their intention to launch products in the AR space. This is incredibly exciting when we think about how the industry has grown and where the technology and market perception was just a few years ago. Having the tech giants of the world announcing their plans shows that AR wearables are about to become a reality.‚Äù‚Äú2019 saw the introduction of the first true everyday consumer smartglasses, and strong signals that the large tech companies are ramping up investments in their AR strategies ‚Äî including rumors on Apple and Facebook‚Äôs approaches, alongside eyewear products announced by Snap and Amazon.‚ÄùCampbell: ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre making great strides in augmented reality, one of the issues that the industry confronts is a true and comprehensive understanding of the power of the technology and an appreciation of the use cases that it can address and the impact it can make on top and bottom lines. Our job, therefore, is to educate.‚ÄúWhen manufacturing executives see AR technology in action, they‚Äôre blown away and are interested in learning more. Seeing is believing ‚Äî and once seeing the potential of this, these executives want to explore more. So we‚Äôre on an upward swing of proving out the value and seeing more enterprise-level implementations. As an example and within the context of the manufacturing skills gap, AR can have significant impacts on business goals, including reduced training time, improved productivity and, in turn, greater revenue.‚ÄùThe overwhelmingly negative response to Microsoft‚Äôs deal with the DoD shed a harsh light on public opinion regarding military technology‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a shame that the public chose fear over hope that AR can offer the military an easier way to understand their surroundings resulting in more informed decision-making.- Adam Kaplan, CEO of EdgybeesSaatchi: ‚ÄúI definitely see much more room for partnerships extending to artificial intelligence. Currently, AI is used for enterprise, military, healthcare, but it has yet [to reach] the mainstream for everyone to enjoy. We really see the need to bring together not just machine learning engineers but immersive storytellers, designers, [and] artists to create augmented reality experiences with virtual beings that you deeply care about. A lot of AI communities are siloed. What happens if various disciplines brainstorm, share ideas, and collaborate?‚ÄùMontgomerie: ‚ÄúIt was a disappointing year for consumer AR. Apple and Google put a lot of hype behind it, the Harry Potter game launched with much fanfare, but didn‚Äôt perform well, and the app stores were relatively empty, lacking any truly compelling experiences that consumers will want to engage with time and again.‚ÄùKaplan: ‚ÄúSomething that was, and still is, quite detrimental to the AR space was the backlash following Microsoft‚Äôs DoD deal and the broader inherent misunderstanding of AR‚Äôs benefits in the military and defense space.‚ÄúThe overwhelmingly negative response to Microsoft‚Äôs deal with the DoD shed a harsh light on public opinion regarding military technology. When utilized in a military setting, AR offers unprecedented situational awareness, efficiency and precision ‚Äî things that everyone can agree are valuable when carrying out life-or-death missions. It‚Äôs a shame that the public chose fear over hope that AR can offer the military an easier way to understand their surroundings and to better communicate, resulting in higher accuracy in more informed decision-making.‚ÄùBentovim: ‚ÄúThe biggest disappointment for me was the fact that although the field of view of the HoloLens 2 is larger than HoloLens 1, it is not materially better than the Magic Leap One. The biggest challenge today with headset AR is the field of view and I was hopeful that the new HoloLens would make a more significant improvement in that area.‚ÄùHayes: ‚ÄúAs with any new market and technology, there has been some market consolidation over the last year. While it is always sad to see startups fail, it shows how difficult it is to build true AR products. That said, the continued excitement from large companies in the sector shows that the market is maturing and the companies that will really shape the AR industry are starting to come to the forefront.‚ÄùLake: ‚ÄúWe began to see the failure of strategies that focused on starting with ‚Äòperformance first‚Äô AR headsets, helmets, and so on, rather than practical applications, with the failure of several significant startups in that realm.‚ÄùCampbell: ‚ÄúThere is so much happening across the industry today. There‚Äôs actually a groundswell of activity. Consider the devices: Microsoft has announced the launch of its new HoloLens 2. And vendors, large and small, are jumping into the ring. We‚Äôve seen the introduction of expanded solutions and offerings for use cases such as remote assistance, expert guidance, and many more‚Ä¶ There are much better ways to train the 21st century workforce, and the demand for effective workforce training cannot be understated.‚ÄúMany industries are facing a growing skills gap, and that‚Äôs particularly pronounced among industrial enterprises. The manufacturing industry is forecast to soon have 2.4 million vacant positions, which could impact economic US output by $2.5 trillion over the next decade. At the same time, US training annual expenditures in 2018 reached a staggering $88 billion. The average training time spent per employee was approximately 47 hours, and most of these hours (70%) were allocated to ‚Äòblended learning‚Äô methods including instructor-led classrooms and learning management systems.‚ÄúWhile these methods might be practical for understanding a job‚Äôs core principles, they don‚Äôt necessarily translate to the development of real-world hands-on skills required for the job‚Äôs performance. Without consistent repetition and reinforcement of work-related concepts, workers will forget 50% of information within one hour, 70% within 24 hours, and 90% over a week.‚ÄúAugmented reality enables companies to pivot to deliver relevant digital information in-context to front-line workers as part of a digital transformation initiative. The less trainees are excessively [subjected to] to traditional ‚Äòjust-in-case‚Äô training programs and information is instead delivered through ‚Äòjust-in-time‚Äô methods to a worker in-situ, the greater the acquired knowledge is retained and seamlessly acted upon in real-world environments. The approximately 2.7 billion global desk-less workers can benefit now more than ever from information delivery on-demand and in-context to their work environment ‚Äòjust-in-time‚Äô rather than ‚Äòjust-in-case.‚Äô‚ÄùSaatchi: ‚ÄúAt [our company] we‚Äôre working on exciting virtual beings. As we‚Äôre exploring virtual beings, it‚Äôs exciting to see how immersive storytelling with AI can create two-way reciprocal relationships across various platforms, including AR.‚ÄùMontgomerie: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing increased buy-in for enterprise AR and we anticipate that trajectory to continue in the year ahead. The C-suite is now a part of the conversation in AR deployments as we‚Äôre seeing repeatable and consistent ROI numbers from various customers with similar use cases. AR can drive real business value and the industry now has the numbers to prove it, to the point where many Fortune 100 companies are taking notice and figuring out the right use cases for their business.‚ÄúI‚Äôm also looking forward to the improvement of some of the more technical aspects of AR as a driver for vastly improving the overall user experience. Toolkits are getting better, and object tracking is becoming more feasible as a result of improved computer vision algorithms and processor speeds.‚ÄúLastly, while we may have to wait a bit longer for the long-rumored Apple glasses, there‚Äôs no way that other electronics powerhouses will stand still now that the HoloLens 2 is available. We can expect competitive, next-gen AR/VR iterations from tech giants, as well as smaller, more niche players as they‚Äôre pushed to innovate or get left behind. As a result, competition and ubiquity will further expand AR potential in enterprise business and beyond.‚ÄùThe C-suite is now a part of the conversation in AR deployments as we‚Äôre seeing repeatable and consistent ROI numbers from various customers with similar use cases. AR can drive real business value and the industry now has the numbers to prove it- Scott Montgomerie, CEO of Scope ARKaplan: ‚ÄúThe AR industry is still evolving, and it‚Äôs clear that 2020 will be a year filled with exciting developments. One development that I can‚Äôt wait to see is the impact of 5G on AR industry-wide. With stronger connections and decreased latency, AR can be integrated into our everyday lives, optimizing its real-time applications and making a huge difference in society ‚Äî protecting drivers, keeping cities safe, and assisting public safety professionals.‚ÄùBentovim: ‚ÄúI am excited about the potential for non-app-based AR to finally come into the mainstream in 2020, I am aware of multiple non-public developments that hopefully emerge publically and become game-changers in 2020 and beyond. The need for apps is currently a major limitation in the adoption of phone-based AR and these developments when they are launched will have the potential to take Augmented reality to the masses.‚ÄùHayes: ‚Äú2020 will be the year that we‚Äôll see a tier-one consumer electronics company deliver an AR wearable product to the market that has had the right level of investment, thought process, and integrated technology. This is significant, [because] consumer launches indicate that the hardware is mature enough to be manufactured at prices that enable the mass market and software experiences are rich enough to support these products.‚ÄùLake: ‚ÄúFrom a device perspective, we‚Äôll see the first true breakthrough consumer smartglasses that achieve what we‚Äôve imagined in science fiction for decades ‚Äî design and form that matches the best traditional glasses. From a software perspective, consumers are craving the first ‚Äòkiller apps‚Äô of smartglasses that provide transformative experiences beyond what watches and phones can deliver.‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see the first hints of these introduced in 2020, with experiences that begin taking advantage of the unique form and perspective of smart glasses.

199,Even Lab-Grown Meat Won‚Äôt Save Us From a ‚ÄòTerrible Reckoning‚Äô,https://onezero.medium.com/even-lab-grown-meat-wont-save-us-from-a-terrible-reckoning-d749c7b5e006?source=extreme_main_feed---------202-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"Plato‚Äôs Republic, Socrates tells his fellow Athenian philosopher Glaucon that in order to feed the Greeks‚Äô nascent appetite for meat ‚Äî a luxury good in 375 B.C. ‚Äî they would need ever more territory to graze farmed animals. Glaucon is quick to point out that would ‚Äúcertainly‚Äù require going to war to obtain land for this purpose. New research has proven him correct.Rosa E. Ficek and Joshua Specht, historians at the University of Puerto Rico and Notre Dame, respectively, have shown that cattle ranching is indeed connected to colonial expansion: During European conquest of the Americas, cattle would be set off to roam in lands that settlers had no rightful claim to, creating the further pretext for military intervention. Specht, the author of Red Meat Republic, referred to the cattle that helped settle the American West as ‚Äúmobile colonizers‚Äù for their unique ability to fulfill Glaucon‚Äôs prophecy.Once the ‚Äúbuffaloes are exterminated,‚Äù Philip Sheridan, a Union general and a ‚Äúchief architect‚Äù of the Western expansion movement, said, ‚Äúyour prairies can be covered with speckled cattle, and the festive cowboy, who follows the hunter as the second forerunner of an advanced civilization.‚Äù In other words, after the buffalo were killed, Sheridan implied, so too would the indigenous people who relied on them ‚Äî and thus he appealed to the idyllic notion of America as a cow pasture. In this sense, cattle were intimately tied to the violence, growth and, crucially, the idea of the American frontier. As the land was settled, so was its diet ‚Äî which, Specht notes, with the help of new technologies like refrigeration and railroads, democratized the availability of cheap beef. This yoked notions of settler belonging to the consumption of meat grazed on freshly stolen land.The lust to seek new territory stemmed, at least in part, from the fact that Europe had used up many of its natural resources, and needed more to satisfy its hunger for more space. Today, half of the world‚Äôs habitable land is used for agriculture; and, of that, two-thirds is used for animal grazing ‚Äî an unsustainable portion, according to the UN‚Äôs International Panel on Climate Change. Yet when investors talk about ‚Äúthe food space‚Äù ‚Äî the marriage of industrial agriculture and Silicon Valley ‚Äî they are talking about another sort of future frontier that posits technological advances in food and science can reconcile plenary and dietary limits. With the success of fake meat burgers like Impossible and Beyond, which are available wherever meat is sold, cultured meat ‚Äî grown from cells in a lab ‚Äî remains not yet commercially viable.According to the anthropologist Benjamin Aldes Wurgaft, like the so-called New World, the promise of cultured meat could be the next frontier to promise bounty in the face of scarcity. ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòspace‚Äô has narrower and more specific historical connotations, conveying not mere dimensionality but also an intimation of the frontier,‚Äù he writes in his new book Meat Planet: Artificial Flesh and the Future of Food. And Wurgaft suggests that capitalism is always in search of new frontiers‚Äîbecause financiers need endless growth‚Äîif only to park their investment capital.The book focuses on the fraught promise of cultured meat, grown from cells in a bioreactor: The speculative, presumably almost-here sci-fi future of consuming not-quite-animal flesh. Like carnivores at a barbeque, mouths watering at the smell of grilled meats, Google‚Äôs Sergey Brin and PayPalantir‚Äôs Peter Thiel have gotten a whiff of cultured meat ‚Äî putting their fortunes behind an emerging technology Brin says is ‚Äúon the cusp of viability.‚ÄùMeat Planet opens with Dutch medical doctor and physiology professor Mark Post‚Äôs unveiling of his $300,000 ‚Äútest-tube‚Äù burger in 2013. The launch video for the burger-ish concoction lays out the allure of cultured meat: It will allow humans to continue consuming as much cooked flesh as we want while simultaneously avoiding what environmentalist Ken Cook dubs a ‚Äúterrible reckoning‚Äù with the challenges posed by climate change.Invoking the image of speckled cattle on the frontier, Brin says on screen that the ‚Äúvision in our minds‚Äù of a ‚Äúpristine farm‚Äù isn‚Äôt ‚Äúactually how meat gets produced today.‚Äù Animals are pumped with antibiotics; they live in cramped, cruel conditions, require some 70% of the world‚Äôs arable farmland, and ungodly amounts of water ‚Äî all while their feces create lagoons that damage the air and water that poor and marginalized people need to breathe and drink. Meanwhile, meat consumption accounts for some 14%‚Äì18% percent of global carbon emissions and global carnivory is expected to double by 2050. Unless everyone becomes vegetarian, which Brin and Post think is unlikely, there is only one way to square the problem: Another frontier.Once again, a new food space could save us.the case of the American frontier, the land was there for the grazing ‚Äî the only thing that stood in the colonizers‚Äô way was its original inhabitants. When it comes to the food space, however, climate change is ongoing and can‚Äôt be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù with musket fire. Yet cultured meat ‚Äî ‚Äúon the cusp of viability‚Äù ‚Äî remains elusive at best, with a delivery date remaining just beyond the horizon. As the writer Charlotte Shane notes in an incisive essay on meat consumption, cultured meat is ‚Äúa beguiling dream because it frees us from reliance on the near-useless tools of guilt and willpower and suggests the future can be improved without any sacriÔ¨Åces.‚Äù The same faith is reflected in the pining for geoengineering or space travel. Of course, it is easier to dream that we could innovate our way out of ecological limits than reckon with a problem once articulated in The Republic.Wurgaft knows this. Throughout the book, he probes at the question of reducing meat consumption, at one point noting that ‚Äúhumans seem to enjoy eating meat, but they have no obvious nutritional need for it, as evidenced by the millions of healthy vegetarians in the world.‚Äù Wurgaft‚Äôs book, in many ways, is a philosophical inquiry into the question of whether humans should kill and eat animals at all. His contention is that we have to take the technology, and the food that could potentially stem from it, philosophically seriously. The book cites many philosophers ‚Äî from Marx to Peter Singer ‚Äî and contains two chapters on Greek gods, one on cannibalism, and none on vegetarianism. Although Wurgaft understands intellectually that factory farming is morally indefensible and that massive dietary shifts are required to weather climate change, he remains seduced by the idea that cultured meat could live up to its potential.‚ÄúCultured meat stands to alleviate the suffering of food animals packed together at industrial scale and to reduce the massive environmental bootstamp of industrial animal agriculture, not to mention eliminating zoonotic diseases that proliferate in microbial feedlot ponds,‚Äù he enthuses, before catching himself by noting, ‚Äúthose are problems themselves symptomatic of deeper civilizational troubles.‚ÄùCultured meat is often buoyed by the idea that, ‚Äúhuman evolution‚Ä¶ is intimately tied to meat,‚Äù as Richard Wrangham, a Harvard anthropologist of biology and lab meat supporter, put it. Wrangham suggests that cooking meat is what ‚Äúenabled us to have big brains.‚Äù Wurgaft is quick to point out that this thinking is dubious.Wrangham‚Äôs own, earlier, book Catching Fire, Wurgaft notes, argues our development isn‚Äôt tied to meat consumption itself ‚Äî many species consume raw meat ‚Äî but cooking.‚ÄúMany of the distinct evolutionary claims made on behalf of meat come less from material evidence‚Ä¶ and more from modern human physiology,‚Äù he writes. In other words, that humans somehow require meat to nourish their brains or for any other reason, is bunk science at best.To counter the idea that meat plays a necessary dietary role for humans, Wurgaft points to a different theory. Drawing from the anthropologist Nick Fiddes‚Äô book, Meat: A Natural Symbol, Wurgaft posits ‚Äúthat the most important function of meat in human life is not dietary at all. Rather, meat symbolizes our control over the natural world, our dominance over the rest of Animalia, our distance from the ‚Äòlower orders.‚Äô‚ÄùSeen through this prism, the centrality of meat in the American diet ‚Äî which is being adopted at an impressive scale throughout the world ‚Äî was socially constructed by people who owned cattle ranches built on stolen land. The presumed demands of that diet, in turn, became the rationale to build a massively unsustainable industrial food system. Meat‚Äôs ‚Äúnaturalness‚Äù is a relic from a time when colonialism, slavery, and domination over nature were not frowned upon but encouraged. I couldn‚Äôt help but think of a line from the French poet Aim√© C√©saire‚Äôs iconic Discourse on Colonialism (1955):Colonization‚Ä¶ dehumanizes the civilized man; that colonial activity, colonial enterprise, colonial conquest, which is based on contempt for the native and justified by that contempt, inevitably tends to change him who undertakes it; that the colonizer, who in order to ease his conscience gets into the habit of seeing the other man as an animal, accustoms himself to treating him like an animal, and tends to objectively transform himself into an animal.C√©saire calls this ‚Äúthe boomerang effect of colonization.‚Äù As I was reading Meat Planet, the boomerang effect of colonization was happening in real time, as fires stoked the Australian brush, propelled, at least in part, from the destabilization of the climate by British colonial coal mining.Many of Australia‚Äôs early settlements in ‚Äúthe brush‚Äù (which is smoldering as I write this), like the American frontier, were rooted in agribusiness ‚Äî cattle ranching. As many as 1 billion animals have died from the fires, including tens of thousands of cattle. In this sense, climate change poses an even greater boomerang effect: one that reminds humans that we are animals, like cattle, who must escape the flames wrought by ‚Äúcolonial enterprise.‚ÄùThe ‚Äúterrible reckoning‚Äù has arrived, and cultured meat remains, per Wurgaft, ‚Äúan abstraction,‚Äù a frontier just out of reach.WRITTEN BY"

201,JavaScript Can Be A Little Weird At Times,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/javascript-can-be-a-little-weird-at-times-7bafa7a2ab54?source=extreme_main_feed---------204-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"JavaScript is a great language that has become a lot more popular over the last few years. Due to its simple syntax and the large ecosystem, it‚Äôs a great language to start with for beginners.At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with a lot of tricky parts. At times we laugh about all of these tricky situations, but some of them can quickly turn your day job into a hell.We‚Äôll be going over a list of five of these funny and tricky JavaScript examples in this article, to show you that JavaScript can be a little weird at times ‚Äî and most of the time without good reason.As we all know NaN stands for ‚Äúnot a number‚Äù. But if we take a closer look into it, is it really not a number? Let‚Äôs take a look at the following example.As you can see NaN is of the type number. Well, sometimes it‚Äôs not in the name I guess‚Ä¶Both [] and null are objects. We can verify that with the following piece of code:However, once we use instanceof to check if null is an object we get returned a false.The answer to this weird behavior lies in the way the typeof function works.Wait, what? Let‚Äôs read that again. Math.max is less than Math.min? That makes absolutely no sense.We‚Äôve probably all used the Math.min and Math.max function at least once in our lives. When you pass in some parameters to the min and max function they both work fine ‚Äî everything works as expected.But once you leave out the parameters things tend to change a little bit. And not for the better. Once you pass no parameters to Math.min and Math.max function tend to return Inifinity and -Inifinity, respectively.The following expressions seem to introduce a contradiction. When comparing null to 0 using the equal or greater than operator both return false. But when combining these operators true will be returned.That makes no sense, right?An array is a truthy value. However, it‚Äôs not equal to true.And the same applies to null ‚Äî null is falsy, but not false.Did you know that all of these kinds of weird things existed in JavaScript? You can really break your head over them once you stumble upon one of these things. Although, sometimes it might be better to just laugh about them.I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve probably run into one of these weird things yourself. Please, feel free to share them.If you want to know more about weird little JavaScript tricks, I‚Äôve got good news for you. There is an entire GitHub repository with a lot more interesting tricks ‚Äî which I‚Äôve used for this article as well.WRITTEN BY"
202,Webpack 5 Federation: A game changer in JavaScript architecture,https://medium.com/@ScriptedAlchemy/webpack-5-module-federation-a-game-changer-to-javascript-architecture-bcdd30e02669?source=extreme_main_feed---------205-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"A scalable solution to sharing code between independent applications has never been convenient, and near impossible at scale. The closest we had was externals or DLLPlugin, forcing centralized dependency on a external file. It was a hassle to share code, the separate applications were not truly standalone and usually, a limited number of dependencies are shared. Moreover, sharing actual feature code or components between separately bundled applications is unfeasible, unproductive, and unprofitable.It‚Äôs a type of JavaScript architecture I invented and prototyped. Then with the help of my co-creator and the founder of Webpack ‚Äî it was turned into one of the most exciting features in the Webpack 5 core (there‚Äôs some cool stuff in there, and the new API is really powerful and clean).I‚Äôm proud to present, a long awaited leap forward in JavaScript application architecture. Our contribution to the open-source community, Module FederationModule federation allows a JavaScript application to dynamically load code from another application ‚Äî in the process, sharing dependencies, if an application consuming a federated module does not have a dependency needed by the federated code ‚Äî Webpack will download the missing dependency from that federated build origin.Code is shared if it can be, but fallbacks exist in each case. Federated code can always load its dependencies but will attempt to use the consumers‚Äô dependencies before downloading more payload. Less code duplication, dependency sharing just like a monolithic Webpack build. While I may have invented this initial system ‚Äî It was co-authored into Webpack 5 by myself (Zack Jackson) and Marais Rossouw with lots of guidance, pair-programming, and assistance from Tobias Koppers. These engineers played a key role in rewriting and stabilizing Module Federation within Webpack 5 core. Thank you for the continued collaboration and support.For those who want a more digestible version of this article, Jack Herrington made one!It‚Äôs important to note that this system is designed so that each completely standalone build/app can be in its own repository, deployed independently, and run as its own independent SPA.These applications are all bi-directional hosts. Any application that‚Äôs loaded first, becomes a host ‚Äî as you change routes and move through an application, loading federated modules in the same way you would implement dynamic imports. However if you were to refresh the page, whatever application first starts on that load, becomes a host.Let‚Äôs say each page of a website is deployed and compiled independently. I want this micro-frontend style architecture but do not want and page reloads when changing routes, I also want to dynamically share code & vendors between them so it‚Äôs just as efficient as if it was one large Webpack build, with code splitting.Landing on the home page app would make the ‚Äúhome‚Äù page the ‚Äúhost‚Äù, if you browse to an ‚Äúabout‚Äù page, the host (home page spa) is actually dynamically importing a module from another independent application (the about page spa). It doesn‚Äôt load the main entry point and another entire application. Only a few kilobytes of code. If I am on the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page and refresh the browser. The ‚Äúabout‚Äù page becomes the ‚Äúhost‚Äù and browsing back to the home page again would be a case of the about page ‚Äúhost‚Äù Fetching a fragment of runtime from a ‚Äúremote‚Äù ‚Äî the home page. All applications are both remote and host, consumable and consumers of any other federated module in the system.Read more on the technical aspects on GitHub:Let us start out with three standalone applications.Configuration:I'm going to use the app container <App> from App One. It will be consumed by other applications. To do so, I expose Its App as AppContainer
App One will also consume components from two other federated applications. To do so, I specify the remotes scopeSetting up build orchestration:In the head of my applications, I load app_one_remote.js ‚Äî this connects you to other Webpack runtimes and provisions the orchestration layer at runtime, its a specially designed Webpack runtime and entry point. Its not a normal application entry point and is only a few KBConsuming code from a remoteApp One has a page that consumes a dialog component from App TwoAnd the router looks pretty standard:Configuration:App Two will expose Dialog, enabling App One to consume it. App Two will also consume App One‚Äôs <App> ‚Äî so we specify app_one as a remote. Showcasing bi-directional hostsConsumption:Heres what the root App looks like:Heres what the default page looks like, that uses Dialog.As expected, App Three looks similar. However, it does not consume the <App> from App One working more as a standalone, self-running component (no navigation or sidebar). As such, it does not specify any remotesPay close attention to the network tab. The code is being federated across three different servers. Three different bundles. In general, id recommends against federating the whole application container unless you are taking advantage of SSR or progressive loading. The concept, however, is extraordinarily powerful.There is little to no dependency duplication. Through the shared option ‚Äî remotes will depend on host dependencies, if the host does not have a dependency, the remote will download its own. No code duplication, but built-in redundancy.While manually adding vendors or other modules to shared is not ideal at scale. This can be easily automated with a custom-written function, or with a supplemental Webpack plugin. We do plan to release AutomaticModuleFederationPlugin and maintain it from outside of the Webpack Core. Now that we have built first-class code federation support into Webpack, extending its capabilities is trivial.Now for the big question‚Ä¶ Does any of this work with SSR??We have designed this to be Universal Module Federation works in any environment. Server-side rendering federated code is completely possible. Just have server builds use a commonjs library target. There are various ways to achieve federated SSR. S3 Streaming, ESI, automate an npm publish to consume server variants. I plan to use a commonly shared file volume or async S3 streaming to stream files across the filesystem. Enabling the server to require federated code just like it happens in the browser. Using fs instead of http to load federated code.‚ÄúModule Federation does also work with target: ""node"". Instead of URLs pointing to the other micro-frontends, here file paths are used which point to the other micro-frontends. That way you can do SSR with the same codebase and a different webpack config for building for node.js. The same properties stay true for Module Federation in node.js: e. g. Separate builds, Separate deploys‚Äù ‚Äî Tobias KoppersFederation requires Webpack 5‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich Next doesn‚Äôt officially support. However‚Ä¶ i did manage to fork and upgrade Next.js to work with Webpack 5! It‚Äôs still a work in progress, some development mode middleware needs finishing touches. Production mode is working, some additional loaders still need to be re-tested.I‚Äôd love the opportunity to share more about this technology. If you want to use Module Federation or Federated architecture, we would hear about your experience And changes with current architecture. We also would love opportunities to speak about it on Podcasts, meetups, or corporations. Reach me on TwitterYou can also get hold of my co-creator, follow us for the latest updated on Module Federation, FOSA (Federation of Standalone Applications) Architecture, and other tools we are creating ‚Äî designed to work with Federated ApplicationsThe community has had an enthusiastic response! My co-creators time, along with my own has been heavily focused on writing this into Webpack 5. We hope some code samples will help while we finalize some remaining features and write some documentation.As we have the bandwidth, we will create SSR examples and more comprehensive demos. If anyone wants to build something that can be used as a demo ‚Äî we gladly will accept pull requests back to webpack-external-importWRITTEN BY"
203,What NFL 7-Seeds Would Have Made the Playoffs the Last 10 Years?,https://medium.com/sportsraid/nfl-seven-seed-playoffs-last-ten-years-7-seed-7seed-football-pittsburgh-steelers-decade-hypothetical-8eac8ea6ab83?source=extreme_main_feed---------206-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"T
HE NFL PASSED ITS NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SUNDAY, by the slimmest of margins. The new 10-year CBA agreement means an increase in the salary cap, a 17-game regular season schedule beginning in 2021, and an expanded NFL playoff field to seven teams in each conference, 14 in all, effective immediately.I‚Äôve already written about the merits for and against the new expanded playoff format. It wouldn‚Äôt have been my choice, but it‚Äôs the world we have now. This is a big win for 7-seeds, who now have a shot, and a huge win for 1-seeds, who get much better protection en route to the Super Bowl. It‚Äôs a massive loss for 2-seeds, who lose a bye week and get a much steeper playoff path against a potentially hot last team in.This year, a 14-team NFL playoff would have meant the Los Angeles Rams and Pittsburgh Steelers made the field. Who else would have made the playoffs over the last decade ‚Äî and would it have even mattered?We start with a bang as Sean McVay‚Äôs Rams sneak in after a disappointing campaign. The team started 3‚Äì0 before losing three straight and falling out of the playoffs as Jared Goff took a major step backwards and Todd Gurley never got going. Still, this was one of the most talented teams in football, and they‚Äôd have been a very tough out against the 2-seed Packers. A Rams win sends them to San Francisco, a team L.A. just played down to the final play on the road in Week 16. It also means the Saints host a conference semifinal instead of traveling to Green Bay, and they‚Äôd host the NFC Conference Championship too if the Rams won again and set up a rematch of last season. Juicy.The AFC is less exciting, with only one non-playoff team even at .500. The Steelers started the year with three straight losses and ended with three more, going 8‚Äì2 in between when we temporarily thought they were good. We were robbed of starting playoff quarterback Duck Hodges, who threw for under 100 yards in each of his final two starts. And I do mean final, like, in his career.The Vikings had the playoffs in their hands but lost at home to the feckless backup Bears. What if Minnesota had rested Dalvin Cook et al instead and been healthy to face the Rams in a playoff game? Sounds nice until you remember the Week 4 Thursday night game when Jared Goff hit every pass he ever wanted against this Minnesota defense.Guess who‚Äôs back? This year‚Äôs Steelers team would have been far more interesting. Remember Ben Roethlisberger? How about Antonio Brown? Can I interest you in JuJu Smith-Schuster and James Conner on breakout campaigns? Pittsburgh sneaks in on the strength of a Week 1 tie against Cleveland, and now they‚Äôre off to 2-seed New England for a massive opening round salvo. Remember, those Patriots won the Super Bowl. Might the Steelers have ended the dynasty a year early? Could that have opened the door for a Chiefs title one year earlier, and for a Super Bowl rematch of that incredible 54‚Äì51 Chiefs-Rams game?The Lions win a three-way tie with the Cowboys and Seahawks (sorry, TV execs!) on the basis of conference win percentage and head to Minnesota, where they won on the road in Week 4. Could Detroit have knocked out the Vikings and saved me from my misery in the NFC Championship against the Eagles? Maybe, but we‚Äôll always have the Minneapolis Miracle.The Ravens tied the Titans, Bills, and Chargers at 9‚Äì7 but finished third among those rankings, missing out while Tennessee and Buffalo danced, after a distatrous Week 17 Baltimore collapse against the Bengals. Now they‚Äôre in, and they‚Äôre off to a rivalry playoff matchup in Pittsburgh. Joe Flacco and the road Ravens had done it plenty of times before. Might they have done it again? And if they had, would Baltimore still have traded up in the draft a few months later to take future MVP Lamar Jackson??Jameis Winston, playoff quarterback. What a world it might have been. The Bucs head to Atlanta where they upset the Falcons in Week 1, temporarily throwing us off the scent of a Matt Ryan MVP campaign and a would-be Super Bowl win that was 28‚Äì3 away.Did you know the Titans have gone 9‚Äì7 four straight years? It‚Äôs true, still a current streak. How do you win nine games every year without ever being relevant? We might have remembered these Titans. They head to Kansas City, a team they just beat on the road in December. And by the way, this also gives Marcus Mariota a playoff start. Our top two draft picks from 2015 both get their first playoff start, maybe one of them even gets a win. Instead both of them are homeless, looking for new jobs this offseason.These Falcons started 6‚Äì1 before imploding on a six-game losing streak despite one of the all-time great receiving seasons from Julio Jones. They would‚Äôve gotten destroyed by Carson Palmer‚Äôs Cardinals.Our first 10-win team! The Jets lost out on the common-games tiebreaker to the Steelers, but this team was legitimately good. Their +73 point differential ranked 8th in the NFL and Todd Bowles had this defense balling. The Jets would‚Äôve been a very tricky opponent for the rival Patriots as a team that‚Äôs upset Bill Belichick more than a few times over the years. But then we might not have gotten that one last great Brady-Manning battle in the AFC Championship.Justice is served as the 10‚Äì6 Eagles make the playoffs, when in the real world they sat out watching while the 7‚Äì8‚Äì1 Panthers hosted a home game. And these aren‚Äôt just any Philadelphia Eagles. These were Chip Kelly‚Äôs Eagles, who scored 30+ points nine times that season on the second-highest scoring team in the league. You don‚Äôt want to see Chip Kelly in an NFL playoff game?This would‚Äôve been a crazy Week 17 finish, as the Texans win the conference-record tiebreaker to get in over the 9‚Äì7 Chiefs, Chargers, and Bills. That means Case Keenum starting in the playoffs after beginning his career 0‚Äì8 the previous season. And you know what happens when Case Keenum‚Äôs in the playoffs, right?Maybe Bruce Arians would still be in Arizona had his Cards not gotten robbed of these playoff berths. This team won seven of its final nine games and would have been no picnic for the 2-seed Panthers. They were more defense than offense, with Patrick Patterson and Tyrann Mathieu leading an absurdly talented secondary at the peak of their powers.Would you have guessed the Steelers would benefit more than anyone else from this new expanded playoff format? That‚Äôs three extra playoff appearances in the last seven seasons for Pittsburgh, though this version of the team wasn‚Äôt very good. They‚Äôd have won a four-way tiebreaker against the Ravens, Jets, and Dolphins, and all of them would‚Äôve lost to the Patriots anyway.Maybe Lovie Smith keeps his job if the Bears make the playoffs. Maybe he should have anyway. This was one of those many Chicago teams with a ridiculous defense and no real offense. Maybe the best defense ever to miss the playoffs, #1 in the league by a mile. Think Brian Urlacher, Julius Peppers, Charles Tillman, and Lance Briggs on one end but Jay Cutler and Brandon Marshall on the other. Ahh, memories.Guess who? These 8‚Äì8 Steelers were actually pretty dangerous, considering Ben Roethlisberger was healthy after missing three games injured and that this team had the #1 defense in the league by yards allowed. They might have given the Patriots a real scare, not to mention this expanded playoff format would mean the Steelers are currently on an 11-year playoff streak. This team hasn‚Äôt finished under .500 since 2003. Incredible.Okay, yeah, Lovie Smith definitely would‚Äôve kept his job awhile longer. Lovie‚Äôs Bears won 7+ games in eight straight seasons before he was fired. They‚Äôve gone over .500 once in seven years since. I guess Joni Mitchell was right. You really don‚Äôt know what you got til it‚Äôs gone. They paved paradise, and put up a Mitch Trubisky.Apparently the Titans just always go 9‚Äì7 without anyone noticing. These Titans were extremely forgettable, even by Tennessee standards. They missed the playoffs because of a head-to-head loss to Andy Dalton‚Äôs Bengals.This might be the best team on the entire list. The Giants ranked top-7 in yardage on both offense and defense, and they were the league‚Äôs #1 third-down defense. And the NFC was there for the taking. The 1-seed 13‚Äì3 Falcons got punked in their first playoff game, and the 2-seed Bears laid an egg in the NFC Championship. Could Eli Manning have gone 4‚Äì0 on the road one again, robbing Aaron Rodgers of his only title, taking down Big Ben for another ring? Would Elisha Nelson Manning be a three-time Super Bowl champion?!Actually, the Chargers might have been even better. Their +119 point differential ranked fifth in the entire NFL, and they had the profile of a 10.9-win team and led the league in yardage on both offense and defense, even without a single player over 800 rushing or receiving yards. Darren Sproles racked up 2210 all-purpose yards. This was the last time the Patriots lost their first game, against Mark Sanchez and the Jets. Could Philip Rivers have played Eli Manning in a Super Bowl? Could the Chargers still be in San Diego?? Guess we‚Äôll never know‚Ä¶So that‚Äôs 10 years of NFL 7-seeds.

For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.very day over the past few weeks, our thoughts have turned constantly to you, our friends and colleagues around the world. We have been in awe of your determination, courage, and sacrifices in the face of Covid-19, a global crisis the likes of which none of us have seen in our lifetimes. From Wuhan to Lombardy to cities and towns across the United States and beyond, we have watched doctors, nurses, and an array of health care workers racing to save lives under extraordinary circumstances. A growing number have even lost their own lives to protect their patients and all of humanity.One image sticks in our minds: a resident physician just a few months shy of graduation, clad in full protective gear, saluting the camera as she starts her day in the ICU. Few of us could have anticipated when we entered this profession that we would be going to war with a virus that threatens millions of lives.Over the past few weeks, we have heard countless stories of colleagues and friends around the world who are displaying breathtaking bravery in the face of Covid-19. When we worked alongside you over the years, we would often say we were ‚Äúin the trenches.‚Äù At no time has that felt more true than right now. Today, you stand on the front lines of the most daunting pandemic the world has faced in more than a century. In the face of this overwhelming threat, we know you are confronting new challenges, responsibilities, and stresses. We recognize the new risks you are taking on: the fear of getting sick or, even worse, getting your family sick. And these worries are made even more acute by the horrifying fact that many of you labor without the personal protective equipment you need and deserve.Yet you are showing up anyway. You are racing to triage a flood of critically ill patients. You are searching for medical supplies that are scarce, or even making them yourself. You are caring for anxious outpatients who still very much need you and want to know if they will be okay. You are volunteering to work extra shifts or to be assigned on a dedicated Covid-19 service because you know you are needed. As hospitals close to visitors, you are filling the role of family members and chaplains to hold people‚Äôs hands and be with them at the end. Through it all, you are putting on a brave face for your patients amid your own fear, weariness, frustration, and sorrow. Despite the unprecedented challenges of the moment, you are choosing to honor the oaths we took when we entered the profession.We want you to know the effect your actions are having on the world. Your courage is mobilizing people in all corners to ask what they can do to respond to this pandemic. Billions of people worldwide are staying home to do their part and give our health care system a fighting chance. People are sewing masks, manufacturing gowns, and donating their home stash of gloves to support you. Around dinner tables, in newsrooms, and in the halls of Congress and parliaments, people are in awe of your sacrifices. You are showing all of us who we can be in our very best moments.In the weeks and months ahead, we will all be tested as a profession and as a human race. And we will need you more than ever. For that reason, as difficult as these times may be, we hope you can take small opportunities to take care of yourself whenever possible. Keep in close contact with the people most dear to you, even if that contact is by phone or through a screen or glass window. Give yourself moments of solitude away from the news, social media, and responsibilities at home. Allow yourself permission to experience and show your emotions, recognizing that your ability to be honest and vulnerable is evidence of strength, not weakness. Support each other, knowing that you are all in this together and that there are, and will be, many moments of struggle. Most of all, have compassion for yourself ‚Äî for your fallibility and your humanity.You have shown our nation and our world what it means to care for and sacrifice for others, to truly serve. You remind us that in moments of crisis, we have a choice. We can retreat to our corners and fend for ourselves. Or, with hands outstretched and hearts wide open, we can reach out and lift each other up.We cannot think of a time when we were more humbled and proud to be associated with our profession. For generations, society has looked to its medical professionals, not only for healing, but also for moral leadership. You are providing both to a world that is afraid and hurting.Long after all of this is over, the story of the heroic response to this pandemic will be documented in history books, shared in stories handed down from generation to generation, and taught in classrooms across the globe. And that story will largely be about you: the brave men and women who went to battle with an enemy that threatened the world and sacrificed so much for the greater good. If we keep this story close to our hearts, if we remember the courage on display in ERs, ICUs, and clinics, we may very well emerge stronger and with a greater commitment to our shared humanity than when this journey began.As clinicians, we may come from different backgrounds and specialties, but our values are singular. Our commitment is clear. And in this moment more than ever, our hearts truly do beat as one.Thank you for choosing to be a healer. We are so proud of you. We are so grateful for you. And we, along with so many others worldwide, are praying for you, for your health, safety, and strength in the long days ahead.With love and solidarity,Vivek and AliceWRITTEN BY"

For more info about the coronavirus, see cdc.gov.‚ÄúLoneliness comes with life.‚Äù ‚Äî Whitney Houston‚ÄúI
can‚Äôt remember the last time I touched someone,‚Äù my friend messaged.Single, she lived alone and ‚Äî now ‚Äî working from home, with weeks of social isolation stretching out in front, she was struggling. ‚ÄúThis is not much fun by yourself,‚Äù she said.She was sleeping badly and her mind wouldn‚Äôt shut down. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to get through this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHow are you supposed to cope when you‚Äôre a bubble of one?‚ÄùI wasn‚Äôt sure how to comfort her. Because it slapped me with the reality of social isolation for people who are on their own: that is, the increased risk to their mental health.Most loneliness is temporary ‚Äî but pandemic loneliness poses a different kind of threat because alongside the loss of meaningful physical connection, we‚Äôre dealing with an upswing in general anxiety.People on their own are often spared from chronic loneliness by their friends or work colleagues, or random chats with their neighbours, barista or anyone who passes through their world. Even just SEEING other people is a means of connecting, of feeling part of the world.But when they‚Äôre denied those little connections ‚Äî not to mention the chance to download‚Äî they tend to internalise their thoughts and feelings. To worry; to ruminate. And that can lead to sleep difficulties, racing minds, cognitive distortions, physiological symptoms of anxiety or unexplained health problems and, ultimately, depression.Loneliness is caused by the distress felt at a lack of meaningful relationships. We all experience loneliness from time to time, but think about what it‚Äôs like to be holed up at home, stripped of your usual social outlets or activities ‚Äî and without someone to you a hug, make you a cuppa or listen to the ordinary contents of your day. AND when you go out for a walk, even strangers step aside to avoid you.If that‚Äôs your struggle right now, here are some ways to reverse the tide, at least until lockdown is lifted. And if you know someone who‚Äôs on their own, reach out. Send a text. Pick up the phone. Smile at a stranger. Your kindness may also save a life.You‚Äôre allowed to do that. In most cases, being on your own in a lockdown is harder than not. So acknowledge and have a little wallow in your loneliness, even if it‚Äôs only to yourself. But keep a boundary around how long you do it for. And when time‚Äôs up, go do something.Wake up at random times and ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù at your peril ‚Äî more often than not, it‚Äôll leave you feeling lost and flat. Instead, sit down every evening and make a plan (list) for the next day. Include the usual components of your life: work/emails, leisure/fun, learning, chores, exercise, catching up with friends or family. Then, your day has a framework: from the moment you get up, you know what to do. Even if you‚Äôre tired, follow the plan.Scheduling is even more important during lockdown because it anchors us, gives us focus and allows us a tiny sense of achievement at the end of the day. And it stops us from being led entirely by our feelings which is risky when you are feeling low.Create a dedicated work space and work there. Break your work into manageable chunks. Schedule and take breaks. When you‚Äôre on your own it‚Äôs tempting to keep working in the evening. You can, obviously, but having work on a drip is not healthy. Have a way of ‚Äúmarking‚Äù the end of your working day. For example, close and tidy away your laptop, get changed, go for a walk.Music is great for uplifting your spirits. So find a way to involve it in your day ‚Äî somehow. If you dance at the same time, take a double tick: you‚Äôre also achieving your exercise goal. And it may help you sleep too.Social media is the biggest and best of them. Spend too much time there and you‚Äôll wind up feeling like EVERYONE who ‚Äúhas someone‚Äù is doing better in self-isolation better than you. They‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre arguing, they‚Äôre stressing, they‚Äôre bored, they‚Äôre worried. And, even if they‚Äôre not, you don‚Äôt need to think about that. Focus on making yourself feel okay.Schedule your news views too ‚Äî twice a day is enough. Constant checking for updates (which are usually just more of the same) will keep your anxiety humming.Do one thing every day that makes you feel good OR peaceful. Take a bath or a walk, hang with your cats/dog, meditate, do yoga or an online exercise class, journal or write, read, draw, paint, do crafts or puzzles, make things, listen to audio books or podcasts or music (see above). Avoid self-flagellation at all costs: if it doesn‚Äôt make you feel good or calm, it doesn‚Äôt count.By Zoom or Houseparty, phone or even text message. Schedule catch ups with them if you can. Just aim to have one human interaction ‚Äî and to hear your own voice ‚Äî every day.When you go for a walk (as you should) smile or wave at ‚Äî or say hi to ‚Äî strangers. Some people won‚Äôt smile back; for some reason, infectious diseases make some people suspicious of everything and everyone. But eye contact is contagious ‚Äî in a good way. It‚Äôs a way of making a human connection. If the stranger doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcatch‚Äù yours back, shrug it off ‚Äî they might be having a tougher time of lockdown than you.Everyone‚Äôs having the odd bad day at the moment ‚Äî days when the kids fight, the house is a mess, their anxiety spikes, they can‚Äôt find what they need at the supermarket, they get NOTHING done. You‚Äôll have them too. But it doesn‚Äôt have to mean the next day will be bad too. So when you‚Äôve had a rough one, reset your plan, get up and keep trying. Tell yourself you can make it okay again.It may be hard to do this on a bad day, but there are benefits to being in a solo bubble. You can do what you want ‚Äî when you want. You don‚Äôt have to keep everyone around you calm or positive or doing schoolwork or entertained. You don‚Äôt have tidy up their crap or do their dishes. You can have popcorn for dinner. You can play your own music ‚Äî and sing and dance without critique. You can watch your favourite shows all night. The only fight you‚Äôll have is with yourself. And, even though comparison is a dumb idea, it‚Äôs worth remembering a lot of people would give an awful lot for that.Thanks for reading!

206,10 things you‚Äôre doing wrong in Java,https://towardsdatascience.com/10-things-youre-doing-wrong-in-java-7608e2f050c7?source=extreme_main_feed---------209-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"In my career I‚Äôve interviewed dozens of software engineers, from juniors to senior technical leaders. And in many cases candidates had gaps in the basic concepts.In this article I‚Äôm going to put in a list the most common mistakes Java developers do, based on my experience both as Technical Leader and interviewer.Don‚Äôt ask me why, but candidates often forget the scope of the protected access modifier in Java. In may be the anxiety and tension accumulated during the interview, but typically they mention just one of the two:Also, the scope at package level helps a lot developers on writing their own tests: protected methods can be accessed from your test classpath. So forgetting this property is equivalent to declare during an interview to have never written a test!If you use == (comparison operator) instead of anequals() call, then you have to change your habits because the result may surprise you.Never use == when you want to compare two Strings and in general almost any object. == just compares the object reference of the two operands (memory address comparison) and not their content.In the above example the string y doesn‚Äôt benefit of String Interning: its memory address is different from the address of x.If you work with a large number of Strings or with huge Strings , you may waste a lot of memory in the concatenation process.In the above example, you are creating several StringBuilder and String objects: 10.000.000 StringBuilder and 10.000.001 String, to be precise!In order to understand what is going on, we have to take a step back.When you use + operator for String concatenation, you are creating a intermediary object that stores the result of the concatenation before assigning its value to the target object.In the above example we have created a total of 3 objects: 2 for the literals and 1 for the concatenation, that is the copy of the first String result plus the second one "" world!"". This happens because Strings are immutable.But the compiler is smart enough to transforms the code into the following (not applicable for java 9+, because it uses StringContactFacotry but the result is pretty similar)This optimization removes the intermediary concatenation object and the memory is occupied by 2 String literals and 1 StringBuilder. In general, the number of String objects drops from O(n¬≤) to O(n).Back to the first example, the compiler optimizes the code like thisThe compiler just optimizes the inner concatenation, but this is creating a lot of StringBuilder and String objects! The right way to concatenate Strings is the following and requires just 1 StringBuilder and 1 StringNot a bad improvement!Storing passwords provided by users in a String object is a security issue, because they are vulnerable to memory attacks.You should use char[] , as JPasswordField and Password4j are already doing. If we are talking of web applications, most web containers pass the plain text password in the HttpServletRequest object as String, so in this case there‚Äôs almost nothing you can do about it.Strings are cached by the JVM (interning) and stored in the PermGen space (before Java 8) or in the heap space. In both cases the cached values are removed only after the garbage collection occurs: this means that you don‚Äôt know when a specific value is deleted from the String pool, since the Garbage Collector acts non-deterministically.The other problem is that Strings are immutable, so you cannot clear them. char[] however is not immutable and can be erased (e.g. substitute each element with a 0) after processing it. With this simple trick the attacker would find just zeroed arrays in memory instead of plain text passwords.How many times I have found methods like this:The problem of returning null is that you are forcing the caller on doing a null check on the result; In this case, the caller is expecting that if there is no item then an empty list would be returned.You always want to return either an exception or a special object (like an empty list) or the application using your code will be affected by NullPointerExceptions.On the other side, passing null means you are taking for granted that the code you are calling can manage a null. If this is not true, your application is going to throw a NullPointerException for sure.Also you are generating a lot of confusion in your code when you pass explicitly null. The following is a classic exampleWhen init() is called, there is no User object available. So why calling a method that operates with User if you don‚Äôt even have a singleUser? If you need the logic contained in grantAccessToUser() you should extract it in a different method and use it rather than passing a null.The following example may cause performance loss in your system:Pattern.compile() is a heavy method and it should not be called every time you need to check if a string matches the same pattern.Pattern.compile() pre-compiles the pattern so that a faster in-memory representation is used. This operation requires a non negligible amount of computational power, compared to a single match.A classic way to gain performance is to cache the Pattern object in a static field like this:This solution should be used every time you are re-using the same heavy-to-compute stateless object.In some way exceptions are felt as evil by developers and they tend to write methods that return weird values instead, like -1 or ""C_ERR"".This is a typical case where is worth creating a custom Exception. The example may be then rewritten like this:As you can see, readability and maintainability is hugely increased. The caller doesn‚Äôt have to handle each single return code but just to read the content of the DeviceStartException.This code will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.Removing an item from a list while iterating on it, make the list iterator behave badly, e.g. by skipping elements, repeating elements, indexing off the end of the array, etc. That‚Äôs why many collections prefer to throw a ConcurrentModificationException.You should use the iterator of the underlying array instead:This example create a lot of overhead due to the synchronized nature of StringBuffer. In more complex contexts, readers could be led to believe that synchronization is required where actually it isn‚Äôt.If you find a StringBuffer in a project, it could be because it‚Äôs needed by some legacy API (namely, before Java 5) and very rarely because your code is trying to append Strings in a concurrent context.Use StringBuilder instead: introduced with Java 5 and all its operations are not synchronized.This is just a subset of the mistakes I see during interviews and in many active projects. I haven‚Äôt even mentioned the pitfalls of OOP, design patterns, over-engineering, memory leaks, etc‚Ä¶If you are making these mistakes, now it‚Äôs time to change your coding style and make your application more maintainable and secure. It‚Äôs not that hard and avoiding these pitfalls will improve your experience as a developer and it will automatically get you more prepared for your next interview.Keep studying the theory behind any programming language and not just its syntax, code a lot and use static code analyzers like SonarQube , as it could point to the actual bugs and highlight potential bugs.WRITTEN BY"

ust before this all happened, I was eating orecchiette with broccoli raab and sausage at Manducatis Rustica in Queens with my three other guys, all of us old-time buddies saying hi over some pasta.One was Lars, a wine guy (he worked for Banfi for about 800 years, but in any case knows more about wine than almost anyone I‚Äôve ever met) who‚Äôs half Italian (and speaks it, among other languages). He has spent a lot of time in Italy and is always good for a food anecdote or two. He‚Äôs especially knowledgeable about the food of Tuscany and farther south ‚Äî Lazio, the Marches, Calabria, Puglia, Sicily.This pasta at Manducatis was good. Lars said, ‚ÄúYou know, the broccoli raab thing is arguably even better with anchovies and garlic than it is with pasta ‚Äî and that‚Äôs how everyone made it when they couldn‚Äôt afford sausage.‚Äù (For some reason, to me, the most memorable Lars story is how really poor people had an anchovy hanging from a rope in their kitchens, and would wipe their bread on it for flavor. That‚Äôs cucina povera.)As we talked about this some more, he mentioned cooking the greens and the pasta in the same pot, and I remembered a Minimalist column I did with my friend Jack Bishop like 20 years ago. Jack is also (coincidentally) half Italian, and he ‚Äúcame up with‚Äù the idea of cooking greens and pasta in the same pot ‚Äî a new idea to me at the time, and to most of my readers, but something I‚Äôve since integrated as a habit.Anyway, to serve two, this little ditty goes something like this:Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Clean the anchovies and slice or chop the garlic; I don‚Äôt like it too small. Put them in a small skillet with the olive oil over very low heat. They‚Äôre done when the garlic is lightly browned and the anchovies are broken up. Don‚Äôt rush them; they‚Äôll be done before the pasta is. If they finish first, they can sit in the oil until you‚Äôre ready.Add the pasta when the water‚Äôs boiling. Cook it as usual. Meanwhile, cut the last quarter inch off the bottom of the broccoli raab and roughly chop the rest ‚Äî like 1-inch pieces. But rough.When the pasta is about 80 percent done ‚Äî with three or four minutes to go ‚Äî add the greens. (Better to under- or overcook the greens than to screw up the pasta, but this is a guessing game. Chopped broccoli raab is pretty reliably done in three minutes or so, so judge accordingly.) Reserve a little of the cooking water and, when the pasta is done, drain and return to the pot. Add the anchovy mix over super-low heat; if the mixture is dry, add more oil and/or some of the cooking liquid and serve.No cheese. And yes, you can use other greens, from spinach to collards; cooking time will vary. You‚Äôll never miss the sausage.WRITTEN BY"
208,"Monorepos in JavaScript, Anti-Pattern",https://medium.com/@PepsRyuu/monorepos-in-javascript-anti-pattern-917603da59c8?source=extreme_main_feed---------211-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"Something I‚Äôve noticed more lately, is this trend of having several npm micro-packages all contained in one repository. Many popular open-source projects adopt this pattern, React, Parcel, Babel, and many more. I would argue that in the majority of cases, this pattern is more detrimental to a project than a benefit, introducing unnecessary complexity at the cost of usability for both the author and the developer.The idea of monorepos is to ease dependency management. If your project contains a lot of packages that need to depend on certain versions of each other, rather than having them in separate repositories, having them in one place can make it easier to manage them all. Also with one history, these packages will always have commits that are in sync or ‚Äúatomic‚Äù. To make things even easier, there can be custom scripts that can manage the releases of all packages automatically so that there‚Äôs never a moment when one package is released without its corresponding package.A JavaScript monorepo project would typically have this type of structure:This is just a small example, but to demonstrate how large some of these monorepos can get:This is absurd in my opinion, and below I‚Äôll explain some of the reasons I‚Äôm against the concept of monorepos, and why I believe this is an anti-pattern.There‚Äôs several benefits to splitting code into multiple packages, whether it be a library, micro-services or micro-frontends. It results in significantly faster builds, can do independent deployments, and parallelise development across multiple teams, all integrating through an agreed API that everyone can rely on. However, if all of these are hosted in the same repository, you lose a lot of those benefits.While it might seem initially that monorepos don‚Äôt have the same problems of a monolith and that you can maintain packages individually, when you inspect these repositories further, the monolith becomes very apparent. There‚Äôs typically a complex tree of dependencies, where packages all tend to rely on each other in order to function.If you introduce changes to one of the packages, that will likely have a knock-on effect on the packages that consume that package, which in themselves would have to be updated and released. After all, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs in one repository to begin with right? Very often in these monorepos, packages are so incredibly specific in functionality, the question then becomes why even have a separate package at all if it‚Äôs tightly coupled? Can you use these packages independently or are they tied to specific versions of other packages in the monorepo? It‚Äôll probably be easier to remove the mask and just work as a monolith.When you look inside a node_modules directory, there‚Äôs likely hundreds if not thousands of packages, even for a relatively basic application. Quite often, a lot of these packages only contain a few lines of code, with an accompanying LICENSE, README and package.json file. It‚Äôs an incredibly amount of overhead and waste. Packages increasingly consume more hard drive space, increase installation times, and become more obscure in functionality to the point where some names literally describe what they do.Monorepos are amplifying the problem. Quite often they unnecessarily split functionality into a separate package. If the only realistic consumer of a package is the monorepo, and you can‚Äôt realistically see normal users installing that 1 package out of 138 other packages in that repository, there‚Äôs probably no need to have it as a separate package. Ideally it would be better to let a user install 1 package that contains everything, and reduce the overhead.The historical commits in a Git repository can be very important, especially if you need to discover how a package was changed over time and if you need to revert some changes that have been made. Some people would argue that a benefit of monorepos is that you can restore all packages at the same time so that they have the same compatibility. This is a good point, but it simplifies only one aspect of version control, while sacrificing on the other aspects. Most of the time for me, I want to revert a single package, or check the changes that have been made to that one package. In the context of a monorepo, this can become significantly more challenging. You would have to start applying filters to the search, but considering how tightly coupled packages in a monorepo tend to be, you still need to see what changes were made to those other related packages in a sea of hundreds of unrelated packages.It‚Äôs worth noting that Git is simply not designed to work at the scale of a monorepo. The more files and commits in your repository, the slower it will become to do any basic command with Git. Atlassian provides some technical specifics on this topic.Many monorepos publish their packages onto npm, and this can cause a few issues. The first issue is that if the developer is expected to install some of these packages, there can be confusion in regards to version numbers. If the packages are tightly coupled, it can be frustrating to figure out which package works with what. Some monorepos resolve this issue by keeping the version numbers in sync, but if you‚Äôre doing this, it again raises the question of why it‚Äôs worthwhile creating separate packages.Another issue is that publishing separate packages exposes private functionality. As much as you wish your users wouldn‚Äôt use undocumented functionality, if there‚Äôs a way to access it, a user will use it. This forces you as a developer to maintain backwards compatibility on that specific implementation detail. If you want to heavily modify the package, you likely will have to increment your major version number just because some people may be relying on that package existing with the undocumented API.One of the reasons for monorepos to exist previously and have several micro-packages was to improve bundling, ensuring that functionality you weren‚Äôt using wouldn‚Äôt be bundled with your app. Libraries such as Lodash famously popularized this pattern. If you only wanted to use a tiny piece of Lodash, you could import that package individually in order to exclude the rest of Lodash code. However with tree-shaking being common place in bundlers now, they‚Äôre beginning to be deprecated. With ESM support being everywhere now including NodeJS, there‚Äôs really no reason anymore to use separate packages as a means to reduce bundle sizes.Having said that though, there‚Äôs still a reason why you might want to consider having a separate package inside your repository. It can help simplify importing and bundling for the developer, without the need to publish those packages anywhere. Preact Compat is a great example of this. If you have optional files that a user can import, but you don‚Äôt want a user to have to reference a specific JavaScript file and you want the bundler to automatically pick the correct format for the environment, then having a separate package.json could help here.In the above example, the bundler can use a simplified path instead of pointing directly to a file, and can also determine whether or not to use the UMD or ESM version of the file based on the package metadata.Like how monorepos over-engineer and separate too many features into packages, the opposite can be true for splitting code into too many repositories. There‚Äôs no silver bullet as to when one pattern makes sense over the other. You need to do a cost benefit analysis and ask yourself what are the benefits of having the feature as a separate package in one repository, as opposed to having it as a separate file that can be imported, or in a separate repository entirely. There‚Äôs always the maintenance overhead to be considered. For me personally, for all of the reasons I‚Äôve listed above, I‚Äôm not convinced that monorepos are the way forward, and my advice is that they should be avoided.Thanks for reading!Links: Medium, Github, TwitterWRITTEN BY"

With 22 million people, it‚Äôs one of the fastest growing populations in the world. There are few tall buildings. Zoning restrictions abound. And it is quickly running out of land on which to expand. Geographic boundaries block it in. This is a metropolis bordered by mountains and volcanoes ‚Äî the Sierra Nevadas to the east; and lower sierras and ranges to the north, west, and south. For millennia, hordes of people have been drawn to this area because of its wealth of natural resources ‚Äî pine forests and rivers, wildlife, and even saltwater lakes. There is food and water aplenty. But now there is no more room to grow.Tokyo, with 38 million residents, is the most populated metro area in the world. It has grown upward, with skyscrapers, and outward without the impediments of hard natural boundaries. Similarly, New York City has jumped the East River and morphed into Brooklyn and Queens and beyond. For Mexico City, there is no such luck. And Mexico City is on track to add millions more people by mid-century. Goldman Sachs says it may become the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy by then. Still, historic preservationists ban renovations. Zoning laws won‚Äôt allow developers to build anything taller than five stories in the city‚Äôs core. Transportation infrastructure is aged, and the surrounding mountains inhibit connections to satellite towns that could serve as commuter alternatives. The result is mass urban concentration.Walk through any megacity these days and the crowds are sometimes difficult to fathom. Which is why standing alone in the middle of Mexico City, in the center of its main square ‚Äî Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, or the Z√≥calo, as it is commonly called ‚Äî is so surreal. The plaza stretches nearly 800 feet in each direction and is cordoned by national monuments. Yet, there are only a few dozen people at a time crossing it. It is a vast, open area, just a lone flagpole rising high in its center. Mere steps away, outside of this main square, the city is packed, jam-packed with people and vehicles and public transportation congestion.With as many as 10 million more people poised to be added this century to the already overstressed urban matrix, and with space limitations, the question is, where will everyone go? In all likelihood, down, underground. And they won‚Äôt be alone. All around the world, people live underground, entire cities even.In Coober Pedy, Australia, it‚Äôs so hot that people who moved there 100 years ago to prospect for opal realized they had to build their city beneath the surface of the Earth, where it‚Äôs markedly cooler. Now close to 2,000 people live there. Coober Pedy‚Äôs average annual temperature eclipses 85 degrees Fahrenheit and during summer remains above 90 degrees and often more than 100 degrees for weeks on end. Underground, at depths of more than 30 feet, temperatures remain relatively constant and cooler. Fun fact: The average local year-round surface temperature is what you will find at these depths, no matter where you are on Earth. In Coober Pedy, that can mean a swing of 20 degrees ‚Äî a big cool-off.In primitive times, caves did the trick for providing cooler environments and protection from the elements. In modern clusters of civilization, living underground seems like an extraordinary step. That is until you consider this: Global temperatures could spike so much over the next 100 years that it will be nearly impossible for billions of people to remain living aboveground; half of the land area of the planet may become uninhabitable.A hothouse scenario such as this would mean temperatures rising about threefold more than expected ‚Äî a lot, for sure, but not outside the limit of possibility. According to a study by researchers at Purdue University and the University of New South Wales in Australia, regions too hot to survive if temperatures rise threefold would include most of the East Coast of the United States, all of India, most areas in Australia, and heavily populated parts of China.With heat and population concentration in mind (people in affected areas would in all likelihood move to cooler geography, congesting those regions), one solution may be underground living. Besides Coober Pedy, there are major subterranean developments already in the works. In Fukuoka, Japan, architects from the Taisei Corporation of Tokyo have plans for Alice Cities ‚Äî airy underground spaces connected by subway trains and subterranean roads. In Helsinki, Finland, there is a ‚Äúshadow city‚Äù with a public swimming pool, shopping areas, a church, hockey arena, and an industrial center. In China, old war bunkers have been taken over by people in Beijing. In Singapore, there are plans for an underground ‚Äúscience city‚Äù where more than 4,000 people will live. Toronto already has its PATH system: pedestrian walkways that span for nearly 20 miles and connect transportation hubs to restaurants, shops, and other commercial spots. New York is even considering a Lowline park: It is billed as the world‚Äôs first underground park. It will use new solar technology to transform a trolley terminal into green space. Breakthroughs in lighting, mood, and spatial aesthetics provide the world with these new underground layers of living and working possibilities.Visionary architects are teaming with urban planners to come up with living solutions to looming climate change conditions. They‚Äôve partnered before.In the past, far-out scenarios prompted considerations for building an alternative world. During the late 1960s and into the 1970s, the Italian architectural collective Superstudio crafted designs for a world scant of resources. The group‚Äôs architects made blueprints for movable cities ‚Äî a Continuous Production Conveyor Belt City ‚Äî among other plans deemed problem-solving. These would be entire communities, or ‚Äúcities,‚Äù that live aboard stations that move about to consume as many natural resources as possible. In 2016, Rome‚Äôs MAXXI, the National Museum of 21st Century Arts, exhibited Superstudio‚Äôs work, including its 12 Ideal Cities and other concepts that are tragically relevant today and will likely be even more so in the future. The exhibit showed drawings, photographs, videos, and design objects ‚Äî all of which are fundamentally a critique of society, whether alerting to dangers of overconsumption or warning of the fallibilities of modern infrastructure.Superstudio architects sought plans for a new world existence. Designs were meant as parables for a world they saw as increasingly headed for the brink of destruction. Today, architects are practically rather than theoretically designing for a world where pollution and temperatures constrict movement aboveground. And they are designing against sprawl.The most populated cities in the world as of 2019 were Tokyo, as previously mentioned; Delhi; Shanghai; S√£o Paulo; and Mexico City. By the end of this century, the most crowded city in the world will have nearly three times as many people living in its metropolitan boundaries as present-day Tokyo. Lagos, Nigeria, will house 88 million people (it had 20 million residents as of this writing). Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, will be the second most populated city on Earth, with 83 million ‚Äî a massive increase from the 11 million people who live there today. Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, will see an even more dramatic rise: 74 million people, up from 4.5 million residents. Mumbai will have 67 million people, three times as many as who live there today; and Delhi‚Äôs population is expected to more than double to 57 million.In past times, without technology such as artificial cooling or heating to solve people‚Äôs climate adaptation problems, resiliency was had by re-engineering natural structures as human habitats.Petra, the ancient city in Jordan made famous by Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, was once a bustling center of commerce. Its petrified (hence the name) structures were carved into mountains, and an estimated 20,000 people lived there in the fifth century B.C. Major underground cities also existed in China, Turkey, Poland, Italy, and Africa.In ancient Mayan culture, cities were built on top of one another. The Aztecs built their temples on top of a lake, and then after the Spanish conquest, the Spanish built their temples on top of the temples of the Aztecs. And eventually the whole Spanish colonial city was built on top of the Aztec city. That city is now called Mexico City.The Z√≥calo here is either a massive open area meant for congregating and celebrations, or it‚Äôs a giant waste of space, depending on how you look at it. Mexican architect Esteban Su√°rez looked at it differently. Why not, he thought, take a cue from the past, the once Aztec capital Tenochtitl√°n, and build on top of the cities that form the foundation for Mexico City itself? Why not build down, not up? He designed the Earthscraper, the inverse of a skyscraper, that would plunge nearly 1,000 feet below the surface, jettisoning past ruins and relics, and reaching back in time, metaphorically speaking anyway.‚ÄúWe thought it would be very interesting, instead of going up with a skyscraper, what would happen if we dug down through these layers of cities?‚Äù said Su√°rez.But preservationists and city officials quashed it ‚Äî not before the design got picked up in the media, however. The Earthscraper became a global sensation. It was a finalist in the prestigious eVolo magazine‚Äôs annual skyscraper competition in 2010. And people from all over the world contacted Su√°rez to incorporate the design for their municipal plans. Variations of it were constructed. One riff on the underground concept was even built on the edge of Mexico City itself. Garden Santa Fe is a seven-story-deep underground shopping mall.Subterranean building isn‚Äôt easy, which is why it isn‚Äôt done very often. Plumbing has to work against gravity. Foundations have the added weight of earth to work against. Artificial lighting has to be installed to replace areas where natural light would traditionally do. Keeping spaces open, airy, and bright is tricky, not to mention expensive. All told, underground construction can be as much as five times more costly than traditional aboveground building. But Su√°rez says it‚Äôs a must. ‚ÄúWe need to go vertical in this city because urban sprawl cannot continue growing,‚Äù he says. Satellite towns around Mexico City have been swallowed up in what Su√°rez calls the ‚Äúblob‚Äù of urban sprawl. The Earthscraper was a solution to try to ‚Äúverticalize‚Äù in an inverse way. ‚ÄúThis was an effort from an urban point of view to try to bring new life into the historic center and solve the problem of new living spaces, new commercial and office spaces, that you practically don‚Äôt have anymore,‚Äù he says.Su√°rez‚Äôs aim is to incorporate nature into unexpected urban environments. There is a bridge, he mentions, that allows room for vegetation; a pavilion in the shape of a cactus. His designs tell a story. The Earthscraper is an inverted pyramid. Its design has a glass ceiling taking up nearly the entire Z√≥calo ground area and allowing natural light to filter down through the structure. Green-scaped walkways are lined with natural trees. A museum showcases heritage sights and Mexico‚Äôs historic connections to pyramids. (Despite Egypt‚Äôs association with pyramid structures, there are more ancient pyramids in Mexico and the Americas than in all the world.)Different layers of the Earthscraper are devoted to retail, commercial, and residential spaces. Public transportation, as designed, would also pass right through the structure. Made of reinforced glass and steel, the Earthscraper looks, by its architectural drawing, modern, bright, and welcoming. It doesn‚Äôt come across as cavernous, which is important. Humans fear being underground.According to studies, as much as 7% of the world‚Äôs population, or about 500 million people, are severely claustrophobic. Indeed, perceived lack of air, light, and exits brings about stress and anxiety in most people. Darkness is our biggest fear. It interrupts sleep patterns and affects people‚Äôs moods. Su√°rez said it harkens to thoughts of being buried alive. Which is why he designed the Earthscraper to capture as much natural light as possible. The large glass ceiling would cascade light through glass floors and walls making its way to the very tip of the pyramid. There, at the bottom of the structure, a water tank would store the rainwater collected from the glass ceilings. There would be tanks for recycling water inside the building, as well as a water treatment plant. The whole place would glimmer bright.There is something poetic about the Earthscraper rising from this point of water. It would afford its inhabitants the feeling of rising up, back to the surface; as seeds grow.Not all underground living spaces are as aesthetically minded as Su√°rez‚Äôs design, however. In Beijing, former bomb shelters have been reappropriated for housing. There is no official number of how many people live down there, but some estimates claim as many as 2 million people live below ground.Annette Kim, director of the Spatial Analysis Lab at the University of Southern California, spent a year in Beijing, observing and researching the lives of ‚Äúrat people‚Äù ‚Äî the pejorative name given to people who live underground there. She said the conditions vary, from extremely dank and squalid apartments to those not dissimilar to a basement flat in London. Humidity and mold are the biggest health hindrances, she found. ‚ÄúIt boils down to design,‚Äù she said. Those living underground in dormitory-style settings that are clean and well lit were relatively well adjusted. Those living in places designed as nuclear fallout emergency shelters fared more poorly. One woman told her that living belowground was ‚Äúdehumanizing.‚Äù But China is experimenting with more pleasing designs for the future. The South China Morning Post reported in June 2017 that President Xi Jinping had ambitious plans to develop ‚Äúa new world underground.‚Äù The newspaper said geologists have been examining different underground plots in northern China for commercial use, including shopping and entertainment complexes.Despite China‚Äôs size ‚Äî the fourth-biggest in the world by land area ‚Äî people need to live near centers of commerce. That‚Äôs why so many choose to live underground in Beijing. They are largely migrant workers. Commuting is expensive. Living underground closer to work is cheaper and more efficient than housing farther away.The global trend toward more concentrated centers of urban populations may force larger swaths of working-class people to accept subterranean habitats. By night, living with darkness above- and belowground may appear to be the same. For many, though, come sunrise, there may be a different type of commute, a vertical one.Meanwhile, there is a trend among the world‚Äôs wealthy to have doomsday bunkers. These are residences designed to withstand the worst of manmade and natural disasters. They are stocked with supplies that can last for months or even years. They are tricked out with the latest gadgetry, some with swimming pools and screening rooms.In San Diego, California, entrepreneur and former time-share and real estate developer Robert Vicino has made a community of these high-end shelters, called Vivos. One such community in South Dakota is comprised of 575 bunkers with space for 10,000 people. It is being billed as the largest survival community on Earth. And this is only one of them. Vivos Europa 1 is a 228,000-square-foot complex carved out of solid bedrock, under a 400-foot-tall mountain in Rothenstein, Germany.Come to Earth in a century and walk along the surface of major cities in the Middle East or equatorial areas, and things might look barren, abandoned. Beneath, though, civilizations might thrive; Earthscrapers underfoot.USC‚Äôs Kim emphasizes that design is key to the health, safety, and psychological well-being of people living underground. By matching new design standards with cognitive ones, better subsurface habitats can be developed.At the base of the flagpole in the middle of the Z√≥calo in Mexico City are four transparent square tiles. They cover the lights that shoot up and illuminate the giant Mexican flag that flies above. But there is a fifth tile. It‚Äôs made of cement and it is padlocked. It‚Äôs hard not to think that what lies beneath may be a solution to overpopulation and urban living.WRITTEN BY"
210,Who Gets Hit the Hardest?,https://coronavirus.medium.com/who-gets-hit-the-hardest-2f7cfdb51643?source=extreme_main_feed---------213-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"This article has been made free for everyone, thanks to Medium Members. For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.A Politico story published Tuesday sparked outrage on Twitter when it called Covid-19 an ‚Äúequalizer.‚Äù Describing the struggles of both public and private hospitals in New York, it claimed that rich and poor alike are grappling with the pandemic‚Äôs drain on health care and medical resources.Across the United States, the data tells a different story. Today in The Atlantic, Vann R. Newkirk II argues that the reason more young people are dying of Covid-19 in the South is because they are generally sicker, and they are sicker because they have long suffered from poor health care. ‚ÄúThe South is the poorest region in the country,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúThe poor, black, Latino, or rural residents who make up large shares of southern populations tend to lack access to high-quality doctors and care.‚ÄùA Reuters report today pointed out that the Covid-19 death rate in New Orleans is seven times higher than that in New York. The analysis came to a similar conclusion: Diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity occur at higher rates in New Orleans, making people more vulnerable to severe illness. ‚ÄúWe already had tremendous health care disparities before this pandemic ‚Äî one can only imagine they are being amplified now,‚Äù Rebekah Gee, Louisiana‚Äôs former Health Secretary, told Reuters.In California, farmworkers maintaining the nation‚Äôs food supply are also at increased risk. In addition to having higher rates of hypertension and respiratory disease, as The Guardian pointed out, many of them can‚Äôt afford to stop working. Especially for undocumented workers who aren‚Äôt eligible for unemployment benefits, losing a paycheck means losing their homes.The divide between rich and poor is especially stark in South Africa, where homeless people are being rounded up into empty sports stadiums. The intention is to keep the most vulnerable safe from the virus, reports CNN, but some worry that the close quarters could only exacerbate an outbreak.The responses to the Politico story demanded a reality check. ‚ÄúYeah try social distancing in the projects. Or working from home when you‚Äôre a waiter. Or avoiding an overcrowded subway,‚Äù tweeted one user. ‚ÄúThis article was so disconnected.‚ÄùWRITTEN BY"
211,Where to Begin: Imagining America‚Äôs Future After the Crisis Recedes,https://medium.com/swlh/where-to-begin-imagining-americas-future-after-the-crisis-recedes-787d70483fdc?source=extreme_main_feed---------214-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"Reflecting on core values broadens the way we see and understand our own culture, where we come from, where we feel we belong, the things that make us feel purposeful and whole, and how these forces merge to shape our future.Things that once seemed impossible are now possible.There are moments in life when our future swings on a hinge of fate ‚Äî forces beyond our control shatter familiar patterns. Shards of insecurity pierce our thoughts in waves. Visions of our mortality, the consequences of civil disruption, and a loss of control ripple in the wake. Policymakers scramble to ‚Äúright the ship,‚Äù in a tug-o-war of tensions among values that define us: consumerism, democracy, directness, equality, informality, independence, innovation, meritocracy, patriotism, and time.This is our chance to reflect on our deepest values and imagine a path forward. We‚Äôre tasked with determining what‚Äôs working, and what‚Äôs not. History has taught us that short term thinking comes with long term consequences. The decisions we make in times of uncertainty are never purely about economics or survival ‚Äî they‚Äôre moral choices. We make better decisions when we‚Äôve taken the time to clarify our values and are capable of seeing the big picture by connecting the past, present, and future.Hindsight is 2020 ‚Äî Look backward to see forward
The choices made by previous generations can shed light on our present options and serve as a reminder that we cannot lead others unless we first learn to lead ourselves.Linden B. Johnson was thrust into the Presidency following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. In the spring of 1964, Johnson declared his vision for a Great Society and pledged a commitment to ending poverty. The emotional weight of the tumultuous 1960s created conditions for the birth of policies that have defined two generations of political and social agendas and debates. Johnson‚Äôs policies included aid to schools and universities, new job training programs, public housing initiatives, new Medicare health coverage for the elderly and Medicaid coverage for the poor, and other programs that have endured, such as Head Start, Job Corps, and Community Health Centers.Johnson‚Äôs initiatives became known as The War on Poverty. Ultimately, his good intentions were obscured by the War in Vietnam, but the War on Poverty marched forward. Now, in the spring of 2020, we‚Äôre facing a set of choices that will determine our present and future.We will become what we choose to be.Choose to let go of limitations
As we move forward, one thing is certain ‚Äî people are our greatest resource and we need policies that support unlocking our full potential. Johnson‚Äôs targeted initiatives focused on one group and one generation at a time ‚Äî this strategy, while imperfect was effective in creating lasting change. Case in point, voting rights were stripped from the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and instead became the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The War on Poverty provided targeted support for vulnerable populations with the aim of creating a more egalitarian civil society.Policies impact people‚Äôs lives, but they are merely an instrument. Values drive policy and policy shapes behavior. The success of a policy is largely defined by how it‚Äôs applied. Policies can be applied to either block or unlock our full potential.Today we face a pressing public health issue. As we reassess our approach to economic stability, health, and public education we may need to take a more holistic approach.

Choose awareness ‚Äî Identify patterns of influence within relationships
Many of our most strongly held goals, fears, and desires are tethered to close relationships. The people we try hardest to understand, to win approval from, to please ‚Äî the people who inspire strong feelings also tend to influence our motivations and values. Our friends, family members including parents, siblings, life partners, and colleagues make an indelible impression on us, shaping our perceptions of who we are, where we belong and how we behave. We must be aware of how these perceptions shape our thinking and limit our visions of what‚Äôs possible. To achieve the best outcome, we will have to confront and release our fears to have a full view of all possibilities.Choose to understand
For better or worse, our perceptions and predictions affect our emotions, guide our decisions, and trigger reflexive habits. Crisis management and elevated angst can overshadow rational thought, impairing our frame of mind and ability to effectively create a vision of the future. Facing a threat to our health and livelihoods triggers fears of scarcity and personal loss. False dilemmas arise in consequence to short-term shock and hypervigilant survival instincts. It may seem like a strange time to stop and take a personal inventory of our values, but it‚Äôs a necessary part of understanding who we are and where we want to go in the future.Choose to see clearly
Futurists track signals to anticipate an uncertain future. Signals are essentially signs ‚Äî hints at ‚Äúthings to come.‚Äù Signals appear as people, places, or things that catch our attention, in one population or location, that can be connected on a broader scale pointing toward larger implications. The futurist lens can inspire creativity, confidence and bold action ‚Äî three things we‚Äôre going to need to create strategies to adapt to a changing world.As the shock, denial, and disbelief of the pandemic fades, we have an opportunity to revisit and become reacquainted with core cultural values that can help us to better understand and interpret current signals and their implication for changes on the horizon.Consumerism
‚ÄúSpending improves the economy ‚Äî the one with the most toys wins,‚Äù are attitudes that grew out of late 1940s lifestyle values. After the second world war, consumerism was touted as a patriotic contribution to the success of the American way of life. New and expanded federal programs allowed some young families to purchase homes in suburban neighborhoods. Consumption and easy credit became staples of the American economy. The wide range of consumables, from clothing to toys and gourmet coffee to home d√©cor, offers infinite variety. For some, shopping became more than securing basic needs ‚Äî it provides a sense of power, pride or satisfaction.With seventy-one percent of households financially unhealthy, and the narrowing distribution of asset ownership shrinking, consumerism isn‚Äôt working for most people. Millions of Americans do not have the day-to-day financial security they need to be financially resilient in the future. We need to find new ways to make a patriotic contribution of lasting value beyond transactional consumption.Democracy
U.S. Constitution is the nation‚Äôs fundamental law ‚Äî upholding democracy is perhaps our highest value. With it comes the principles of rule of law ‚Äî that all people and institutions are subject to and accountable to the law. It delivers values we hold dear: accountability, free and fair elections, a system of checks and balances, protection of fundamental rights, including the security of persons and contract, property, and human rights. As citizens, we value our right to elect and change our political leaders based on who we expect will best represent our values and interests.Civil society and constitutional courts across America are part of the infrastructure being transformed by technology. Corporate personhood has its own set of interests, often very different from the best interests of human beings. As public spaces and cities begin intelligently tracking movements, monitoring citizens and visitors alike, the lines between safety and invasion of privacy will blur. With confidence and trust in government in decline, we need civic participation to shape future practices and ensure that unfair, incomplete, or short-sighted policies are not allowed to bypass civil liberties.Directness
‚ÄúSpeaking one‚Äôs mind‚Äù and ‚Äútelling it like it is‚Äù are hallmarks of our straightforward, direct approach that values making a concise point, as quickly and as clearly as possible so as to ensure the message is delivered as intended, and correctly received.Networked machines will communicate and expand artificial intelligence and decision-making abilities to allow objects and environments to anticipate our next steps or actions directly, without a request or need for approval. On one hand, we‚Äôll appreciate the convenience this brings ordinary life. It has the potential to eliminate certain types of miscommunication and misunderstandings. Machine learning systems often produce correct results, but the results aren‚Äôt always easily explained in terms we understand. Limitations apply ‚Äî faulty conclusions can create disastrous outcomes. Are we prepared to address these limitations in advance?Equality/Fairness
‚ÄúTreat others as you would like to be treated‚Äù and ‚Äúlove your neighbor as yourself‚Äù are values passed from generation to generation to instill a sense of kindness and care within communities. As history will attest, achieving equality has been a struggle. We have a history of polices and practices that includes certain Americans having their rights taken, overlooked, or ignored. Advocates champion equality of access to the right to make important decisions that affect their lives, have relationships with whom they choose and have access to all the benefits of society. Even with legislation aimed toward preventing discrimination and guaranteeing access, creating a more egalitarian society is a work in progress.As machines increasingly make important decisions based on data collected through apps on our phones and beyond ‚Äî we need to decide what we want from technology. Algorithms sift the most relevant intelligence. While efficient, algorithms carry the same bias as the data it's trained on.Informality
Americans prefer to use relatively few titles in everyday interactions ‚Äî titles are primarily used for medical and religious professionals, military and police officers, teachers and university professors. First names are used early in interactions. Protocols are more informal and relaxed. In comparison to other cultures, Americans tend to dress more casually and are more relaxed in standing and seating posture. People are encouraged to be self-directed and to take initiative.Work environments are swiftly changing. As many people shelter in place and work from home during the pandemic, we‚Äôre increasingly relying upon virtual communication. In the last century, work environments were primarily shared with people in close physical proximity who could share in the same sensory conditions ‚Äî sight, sound, smell, and touch. Advances in virtual and augmented reality will influence human perceptions and change the way leadership takes action. In the future there will be even less hierarchy ‚Äî leaders will move from managing and mobilizing to curating, collaborating and integrating systems.Independence
Americans value individualism, holding dear the freedom of each person to make their own choices, and do what they want ‚Äî as long as it doesn‚Äôt interfere with the rights of others. People strive to be recognized and rewarded. Personal accountability and a belief that our actions can change or influence our circumstances is a key part of our culture of individualism.As data science and machine learning train on insights from psychology and neuroscience, we will increasingly rely on intelligent machines to make decisions and perform actions on our behalf. From these interactions, intelligent machines will learn new pathways to alter human perceptions.Innovation
American ingenuity brought us the conveniences we enjoy today. Our outward-looking orientation toward the future is one potential risk and possibility. We want to know what‚Äôs on the horizon, what‚Äôs around the next turn. The value we place on curiosity and interest in ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù fosters innovation, business, and leadership.We often think of technology as a tool that can improve efficiency or make our lives more convenient, but it‚Äôs also designed with optimal users and purposes in mind. In that way, technology is persuasive. It‚Äôs not neutral. It is up to us to instill the values and standards we wish to uphold.Achievement/Meritocracy
The American Dream is part of a vision of the good life and a belief in opportunity for advancement. Our identity is closely tied to job titles and roles. We value hard work and expect it will lead to economic stability and a better future. We embrace upward socioeconomic mobility achieved through individual efforts, accomplishments, and talents ‚Äî in direct contrast to cultures that focus on seniority, inherited names, titles, and property.

AI has been described as the most significant technological innovation since the steam engine. The practical and political issues that emerged during the late 1980s have a renewed relevance. AI‚Äôs advancement is dependent on hidden pools of labor. How will people be compensated for their contributions? This is our chance to determine what we want from the jobs of the future.Patriotism
Patriotism, the belief in the ideals of the United States, is often expressed as ‚Äúlove of our country.‚Äù It has served as a powerful force of solidarity and resilience ‚Äî bringing people closer together in difficult times. Patriotism inspires us to affirm and defend the country‚Äôs basic principles and institutions, regardless of how we identify ourselves in terms of religion or ethnicity.In 2020 we face a human need for a different type of defense than what was required in the past. In response to the pandemic, the World Health Organization has encouraged leaders to take bold action to mitigate the financial harm coronavirus is imposing. More than half of all U.S. households have no emergency savings to sustain them through the current financial crisis. Our willingness to defend values and principles often amplifies the spirit of patriotism ‚Äî does that spirit include banding together to sustain civil society financially, and to invest in fighting diseases?The Value of Time
We treat time as money ‚Äî our relationship with time is often described in specific and scarce terms, rather than as something fluid and abundant. From an early age, we teach children about efficiency and speed. Our relationship with time management creates conditions of increasing demand for convenience services like fast food, meal delivery, even product expiration dates.The value we place on time is changing. Technology is becoming more interconnected daily and there are new possibilities to explore. Convenience and productivity have their place, but the tendency to equate more surveillance and tracking with more productive workplaces and higher profits may or may not align with the way we‚Äôve valued time in the past. This is our opportunity to expand on our goals for the future.What‚Äôs next ‚Äî ask bold questions about the future we hope to create
How will the present outpouring of relief efforts, powers and responsibilities, international medical collaboration, and our own history, combine to set the conditions for the future 10, 20, 50 or 100 years from now? How will we combine our individual strengths, values, diversity and the complexity of American culture to meet the current needs of our society? Will we meet our challenges with humanity, humility, responsibility, and decency? Will we make choices based on conscience, and who we‚Äôre called to be?
What kind of future do we want?Turn by turn, the spin of chaos will slow. Our focus will shift. Solidarity will bring comfort. Suffering and grief will give way to acceptance of a new reality. A new order will emerge, and we‚Äôre all part of it. We have a responsibility to be sure the future represents the values and interests of, ‚ÄúWe the People.‚ÄùWRITTEN BY"
212,I Am a Descendant of James Madison and His Slave,https://zora.medium.com/i-am-a-descendant-of-james-madison-and-his-slave-62f7a3660600?source=extreme_main_feed---------215-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"resident Madison did not have children with his wife, Dolley. Leading scholars believe he was impotent, infertile, or both. But the stories I have heard since my childhood say that James Madison, a Founding Father of our nation, was also a founding father of my African American family.In my childhood, whenever I whined or squirmed or got into trouble, my mother repeated the refrain: ‚ÄúAlways remember ‚Äî you‚Äôre a Madison. You come from African slaves and a president.‚Äù This is my family‚Äôs credo, the statement that has guided us for 200 years.Though many in our family have heard we descend from President Madison and his slaves, only the griots ‚Äî the one-in-a-generation oral historians in the family ‚Äî know the full account of our ancestors, White and Black, in America. Gramps had told me many stories, but the detailed family history was Mom‚Äôs responsibility to convey to me when I became the next griotte.The night my mother passed those stories on to me, I understood for the first time why some of the details of our family history were passed only from the griot of one generation to that of the next. Not only were some of the stories intimate, but this tradition safeguarded their accuracy, truth, and longevity. I sank into the sofa with my mother and listened with a new awareness of the significance of her words and what they meant to me. She began.‚ÄúWhen your uncle John, your uncle Mack, and I were children, Daddy would call us to his library. He would spin the big globe that sat on his desk, then stop it to point to different continents and countries and teach us about ancestors who had lived there. When Daddy spun the globe and asked us, ‚ÄòWho was the first African in our family to come to America?‚Äô John would stop the spinning globe, touch the outline of Africa, and shout, ‚ÄòMandy! She was kidnapped in West Africa and put on a slave ship.‚Äô‚ÄúJohn Maddison ‚Äî that‚Äôs spelled with two d‚Äôs,‚Äù Mom said, beginning the saga of the Other Madisons, ‚Äúwas our first white ancestor in America. His son, John Jr., kept that spelling, but his grandsons, John the third, Henry, and Ambrose, spelled it with one d.‚ÄúMandy was our first black ancestor stolen from Africa. That happened sometime in the middle of the 18th century,‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúShe was the mother of our family.‚ÄúMandy and her master, President Madison‚Äôs father, had a daughter, Coreen,‚Äù Mom went on. ‚ÄúShe was the first African American Madison and the second of our family‚Äôs griots.‚ÄúJames Madison Jr., the future president, saw Coreen walking back and forth between the kitchen and the mansion. And he wanted her,‚Äù Mom stated simply. ‚ÄúAs soon as she became pregnant with his child, she began to worry she would not be allowed to keep the baby for more than a few years. Coreen gave birth to a boy. She named him Jim. Raising him, Coreen lived in constant dread that he would be taken from her. She had heard of family members, even mothers and infants, being sold and separated by hundreds of miles, never to see each other again.‚ÄúIn Jim‚Äôs teenage years, Coreen‚Äôs fear became reality. He had been born around 1792. A few weeks after his birth, Dolley‚Äôs sister-in-law died, leaving two daughters ‚Äî Susan, a toddler, and Victoria, an infant. Dolley agreed to take care of them. When the children arrived at Montpelier, she assigned Coreen to be Victoria‚Äôs wet nurse. Coreen nursed Victoria on one breast and Jim on the other. The two children became inseparable.‚ÄúMany plantation owners believed that black people lacked the ability to read, write, or ‚Äòfigger.‚Äô The slaves knew this was not true. As Jim grew up, he hid behind the door and listened in on Victoria and Susan‚Äôs lessons. His father saw him hiding there but did nothing. Allowing Jim to learn,‚Äù Mom speculated, ‚Äúwas Madison‚Äôs way of showing love for his son.‚ÄúWhen Victoria was 12, Dolley told her she could no longer be around boys, especially slave boys, like Jim.‚ÄúIn 1809, when Madison became president, he brought Coreen and Jim to Washington. Dolley directed the other house slaves to make sure her niece was not around when Jim was working. But Victoria was hardheaded; she hid in the armoires in the Madison family bedrooms, where they shared their deepest thoughts and feelings. It didn‚Äôt take long for Jim and Victoria to fall in love.‚ÄúOne of the maids found out and suggested they stay away from each other. Jim was worried the maid would report them to Dolley, so he went to his mother. She burst into tears when he disclosed how he felt about Victoria. Coreen knew her boy could be sold or killed. She persuaded the steward to let Jim work in the kitchen, where it would be easier to keep the young lovers apart. But Victoria followed him there. One of the chefs, a slave, warned her that if she didn‚Äôt stop sneaking into the kitchen, he would have to tell the mistress.‚ÄúIn 1812,‚Äù Mom continued, ‚Äúthe United States declared war on Great Britain, and on August 24, 1814, British soldiers and slaves who had been freed and recruited to fight with them advanced on Washington. Dolley told Jim to save the American flag. He folded it, secured it under his shirt, then ran to hide in the woods with the other slaves.‚ÄúYears after the war,‚Äù Mom said, ‚ÄúJim told his children how worried he was that lightning and flames from the burning city would reveal his hiding place.‚ÄúIn December 1814, two months after Britain and the United States negotiated a peace treaty, Dolley gave a party to celebrate. She ordered the male slaves, including Jim, to stand along the walls holding rushlights.‚ÄúA decade later, he told his children how sore his arms became, but he would never forget the music, the dancing, and the ladies and gentlemen in their finery. Standing there like a statue, he must have looked like the hero he truly was.‚ÄúA few days after the party, Victoria sneaked into the kitchen again. The chef promptly carried out his threat. Dolley was furious. She had assumed that Victoria and Jim knew better than to fall in love. Dolley arranged to sell Jim immediately, and the president made only weak objections.‚ÄúJust before Jim stepped onto the wagon that would take him away, Coreen held him tight and wept bitter tears. Her only hope was that the Madison name might serve as a tool to help them find each other someday.‚ÄùI knew what was next. I could hear Coreen whisper to her son: ‚ÄúAlways remember ‚Äî you‚Äôre a Madison.‚Äù This is how the credo was started. Over the generations, as America changed, words were added and we were reminded that we weren‚Äôt just descendants of a president, we were descendants of slaves, too.‚ÄúJim was sold twice,‚Äù Mom went on. ‚ÄúThe first time, he was sold to a nearby plantation, but Victoria drove herself there on a wagon to see him. The plantation owner sent her back and informed Dolley, who begged the new owner to sell Jim to someone far away.‚ÄúHe ended up in Tennessee and never saw Victoria or Coreen again. But he remembered he was a Madison.‚ÄùJim, I would learn when I tried to find him, was one of the countless slaves who was not valued by those who created America‚Äôs written record. Much of his story is lost to history.here were more stories for my mother to tell me, but the hour had grown late, and Mom and I were tired. I accompanied her upstairs, kissed her good night, then returned to the living room.I did not question Madison‚Äôs greatness, but I did question his goodness.I have always been very private and reserved by nature, but I knew the source of my reluctance to accept this new role was about something more. For my mother, being the griotte meant being proud of descending from a U.S. president. She was not ashamed of having slaves in her family tree, yet, although most black Americans had enslaved ancestors in their genealogies, few had presidents. And she believed that President Madison was a great and good man.I did not question Madison‚Äôs greatness, but I did question his goodness. James Jr. inherited more than fortune and power. He also inherited the Southern way of thinking and behaving. Madison was a Founding Father who was reputed to have been kind to the human beings listed among his possessions, but I knew that he, like his father and many other plantation owners, sexually assaulted or coerced the women he owned. In my eyes, the griots before me had glossed over the less than admirable behavior that had given James Madison Jr. a place of honor in my family tree.The next day, my mother said, ‚ÄúI have something to tell you before I go back to Oakland tomorrow. I‚Äôve never told you before. Your father is the only person I‚Äôve ever mentioned it to.‚Äù She then told me about how her mother had been hard on her growing up ‚Äî more than hard, really. ‚ÄúShe loved us, I‚Äôm sure, but sometimes it seemed she was trying to break us by enforcing a list of rules that was as long as her arm. She was hardest on me, claiming I was the most disobedient.‚ÄúMother would push me facedown on the floor, sit on my back, and beat my behind with a belt. I cannot justify her abusive actions to anyone, especially myself. I can only suppose Mother loved me in her way and was trying her best to direct me. I was a girl, so maybe she singled me out for punishment because she was afraid some man might try to hurt me if I didn‚Äôt follow her rules carefully. Maybe Daddy understood her reasons and accepted her methods. A little misstep on my part could have cost everything they worked for and put me in danger. They were only one generation removed from being slaves themselves.‚ÄúWhat happened to Mandy was much worse than what happened to me. I tried to be strong like her. And Daddy had told me I was President Madison‚Äôs great-great-great-granddaughter. I was proud of that. Even Mother couldn‚Äôt beat that pride out of me. Mandy and the president got me through those beatings.‚ÄùI wanted to say something that would take away that long-lasting hurt, but nothing seemed adequate. Mom blinked away tears. The beatings and Mom‚Äôs anger and pain would now be part of the family saga.Over the next two years, I went through the box again and again. I studied maps of West Africa and researched the history of slavery in America. I read biographies of James and Dolley Madison and historical studies on the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings. And I tried to figure out the message the directive should impart to the current and future generations of African American Madisons.My mother, like the ancient storytellers of West Africa, retold the family history that had been passed from generation to generation faithfully and accurately. She added her own stories and messages but never challenged any part of the saga. However, unlike the ancients, who relied strictly on oral tradition, my mother embraced a new tradition started by my great-grandfather Mack. To make the stories tangible and support them, he had gathered up letters, documents, and photographs. He wanted his children and grandchildren to see their ancestors, read their words, and hold in their hands evidence of what they had accomplished once they were no longer in bondage.I, the newest griotte, would be the first to write it all down, and I began to realize I would be the first to explore the discomforting parts of our story. I had many questions. Who were these slaves and slave owners I had heard so much about? How had they influenced who I was? I wanted my ancestors to become real to me. I needed to visualize all of them and understand their sorrows, joys, and passions.I needed to know how Mandy had survived the Middle Passage and life in bondage and how generations of her descendants had endured unrelenting, sometimes life-threatening, racism.And I had to try to understand how James Madison could own some one hundred human beings while knowing that the widespread institution of slavery spat on the moral principles underlying the nation he had helped create.To know my ancestors and find myself in their stories, I had to walk in their footsteps. Virginia, I decided, would be the best place to begin.WRITTEN BY"

And it‚Äôs as simple as embracing some of the things you already enjoy doing in a more mindful and moderate manner?For the past five years we‚Äôve been studying the potential health effects of many so-called ‚Äúvices,‚Äù including beer, bread, and coffee, for our book The Good Vices. By poring over the existing medical literature and drawing on our combined 50 years of experience in medicine and health journalism, we‚Äôve found that in many cases these foods can not only be part of a healthy lifestyle, but when consumed in moderation, they can help power a healthier way of being.It‚Äôs true that bread, made from gluten (what is today considered the most unholy of holies), is unhealthy for people with celiac disease or other wheat sensitivity. But for the vast majority of people, whole grain breads are a healthy food. Whole-grain bread is filling and provides nutrients like vitamins E and B and minerals like iron, magnesium, selenium, and others. It is also a very rich source of dietary fiber, which can lower people‚Äôs bad cholesterol or LDL, improving their heart health in the process.A 2017 Harvard Medical School study looking at 64,714 women and 45,303 men found that people who consumed the lowest levels of gluten were 15% more likely to develop heart disease. In another 2016 report published in BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal), researchers looked at 45 previous studies and concluded that compared to people who ate no wheat, people who consumed 90 grams of whole grains a day reduced their risk for all-cause mortality by 17%.Another 2016 analysis looked at 14 studies with 786,076 people and found that compared to those who ate the least whole-grain foods, people who ate the most had a 16% decreased risk of all-cause mortality and an 18% decreased chance of dying from cardiovascular problems. The study also found that with each 16-gram increase in whole grains people ate, their risk of early death dropped by 7%.Coffee is a beloved beverage with a mixed reputation. But according to most available research, the evidence suggesting that coffee is unhealthy is unfounded. A series of studies published in the 1970s and 1980s tied coffee to higher rates of cancer and heart disease. But these studies failed to adjust for people‚Äôs cigarette habits or other unhealthy lifestyle choices. Despite its frequent blacklisting, a slew of modern studies have reported that moderate coffee drinking ‚Äî three to five cups a day ‚Äî could improve cardiovascular health, lower a person‚Äôs risk of developing stroke, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and type 2 diabetes, and even reduce the chance of dying early from all causes.In a paper published by the American Heart Association in 2014, researchers conducted a systematic review of 36 studies with a combined sample size of more than 1,270,000 people. The study looked at people‚Äôs long-term consumption of coffee and its association with cardiovascular disease. The researchers found that moderate coffee drinkers were at the lowest risk for heart-related problems. Previous studies found similar results and suggested coffee also decreases the likelihood of experiencing a stroke. (This doesn‚Äôt mean you need to drink coffee to prevent stroke, but that the idea that it causes heart problems doesn‚Äôt seem to be accurate at all).Though not recommended, even excessive coffee guzzling (often defined as more than five cups a day) has been shown to have little or no adverse health side effects.Enjoyment may be an important, and all too often forgotten, part of the healthy living equation.We‚Äôll take a taproom over a yoga studio any day (though admittedly that preference is not entirely motivated by health concerns). ‚ÄúMore than 100 prospective studies show an inverse association between moderate drinking and risk of heart attack, ischemic (clot-caused) stroke, peripheral vascular disease, sudden cardiac death, and death from all cardiovascular causes. The effect is fairly consistent, corresponding to a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in risk,‚Äù according to an online analysis from the Harvard School of Public Health.There are, of course, studies that dispute this. For example, a recent major study published in the journal The Lancet came to the sobering conclusion that drinking any alcohol, even moderate amounts, is detrimental to health. The study focused more on relative, not absolute, risk and seemingly contradicted many studies before it, including one published just a few months before in the same journal. As David Spiegelhalter, the Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, noted, one figure in the appendix of the earlier study showed that ‚Äúcompared to moderate drinkers, ‚Äònever-drinkers‚Äô experience 30% more heart disease and strokes, and 20% higher overall death rate. But this does not mean that this is because they don‚Äôt drink.‚Äù Another question the new study leaves unanswered is why people living in certain European countries have a higher life expectancy even though they drink more than people in the United States.While doctors are unlikely to recommend that people increase their drinking for any perceived health benefits, the idea that beer should be blacklisted is unfounded. Moderate drinking is part of many healthy diet patterns around the world.In addition to their possible health benefits, bread, coffee, and beer have something else in common. Eating bread or drinking beer and coffee is something many people enjoy doing. Enjoyment may be an important, and all too often forgotten, part of the healthy living equation.A 2007 study led by Harvard professor of social and behavioral sciences Laura Kubzansky followed more than 6,000 men and women aged 25 to 74 for 20 years and found that emotional vitality ‚Äî a sense enthusiasm, hopefulness, engagement, and so on ‚Äî appeared to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. The link between health and happiness is far from clear, and many questions still remain. However, you don‚Äôt need a body of scientific research to realize that joy is something worth pursuing. Meeting a friend for a coffee or a beer, or biting into a freshly baked baguette are all small joys that can make the daily grind better. There‚Äôs also a great deal of research suggesting that drinking beer or coffee and eating bread in moderation can be part of a healthy diet. At the very least these activities are fun, and fun might be just what the doctor ordered.From THE GOOD VICES by Dr. Harry Ofgang and Erik Ofgang, published by TarcherPerigee, an imprint of The Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC.

214,20 Things I Wish I Could Tell My 20-Year-Old Self,https://humanparts.medium.com/20-things-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-20-year-old-self-c1859651f9?source=extreme_main_feed---------217-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"I met with my 20-year-old self, I imagine I‚Äôd not so much sit down for a quick chat as have a serious discussion to guide her through the coming years. More importantly, I‚Äôd have to write down my advice so she wouldn‚Äôt forget.I think it would look something like this:Absolutely everything else is speculation, projection, or the fodder of your imagination. You are not psychic. Your feelings are not all real. Most of the things you worry about are fearful delusions. You must differentiate reality from imagination for the sake of your sanity.What you intend to do with your life is what will become of your life. No matter the setbacks, no matter how you feel, your intention‚Äîfollowed by action‚Äîwill always dominate your outcomes.Instead of trying to predict what will happen, plan for what will happen. One involves being anxious about the 10% you can‚Äôt control, and the other involves capitalizing on the 90% that you can.Nothing will feel comfortable at first, because you aren‚Äôt used to it. What you condition yourself to is what you will want to do automatically. Choose wisely.Inbox zero, baby. Inbox zero.You don‚Äôt have to wonder whether or not something is meant for you, because if it is, it will be. That‚Äôs all. When you‚Äôre doing the right work, it will come easily, and it will be well-received. When you meet the right person, you will just be together, no questions asked. What‚Äôs meant for you is what‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs not as complicated as you might think.Nobody tells you this, but sometimes you are going to feel like shit‚Äîthere‚Äôs nothing to do but feel like shit until you don‚Äôt feel like shit anymore.You won‚Äôt feel this way forever.But you might if you do one of two things: suppress it or overanalyze it.Entertaining intense fears only makes them seem more real. Suppressing them keeps them stuck within you. There will be nothing to do but allow them to pass. It‚Äôs the meaning you ascribe to your feelings that‚Äôs tripping you up.Feelings are not in your head, they are in your body.You need to stretch, shake, cry, do yoga, walk, talk to a friend, talk to a therapist. Junk journal, write down everything you feel and rip it up and throw it out. Clean your space, donate your old things. All of this is releasing.Sitting around and thinking through the problem one more time is not letting it go ‚Äî it‚Äôs keeping it stuck exactly where it is because you‚Äôre maintaining the energy, and attention, you‚Äôve already spent on it.If you can‚Äôt figure out what you want, start with what you don‚Äôt want. What‚Äôs the opposite of what makes you uncomfortable? What‚Äôs the opposite of what you‚Äôre dissatisfied with? Whenever you‚Äôre unhappy, please ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat is the opposite of this experience?‚Äù That‚Äôs what you want to create.However, you cannot do this all the time, for everyone. Therefore, you need to know who, and what, you value.Not promises, not problems. Not a 20-point checklist about why someone is so perfect for you. Love is a verb. Life is too. Show up for it.Just for one more hour, day, or night. If you don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre going to get through (whatever) just wait one night. One day at a time makes a life.This will help you decide what actually requires your attention. To that end‚Ä¶If there is no action to be taken, you don‚Äôt have a problem.Nobody does. Nobody is supposed to.Seriously, if you want to change anything about your life, just change the way you do one thing daily. You will see how much your little habits are massively impacting your life. Most of your outcomes are the result of behaviors you aren‚Äôt even conscious of.Every time you find yourself consistently uncomfortable‚Äîespecially regarding one particular aspect of your life‚Äîsomething deep within you is telling you that you are capable of more, deserving of more, and destined for more. Let it show you where you need to grow.Make your goals simple and fill each day with meaningful purpose. You will blossom naturally, whereas, if you start to pursue the opposite, you will slowly shut down.You can, and should, be highly ambitious about living a peaceful, purposeful life. You should be highly ambitious about being healthy, or being happy, or having a great group of friends. These, too, are worthwhile pursuits that will impact you even more than making a lot of money.That‚Äôs the goal of financial freedom: to be able to say ‚Äúno‚Äù when you want to.You are responsible for your outcomes. You are responsible for your happiness. You are responsible for your success. You are not inherently more or less capable than anyone else. You are not falling behind. Every single day, ask yourself what you can do to move your life forward. The steps will add up. You will arrive.Don‚Äôt worry so much ‚Äî but don‚Äôt slow down, either.WRITTEN BY"

To rest in other people‚Äôs minds. To connect to other knowledge. It‚Äôs an innately social organism.Therefore, teaching is knowledge‚Äôs oxygen.In teaching what you learn as soon as you learn it, magical things happen before, during, and after:Not only do you learn faster when you teach others, you:‚ÄúWhile we teach, we learn.‚Äù ‚Äî SenecaLearning is NOT just about taking in information. In my experience coaching hundreds of people on learning how to learn, almost no one has a system for processing information. It‚Äôs almost as if people just expect the learning to happen automatically after they read a book, listen to a podcast, watch a lecture, or have a life experience. Looking at text and expecting to learn is not far off from looking at food and expecting to get its nutrients. We need to digest our life experiences just like we digest our food.Without some form of active processing, like teaching, almost everything we read is lost within weeks.In my experience, teaching others what you learn is also more fun and easy to stick toSo what‚Äôs the simplest way to get started?‚ÄúNo one learns as much about a subject as one who is forced to teach it.‚Äù‚Äï Peter DruckerIn a Harvard study, ‚Äúemployees who spent the last 15 minutes of each day of their training period writing and reflecting on what they had learned did 23% better in the final training test than other employees.‚Äù Imagine spending 8 hours in a training, then spending 15 minutes reflecting on what you learned. Amazingly, those 15 minutes are only 1/33 of the total time but drive 20% of the learning gain.Now, imagine what would happen if you spent 15 minutes per day every day reflecting on the lessons you‚Äôve learned and sharing it with others?I can tell you the answer‚Ä¶Learning 20% more per day and having that compound over years is life-changing.Because of the Explanation Effect, I started spending one hour per day reflecting on my learning in college, and I never stopped. I personally attribute this habit to peace of mind, faster learning, and helping me kickstart my career as a writer and teacher.More recently, I created a Facebook Group called the Daily Learning Journal, which now has 5,000+ members, to help others start this habit too. Here‚Äôs how it works‚Ä¶Reader note: The exact percentages in the learning pyramid at the top of this article are not officially backed by research. However, there is quite a bit of research on the power of teaching-to-learn. Furthermore, the percentages really ring true for me and many others, so I decided to include it.

216,A New Battery Breakthrough That Could Save Electric Vehicles During a Recession,https://marker.medium.com/a-new-battery-breakthrough-that-could-save-electric-vehicles-during-a-recession-c193ebdd3a5d?source=extreme_main_feed---------219-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"nother unsuspecting victim of Covid-19 should be electric vehicles: Oil prices have cratered, making gasoline-fueled cars dirt-cheap to run. But a little-noticed breakthrough in automotive batteries has shaken up China‚Äôs EV market, and now is about to arrive in the United States, where GM and VW already have their hands on it.The advance is the result of a global race to substantially reduce expensive cobalt in lithium-ion batteries. Until now, cobalt has been 20% to 33% of the cathode, the heart of lithium-ion batteries. The advance reduces that to 10%, a drop that researchers were calling highly unlikely just six months ago, cutting the price of an electric vehicle and adding up to 25 miles of range. Cobalt ‚Äî sometimes called ‚Äúblood cobalt‚Äù‚Äî also comes largely from a controversial supplier, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where workers toil in often horrible conditions. ‚ÄúThis leap is big because it gets harder and harder to remove the last bit; 33% to 20% is less challenging than 20% to 10%,‚Äù said Venkat Viswanathan, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. ‚ÄúIt becomes exponentially harder to get the cobalt out.‚ÄùThe new, advanced battery, called NMC 811, solves an electrochemistry puzzle that has vexed researchers for more than five years. Already it captured 12% of Chinese EV sales in January, up from less than 1% in 2018, according to Adamas, a Canada-based research firm. LG Chemical, the South Korean battery-maker, made the NMC 811 battery that GM will commercialize next year in its new electric Hummer, the ultra-heavy pickup truck popularized during the first Gulf War in the early 1990s. The revived Hummer will have up to 400 miles of battery life on a charge, GM says, sufficient to erase almost anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúrange anxiety,‚Äù the malady afflicting anyone conjuring a spouse or child stranded on a snowy night in a dead car. After GM, VW says it will introduce the new battery in its own electric vehicles over the next year, and experts say most of the other major carmakers won‚Äôt be far behind.‚ÄúIt seems too good to be true,‚Äù says Tim Grewe, GM‚Äôs director of battery cell development. ‚ÄúBut we do manage to create things that you couldn‚Äôt imagine five years ago.‚ÄùEVs can cost tens of thousands of dollars more than conventional models, and gasoline is selling for an average of $2.15 a gallon, the cheapest in five years. But Tesla ‚Äî by far the dominant player in electrics ‚Äî has demonstrated that large numbers of people will buy the right battery-operated vehicle regardless of gas prices, and most major automakers are wagering that they can significantly boost electric sales. Five years after a criminal scandal over trick devices in its diesel vehicles, VW for one is betting the company on a wholesale transformation to electric.The lithium-ion breakthrough is one clue to how the automakers hope to make the leap to the masses.It turns out that while researchers at universities and national labs had continued to labor away, LG had already reached what the battery field calls ‚Äú811,‚Äù short for NMC containing 80% nickel, 10% manganese, and 10% cobalt.MC is the most widely used type of automotive lithium-ion battery, short for its composition of nickel, manganese, and cobalt. GM was the first to commercialize NMC, a twist on the original lithium-ion battery, invented in 1980. In 2011, an NMC-equipped battery powered GM‚Äôs new plug-in hybrid Volt. From there NMC spread, and it now powers the electric vehicles of every major carmaker on the planet except Tesla, which favors a different formulation called NCA.But what researchers on both NMC and NCA have encountered as they have sought to reduce cobalt is an electrochemical rebellion: Cobalt has served as a balancing agent, and when it‚Äôs been reduced, the other metals have revolted and refused to cooperate with the objective of storing energy. The result: The cathode cracks after just a few charge-and-recharge cycles.A couple of years ago, though, researchers successfully managed a substantial reduction ‚Äî lowering cobalt to 20% of the cathode. Researchers regarded it as a signal triumph; as recently as a few months ago they were saying that further reduction was highly improbable.But on March 4, GM suddenly announced a much-enhanced line of electric vehicles and a new battery pack for a future Cadillac, a self-driving Cruise Origin, and next year‚Äôs Hummer. What the company did not say, and that no one noticed apart from a couple of trade journals, was that the newly unveiled battery achieved the latest cobalt-reduction goal ‚Äî the cathode was just 10% cobalt.It turns out that while researchers at universities and national labs had continued to labor away, LG had already reached what the battery field calls ‚Äú811,‚Äù short for NMC containing 80% nickel, 10% manganese, and 10% cobalt. LG had surprisingly avoided the usual cracking. When you add up the entire cobalt reduction you also knock up to about $2,400 off the price of a car, says Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs Viswanathan. In part, the solution was doping the cathode with alumina (along with other trade secrets), according to Grewe, the GM battery official.A notable aspect of the advance is its origin ‚Äî researchers working at the bench. For years, researchers attempting various breakthrough efforts in lithium-ion and futuristic battery types like lithium oxygen have faced nothing but frustration. It reached the point where one wondered whether the physics of batteries are simply too hard. In that vein, NMC 811 is a sign of hope for battery science. Now, says Grewe, the LG and GM teams are working to reduce the cobalt even further.For the last decade, though, all but unnoticed to the broader public, GM has gone after electrics in a very serious way.GM is perhaps the most surprising presence at the forefront of the electric car race. Over the years, the company has produced some of history‚Äôs most iconic vehicles ‚Äî among them, the 1957 Chevy, the 1959 Cadillac DeVille, the 1963 Corvette, and the 1969 Camaro. As a company, General Motors was the very archetype of American capitalism at its admired peak, year after year turning out models that were snapped up by Americans and status-seeking buyers across the globe.But the 1980s killed that winning image. GM went flabby with the rest of Detroit, producing grandmotherly mediocrities with mixed quality, opening a yawning space for Japanese automakers to capture the market for high-quality, desirable, mainstream vehicles.For the last decade, though, all but unnoticed to the broader public, GM has gone after electrics in a very serious way. The groundbreaking 2011 Volt, which traveled 35 miles on a fully charged battery before the engine took over, was named car of the year by Motor Trend magazine. In 2017, the company won the same prize for the Bolt, an all-electric, $37,500 sedan that went an at-the-time astonishing 238 miles on a charge, beating the Tesla Model 3 to market by several months. Both the Volt and Bolt were deliciously decked out vehicles ¬≠ ‚Äî lacking the elegant sexuality of a Tesla, but reliably handsome, durable, and stacked with technology.Now GM‚Äôs hat trick is reimagining the cultish classic Hummer, a gas-guzzler, as an electric. With the Volt and the Bolt, GM fell flat on sales, and one of the reasons was incompetent promotion ‚Äî the company failed to market the cars, leaving the field to Elon Musk, who today is as synonymous with electric cars as Steve Jobs was with the smartphone.This time, GM is not only boasting that it is first, but intends to license its battery to rivals.M is first to the global market, but not to China. Last year, China‚Äôs NIO said it had the world‚Äôs first electric vehicle using NMC 811, an SUV with a battery made by CATL, a large Chinese battery producer that appears to have used a different method to achieve the same advance. After NIO, a rush to NMC 811 broke out ‚Äî resulting in it ending up in 6% of EVs and plug-in hybrids sold in China last year as a whole, says Ryan Castilloux, managing director of Adamas Intelligence. CATL‚Äôs NMC 811 will also be in the new electric VWs, though it is not clear when they will go on sale.Tesla, too, is in the NMC 811 game in China, supplying its Model 3s with LG‚Äôs battery. That is a surprise since ordinarily Musk insists on using only NCA, which still relies on cobalt but substitutes aluminum for the manganese. In a 2018 call with Wall Street analysts, Musk said that Model 3 cobalt content in its NCA battery was already lower than anyone would achieve in future deployment of NMC 811.VW, too, is viewed as determined to rival Tesla for electric sales, and the NMC advance puts both companies in position for the first time to mount fierce competition against combustion for mainstream motorists.Jeff Chamberlain, who runs Volta Energy Technologies, an Illinois battery investment firm, said NMC 811 is ‚Äúbig‚Äù but not a paradigmatic advance, like for instance, figuring out how to stabilize pure metallic lithium anodes, another of the field‚Äôs major current goals.There appears to be no public data describing how CATL or Tesla stabilize their cathodes. But in a paper in January, Jeff Dahn, a professor at Dalhousie University in Canada, and Yulong Liu, a PhD student, suggested using large, single crystals, rather than relatively small, polycrystalline particles. The paper attracted much attention in the battery community.There may be no other GM vehicle with a better chance of becoming a bestselling electric than the Hummer, which comes with a fixed base of hardcore fans. VW, too, is viewed as determined to rival Tesla for electric sales, and the NMC advance puts both companies in position for the first time to mount fierce competition against combustion for mainstream motorists.Says Castilloux: ‚Äú811 has been viewed as the near-term frontier of innovation for EV batteries, and those who view themselves as leaders have been in a race to get there.‚ÄùWRITTEN BY"
217,"The At-Home DNA Testing Fad Is Over, But Companies Still Have Your Data",https://onezero.medium.com/the-at-home-dna-testing-fad-is-over-but-companies-still-have-your-data-1b3aa11d313a?source=extreme_main_feed---------220-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"or the past few years, it seemed like everyone and their mom was buying an at-home DNA testing kit. Millions of people bought tests from 23andMe, Ancestry, and other companies to learn about their heritage, connect with long-lost relatives, and discover their risk of certain medical conditions. People ordered them in droves for holiday and birthday gifts, and others bought 23andMe tests at Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart while getting their prescriptions filled.But now, the enthusiasm for consumer DNA tests is waning. Sales of DNA kits have slowed, and in January, 23andMe said it was laying off 100 employees, about 14% of its workforce. This week, Ancestry announced it is also letting go of 100 people, around 6% of its employees. ‚ÄúOver the last 18 months, we have seen a slowdown in consumer demand across the entire DNA category,‚Äù Ancestry president and CEO Margo Georgiadis said in a blog post.The post alluded to privacy as one reason for the slowdown. ‚ÄúFuture growth will require a continued focus on building consumer trust and innovative new offerings that deliver even greater value to people,‚Äù said Georgiadis. In an interview with CNBC, 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki also acknowledged that privacy could be a factor.Concerns around what companies can do with customers‚Äô DNA and who they share it with have mounted in recent years, especially after law enforcement officials announced in 2018 that they had used an online DNA database to identify a suspect in the decades-old Golden State Killer case. Detectives uploaded the suspected killer‚Äôs DNA profile to GEDmatch, a free genealogical service where users upload their raw genetic data from DNA testing companies. The website was originally created to help adoptees find their birth parents but is increasingly being used to help crack cold cases. Though 23andMe and Ancestry don‚Äôt directly share customers‚Äô data with law enforcement and said they will fight search warrants, there‚Äôs increasing pressure from police for them to do so.And if you‚Äôve opted to allow your DNA to be used for research, it could be shared with other scientists and organizations outside of the company that conducted your DNA analysis.Even if you haven‚Äôt used an at-home DNA test, your genetic data could be at risk.Adding to privacy concerns, the Pentagon recently warned members of the military against purchasing DNA kits like 23andMe and Ancestry, saying in a December memo that these tests ‚Äúcould expose personal and genetic information, and potentially create unintended security consequences.‚ÄùQuestions about security may also be affecting sales. In 2018, DNA testing company MyHeritage revealed that a data breach in 2017 exposed the email addresses and encrypted passwords of 92 million users. At the time, the company said it stored other data, including users‚Äô DNA data, in a separate system that was not affected by the breach. Genome sequencing firm Veritas Genetics also reported a breach that included customer information but not DNA data last November; it has since ended its service for U.S. customers.Even if you haven‚Äôt used an at-home DNA test, your genetic data could be at risk. A 2018 study led by Yaniv Erlich, the chief science officer at MyHeritage, found that about 60% of people in the U.S. with European ancestry ‚Äî including those that have not undergone genetic testing themselves ‚Äî can be identified through their DNA using data from open genetic genealogy databases like GEDmatch. Once one or more of a person‚Äôs relatives are found on a database, their identity can be determined through their family lineages, combined with demographic information available elsewhere on the internet, such as their approximate age or area of residence.People may no longer be buying DNA kits en masse, but DNA testing companies still have their users‚Äô genetic data, which in itself is hugely valuable. 23andMe is using users‚Äô DNA profiles and self-reported health data to develop its own drugs and form drug discovery partnerships with pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithKline. And removing your DNA from companies‚Äô databases isn‚Äôt as easy as you might think. You can delete your profile from sites like 23andMe and Ancestry, but if you‚Äôve contributed your data for research, you can only remove it from future studies, not ones in progress.If DNA testing companies want to win over new customers, they‚Äôll first have to address the privacy issue. But even if they do, they will also need to figure out how to get users to come back to a service that, in most instances, is a one-time experience. Most people pay for a DNA test once and might only check back when the company adds a new feature, and this is why it may seem as though the DNA testing market has hit a saturation point. People who were interested in mapping their family trees or learning their ancestry likely have already bought DNA kits, and those who haven‚Äôt may still not see the value in them. ‚ÄúThe DNA market is at an inflection point now that most early adopters have entered the category,‚Äù Georgiadis said in the blog post.Ancestry is investing in a new DNA health testing service in an attempt to keep users coming back. In October, it announced the launch of a health test that will report on your risk of a handful of medical conditions, as well as a membership service that promises to offer more health insights over time. But consumer DNA tests analyze only a small number of genes, so they only provide limited information about disease risks. Often, it‚Äôs unclear how useful this information is to your health, and for otherwise healthy people, doctors haven‚Äôt figured out how to use this data in patient care.In the future, it‚Äôs likely that people will get their entire genome sequenced as part of routine medical care, ending the need for consumer DNA health tests. And companies analyzing genetic data and the medical institutions using that information will face the same privacy and security issues, just on a much larger scale.WRITTEN BY"
218,5 Tips To Know Before You Start Developing Your App with Flutter,https://medium.com/flutter-community/5-tips-to-know-before-you-start-developing-your-app-with-flutter-50771507dae0?source=extreme_main_feed---------221-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"When I started learning Flutter, I did not always think about canceling my stream subscription because that was something I never heard about.But what I learned is that even if your widget is no longer alive, well, your stream subscription still is! And that can become a major issue when the widget is re-created a certain number of times, leading to possible process overload!To prevent that, you could just add a conditional block that checks if the widget is mounted, but that would still result in a useless loss of performance.So to prevent that here is how you should manage your stream subscription in Flutter:But the easiest way can sometimes be to just use a StreamBuilder. It is a very powerful widget that will manage the state of its child depending on the stream provided! If you want to know more I would suggest that you read this article from Manzurur Rahman Khan.Let‚Äôs say that whenever the user receives a certain type of notification, you want to push a view corresponding to the notification.The problem would be that you don‚Äôt have access to any BuildContext object which will result in no way to access the current instance of the Navigator.The solution is to create an instance of GlobalKey and store it in a global variable anywhere you want. Then simply specify that the navigator key parameter of your MaterialApp instance should be this variable.Now you can simply access the current Navigator state by using the GlobalKey!It can sometimes be tempting to instantiate non-final variables in stateless widgets but that‚Äôs something you should always avoid because stateless widgets are immutable which means that they are not supposed to change even a bit!If you need a non-final variable, consider using a Stateful widget instead!If you already work with Flutter in your daily life, you probably know how Flutter can be extremely verbose, making you re-write the same code over and over!But, instead of being lazy and just copy-pasting your code, you should create reusable widgets! That will save you a ton of time and make your code more maintainable!If you don‚Äôt see how you could do that, you can check this article!Did you even know that Dart had a const constructor? A const constructor is pretty useful in terms of performance and the reason for it is simple!Let‚Äôs say that you create a simple text widget that displays ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô. You want to display this text in different places of your app but the thing is that you don‚Äôt want to instantiate it more than once.The solution that may come to your mind if you never heard about const constructors would be to define a global variable containing the text widget. But this solution is not really‚Ä¶ esthetic.As you probably guessed it, the good solution here would be to use a const constructor! A const constructor will store the instance and returns it wherever you create the same instance of your class with a const constructor!So basically, you will only have one instance of your text widget if you always use it with a const constructor, no matter how many times you ‚Äòinstantiate‚Äô it in your code.I hope you liked this article :)https://www.twitter.com/FlutterCommWRITTEN BY"
219,A Shot of CRISPR Could Restore Sight to the Blind,https://onezero.medium.com/how-a-shot-of-crispr-could-restore-sight-to-the-blind-2be74bab44e8?source=extreme_main_feed---------222-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"cientists have used the gene-editing technique CRISPR in an attempt to restore vision in a patient with a type of inherited blindness, researchers announced last week.The experimental treatment is meant to snip out a genetic mutation that causes severe visual impairment, often starting at birth. It also marks the first time doctors have used CRISPR directly inside a person‚Äôs body. In a few weeks, they hope to know whether the treatment is working. If it works and is safe, it opens up the possibility of using CRISPR against many more conditions.CRISPR is a powerful technique often likened to molecular scissors for its ability to cut DNA with relative ease. Scientists think it could be applied to a variety of diseases to delete or correct faulty segments of DNA. Repairing DNA at its source could stop or reverse diseases in their tracks rather than just treating symptoms like the vast majority of drugs are designed to do. The hope is that CRISPR could be a one-time, permanent treatment.It has already been used to treat a handful of people with genetic blood disorders and advanced cancers. In those cases, doctors removed cells from patients‚Äô bodies, used CRISPR to edit the cells in a lab, and infused the edited cells back into patients. So far, that approach looks safe in these studies, but it‚Äôs too soon to know how effective it is.The blindness trial uses CRISPR in a different way. Doctors plan to treat up to 18 adults and children with a particular genetic mutation that causes Leber congenital amaurosis, a rare genetic eye disorder. Many people who have the disorder are legally blind, though some can recognize light or movement. It can be caused by mutations in several genes, but this trial will only target one gene, known as CEP290. Mutations in this gene prevent cells in the retina from making a protein that‚Äôs crucial to vision.The hope is that CRISPR could be a one-time, permanent treatment.CRISPR is made up of two parts: a cutting protein and a guide molecule programmed to tell the cutting protein what sequence of DNA to cut. The scientists behind this treatment programmed CRISPR to find and slice out the problematic mutation in CEP290. The hope is that cutting out the mutation will kickstart the production of the necessary protein and restore some degree of vision.Doctors at Oregon Health and Science University injected a few drops of the treatment behind the patient‚Äôs retina, and now they must wait. To test vision improvement, the patients will eventually walk through obstacle courses in rooms with different levels of light.The therapy, developed by Irish pharmaceutical company Allergan and the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based CRISPR startup Editas Medicine, is still in its early stages. For one thing, the investigators don‚Äôt know what dose will be enough to restore eyesight. They plan to test three different doses, starting with the lowest dose in older patients with the most profound vision loss. If the first few attempts go smoothly, they will treat more patients. As another precaution, doctors will only treat one eye at first. If the treatment works, people in the trial could get the CRISPR injection in the other eye, too.Promising as it could be, the treatment comes with risks. One of the biggest is that CRISPR could cause unintended edits elsewhere in the body known as off-target effects. The eye is a good first target for using CRISPR in the body because it‚Äôs easily accessible and only requires a short procedure. By directly injecting a small amount of CRISPR in the eye, scientists can ensure that gene editing won‚Äôt occur in other body parts.In the other ongoing CRISPR trials, scientists can confirm they‚Äôve made the right edits to cells in the lab before putting the cells back into the body.CRISPR could have the power to create a permanent fix for certain diseases, but that also means it could also create permanent DNA damage ‚Äî something scientists want to avoid at all costs. Despite its promise, scientists are moving cautiously to make sure these treatments are safe and don‚Äôt cause any unwanted edits. They may be starting small by focusing on the eye, but what they learn from this research could have big impacts in the years to come.WRITTEN BY"
220,What to Do If Your Startup is Running Out of Cash,https://marker.medium.com/how-to-manage-a-business-thats-running-out-of-cash-a9e109a2f254?source=extreme_main_feed---------223-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"ver the course of just a couple of weeks, economic activity has slowed dramatically. Companies are freezing new purchases in nonessential areas. Consumer spending is slowing down. And investors are fearful as they watch their portfolios tank.As business owners, these financial challenges mean we have some hard decisions to face, especially when it comes to retaining our staff and managing our dwindling cash reserves.A lot of people are asking me what other CEOs are doing. While it‚Äôs reassuring to know how others are reacting, I encourage you to make decisions based on your specific situation. To that end, here are some of the essential questions to ask yourself in order to successfully lead your company through the coronavirus crisis and to regain control of your cash flow.When you spend more than you earn, your business can only exist for so long. The length of time you can survive while making a loss every month is your runway.Estimating your runway is tricky since there are many unknowns. You‚Äôll need to run some financial models that forecast what might happen in a worst-case scenario. For example, you should map out what would happen to your runway if:For companies in the U.K., here‚Äôs a useful checklist that outlines ways to improve your cash flow and extend your runway, including the latest government measures available to small businesses.A month ago, if you‚Äôd come to me with a six-month runway, I would‚Äôve told you to start cutting your costs so you could survive longer. Now, I believe you should proactively reduce your costs if you have less than 12 months of runway.Even truly outstanding companies will find it harder to raise funding in the next few months because virtually all companies, including their existing investments, are depleting their cash balances at the same time. The hard part is working out how much to cut, and then cutting it. The longer you wait to make this decision, the more you‚Äôll have to cut just to stay solvent.Reducing your costs is the financial equivalent of ‚Äúflattening the curve.‚Äù Investors can‚Äôt fund all good companies at once.There are many ways for any company to cut costs, and you should investigate all of them. However, for most startups, people are the biggest cost.There are some temporary options to consider first.Many founders and employees may be open to taking a salary cut if it means the company can stay afloat and they can avoid unemployment. Another option is a furlough ‚Äî unpaid leave ‚Äî where staff stop working temporarily until they‚Äôre able to restart.However, there‚Äôs a harder, scarier, and more permanent option that I know many of you will have to look at: laying off part of your team.To put it bluntly: If your runway is short and if you don‚Äôt reduce your head count, you‚Äôre likely to face bankruptcy.It‚Äôs going to feel like an impossible decision, and I truly feel for you. Laying off people you know and care about when they haven‚Äôt done anything wrong, during the biggest economic crisis of our time, can seem incredibly cold and insensitive.However, if you‚Äôre facing a choice between layoffs and bankruptcy, you don‚Äôt really have a choice at all.Psychologist Paul Bloom defines empathy as ‚Äúfeeling what other people are feeling‚Äù and warns us that empathy alone is a terrible decision-maker. He points out that empathy is innumerate (it‚Äôs easier to empathize with one person than an entire company), biased (we empathize more with people that look like us), and it can be weaponized (leaving you open to manipulation).Moreover, Bloom warns that literally feeling other people‚Äôs emotions, especially during a crisis, can leave you exhausted and burned out.Instead, Bloom recommends substituting empathy with compassion. When you act with compassion, you still care deeply about people, respect them, and sympathize with their situation. However, you don‚Äôt feel what they feel ‚Äî for your own sake.Ideally, if you reach the stage where you need to do layoffs, you should video call each employee individually to deliver the bad news. Explain the situation and the actions you‚Äôve taken to secure the business. Be grateful, vulnerable, and proactive about the support you can offer. Pay them what they‚Äôre owed, maybe even with a generous severance if you can afford it.It‚Äôs a huge struggle to stay motivated during a crisis, especially when your co-workers are leaving. And this goes for founders, too.A crisis is the true test of your company‚Äôs mission.In nonbusiness use, the word ‚Äúmission‚Äù is reserved for the most important and inspiring jobs. It would be weird to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on a mission to do the washing up,‚Äù unless the magnitude of the cleaning was so large that you‚Äôd earn someone‚Äôs respect just for trying.And that‚Äôs a good way to think about your company‚Äôs mission: It‚Äôs the most important thing you‚Äôre trying to achieve. After all, if your ultimate goal isn‚Äôt important, what‚Äôs the point in working hard?If you‚Äôre looking to reformulate your mission to reinspire your team, start with this simple format: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a mission to help __[customers] __[achieve an important goal/outcome].‚ÄùYou can‚Äôt have a business without customers, so this will clarify whom you‚Äôre serving and why you‚Äôre serving them. If your mission isn‚Äôt motivating, maybe it‚Äôs time to find a mission that is and work on that.This isn‚Äôt just a global health and economic crisis. Each and every one of us is living our own mini-crises right now. And your team is no exception.They have their own medical concerns, parents and grandparents to worry about, children to look after. They have food to buy, homes to run, and new, enforced routines to manage.And you can count on one thing: You don‚Äôt know the half of it. As a leader, you‚Äôre often the last to know if your team isn‚Äôt happy. Don‚Äôt assume that they are ‚Äúdoing great‚Äù if you aren‚Äôt aware of anything in particular.Try setting up a support group a couple of times a week. It may sound intimidating, but here‚Äôs a simple format that works:You may be surprised by how many different ways this crisis affects people ‚Äî especially if you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to have kids at home. Listen to your team, acknowledge their challenges, and support them wherever you can ‚Äî even if that means providing extra flexibility. It might make all the difference.With new measures and policies coming in on a daily basis, your team needs to know where they stand. However, if you‚Äôve just started working from home, your communication levels are probably going down, not up.Even if you finished planning your quarterly goals just a few weeks ago, it might not be clear whether priorities have changed. Indeed, it‚Äôs hard to imagine they haven‚Äôt changed, and in most cases, you‚Äôll need to replan. And this needs to be communicated to your team explicitly.The correct meeting structure is critical at a time like this. You should adopt meetings that minimize communication problems, such as:You can also create additional meetings and communication channels to support people that are new to remote working. But aside from setting up the right meetings, it also matters what you say.Take the opportunity to repeat your company‚Äôs mission in every meeting, and clarify what‚Äôs most important right now. Share any context and information you have, so your team can act and plan accordingly.It‚Äôs wise to work on your own fears and anxieties outside of team meetings. After all, emotions can go viral inside companies too. Before addressing the team, take a moment to ground yourself with some deep breaths.If you can, find a way to laugh at yourself. Done well, humor can break the tension and increase people‚Äôs spirits.Communication is about listening, not just speaking. Pay attention to your team‚Äôs questions, and answer them as honestly as you can. Their questions will give you an insight into what they really care about, and your honesty will earn their trust.There‚Äôs still so much we don‚Äôt know. No one knows how long this crisis will last. We don‚Äôt know how serious the economic, financial, and social consequences will be. And we don‚Äôt know how many people will lose their lives. We‚Äôre all in a period of great uncertainty, trying to do the right thing.However, if you‚Äôre close to running out of money, now is the time for strong and decisive leadership. Decide which measures you must take to give your business the runway it needs, and act accordingly.Many founders are driven by the idea of making an impact. But the biggest impact we ever make is on the people nearest us. Be kind to each other, and be kind to yourself.I‚Äôm Dave and I coach CEOs of Series A+ tech companies.

We still attempt to communicate by omission, sometimes for brevity‚Äôs sake, other times through comfort or laziness. It‚Äôs the assumption that we don‚Äôt need to say what we‚Äôre thinking, what emotional state we‚Äôre in or why we‚Äôre behaving a particular way because the other person should know. We would rather spend our time with the fall-out conversations that begin ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve been together X amount of years, I shouldn‚Äôt have to spell this out‚Äô or ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre supposed to get me.‚Äô When we expect those closest to us to know full-time what we mean or how something will make us feel, we are giving them less help and support in the act than we would a stranger.

222,Why Silicon Valley Is All Wrong About the Cybertruck,https://onezero.medium.com/cybertruck-697cd63515df?source=extreme_main_feed---------225-49----------bd856b86de98----------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"Silicon Valley is all wrong about the Cybertruck, but not like it was wrong about Apple‚Äôs AirPods or Amazon‚Äôs Echo Show.The Cybertruck reimagines what a truck is, constitutionally. It‚Äôs such a savage departure from our expectations that define a ‚Äútruck‚Äù that we need a new word. It‚Äôs in a class of its own.The Cybertruck may be hired for similar jobs as the Ford F-150 (as Musk asserted), but it consequates much more.Personally, I see parallels to Steve Jobs‚Äô 2007 launch of the iPhone ‚Äî a generation-defining moment that birthed a new category: ‚Äúan iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator.‚Äù It may have been unknown that day, but it didn‚Äôt take long to feel the enormity of the iPhone‚Äôs importance as a modifier of human experience. I have a similar sense about the Cybertruck, at least in terms of the symbolism it offers and what its design portends.Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck is a truck like the iPhone is a phone. Though the word ‚Äúphone‚Äù is embedded in the name iPhone, it primarily serves as an homage to the category it redefined; as an anchor to the familiar, rather than as a predictor of its potential.Similarly, Cybertruck necessarily encodes the word ‚Äútruck‚Äù in its name to throw people off. By aligning with today‚Äôs popular conception of ‚Äútruckness‚Äù (big, heavy towing capacity, acceleration, roominess), Tesla can buy time to fulfill its grander ambitions.In the same way the ‚Äúi‚Äù in iPhone concealed the ultimate arc of the device, the ‚Äúcyber‚Äù in Cybertruck holds the secret for what comes next and points to why Silicon Valley (with the exception of Marques Brownlee) has got it all wrong.Again.The last time my words failed me, I was in Pittsburgh in the early 2000s. Before I could even see it, I heard the low rumble of a military battlecraft masquerading as an SUV swerving down a city street.At its consumer debut, the Hummer was controversial and brash, having exited the theater of war with modest modifications to make it more suitable for the theater of cul de sacs and tricycles. Despite its girthiness in the suburbs, the Hummer‚Äôs pedigree made it a preferable choice for pummeling through the hinterland. These days, Hummer sightings are rare, as its ridiculously low fuel economy (10 miles per gallon) came up against the economic hardships of the Great Recession, critically dampening demand. GM then attempted, and failed, to sell off the brand. Hummer production ceased in 2010.The story of the Hummer is relevant not just because its appearance disabused our stereotypes of what a truck should look like, but also because the Hummer was one of the first vehicles ordained with autonomous self-driving superpowers. In 2003, I was attending Carnegie Mellon University and worked on a design project on telematics ‚Äî the year before CMU‚Äôs Red Team entered Sandstorm and H1ghlander into the DARPA Grand Challenge, a 142-mile race for self-driving cars with a $1 million prize bounty.As it had with amphibious vehicles in earlier wars and the Cold War, the military sought to advance the development of autonomous vehicles to get an upper hand in what was turning out to be increasingly urban fields of battle in Afghanistan and Iraq and to counter improvisational tactics of foreign fighters. Vehicles that could drive themselves could greatly reduce U.S. casualties from roadside bombs and IEDs. The Grand Challenge offered a cost-effective way to drive innovation in the event that the Iraq War took longer than expected.With the deposition of Saddam Hussein, the U.S. mission became less clear. What was sold as a mission to liberate the Iraqi people from a mad dictator hellbent on using weapons of mass destruction on his neighbors turned into a rudderless occupation. Following a succession of idempotent civilian leaders, the army finally installed anti-insurgency expert General David Petraeus. He advocated for a high-touch, human-intensive, door-to-door approach to win over the hearts and minds of the Iraqi population, effectively nixing the promise of autonomous Humvee patrols. That, and the increasing reliance on overhead surveillance and drone attacks, meant that vehicular autonomy would need to find another market.More than a decade later, these technology solutions have finally entered the consumer market as mobility products from startups like Tesla, Uber, Cruise, and others. Google (doing business as Waymo) hired many engineers straight from the DARPA Grand Challenge, including Chris Urmson, the technical team lead of the CMU team that won the 2007 Urban Challenge; Mike Montemerlo, the software lead for the Stanford team that won in 2005; and ex-Otto, ex-Uber, and Church of A.I. founder Anthony Levandowski, who built the world‚Äôs first autonomous motorcycle that participated in a DARPA Grand Challenge.The DARPA Grand Challenge provided a glimpse of vehicles behaving in a way we‚Äôd never seen before, but they were built for hostile, dusty, and remote environs that seldom resembled the urban environments where most of us drive. Back in 2004, it was hard to envision derivatives of Sandstorm and H1ghlander driving down Main Street. But now, that once-impossible future seems to be just around the corner ‚Äî or now, if you took Elon Musk at his word six months ago.Lex Friedman: Do you see Tesla‚Äôs full self-driving as‚Ä¶ requiring supervision of the human being?Elon Musk: I think it will require detecting hands on wheel for at least six months or something like that from here.Of course, Musk has to believe this. Autopilot‚Äôs success is essential to Tesla‚Äôs viability.Furthermore, Musk cites Blade Runner 2049 as a direct inspiration for the Cybertruck‚Äôs design. While it‚Äôs possible that Tesla designers took only external aesthetic cues from these vehicles, it‚Äôs worth noting that most modern sci-fi films portray a collaborative relationship between the human driver and a conversational self-driving system‚Äîlike Autopilot. The inspiration, therefore, may go deeper than just the angular lines to reveal a different kind of utilitarian relationship between humans and their modes of transport.Lest we forget, Musk‚Äôs ultimate goal isn‚Äôt to dominate terrestrial roadways (though that may happen along the way), but rather to create the preconditions for the human race to persist ‚Äî on this planet and as a multiplanetary species. He said it himself ‚Äî while the Cybertruck may find its first home on planet Earth, the Tesla Cybertruck may well be destined to become the first manned vehicle to drive the surface of Mars:So, rather than the buggy-style rovers portrayed in Ad Astra being the future of extraterrestrial mobility‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ perhaps subsequent iterations of the Tesla Cybertruck might look more like the RT02 of Prometheus on planet LV223:Before humanity‚Äôs initial interstellar exploits, our relationships with discrete technologies are going to change.Today, many people love their phones and their cars. So important are these relationships that some go so far as to name their devices like they would their pets or offspring. And while a deep personal connection between phone and owner will persist, I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôll hold for vehicular accomplices.Yes, we will own cars in the future, but they‚Äôll be more like trophies‚Äîmore like Cameron‚Äôs dad in Ferris Bueller‚Äôs Day Off. Sure, a few hundred thousand people may buy out the first release of Tesla Cybertrucks (to fund subsequent development, just like with the Roadster), but a long-term play for self-driving vehicles has always been unlocking fractional ownership, with hordes of car-for-hire vehicles roaming the streets like a pack of AutoM8s in Daniel Suarez‚Äôs prescient sci-fi novel Daemon and earning their owners some extra cash by operating as autonomous public taxis. This was and is the generational game plan for Uber, Lyft, and especially Tesla. Have you read parts of the Tesla licensing agreement or Musk‚Äôs 2016 Master Plan, Part Deux? It‚Äôs all there, spelled out for you:When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination.You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you‚Äôre at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.For those of us who have never owned a vehicle (like me!), nothing much will change, except we will become the majority. Sure, we‚Äôll still appreciate the attractiveness of particular models, but in a detached, ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs nice‚Äù kind of way. The Cybertruck‚Äôs low-poly brutalist lines will only make it easier (over time) to see this device as pure utility, rather than an object of desire. It commands respect but not lust (unlike some of Tesla‚Äôs previous designs). This visual language is intentional and is about rewriting the rules of how we interrelate with vehicles.As Kara Swisher has pointed out, owning a car will soon be as quaint as owning a horse.I can‚Äôt pinpoint the origin of my interest in ‚Äúcyber‚Äù stuff. Maybe it was reading Marc Silvestri‚Äôs comic Cyber Force or the government‚Äôs goofy use of ‚Äúcyberspace‚Äù to refer to the internet (see also USCYBERCOM). Or maybe it‚Äôs because ‚Äúcybersex‚Äù emerged as something else to do in AOL chat rooms.Regardless, Norbert Wiener is the guy who coined the neologism in his 1948 book, Cybernetics, and words matter.Assuming I‚Äôm even 20% right about Tesla‚Äôs ambitions for the Cybertruck, and that, in the self-driving future, we treat our cars like we treat lawnmowers, and the Cybertruck‚Äôs exoskeleton design is built without curves because the metal is necessary for interplanetary use, then the choice of ‚Äúcyber‚Äù wasn‚Äôt just cool or incidental. No, the Greek origin of the word ‚Äúcyber‚Äù means something specific.In Cybernetics, Wiener writes:We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or in the animal, by the name Cybernetics, which we form from the Greek œÄŒ∑Œ¥Œ±ŒªŒπŒøœçœáŒøœÇ or steersman. In choosing this term, we wish to recognize that the first significant paper on feedback mechanisms is an article on governors, which was published by Clerk Maxwell in 1868, and that governor is derived from a Latin corruption of œÄŒ∑Œ¥Œ±ŒªŒπŒøœçœáŒøœÇ. We also wish to refer to the fact that the steering engines of a ship are indeed one of the earliest and best-developed forms of feedback mechanisms.The Cybertruck, therefore, is but a rudder intended to steer humanity toward its own salvation. How else do you move such a stubborn animal race forward if not by goading us from one mirage to another, enlisting us as our own accomplices as Musk continues his march to translate cyber fiction into cyber fact.I hope you enjoy the ride.WRITTEN BY"

The summer night was cool; the stars glowed.‚ÄúA book with a name like that should make the author a bundle,‚Äù Vic said with a snort and a twinge of writer‚Äôs jealousy.‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs an interesting idea,‚Äù Richard protested. I imagined his scowl, but it was too dark to see it. ‚ÄúYou need to know the language of love essential to your partner. It may not be the same as yours.‚Äù‚ÄúOK. Tell us,‚Äù I said.‚ÄúQuality time. Touch. Gifts,‚Äù Richard began.‚ÄúWhat else?‚Äù I asked.‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶ Acts of Service and something about affirmation. Oh yeah. Words of Affirmation.‚ÄùVic and I hooted into the night sky and poked each other in the ribs.‚ÄúAffirmation,‚Äù Vic said. ‚ÄúThat is top of your list.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd you are clearly an Acts of Service guy,‚Äù I popped back.I loved affirmation, spoken words of appreciation. I thrived on compliments about the food, the beauty of the flower gardens, or a piece I‚Äôd written. I never tired of hearing that I was beautiful. Vic appreciated the small things I did for him and told me so every day. Affirmed, recognized, and loved, I was easily persuaded to pack his suitcase for a trip even if I wasn‚Äôt going along, or cook pasta and tomato sauce for dinner when I‚Äôd prefer brown rice.Acts of service made Vic feel loved. He sweetly requested rather than demanded help when he needed it. Packing that suitcase or a vegan lunch for work, sticking a little love note on the wax paper wrapping of his tofu sandwich, helping him choose clothes that were color coordinated. I didn‚Äôt complain about reading his book galleys when they came in the middle of an Arizona vacation even though I wanted to go hiking ‚Äî or I didn‚Äôt complain as much as Vic did.‚ÄúThis is what you always wanted,‚Äù I teased after Vic became ill, when there was little to joke about. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm devoting my whole life to serving you.‚Äù We laughed, but we knew. He needed a motherly nurse and I was willing to do anything to keep him alive. He affirmed me with gratitude until his death.We liked being physically close so agreed on the Gift of Touch. We craved small caresses, pats, and hugs. Vic awoke early and was downstairs at his desk drinking coffee by the time I finished meditating in the morning. I came into his office and stood beside his desk chair. He put his arm around my waist or patted me on the butt. I caressed his hair and rubbed his neck.‚ÄúDid you have any dreams?‚Äù he‚Äôd ask. I‚Äôd tell him if I did.‚ÄúAnd did you dream?‚Äù I asked. Or when he was sick: ‚ÄúHow are you feeling, top of head to toe and did you sleep?‚Äù We were interested in each other, so all our time together was quality.Gifts? No problem. Neither of us cared much about gifts. Instead of Christmas gifts, we saved money for a trip in March or something we wanted for the house or a tractor implement.I would add a sixth language of love: Tolerance. I could be irritable and anxious. He could be testy and rushed. I got tired of his need for mothering and the demands his career. He became exasperated by my lack of self-confidence and excess of complaints. I was exhausted from the last two years of care-taking. But he rarely forgot how hard it was to care for a dying man. Our intolerances were replaced by love and sorrow.We usually spoke each other‚Äôs language of love. When we forgot, we still had tolerance.‚ÄîThis story was originally published on Elaine Mansfield and republished on The Good Men Project.WRITTEN BY"
224,Here‚Äôs Why You Give Up on Most of Your Goals After Two Weeks,https://humanparts.medium.com/heres-why-you-give-up-on-most-of-your-goals-after-two-weeks-37b42aabc026?source=extreme_main_feed---------227-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"If you‚Äôre like most people, you‚Äôve probably come up with ‚Äî and subsequently given up on ‚Äî far more goals than you‚Äôve ever realized.Your goals tend to be short-lived, and easy to forget.Remember that inclusive Facebook group you were going to start? That side-business that seemed so viable? That nutrition plan? That workout regime?It‚Äôs practically human nature to see a solution, recognize its potential to solve a problem in our lives, and then to give up on it once we‚Äôre past the peak of our discomfort. Most of your goals fail within 14 days ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs happening.If you were to keep a spreadsheet of every ‚Äúbig idea‚Äù you‚Äôve ever had, you‚Äôd probably notice a roughly two-week falloff point. This is because we make goals when we‚Äôre in that peak state of dissatisfaction and we lose motivation when we return to our baseline of comfort. We initiate a goal (the first workout, the down payment, the first hours logged) to satiate our desire to feel as though the problem is solved. But it‚Äôs not.Goals are conceived, executed, and abandoned through the following cycle:You realize, independent of external factors, that something isn‚Äôt quite right. Maybe you‚Äôre beginning to spend more than usual, and you don‚Äôt know why. Or maybe you feel sluggish, unhealthy, out of shape. Either way, you aren‚Äôt satisfied with how some part of your life is going. Typically, this would initiate action ‚Äî but in this case, it doesn‚Äôt.2. Your discomfort gradually increases.The more you defer action, the more your discomfort intensifies. At this point, you‚Äôre still able to divert your attention for long enough as to temporarily pretend you don‚Äôt have a problem.3. A trigger puts you into a state of peak discomfort.Eventually, you experience a trigger moment that acts as the ‚Äútipping point‚Äù wherein the problem comes to the center of your awareness. You experience heightened emotion and an embodied response that makes your problem impossible to ignore.4. You devise a plan of action to alleviate your discomfort.From this place, you make a plan. You decide you‚Äôre committing to change because you cannot live like this any longer.5. Eventually, you return to your baseline of tolerable discomfort.After the emotions subside and you engage in your action plan for a little while, you begin to think the problem is solved because you‚Äôve returned to moderate levels of discomfort. While you don‚Äôt feel completely better, you also don‚Äôt feel as bad as you did at the trigger point.6. You turn to the poor habits that initially caused your problem to soothe your mild discomfort.In the moment, this feels like the answer.7. You become stuck.You have two coexisting but competing desires: You want to override the behavior, and you want to use the behavior as a coping mechanism. You‚Äôre stuck because you need the behavior you claim not to want.8. A trigger puts you into a peak state of discomfort. The cycle repeats.I‚Äôve found this process tends to take about two weeks to fully cycle through. And the more it happens ‚Äî the longer the cycle continues ‚Äî the more defeated we feel. To break out of it, we must go one layer deeper.Here‚Äôs our first problem: We don‚Äôt know what we want.The first reason we get stuck in this cycle and give up on our goals is that we‚Äôre pursuing things we do not fundamentally want. This is not always the case, but it very often is, especially when it comes to novel opportunities or big life changes that aren‚Äôt actually that desirable in the end.We feel pressured by external forces and the fear of others‚Äô perceptions to become something or someone more acceptable ‚Äî but deep down, we don‚Äôt actually want that change. In fact, the more we sabotage our efforts to move forward, the more we need to start questioning whether or not we actually desire what we think we do.Sometimes, the big goals we expend so much energy on are distractions ‚Äî not permanent solutions.It‚Äôs easier to make a huge commitment to getting into rock-hard shape than to acknowledge that we could stand to eat a bit healthier and take care of ourselves in a sustainable, loving way. One solution recognizes our everyday problems, the other ignores them in pursuit of something else entirely.Likewise, it‚Äôs easier to have aspirations of making tons of money you‚Äôll never really use than to acknowledge that you‚Äôll have to manage it well no matter how much you make. It‚Äôs easier to dream up new side-gigs than to find a way to cope with day-to-day challenges that arise at any job, in any position.Most people‚Äôs desires are more simplistic than they‚Äôd think.To escape the cycle of sabotaging our progress, we first must get clear on what we really want, deep down. We must finally summon the courage to pursue it ‚Äî and let go of the distractions.Here‚Äôs our second problem: We don‚Äôt know how to get what we want.Most people‚Äôs desires are more simplistic than they‚Äôd think. It‚Äôs the fear that they might not be able to accomplish them that drives them to greater and greater aspirations.We fear failure because we don‚Äôt understanding what it takes to actually pursue a goal and stick with it ‚Äî which is essentially a commitment to lifelong, permanent change. It makes sense that this is difficult to commit to, because there aren‚Äôt many things we‚Äôre willing to totally reinvent our existence for.When we do decide what that might be, however, we need to enter with the attitude that this isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôre doing until we arrive at a certain point. Instead, it‚Äôs something we are doing every day, forevermore, until the end of our lives. This is the only way that change really happens. It‚Äôs about committing ourselves to never being finished, never reaching the final summit, not waiting until the day we can declare our mission complete.In the end, achievement is about daily commitment and trusting the process ‚Äî even (and especially) if you don‚Äôt see immediate results. That‚Äôs all it comes down to.Achieving a new life isn‚Äôt easy. Being stuck isn‚Äôt, either. You get to choose your hard ‚Äî and commit to it, for good.WRITTEN BY"

Your colleague just opened up for the ultimate discussion: ‚ÄúCan you explain this ‚Äòdesign‚Äô thing to me?‚Äù You‚Äôve waited a long time for this moment, biting your tongue every time your whole field is reduced to ‚Äúmaking it pretty‚Äù. After many years of study and hard work you know what this design thing is now, right? Yet the words escape you, and all those perfect quotes you found online just don‚Äôt seem to cut it. You may fall back to describing the value of design, but describing exactly what design is‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs harder.There is an ancient Indian proverb about the blind men and the elephant. The men have never seen an elephant before, and when one is placed in front of them each starts experiencing a different part of the elephant‚Ä¶And so on and so forth. The proverb is often used to illustrate how good we are at claiming absolute truth based on our own limited experiences, while dismissing the truths of others. I find this idea of multiple truths interesting in the pursuit of defining something so complex as design. In researching for this article, I found a variety of approaches to describing design where the perspective, context, and the goals of the author vary. Many designers have attempted to describe design in a simple elevator pitch, yet these simple descriptions only describe a part of the beast. But consider them together, and a greater picture starts to form.The following are four of the many useful descriptions of design:Perhaps the most straight-forward way of describing design would be the way it was described to the designer ‚Äî through their education. Though design training varies, there are some common themes:Most design schools have a focus on learning design by doing design. It is a hands-on major where students learn by model projects requiring them frame the challenge, ideate and present designs, then receive and give feedback through ‚ÄúCritiques‚Äù.Techniques for generating and exploring numerous concepts, then methodically narrowing down to the best solution.Designers are taught that the answer always lies with the user. By learning interview techniques, co-creation, facilitation and mapping techniques, designers grow their empathy for users and train to move past their own assumptions and biases.Humans respond best to stories ‚Äî it is how we naturally process and store information. Designers learn to harness this both in text, user flows and to sell concepts.How can shape, line, color, and type affect how we receive and respond to a visual message? How can one lead the eye through a composition, or create different feelings through visual elements?With a foundation in aesthetics, designers practice to be able to quickly and efficiently turn complex ideas and problems into easy-to-understand visuals through simple sketches and diagrams.Prototyping allows designers to test and iterate on concepts in a fast and cheap way.Even after formal education, designers are often still measured by these attributes. Want to understand a designer? Understand the little professor-voice in their head still nagging about these things.Zooming way out, another approach to describing design is by contrasting it to related disciplines. In the Netflix series Abstract, designer and renaissance woman Neri Oxman presents a diagram of her team‚Äôs process, with an interesting perspective on design:Oxman‚Äôs work with Bio-architecture is at the intersection of design, science, engineering and art, so for her the blurred boundaries of these disciplines has been especially enlightening. She describes how the fields bleed into and inform one another:‚ÄúScience converts information into knowledge. Engineering converts knowledge into utility. Design converts utility into cultural behavior in context. Art takes that cultural behavior and questions our perception of the world.‚Äù‚Äî Neri OxmanIn her team‚Äôs work, design is defined by the input it needs from neighboring disciplines, and the output it gives to others.Similarly, way back in 1965 designer Bruce Archer mused about a question that still confuses many today: what is the difference between art and design? Though they may seem similar, they are quite fundamentally different. Think about it‚Ä¶ an architect preparing plans for a house ‚Äî that is design. So is a typographer preparing a page for print. But what about a sculptor, shaping a figure out of clay? Is that design? Archer would argue no ‚Äî an artist creates, they do not design. For an activity to qualify as ‚Äúdesign‚Äù there are two requirements:So basically, according to Archer, design is about making plans for something you hope gets made in the future, while art creates the actual thing then and there.Perhaps one of the greatest challenges in finding one definition of design is the sheer breadth and diversity of design activities, problems being solved, and outputs. At the broadest level, designers could be classified by the medium they work with: physical objects, digital interfaces, visual systems, environments, experiences, etc. While some designers aim to be generalists and deliver all types of design, some specialize. Others find a subset of design they love doing, but can do the rest as well. A multitude of titles have emerged to describe these profiles and the facets of design they work with, with mixed success. This variety can create confusion for their non-design counterparts, especially in trying to find the right designer(s) for their team.As visual communicators, describing this variety becomes a design problem. Many designers have attempted to describe these different types of designers by visualizing them on a spectrum to provide some clarity. Here are some examples from digital product design, one of many design disciplines:Some would argue that there is one sure-fire way to find the designer on a team ‚Äî the questions they ask. Your designer is probably the one asking questions like:Questions are an interesting angle in defining design, as questions are a tangible output of the typical problems design aims to solve ‚Äî not to mention the core values and philosophies of a designer. Yet they don‚Äôt require long training or special tools. They can be asked by anyone, not just the designer. So per this definition, design can still happen without it‚Äôs advocate, as long as questions like these are being asked. Interesting.And there you have it ‚Äî four definitions, each shedding a bit of light on what this ‚Äúdesign‚Äù thing is. What definition has helped you to build understanding and design maturity in your organization? Join the discussion by leaving a comment bellow üëá.Other noteworthy definitions:WRITTEN BY"

230,We May Finally Be Able to Destroy a Dreaded ‚ÄòForever Chemical‚Äô in Our Drinking Water,https://onezero.medium.com/we-may-finally-be-able-to-destroy-a-dreaded-forever-chemical-in-our-drinking-water-d7e394d2cc19?source=extreme_main_feed---------233-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"2019, nearly two dozen water agencies in Southern California were found to have reportable levels of cancer-causing chemical compounds in their wells. By 2020, 700 agencies with similar contamination had been identified across the United States. These compounds, known as perfluorinated alkylated substances or PFAS, are dubbed ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù because, for a long time, there was no known way to break them down.But Sharma Yamijala, a computational chemist at the University of California, Riverside, may have just discovered a solution. After hearing about the issue at a seminar in 2019, he got to work on the problem with two colleagues at the university. The results of their project were published in the journal Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics in January.‚ÄúI thought that we should try something out to understand what‚Äôs happening,‚Äù he tells OneZero.Since the 1940s, PFAS have been used in a wide variety of products, like food packaging, nonstick pans, paints, cleaning supplies, and even smartphones. Because they don‚Äôt break down in the environment, they get into drinking water and other living organisms, many of which we eat. Since the body can‚Äôt digest them either, they accumulate inside of us, too.‚ÄúThese pollutants are very persistent,‚Äù explains Bryan Wong, one of Yamijala‚Äôs co-authors on the paper, to OneZero. ‚ÄúThey last for a long time.‚ÄùHigh levels of PFAS intake are linked to cancer as well as low birth weight and thyroid hormone disruption, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.In his research, Yamijala used computer simulations to study the chemical structure of the PFAS that are the most ubiquitous in the environment: perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. The carbon-fluorine bond that acts as the backbone of these chemicals is one of the strongest bonds in organic chemistry, which is why they seem to last forever. But this is exactly what the team‚Äôs breakthrough addresses: When they exposed the compounds to excess electrons ‚Äî a process called reduction ‚Äî the bond with the fluorine atom broke.What‚Äôs more, the broken molecules that resulted from the process had a domino effect on the remaining PFAS in the water. In the simulation, these smaller molecules accelerated the breaking down of the other PFA molecules.‚ÄúScientists are the ones who helped the industrialists generate these chemicals in the first place.‚ÄùThe results are promising, but more work must be done before the process can be used to decontaminate water in the real world, says Yamijala. For one thing, researchers must find out whether or not the new molecules created by breaking down PFAS are carcinogenic. Yamijala and his colleagues plan to run longer simulations to better understand these new molecules and how they functionStill, the breakthrough has potential to end the forever chemicals that have infiltrated water systems around the globe. Ideally, the method would be used at water treatment plants and aquifers. ‚ÄúYou want to get rid of these chemicals before supplying water to households,‚Äù says Yamijala.In the real world, the process would involve placing compounds that contain metal, like copper nanoparticles, into water and exposing them to ultraviolet radiation. Doing so would cause electrons to break off from the compounds, freeing them up to interact with the PFAS molecules and break them down.Previous studies about the possibility of using reduction to break up PFAS suggested that doing so would be cost effective, says Yamijala. While there are still unknowns about costs in the real world ‚Äî like that of the metal-containing compounds needed to break down the PFAS ‚Äî research from the University of California, Los Angeles suggests the technique would cost 8 to 10 cents per liter of contaminated water to employ.Though companies like DuPont, one of the largest corporations known to have used PFAS in its products, have phased out their use, the chemicals still continue to contaminate nearly every facet of our environment. Yamijala says scientists should play a role in cleaning up the mess, since they helped corporations create PFAS to begin with.‚ÄúIt is scientists‚Äô responsibility to show people how to break these bonds because scientists are the ones who helped the industrialists generate these chemicals in the first place,‚Äù he says.‚ÄúSo scientists need to do the opposite, is what I believe.‚ÄùWRITTEN BY"

People outside of the industry assume that there‚Äôs no cooler professional calling than investing other peoples‚Äô money into sexy startup companies. But for those lucky enough to break into the industry, the truth is often less appealing than the mirage.I‚Äôll preface my story by stressing that this was my experience and is not representative of every VC‚Äôs experience. But I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs more common than uncommon.I moved to San Francisco in January 2018 to join a brand-new venture capital firm as the first non-partner on the team. I had zero experience in the industry, and to be honest, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect or what I was supposed to do.One of the first surprises I encountered, having five years of professional experience in the entertainment industry under my belt, was the sheer volume of recent college graduates who held analyst and associate roles at venture firms. From my perspective, hiring 21- and 22-year-olds (who are also mostly white men) with zero experience in the professional world to evaluate businesses and investment opportunities was not only stupid but reckless. I was dumbfounded during one of the first conversations I had with an analyst at another firm who had just graduated from college, was living at home with his parents, and didn‚Äôt know what CAC (customer acquisition cost) was.I realized pretty quickly that there‚Äôs a lot to be cynical about in today‚Äôs venture capital ecosystem.I stayed dumbfounded until I realized that these junior VC roles are usually 99% ‚Äúdeal-sourcing,‚Äù or lead-generation roles. Firms rely on junior VCs to ‚Äúhustle,‚Äù ‚Äúnetwork,‚Äù and find ‚Äúproprietary deal-flow.‚Äù Practically, this means lots of outbound emails, LinkedIn stalking, and swapping information about deals with the other junior VCs you know. It also means developing relationships with founders, investors, and others in the tech ecosystem in order to be in the know when companies are fundraising.This, perhaps, is the #1 perk for junior VCs because it means lots of happy hours, social events, and traveling. I attended at least one to two social events per week with open bars, free food, and a room full of fellow investors or early-stage founders eager to pitch their companies to anyone who would listen. It was easy to justify spending thousands of dollars to attend SXSW in Austin, booking a private Airbnb, and basically embarking on a three-day bender of parties with free food and booze. I could show up to an exclusive private event that I wasn‚Äôt invited to, give the check-in table a business card with my firm‚Äôs name on it, and be enthusiastically invited in and accommodated.That wasn‚Äôt even the most extreme expense. After our firm had only been around three months, our five-person team took a weeklong retreat to Israel, where we hosted an open bar in Tel Aviv, went wakeboarding in the Sea of Galilee, and took a daylong tour of Jerusalem. This trip didn‚Äôt lead to any investments or opportunities.The biggest perk of working in venture capital, in my opinion, was the incredible access to intelligent, hard-working founders building their visions for a better future. A LinkedIn profile that labeled me an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù and an email address linked to a venture firm meant I could get a phone call or meeting with just about anyone I reached out to in short notice. I was regularly surprised to receive responses from successful founders and leaders who I would never in a million years had heard back from if it hadn‚Äôt been implied that our interaction may one day result in me giving them money. And I was just one of many who was privileged with incredible (and sometimes unearned) access: At one of those SXSW parties, I met an unemployed man who printed business cards that said he was a general partner at Asshole Ventures, which earned him as much access as anyone else. This is why so many of the LinkedIn profiles for professionals in the Bay Area include the term ‚Äúangel investor‚Äù in the bio.I was very aware that people were probably laughing at my shitty jokes because they wanted money from me.I was very cognizant, however, that the context behind this access was my connection to the capital that founders needed. That power dynamic almost always corrupts the authenticity of an interaction, and I was very aware that people were probably laughing at my shitty jokes because they wanted money from me. One of the first founders I connected with ‚Äî someone I thought I had hit it off with regardless of whether my firm invested ‚Äî responded to the detailed rejection email that I labored over for hours (filled with sensitive, honest feedback) with: ‚ÄúMike ‚Äî I thought you were smarter than this.‚ÄùMy least favorite part of the job was turning down 99.9% of the pitches I received from the intelligent, passionate, hard-working founders I met. Many of them I admired, rooted for, and wanted to invest in but couldn‚Äôt convince my firm‚Äôs partners to fund. I began to realize that the most important and least-discussed skill of a junior VC is sales: You must sell deals that you source to your firm‚Äôs partners, sell your firm and yourself to founders to convince them to take your capital, and sell your portfolio companies to other, later-stage investors. If you don‚Äôt understand and empathize with the interests and incentives of all of these stakeholders, it‚Äôs difficult to get any traction.I realized pretty quickly that there‚Äôs a lot to be cynical about in today‚Äôs venture capital ecosystem. There are more firms, more funds, and more capital than ever before ‚Äî and with that comes a lot of negative forces and people. From my experience, there are a lot of people who aren‚Äôt in it for the right reasons or don‚Äôt have their incentives aligned with their portfolio companies. There are even more VCs who, quite frankly, aren‚Äôt qualified to be venture investors, aren‚Äôt actually helpful to companies, and just parrot the same talking points and theses that they read on Twitter or other VCs‚Äô blogs. There‚Äôs actually very little original thinking in the venture capital ecosystem.I can‚Äôt tell you how regularly I was asked ‚ÄúWho else is investing?‚Äù as a validation test from investors.Despite this, there‚Äôs nothing investors love more than tweeting about, blogging about, or promoting their current theses and ‚Äúhot‚Äù investments. I noticed pretty quickly that venture investors and television development executives have a lot in common: namely, short memories for their failures, FOMO, copycats, and a thirst for attention for their rare successes. Most of this content is derivative, self-promotional, and tone-deaf, making it easily parodied by accounts like VC Starter Kit and VCs Congratulating Themselves.For founders, the truth is that raising venture capital is usually more about psychology than anything else. Many investors are incredibly vulnerable to manipulation and storytelling, and what drives investment decisions more than anything (in my experience) is subtly convincing investors that your company is a ‚Äúhot deal,‚Äù that there are many ‚Äútop-tier‚Äù firms interested, and that time is of the essence. I can‚Äôt tell you how regularly I was asked ‚ÄúWho else is investing?‚Äù as a validation test from investors who don‚Äôt have any conviction of their own and who relied on signals from other investors who are actually good at their jobs.Most junior VCs eventually churn out of the industry after two to three years. Unless you get lucky early in your career and source a deal that leads to huge markups, there‚Äôs little incentive for a firm to promote you to a general partner and split their share of the fund‚Äôs profits with you. It turns out that an early success in venture investing is somewhat like a flywheel: You become known for your investing acumen, which means you‚Äôre more well known to the VC and founder community, which means you have access to more investment opportunities, which means you have greater odds of investing in the best companies, which reinforces your reputation as a good investor. I‚Äôm not sure this is replicable outside of getting lucky early.There are of course talented, helpful, humble venture capitalists in the world who are in it for the right reasons, like Hunter Walk and Seth Bannon. But they seem to be a minority these days.I‚Äôve had plenty of people ask for advice about how to ‚Äúbreak-in‚Äù to venture, and very few of them actually understood what the day-to-day of being a junior VC most likely would entail for them: a hamster wheel of continuously searching for the next deal, constantly selling to everyone around you (founders, partners, other investors), and the demoralizing daily task of turning down hopeful and hardworking founders. But hey, at least there‚Äôs an open bar.WRITTEN BY"
232,Bringing 4K and HDR to Anime at Netflix with Sol Levante,https://netflixtechblog.com/bringing-4k-and-hdr-to-anime-at-netflix-with-sol-levante-fa68105067cd?source=extreme_main_feed---------235-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"By Haruka Miyagawa & Kylee Pe√±aSome might dismiss them as simple cartoons, but anime‚Äôs diverse and fantastical stories, vibrant style, and delicate lines are an art form that has evolved and grown in popularity, variety and sophistication over the last fifty years. From its likely roots in colorful painted lanterns in the early 20th century, to gaining mainstream status in Japan in the 1970s, viewers now have hundreds of anime series and films to choose from all over the world.Our Creative Technologies team wanted to elevate the technical quality of anime‚Äôs visuals, discover what new creative opportunities that would introduce, and to learn what it would take to increase anime‚Äôs resolution from HD to 4K and introduce the wider color palette of high dynamic range (HDR) to artists‚Äô toolsets. When 4K entered the conversation, most animators in Japan asked for one thing: a bigger piece of paper! But the artists at Production I.G. saw the future in digital. A bigger, more colorful collaboration was born ‚Äî and the resulting short, Sol Levante, is now available for streaming on Netflix in 4K Dolby Vision and Atmos!The Creative Technologies team at Netflix focuses on how we can improve our content creation practices for the long term, and works with various partners on research and development to bring these improvements to real world workflows. Combining high quality and longevity with an authentic presentation experience is a part of our team‚Äôs core mission, as is opening up new creative opportunities. Given the rapid adoption of consumer 4K HDR capable devices, it‚Äôs easy to imagine that it will be the primary viewing experience in five years.We‚Äôve had great success remastering titles like Knights of Sidonia, Flavours of Youth and Godzilla from SDR to HDR over the last few years. But what if we increase the resolution and create anime with HDR in mind from conception? How would creative decisions change? What creative and technical challenges would pop up? How would the budget and timeline be impacted? And what new creative opportunities would emerge?Known for projects like Ghost in the Shell and the anime portion of Kill Bill, Production I.G. in Tokyo brought an experienced crew who felt comfortable working in digital from scratch and wanted to answer these questions too. Our combined curiosity led to the creation of an experimental 4K HDR Immersive Audio anime short called Sol Levante. [In order to help the industry better understand 4K HDR and immersive audio in anime, we‚Äôve released the raw materials used in Sol Levante for download and experimentation.]While the incredible stories in today‚Äôs anime will never become obsolete, the anime workflow developed in Japan hasn‚Äôt changed much over the years. To recognize why this experiment was necessary on a small scale, it‚Äôs important to understand the reality of creating anime in Japan.Since the turn of the century, the anime industry has shifted from the traditional system of an anime studio owning most or all of the copyright to the current business model of a ‚ÄúProduction Committee‚Äù system. While it became easier to create content for the studio thanks to all the financial support, more stakeholders are involved which creates a lot more complexity.Some or all of the production is subcontracted to multiple companies and freelancers in many cascading tiers. With so many subcontractors involved, it‚Äôs hard to align everyone with changes in technology and new creative opportunities. The number of freelancers depends on each project, but those who are working at home have limited equipment compared to those working at studios.In addition to the complexities of the studio system, there are challenges to be faced when trying to make the production workflow of anime more innovative. While ‚Äú3D CG‚Äù anime is becoming more popular ‚Äî shows like Saint Seiya and Ultraman that are generated entirely on computers by 3D artists ‚Äî most anime titles are still hand drawn. Some artists simply prefer the feel of a piece of paper, or haven‚Äôt had the time and money to invest in the equipment needed to even try digital, such as a new computer. The pipeline that follows after the drawing phase is already digital, but it requires major equipment upgrades to support a larger resolution. There‚Äôs also a lack of teachers with the experience or tools to teach the next generation of digital animators. This produces a lack of staff who are willing and able to work digitally in the drawing phase.Anime for broadcast is usually created at 1280x720, or ‚ÄúHalf HD‚Äù. Only some high-end shows are in full 1080 HD. To move to 4K, digital becomes a necessity because when hand drawings are completed, they‚Äôre scanned. But if the typically-sized piece of paper is scanned at a higher DPI, unwanted detail is blown up in the pencil lines. Therefore, a bigger piece of paper is required to increase the resolution with pencil-drawn anime!Color management ‚Äî a process that helps to achieve predictable and consistent color at each stage of production and post ‚Äî is also rare in anime workflows. With a few exceptions, everything is created in an sRGB color space ‚Äî the most common color gamut used in computer graphics applications. For feature films, animators usually create in sRGB and then the post house applies a 3D LUT to transform to P3, thereby preserving the sRGB look in a P3 colorspace.In addition, you might be surprised to read that Japanese broadcasters set the color temperature at 9300K, much bluer than the 6500K that dominates as a standard elsewhere in the world. In fact, many of the licensed anime shows on Netflix were converted to D65 BT.1886 at the very end of post production to meet our spec and look accurate on our streaming service ‚Äî as the creatives intended!Understanding the challenges involved with moving anime from a piece of paper to a fully digital workflow, Creative Technologies worked closely with Production I.G. to try to anticipate some of the hurdles that were to come. But it was only when the team started to put digital pen to tablet that the findings began to take shape.The current anime production process usually means about 1 ¬Ω to 2 years of work from writing to delivery for a 12 episode broadcast series. For Sol Levante, director Akira Saitoh spent two weeks storyboarding the 3 minute short movie. She tried to ‚Äústage the light‚Äù by hitting many different colors from scene to scene, making the story start at dawn, go through a dark day, night, and end with the sunrise. According to Akira, it was a lot of fun and she excitedly created animatics without knowing what issues would stand in the way of production.When Akira considered 4K and the increase in resolution, she balanced carefully between shots with simple lines and shots with intricate details. In many shots, she created a world that has enough density to overwhelm audiences, retaining fine details you can see even after zooming.For the character design phase, animator Hisashi Ezura spent lots of time adjusting the thickness of the line because of the wider dynamic range. Having an outline on characters is unique in anime, but using the typical line thickness for SDR became too sharp and looked fake in HDR. He adjusted the pen pressure to have a bit softer touch than usual.In the color design phase, the team initially thought 300 nits would be good enough for pre-production. However, once they saw the impact of 1000 nits on an Eizo CG3145 monitor, they felt the gap between the two was huge and 300 nits didn‚Äôt provide the color designer a full palette. Since color decisions are made in pre-production for anime, it was very important for Production I.G. color designer Miho Tanaka to look at an actual mastering monitor at 1000 nits at this point.Establishing the skin tone was also a challenge. Shadow color in particular needed careful adjustment as it could easily make the overall appearance of the face very different, and impact the character design. Miho spent lots of her time making the character look pretty at all times of the day. For dark scenes, HDR made it easier to create colors because it didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúmuddy‚Äù, and the line kept its sharpness. Without enough dynamic range, it‚Äôs hard to retain thin lines like eyelashes. HDR allows for distinct color separations instead of ones that blur in a way that is undesirable.During the look development, other challenges and opportunities emerged. Thanks to HDR, the typical VFX effect to make eyes appear to sparkle could be replaced by simply using colors differently. By adding simple bright lines on the lips, they become glossy. The director received all this feedback and adjusted her designs and colors.One of the biggest challenges during pre-production were the limitations in design and drawing tools in HDR. The user interface of graphics software was far too bright to view consistently at 1000 nits, and the background needed to be changed to grey (180) instead of white (255) during preview on an HDR monitor. Inside many graphics tools, 16 bit output is still not fully supported ‚Äî a critical requirement for HDR. And when selecting color swatches, the color picker in design software would look different on SDR and HDR monitors, leading to difficulty in accurately selecting colors.Challenges with 4K also emerged at this stage. When artists drew lines, limitations on resolution for their screen or tablet required them to scale up and check their work repeatedly. When fully zoomed out, the lines were too thin to recognize minute details.Pre-production went smoothly in our collaboration with Production IG. The real challenges began to emerge in the production phase.To start, the team had to go through a lot of experimentation to establish the right signal flow and set-up the proper color profiles and view color correctly on each display depending on the software. The team needed to have multiple monitors for each artist to show SDR and HDR, and to continue to support the SDR projects they continued to work on in the studio. Management of color in animation is a challenge across many productions globally. This was a particularly complex project, but Junichiro Aki and Katsushi Eda and color management specialist Masakazu Morinaka created a system that worked.For Sol Levante, everything was created digitally. Aside from using Procreate on the iPad for the pre-production drawing and ideation phases, Production I.G. used ClipStudio for in-betweening, Vue for background and a few select elements, Retas Stylus for color, Photoshop, and After Effects. Animators experimented with Toon Boom Harmony, which is well-known for ‚Äúcut out‚Äù animation, a technique widely used outside Japan.Right away, the team realized some anime techniques they had relied upon for years wouldn‚Äôt work with the additional brightness and color gamut. For example, ‚Äúwhite out‚Äù is a common effect in anime: a fade to 100% white as a storytelling technique. The white was far too overpowering in HDR, so they chose to add a white layer on top of the existing color instead. Every time they found something that couldn‚Äôt work as expected, they found another way to accomplish the same feeling.The biggest impact 4K had on the workflow was when rendering final shots with compositions that contained images much bigger than 4K to allow for panning. In fact, the rendering problems at this resolution caused such an issue that the entire project was delayed for months. Some of these issues were caused by hardware configurations that needed to be adjusted for the 4K pipeline, while others were rooted in the design of software and how it utilized system resources. Redesigning software to better handle system resources continues to be a major problem for software manufacturers to solve.Digital drawings also retain delicate lines because there‚Äôs no need to scan paper for digitization. Compared to paper, the animator wasn‚Äôt as conscious about the canvas size. He also made a ‚Äúsettings sheet‚Äù to limit the level of detail for characters and accessories under certain conditions. The amount of detail is related to the size of the character on the screen. This needs to be refined to decide to add additional detail in 4K resolution, or to not spend time on detail that won‚Äôt be seen.As Production I.G. continued to work on Sol Levante, the team decided to outsource some of the ‚Äúin-between‚Äù animation work ‚Äî generating the intermediate frames between two images ‚Äî to other companies (a common practice in anime production). It was difficult to accomplish this since a typical response from these subcontractors was to refuse new ideas like a digital workflow, which would require investment in equipment and retraining staff to adopt these new tools. Additionally, since Production I.G. found that working on an HDR monitor at 1000 nits was absolutely necessary for color decisions, line work, or compositing, the persistent shortage of HDR monitors ‚Äî particularly affordable monitors ‚Äî in the post production market has a major impact on the ability to decide to work in HDR from the beginning.Ultimately, Production I.G. was able to get enough subcontractors on board with a fully digital workflow with one exception: timesheets used for timing out the drawings and making indications for in-betweens, camera movements, and other technical information. This became the only paper in Sol Levante‚Äôs entire pipeline.Final color grading is not usually part of the finishing process for anime, but for Sol Levante the animators worked with a 10,000 nit image container (PQ) yet displayed it on a 1000 nit monitor, so a ‚Äútrim‚Äù pass was necessary to finalize the visible range and look. During the grading session, the colorist and director discovered opportunities to enhance the final anime by changing some initial color choices and allowing elements to stand out from the background. For example, the colorist adjusted the color of the lightning on one frame to make it stand out more, and added film grain on the volcano eruption to give it more texture.Since the full range of PQ was utilized in production, the colorist had more freedom and ‚Äúheadroom‚Äù to adjust during grading, and the archived project has greater flexibility for remastering in the future. While relying on original color is traditional, this showed Production I.G. that there are more creative decisions that can be made throughout the pipeline.One of the director‚Äôs greatest learnings throughout the entire production was that the studio in charge really needs to take the lead and provide a fixed workflow and tools to the subcontractors instead of endless options. Things can‚Äôt change unless big studios team up with manufacturers to push the transition to digital.Unique to the world of anime is a soundscape unlike any other content type. Music and sound are critical to a storytelling experience, and Sol Levante was the perfect opportunity to showcase this in an experience that blended immersive audio with the experiment of 4K and HDR in anime. Our team believes immersive sound mixing is the natural next step in the evolution of audio because of what it brings to the quality and creative opportunity of a story. Blending 4K, HDR, and immersive audio would make Akira‚Äôs world truly alive. And it could be done while using all the same tools mixers are already used to using.Mixing in Dolby Atmos, sound mixer Will Files and sound designer Matt Yocum collaborated with director Akira to create the sound of her world. Getting involved early in the process while animations were still being completed, Haruka helped to translate Akira‚Äôs ideas from Japanese to English while maintaining the creative nuance and meaning.In one instance, Matt added a raven sound behind the shot of hundreds of birds flying upward, and received feedback from Akira to try a sound from a bird native to Japan instead. Matt created something brand new from the native bird, developing an effect that wouldn‚Äôt have existed without this global collaboration.Using Dolby Atmos inside Pro Tools, Will brought contrast to the sound mix and wove in composer Emily Rice‚Äôs original orchestral score which had been recorded on a Schoeps ORTF 3D microphone during the scoring session. By moving sounds around the room, to the ceiling and the floor and back again, the sound and music tell the drama of Sol Levante without dialog.Immersive audio mixing is still a new concept for many mixers, including those in Japan where there aren‚Äôt yet enough updated rooms to support playback across many shows. However, mixing in Dolby Atmos allows the creative team to create one single mix that can be used to derive all others, from 7.1,5.1 to Stereo, which makes it an ideal archival format, and a great way to bring a new dimension to anime.The gorgeous world of Sol Levante was a culmination of art, technology, and curiosity. Given all that we‚Äôve learned in this two year collaboration with Production I.G., we want to start a conversation with animators and creatives about evolving technologies, partner with manufacturers to better support the anime industry, and work with anime studios to apply our findings to their productions. In order to help the industry better understand 4K HDR and immersive audio in anime, we‚Äôve released raw materials used in Sol Levante for download and experimentation. Subscribers can watch Sol Levante on Netflix today. It‚Äôs best enjoyed on an HDR configured device with a premium subscription.Director Akira Saitoh told us that ‚Äú4K HDR is like getting wings and an engine to see a new horizon where a new era is rising. We keep challenging ourselves and being innovative for the future.‚Äù There have been many challenges for this project, but Akira believes 4K HDR is the only way for them to continue being a top runner of content creation.However, the current reality is that these technical challenges do persist, especially for moving from HD to 4K. We encourage creatives to push the boundaries of resolution to serve their story. We want to create content in the format that viewers will be consuming it, and we want that content to look great for as long as possible. But we can‚Äôt ignore the fact that for anime, the tools and equipment are still not prepared for a 4K workflow without a major overhaul. There is more to do and learn, and the Creative Technologies team is engaging with software and hardware manufacturers to share these learnings and try to accelerate improvement in the industry.For HDR, the adjustment is much easier because the challenges are simpler to solve. There are already software manufacturers making changes to account for the issues faced on Sol Levante, like the color picker‚Äôs different visual representation across monitors and a searingly bright UI. The biggest hurdle that remains across the industry is the lack of affordable HDR monitors. After all, even with an HDR color picker, you need the monitor to see what color you are picking. Once they become more plentiful, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before HDR is common in anime.‚ÄúAt the end, who doesn‚Äôt want a bigger house?‚ÄùThis is what animator Hisashi Ezura told us about working in HDR, and the analogy made Haruka laugh because the Japanese are well known for living in small apartments and always wanting to have a big house ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a dream. For him, this dream came true for his work. And now that he can achieve things he never thought possible by using HDR, he‚Äôll never go back.In Italian, Sol Levante means ‚Äúsun rising from east‚Äù, a metaphor for Japan. Akira chose this title because to her, the theme of the project was the beginning ‚Äî the beginning of something new for Japan‚Äôs animators. As the last shot in the film is the dawn, so too is this the dawn of new creative technology for anime![Download the image and sound assets for Sol Levante including TIFF sequence and IMF, selected After Effects projects, ProTools sessions, animatic and storyboard, and more.]WRITTEN BY"

While more and more people seem happy with the iPad Pro as a mobile computer, I‚Äôve landed in the other camp. The iPad Pro, though increasingly capable, forces too many compromises to serve as a mobile work machine for me. Too many productivity tasks are too complicated. So I sold my iPad Pro last week.I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôve made the right decision. My MacBook Pro 16 and iPhone 11 Pro Max combination lacks nothing that I absolutely need. But I‚Äôll admit, the iPad Pro fills a few niche use-cases better than any other device on the market.The iPad Pro is perfect for these specific use-cases. If you‚Äôre going to buy one or you already own one, these are most likely the things you‚Äôll find liberating with an iPad Pro. Unfortunately, anything deeper than surface level productivity tasks you‚Äôll likely still find frustrating. That‚Äôs not to say the iPad Pro is unworthy of some hard-earned dollars, it‚Äôs an incredible machine, and one that Apple seems more committed to than just about any other in their arsenal (interesting rumors are circulating in relation to what we might see for iPads in 2020). Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that the functions I need most from my devices in 2020 are covered by a MacBook Pro and an iPhone, and that an iPad Pro is mostly overlapping. But I won‚Äôt deny pining for an iPad Pro while sitting in a meeting or on a plane.WRITTEN BY"

Over more than six years, my corner of the internet was LinkedIn.Recently, I was banned for life and all my blog posts were permanently deleted and never to be recovered ‚Äî in case you‚Äôre wondering, there is no option to back up my work or take a screenshot of my LinkedIn articles.Thousands of heartfelt blog posts designed to inspire people have left cyberspace and can never be retrieved. It feels like having your family history wiped out.If you read my LinkedIn posts in 2016, you could see the remnants of a man who faced epic challenges of the mind and fought back. If you read my LinkedIn posts back in 2017, you could see the pain of several breakups and a normal dude with Dumbo-sized ears trying to make sense of the heartbreak. In 2018, you could see what it was like to change careers and face an overwhelming pile of rejection emails. In 2019, you could see the person that was fired from their job and had no idea what to do ‚Äî that person was deathly afraid.Each blog post was linked to a phase of my life designed to be helpful to others. All of that is gone. Other than the photos on my phone, the last six years of my life have been erased forever and can never be retrieved. It‚Äôs an idea you never think you‚Äôll have to grapple with until it happens ‚Äî and it can happen to anyone and is happening more and more.So I‚Äôm left facing the reality of my situation. It‚Äôs one where I can feel sorry for myself or try and find an empowering meaning in it all. I choose the latter.Here‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like to have the digital version of your life erased forever.You might think people will remember this day for the rest of your life. They won‚Äôt. Within a few days, just like a computer game, new users were spawned in place of my rotting carcass of a LinkedIn profile.You think your digital legacy will last a lifetime. I‚Äôve learned it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the real-world relationships you will remember that count. It‚Äôs the coffee you had with people you met online or the love of your life that you met through a dating app.When your digital profile is extinct, all that is left is the real world and whatever you remembered to keep before your time has come to face digital exile.People won‚Äôt remember in a week when your social media profile is erased. That might be a good thing depending on how you look at it.The fake help starts with the thought, ‚Äúhow do I turn this person‚Äôs loss into a story to get likes?‚ÄùOn social media, someone else‚Äôs loss is an opportunity to post a story to get likes and capitalize on that person‚Äôs misfortune. Most of the help I received was genuine when my digital profile became extinct. People really wanted to help and it was stunningly beautiful.The fake help disguised as trying to benefit off my loss was ignored.This is one decision I made that served me. I never let my LinkedIn profile and its perceived success become part of my self-worth. I told myself, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre enough without it all.‚ÄùA couple of people I know also had their social media profiles deleted. They weren‚Äôt so lucky and became extremely ill because of it.Seeing them go through their digital execution beforehand helped me when it was my turn and I bent over to have my head chopped off.There is one thing I know for sure: people won‚Äôt miss me on LinkedIn. They will forget quickly and get on with their lives, and I‚Äôm okay with that.You might think the world is hanging off every word you write, but that‚Äôs most likely a lie made up by your ego. Whether you write inspiring stories or post beautiful photography on Instagram, you too can be forgotten.Fame and notoriety are overrated anyway. Just ask Tim Ferriss, who once said to his friend as a twenty-eight-year-old:‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm not famous by 30, I might as well put a bullet in my head.‚ÄùFame is pointless, so don‚Äôt worry about people missing you if your social media profile gets deleted forever.Social media can give you a false sense of what is real. You can think that when you get thousands of comments on a post, you‚Äôre god. I‚Äôve learned the hard way: I‚Äôm not god.The lure of social media is to build up your own importance, but that idea is a trap. You don‚Äôt need to be more important. You just need to be important to the people you care about.My girlfriend and family love me, and that matters far more than what a social media network junked up on dopamine-inducing engagement metrics think about my place in society.It‚Äôs not so bad being back at the bottom again with no audience and nothing but peace and quiet.A friend asked me if I was going to start another LinkedIn account. He said, ‚ÄúYou can build up an audience again quickly and find the same readers.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs a good point. But why would I invest my time working for free and helping a social media company build its business? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. I just start again and hope that there are no problems?One of the key lessons of losing my LinkedIn profile is to never rely on someone else‚Äôs platform ever again.Your digital footprint on social media is not owned by you and the sooner you realize that the quicker you can start building your thing, not a tech company‚Äôs business.I quickly learned who my friends were when all of this happened.In the first 24 hours, everybody wants to help. After that, only your real friends are left. You realize quickly who was genuine and who just wanted access to your audience and some nonsense perception of coolness (I‚Äôm the least cool person on the internet and proud of it).I‚Äôve learned to live on my own and that has been the saving grace when the dust settled and the reality of all my work being gone sets in.Yep, I no longer can contact a lot of people I have had interactions with.All that is left is the phone numbers on my phone. Everybody else is a distant LinkedIn connection that I can‚Äôt revive or talk to anymore, and I will be unlikely to remember most of them in a few weeks due to my poor memory ‚Äî this is life.Life comes in seasons. People enter our life and they exit through the stage door on the right called death or the alternate door on the left called choice. You can‚Äôt hoard contacts forever, even though I have tried. They are gone. Free. Hopefully, left just a tiny bit better from having read one of my articles all those years ago.Some of us will meet again. For others, this is it between now and death.It‚Äôs been an awesome ride. The last six years have shaped my life for the better, even if I no longer have the written articles to prove it.What I do know after having six years of writing deleted overnight is that I‚Äôll never be the same again. My life is forever changed.The whole point of writing for six years straight is not about me at all. It‚Äôs about so much more than that.Writing for six years is about daring to dream, using your creativity, finding a way to be helpful, and carving out your own corner of the internet for as long as it will be rented to you, and for anyone who‚Äôd like to take a seat and listen to what you‚Äôve got to say.Nothing is forever. That‚Äôs what having six years of writing deleted overnight and gone forever can teach you.WRITTEN BY"
235,React Native 0.62 and Flipper Will Change Your Mobile Development Experience and make it easier!,https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/react-native-0-62-and-flipper-will-change-your-mobile-development-experience-and-make-it-easier-8945d345f644?source=extreme_main_feed---------238-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"Until 2020, React native was a poor framework in terms of debugging tools. Most of the time you had to rely on various platform-specific tools for Android and IOS in order to get system logs (logcat, ‚Ä¶), debug and analyze performance pits or rendering issues.That‚Äôs for the native part of the framework.About JavascriptYou could debug Javascript using the remote debugging which is done through the browser debugger. It means that instead of running the code in the device Javascript engine, your app code run in chrome‚Äôs V8 engine (if you are using a chrome-based browser, of course).This can leads to some strange behaviors because the engine is not the same, and because your code is running in a browser with the power of your computer CPU, you might not see performance pits while developing and get surprised when back to the device, when releasing on staging as example.This is even getting worse while releasing on Android, as depending on the Android version and the device model, the system‚Äôs Javascript engine is not homogeneous, some things might behave differently. This is one reason why little by little Facebook is bringing tools to improve reliability across devices and debugging tools such as Hermes, an embedded Javascript engine for Android.Until now, to face the poor collection of tools we had available for react-native, some companies built their own tools such as InfiniteRed with Reactotron. This tool is great because it brings through plugins some nice features such as Network inspector, overlay or redux store inspector among other things, that were missing out-of-the-box in react-native apps.But besides Reactotron and the CLI embedded version of the React Devtools (that was not usable in v4)‚Ä¶There was clearly a lack of platform tools that we could easily use where a concurrent like Flutter is doing and taking into consideration of developing such tools since the beginning.But little by little Facebook reacted and started building a nice tool to fill the gap, a tool you might have heard of but that was not so popular until today for many developers‚Ä¶This tool is named Flipper and it is officially shipped by default in any react-native > 0.62 application.Flipper: An extensible mobile app debuggerFlipper is a platform for debugging iOS, Android and React Native apps. Visualize, inspect, and control your apps from a simple desktop interface. Use Flipper as is or extend it using the plugin API.Let‚Äôs see why this is great news for mobile development with react native.What‚Äôs new? Why is it a good breaking point with the past? As we saw above, the development experience was not so good with react native tools but Flipper brings a lot of improvement to that and remember: it‚Äôs only the beginning. Feel free to make your own plugins for it!Flipper provides the following features without any additional configuration steps.You can now, using Network Inspector, debug network requests that occur, before you had to use something like Reactotron and bootstrap it in your code.It works for HTTP calls, and you can access any element of the payload such as Headers, body formatted. You might also filter requests based on some rules and use sorting.Metro Actions: Reload the app and trigger the Dev Menu right from the toolbar.As I already talked about in my article about react native dev menu that you can find hereThere is a new way to deal with device shortcuts. You can now provide a keyboard shortcut using Flipper to reload or show the dev menu, no matter if your app emulator has the focus or not. Which is great when you‚Äôre using the Javascript debugger in chrome and you want to reload the application.Crash Reporter: View crash reports from Android and iOS devices.Some bugs don‚Äôt happen in development, this is where crash reporter shines. This is especially great to debug crash on React Native‚Äôs release mode build variant, as you will get the triggering error stack trace in Flipper if a crash occurs while running the app.Also if any of the native libraries trigger a crash, you‚Äôll get the log here.React DevTools: The latest react development tool that helps to inspect components state and props.This tool is a masterpiece in terms of development experience and debugging. And for those who are familiar with the React web, it‚Äôs exactly the same tool! Which is a great thing.Briefly, it provides two tabs: a components tab that allows us to inspect the components tree and hooks with the state/props in real-time. And the profiler tab that helps to find performance pitfall such as over-rendering.It‚Äôs also possible to search in device logs in Flipper, that originally were printed in the metro bundler console or chrome console if using remote debugging. That way you can use custom filters if your app is having a bunch of logs, preventing getting overwhelmed.This is especially useful for apps that are business logic heavy with a lot of events, such as a Bluetooth communication-based app.You can inspect the native Ios/android layout output by the React Native renderer and edit it. This might help you understand some effects produced by a bug.And my favorite one is the Database and Preferences Inspector plugin.Using that one you can finally see which data lives in your Async Storage and embedded SQLite database. For adding a custom database such as WatermelonDB (based on SQLite), you need to add some code, we will see how in another article. But by the time, see that.This version also comes with the brand new Log boxes.You can turn them on as an experimental feature using require(‚Äòreact-native‚Äô).unstable_enableLogBox(); in your root file (generally index.js) They are way more stylish and less obtrusive and the stack has been enhanced, especially for components exceptions.Remove PropTypes: We‚Äôre removing propTypes from core components in order to reduce the app size impact of React Native core and to favor static type systems which check at compile time instead of runtime.One other thing that happened behind the scene is the deprecation of the prop-types library, which was used to display a warning when some props were missing at runtime. This is a great thing in my opinion as it will progressively push people to adopt good practice in Javascript with static typings tools. Which helps to detect those issues Ahead of Time at transpilation.You might have a look at the well-known Typescript is you are not aware of itFor those that haven‚Äôt project already, it‚Äôs pretty easy, just create a new react-native CLI and you‚Äôll get the latest version instantly :), for those like me using a 0.61.5 version you‚Äôll need some steps for android and IOS.If you followed the migration tools, take not that Gradle has been updated to version 6, which can introduce some breaking changes in your libraries.You‚Äôll need to follow https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/?from=0.61.5&to=0.62.0 migration guide.I just wanted to highlight that there are some part to take care of and adapt to your project specificities:Everything named package com.rndiffapp; must correspond to your own package name and you must adapt your folder structure accordingly. You can find your app package name in android/app/src/main/java/<your/package/name>/MainApplication.javaAlso take note in the same file that the initializeFlipper method is using class reflection to target your Flipper configuration class you‚Äôll create, you might need to adjust the package name here too.The ReactNativeFlipper class contains all your Flipper plugins configuration, this is where you can add more.WRITTEN BY"
236,A Battery Breakthrough Could End Lithium-Ion‚Äôs Reign,https://onezero.medium.com/a-battery-breakthrough-could-end-lithium-ions-reign-9aac17fc2562?source=extreme_main_feed---------239-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"hances are, if you own a smartphone or laptop, much of your life revolves around a lithium-ion battery. It‚Äôs just as likely that you know about this battery‚Äôs downsides: It eventually stops holding a charge, lithium is scarce and mining it is horrible for the environment, and sometimes, it blows up. And yet, the vast majority of consumer electronics and clean energy storage devices rely on lithium-ion batteries because right now, there‚Äôs no better alternative.Scientists are working hard to find other options. Last week, a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences described a breakthrough in the effort to make a potassium-based battery. Potassium batteries are considered one of the best potential competitors to lithium-ion batteries because potassium is way more naturally abundant than lithium, and the batteries could perform comparably ‚Äî once a few obstacles are addressed.‚ÄúThe uneven distribution and scarcity of lithium in the Earth‚Äôs crust make relying on lithium-ion batteries as the sole source of energy storage highly impractical and uneconomical,‚Äù study co-author Nikhil Koratkar, a professor of mechanical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, tells OneZero. Previous potassium batteries didn‚Äôt perform as well as lithium-ion technology, he says, but his team has now figured out a way to build one that safely provides more juice.First, a quick recap on how batteries work: They‚Äôre a self-contained chemistry reaction made up of two electrodes ‚Äî a positive terminal (cathode) and negative terminal (anode) ‚Äî with a substance called an electrolyte sandwiched between them. What we think of as ‚Äúpower‚Äù is a stream of electrons flowing out of the negative terminal to the positive side. Connecting a battery to a device and powering it on completes a circuit that allows this flow to happen.The chemical makeup of the two electrodes is key. In a lithium-ion battery, the positive terminal is made from a lithium compound and is paired with a negative terminal made of graphite. Lithium is lightweight and especially good at freeing up its electrons for graphite to grab, which is why it performs so well. In a potassium battery, the positive terminal is made from (surprise!) potassium. But since potassium is heavy and naturally less energy-dense, says Koratkar, it doesn‚Äôt perform as well when paired with the usual graphite-based negative terminal.Researchers attempting to make a potassium-based battery have discovered that they can get past this issue by making both the positive and negative terminals out of potassium. ‚ÄúSuch potassium metal batteries can compete with commercial lithium-ion batteries,‚Äù says Koratkar.But there is, of course, a catch ‚Äî one that other researchers attempting to perfect the potassium battery have run into before. The ‚ÄúAchilles‚Äô heel,‚Äù Koratkar says, ‚Äúof any metal battery lies in the evolution and growth of sharp metal projections (called dendrites) that can short the battery and result in a fire hazard.‚Äù These dendrites are like tough weeds poking out of concrete. If they break through the structures inside a battery, explosions could ensue.This is where the team made its breakthrough. Rather than wrestle with dendrite formation, the researchers figured out a way to simply burn them off ‚Äî a process they gently call ‚Äúself-healing.‚Äù To continue with the weeds analogy, self-healing is akin to periodically heating sidewalks, in a controlled way, to toast weeds into oblivion. ‚ÄúTo our surprise,‚Äù says Koratkar, ‚Äúwe found that potassium is far more amenable than lithium for such type of healing.‚ÄùIf this feat can be reproduced by other researchers, potassium batteries may stand a chance at knocking lithium-ion from its throne. Of course, there‚Äôs a lot of potential for things to go wrong with self-heating batteries, but the team has shown it can be done safely in a controlled manner, at least in the small batteries that were tested. To further address safety and scale, the team plans to try reproducing these results in bigger, industrial-scale batteries.The potential for potassium-ion batteries is enormous: They not only could make it more economical to power consumer electronics but also bigger devices, like electric cars; further, they could provide a way to store power from green energy sources like solar and wind. Excitement about these prospects appears to be reflected in the research, with scientists in Russia, Australia, and Japan publishing papers on potassium-ion batteries in just the past few months.Research on other alternatives is ongoing as well. Koratkar roughly divides them into two groups based on the family of metal they belong to on the periodic table. Zinc is another cheap metal that shows promise (and interest from investors) as is sodium. Ultimately, it may be that no one battery ‚Äî but rather a range of alternatives ‚Äî takes over lithium-ion‚Äôs battery monopoly.WRITTEN BY"

We may have added some flair into our vows, like the promise of endless candy in the pantry and unlimited back rubs, but the ‚Äúfor better or worse‚Äù part meant the most.And boy, have we lived up to those vows. I mean, she‚Äôs always stayed by my side and supported me at my ‚Äúworse.‚Äù And believe me when I say that I‚Äôve had a lot of worse. A whole bunch of worse. She was also my number one supporter during our ‚Äúpoorer.‚Äù And believe me when I say that we‚Äôve seen some poorer. She never wavered, never faltered, never gave up on me ‚Äî no matter how bad things may have gotten. She was always willing to pick me up when I‚Äôd fall. She deserved so much better but, for some reason, she chose me.I remember our wedding day like it was yesterday, and thinking that the ‚Äú‚Äòtil death do us part‚Äù would come someday. Never in a million years did I think that ‚Äúpart‚Äù would come so soon. That part was supposed to happen 50 or 60 years from now, not today. For sure not now.But as I sit here today, watching her sleep, in the same hospital room we‚Äôve been living in for almost a month, death is exactly what we are facing.Less than two years ago, we were diagnosed with breast cancer. We fought it and we beat it. Five months ago she mentioned some back pain that we initially wrote off as just getting old, but it ended up being cancer in her spine. A month ago the cancer showed up in her spinal fluid, and just a few weeks ago, it invaded her brain.We‚Äôve talked to the experts. We‚Äôve gotten opinion after opinion. We‚Äôve even explored some pretty radical ideas suggested to us by complete strangers. But at this point, the team of doctors we‚Äôve assembled has assured us that any treatment may do more harm than good. And we all agree.As of now, the main goal is to keep her as comfortable as possible. And they‚Äôve done that. She‚Äôs more comfortable than she‚Äôs been in months. She doesn‚Äôt have pain like she once did. The ‚Äúcocktail of medicine‚Äù they have her on is doing the trick. And if it weren‚Äôt for her short-term memory loss, most days, you‚Äôd wonder what we‚Äôre even doing in this hospital.Each morning, when she wakes up (could be ‚Ä™3 a.m.‚Ä¨, could be ‚Ä™8 a.m.‚Ä¨, could be ‚Ä™11 a.m.‚Ä¨), she asks me ‚Äî and whoever else happens to be in the room ‚Äî the same question:‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan for today?‚ÄùAnd each morning my response is the same. For almost three weeks, my response hasn‚Äôt changed.I ask her if she‚Äôs comfortable. She says yes.I ask her if she has any pain. She says no.And then I say, that‚Äôs perfect, and reassure her that the plan is working. That she‚Äôs doing an awesome job with the plan. She smiles and says, ‚Äúgood.‚Äù I love that smile so much.I assume she asks this each day because she‚Äôs forgotten that there isn‚Äôt a plan. That we aren‚Äôt going anywhere. That we are literally just waiting. Waiting for her to die. But other days, I bet she just hopes. Hopes that the plan has changed. That maybe today is the day we‚Äôll bust out of this place.I‚Äôll never again hear that question the same way. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan for today?‚ÄùI dread it each morning because I hate my answer so much. I wish I could offer her more clarity. I wish I could tell her that things were getting better. Or that eventually, they will get better. I wish I could encourage her by telling her that we‚Äôre heading home, any day now. I wish I could fix this. But I can‚Äôt do any of those things.We have come to a really awkward point in our journey. There are no more treatment plans. The doctors have exhausted all their options. At this point, we just wait.And I know each day that passes is one day closer to me losing Rachel. One day closer to our three kids losing their mommy. To her parents losing their daughter. To my sister losing not only her sister-in-law, but her best friend. To her brother losing his only sibling. To my mom and dad, to all of our family, to her friends, and to those who know her from afar, all grieving the fact that we are losing such a beautiful person.As ugly as this all sounds, she‚Äôs continued to have an enormous impact on so many people. As one friend put it the other day, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even think we‚Äôve begun to see where she may take us.‚ÄùThis time is so hard. But in all the pain and suffering, between the tears and the fear, there is something so beautiful happening.‚ÄúPeople come to this room to be ministered to,‚Äù is what her dad said to me the other day. And when Rachel overhead this, her response was perfect.‚ÄúI know that I‚Äôm dying. I am at peace with that. And at this point, where I am today, all I have to give is Jesus.‚ÄùI‚Äôm not simply watching my wife die. That would be terrible and unbearable. I‚Äôm watching her live and love in a way that is beyond beautiful. I‚Äôm watching her minister to the masses. Each day, I have a front row seat to something indescribable. You can‚Äôt comprehend it unless you‚Äôre here.There is so much beauty in the brokenness. And Rachel‚Äôs helped us all find the beauty.I‚Äôm watching doctors and nurses in tears as Rachel shares stories with them about what she‚Äôs feeling and where she‚Äôs heading. And then I get to watch Rachel reassure them that it‚Äôs going to be okay.I‚Äôm watching friends flock in from all over the world just to spend five minutes with her, and I‚Äôm watching her comfort each and every one of them before they leave.Every single day, I watch as people come to say their goodbyes. And though you‚Äôd think it would be a brutal thing to watch, what I see is people who enter the room one way and leave the room completely transformed.I can‚Äôt explain it. It‚Äôs something you‚Äôd have to experience to understand. But it‚Äôs beautiful. There is so much beauty in the brokenness. And Rachel‚Äôs helped us all find the beauty.I have no idea how much longer we have. And we still have hope that Jesus will fix this. We‚Äôve never wavered from that. But we‚Äôd be crazy if we didn‚Äôt recognize all the miracles that He is performing right in front of our eyes, every day, through Rachel‚Äôs story. Not just in this hospital room, but all around the world.If you‚Äôve never met Rachel, I‚Äôm really sorry. I hate that for you. I wish you could all have just five minutes with her. I promise you that you‚Äôd look at life in a completely different way. I promise you that you‚Äôd enjoy the everyday moments so much more. I promise you that you‚Äôd complain less and laugh more. If you could just have five minutes with her, you‚Äôd understand what loving others really looks like. You‚Äôd leave so much better and you‚Äôd love so much harder.I‚Äôm so glad she chose me nearly 10 years ago to walk this walk with her. I‚Äôm so glad she chose me to fight this fight with her. I‚Äôm so glad she never gave up on me. And as ugly as this chapter should be, I‚Äôm just so glad she picked me. Every single day I‚Äôm grateful that she chose me. Our story is my favorite love story. Because she chose me.‚ÄôTil death do us part.WRITTEN BY"
238,Layout Inspector,https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/layout-inspector-1f8d446d048?source=extreme_main_feed---------241-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"Debugging UI issues can be tricky. Android Studio 4.0 comes with an updated Layout Inspector that lets you debug your Android app UI (user interface) in a way that‚Äôs similar to Chrome dev tools. The Layout Inspector works with your device or the Android Emulator and displays the current view hierarchy. This helps pinpoint issues and discover the root causes. Unlike the previous version, the updated Layout Inspector can show the view hierarchy in a 3D perspective which lets you visually see how views are laid out. With this, you can inspect the view hierarchy in layers. It also shows all the view‚Äôs attributes including those inherited from its parents.Let‚Äôs see how the latest version of the Layout Inspector works. To open the Layout Inspector click View and select Layout Inspector under the Tool Windows menu. This opens the Layout Inspector window.The Layout Inspector only displays a UI hierarchy from a running process. This means you need to connect to a debuggable running app on a device or on an emulator. There are two ways to do this:After you select your app process, the Layout Inspector creates a snapshot of the current UI hierarchy. If you select the Live updates option, the snapshot is dynamically updated as you interact with the app on the device.This version of the Layout Inspector resembles the previous version, but offers much more capability. To start with, the Layout Inspector can display the UI hierarchy two ways: in the usual 2D outline format, or in a 3D view called rotation mode.Clicking the rotation button switches between the 2D and 3D view of the UI hierarchy. Clicking the rotation button switches between the two modes. When you are in rotation mode you can rotate the image of the UI hierarchy. Rotation helps you see how views are laid out. Note that rotation is only available on devices API level 29 and above.You can also select a view and right-click to display only its children.Similarly, you can display the parents of a selected view.The pane on the right displays all of the declared and inherited attributes of the selected view. You can navigate to the layout‚Äôs corresponding xml file by clicking the link below any declared property. Like the rotation feature, this only works on devices running API level 29 or higher.With the Layout Inspector, you can also load a new design and compare it to your current UI.To load a design, click Load Overlay and select a design. After the image loads, you can change the alpha value of the overlay to see the difference between the current layout and the design.So far, we‚Äôve seen how the Layout Inspector works, Now let‚Äôs see how it can help solve app issues. Here we have a simple sample app which consists of a fragment with some static content of text and an image.If you want to try along while reading the post, follow the steps below first.When you run the app, you‚Äôll see a cute android ‚Äî but there is something missing: the bottom navigation tabs. Looking at the layout file, we can verify that the bottom navigation view is present, but somehow it does not appear on the screen.This looks like a good opportunity to try out the Layout Inspector! Let‚Äôs run the app and inspect this issue. Switching to rotation view after connecting to the app process reveals that there are problems with the app UI.What we see first is that the toolbar is laid out inside the LinearLayout, which is followed by the navigation host. Below that, you see the navigation tabs at the very bottom. It looks like the bottom bar is pushed off the screen.Maybe the size of the navigation host is wrong. Try setting the navigation host‚Äôs height to ‚Äòwrap_content‚Äô:Switching back to Layout Inspector, you can see that the linear layout has the correct size, but the bottom navigation tabs are not placed at the correct position:There are different ways to fix this. We can add layout weights to the navigation host and the bottom navigation tabs, or we can switch to using constraint layout instead of linear layout but switching layouts is beyond the scope of this post. So let‚Äôs add layout weights:And here is the result:Voila! Now when we run the app, everything is in the right place.Try out the new features of the Layout Inspector and let us know what you think! We are always looking to hear what you like, as well as issues you have or features that you would like to see.WRITTEN BY"
239,The Pantry Police,https://arcdigital.media/the-pantry-police-a236e9b148b4?source=extreme_main_feed---------242-74--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.Y
ou‚Äôve made it to the supermarket. You look both ways, ensuring no one‚Äôs too close by. You find yourself, at long last, in the dry pasta aisle. How much do you put into your ostensibly sanitized shopping cart? What might have once been the most mundane decision is now high stakes. Five bags and you‚Äôre a hoarder; just the one and you‚Äôre irresponsible, failing to keep your pantry well-stocked. Do you really expect 450 grams of pasta to get your household through an indefinite period of self-isolation?Slowly yet suddenly, everything changed.It wasn‚Äôt like Trump‚Äôs election, where everyone online would announce that the world had gone to bits, but day to day life largely went on as normal ‚Äî enjoyable for those who‚Äôd been having a good time of it, miserable for those who‚Äôd never had it great to begin with. No, the coronavirus has impacted nearly everyone on the planet in inescapable, material ways.What began as commonsense admonishing to wash your hands crept up to a sudden need to buy hand sanitizer, and then all of a sudden not just was handshaking out, but so was standing within six feet of another person. The uncertainty, and ramping-up of precautions, continues: First you were still meant to go for walks, for mental and physical health. Now it‚Äôs like, maybe not? First you would risk getting weird looks if you pushed your apartment building‚Äôs elevator button with your elbow; now it seems borderline reckless to get into the elevator at all.Human activity has been divided into the essential and the inessential, with breathing falling into the former category (as long as there are ventilators available, at least) and just about everything else, the latter. Office jobs, clothes-shopping, bar-going, sex (or just in-person conversation) with anyone you don‚Äôt happen to live with‚Äîall of these everyday pursuits have been put on hold, their eventual return uncertain.Falling somewhere ambiguous between necessity and frivolity, however, is food. On the one hand, we‚Äôve all got to eat. On the other, the discourse about eating in the era of coronavirus has a way of suggesting food is a luxury, a pseudo-requirement the more noble among us would somehow transcend. As though if you believe yourself and your family entitled to food, now and in the foreseeable future, then you‚Äôre exhibiting a level of unacceptable entitlement.Don‚Äôt hoard, goes the scolding drumbeat. But hoarding is a moving target. Don‚Äôt buy more than you need, but need for how many days? Even if you pick some estimate ‚Äî a week or two, say ‚Äî if this isn‚Äôt how you usually shop, if you or some members of your household normally have at least some meals or coffees out, how are you meant to know what this even means, how much to spend on this, of whatever your budget for it (money saved on going out minus money lost from the end of jobs) might be? Home cooking is a skill it takes time to acquire under the best of times, and even those of us who‚Äôve more or less acquired it may be stumped.And! If the idea is to go to the supermarket as rarely as possible, isn‚Äôt the correct approach to buy as much as you can carry, store, and afford? But if you buy the last bag of lentils, someone else who really needed them will not be able to get them. You, you ‚Ä¶ food-consumer, are a terrible person.But also, is it even fair to go to the supermarket at all, at a time like this? Grocery store employees are ‚Äî and this is undeniable ‚Äî in a terrible situation, among the rare workers compelled to interact with the public during a pandemic, but not with the inclinations (or compensation) of, say, a physician. By going to the store, by being another body in that enclosed space, getting up closer than six feet to a cashier, you‚Äôre making things worse. But so, too, by having groceries delivered, for the gig workers responsible for making those deliveries are also exploited and poorly protected from the slick but invisible coating of death that currently covers all surfaces. (That feeling when you can recite how long It lasts on cardboard, aluminum, a jacket‚Ä¶)A figure has emerged of the Bad Grocery-Shopper, the proverbial Karen who buys more than is correct (even though, and I cannot emphasize this enough, no one knows or can know what ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù would mean), and who is definitely, definitely buying toilet paper in excess. Indifferent to the fate of her local businesses (or, perhaps, newly unemployed herself?), she isn‚Äôt even sending a few bucks here and there to her preferred bars and caf√©s. The problem isn‚Äôt coronavirus; it is ‚Äî it‚Äôs soothing to think, apparently ‚Äî middle-aged, middle-class women buying groceries for their families.The blunt reality of grocery-shopping at this time is that it‚Äôs a terrifying experience. Picture a stroll with a woven basket through a Parisian organic-foods market while on vacation, then imagine the opposite. First, you wait in a line a morbid six feet behind the person in front of you, hoping that everyone obeys this and that dude behind you who‚Äôs looking at his phone will stop meandering near you, closer than six feet at any rate, as if it were still February.Then you‚Äôre allowed inside and you have to make your way as quickly as possible through your handwritten shopping list (so as not to touch the petri dish that is your phone), trying not to get within six feet of other shoppers or store employees. If you need something on a high shelf, forget it. Baguettes carelessly exposed to the elements in the store and on the way home? How quaint. Want to take a closer look at some broccoli to make sure it‚Äôs not rotten? Can‚Äôt linger. Everything you touch, you need to buy, since you ‚Äî yes you, even if symptom-free and wearing the makeshift hazmat suit one must for such occasions ‚Äî could well be shedding virus without realizing it.It‚Äôs hard not to get furious at those other shoppers who are doing it all wrong. Who are surely treating the pandemic like yet another excuse to shop, and buying up all the flour because sourdough is trending, plus all the beans because something something Alison Roman. It‚Äôs hard not to get furious, period. And the bean-and-flour brigade are, after all, a lot easier to scream at than the actual haves, who have, of course, retreated to comfortable self-isolation in their vacation homes, far from the checkout.It‚Äôs comforting to retreat into discourse, and more specifically, into the circa-2010 era of people thinking the main political issue of the day was individual consumers‚Äô grocery decisions. Imagine if it were that simple, if it were just a matter of honing in on the correct number of beans, or the right target for grocery-shaming, and you could somehow catapult yourself out of this dystopia.The fact of the matter is, individual grocery-shoppers are probably not up to anything all that sinister. It‚Äôs unclear how much ‚Äúhoarding‚Äù is that people are going in and buying everything in sight, and how much is just the aggregate result of most buying a bit more than usual, as we‚Äôve all been instructed to do. It‚Äôs not clear from a bursting shopping cart whether these are groceries for one or for a bunch of roommates or relatives. Nor is it clear whether an item that‚Äôs the last on a shelf is the last one in the entire store.There‚Äôs no commonsense answer to how to ethically approach grocery-shopping, because this is a totally new ‚Äî and immensely stressful ‚Äî situation. People are lining up at and filling supermarkets not out of indifference to social distancing but because, you know, food. The urgent pay and safety concerns of supermarket employees and gig workers are not addressed by headlines like ‚ÄúIs Your Grocery Delivery Worth a Worker‚Äôs Life?,‚Äù at a moment when it‚Äôs also meant to be irresponsible to go out and buy groceries.There is, it‚Äôs clear, a problem with food distribution at this moment. Whatever the solution to it might be, it‚Äôs not shaming people who have the audacity to eat.WRITTEN BY"

Every single one of us wants to feel loved by our partner. But for one reason or another, you know there‚Äôs room for improvement & that something needs to change.Over the years, I‚Äôve found myself in the same position as you many times. But I‚Äôve discovered that one of the best ways to improve your relationship is by making an effort to understand each other‚Äôs opinions during a conversation. In the words of Seneca:‚ÄúOne of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand and to be understood.‚ÄùSo below are a collection of principles that will help you to improve the quality of your relationship significantly. Each one of these points helped me to become emotionally intelligent & prevent loads of arguments with my partner. I‚Äôm sure they will do the same for you, too.I‚Äôve discovered that listening to your partner‚Äôs opinion is a great way to understand how they arrived at a specific conclusion. After all, if you genuinely understand where they‚Äôre coming from, it makes it much easier to find common ground during an argument.Epictetus once said, ‚ÄúWe have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.‚Äù So now that I take the time to listen to other people‚Äôs opinions, I‚Äôm getting into fewer arguments as I‚Äôm not misunderstanding what the other person is saying.You don‚Äôt need to agree with everything that your partner says during a conversation. After all, we all have different circumstances that help us to form individual opinions about the world.But if you want to have fewer arguments with your spouse, recognizing that it‚Äôs okay to have different opinions is a great place to start.Because when you focus on finding what unites you, instead of the subjects that divide you, it‚Äôs easier to spend your time as a couple focusing on the things that genuinely matter.One of the biggest mistakes I used to make in my relationships was focusing on things that I couldn‚Äôt control. For example, I‚Äôd often spend hours trying to figure out the rationale behind someone‚Äôs negative actions.But I‚Äôve recently started letting go of external events, and instead, focusing solely on my reaction to them. Because if I cannot choose what happens to me, I‚Äôve realized that the only thing I can control is my response. In the words of the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius:‚ÄúYou have power over your mind ‚Äî not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.‚ÄùYou will inevitably question the rationale behind your partner‚Äôs actions and wish for certain aspects of the past to be different. But once you focus on the present moment & the events within your control, you‚Äôll realize that any arguments about the past are trivial as it‚Äôs something that can‚Äôt be changed.For example, you might have had previous arguments with your partner about their impulsive spending habits. However, you can use this moment as an opportunity to mutually accept what‚Äôs happened, learn from previous mistakes, and move on.So instead of looking back at the past, try to focus on creating a better future alongside your partner. As when you‚Äôre both no longer concerned by events that can‚Äôt be changed, it becomes much easier to focus on everything that can.During the heat of an argument, it‚Äôs incredibly easy for you to say something impulsive that you may later regret. But if you want to improve your relationship, I‚Äôve found that a great way to reduce tension is by temporarily holding back your negative emotions.Research shows that people are likely to ignore any information that contradicts their opinion during an argument. Known as confirmation bias, this makes us ignore rational arguments & favor any information that supports our beliefs.So instead of trying to prove that you have the correct point of view, take a moment to calm down so you can evaluate what you want to say without being aggravated by emotion. Cato the Younger said it best:‚ÄúI will begin to speak, when I have that to say which had not better be unsaid.‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre constantly comparing your relationship to everyone else‚Äôs, you‚Äôll probably develop unrealistic expectations as you want to achieve an impossible level of perfection.However, it‚Äôs important to remember that many people portray a false reality on social media as they don‚Äôt want to share the negative aspects of their life.So instead of comparing your relationship, become willing to do anything necessary to become a better partner towards your spouse. In the words of Ryan Holiday:‚ÄúYour potential, the absolute best you‚Äôre capable of ‚Äî that‚Äôs the metric to measure yourself against.‚ÄùSo every day, ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat actions can I take right now to become more empathetic to my partner, and improve my relationship?‚ÄùThat‚Äôs all you need to do.WRITTEN BY"

Is there an easy way to level up a T-shirt and jeans wardrobe without blowing my entire first month‚Äôs pay?ell, well, well! If your job is letting/encouraging/forcing you to work from home because of the pandemic (and you‚Äôve been fortunate enough not to be laid off), you might be able to save up and blow your second month‚Äôs pay on a new wardrobe. Problem solved. Of course, you might not be working from home, and hopefully, the pandemic will be over one day.The easiest thing to do, if you don‚Äôt feel like spending a lot of money or overthinking it, is to just buy a bunch of stuff at the mall, or at least the digital equivalent: Banana Republic, J. Crew, etc. Get a navy suit, a gray suit, a few white shirts, a few blue shirts, some black shoes, a black belt, and keep it moving. It‚Äôs not the sexy answer, but it works. (If you need sexy, Rick Owens once said that a younger, broker Rick would shop at Uniqlo.) I don‚Äôt know what kind of job you have that frowns on T-shirts and jeans, but mall stuff is probably fine for whatever conservative atmosphere you‚Äôre clocking into.But, you‚Äôre a person who likes clothes, it sounds like, which is why your closet is so loveable. How did your closet get that way? Did you buy it all in one weekend with the first paycheck from your last job? Probably not, right? It took time. Read some fashion magazines. Read some menswear blogs. Read some fashion magazines‚Äô menswear blogs. Watch some runway shows. When it‚Äôs safe again, go to your local fancy clothing store for some ‚Äúlook, but don‚Äôt touch‚Äù (or some ‚Äúlook and touch, but don‚Äôt buy‚Äù). Figure out the kind of look you want, what kind of stuff you like, and what you can get away with at the office. Then, start picking things up. A pair of slacks here, a sportcoat there, a pair of hard bottoms, a nice tie, etc. But the stuff doesn‚Äôt have to be new (or expensive, even). Find a consignment shop you like or a good resale website. Go to a thrift store, and take some stuff to the tailor.If this all sounds basic, it‚Äôs because it is. But it‚Äôs also easy if you don‚Äôt mind being a little patient. The motto of the street style photographer Mordechai ‚ÄúMister Mort‚Äù Rubinstein is ‚Äúsome men get dressed.‚Äù The men in his photos may not all be dressed expensively, but they‚Äôre always dressed well.My cousin is always telling me to support Black-owned businesses, but how do I actually do that, especially now that there are so many of them?sk your cousin! Seriously. If you have the kind of relationship with your cousin where they‚Äôre asking you to do something, and you eventually listen, you should ask them the best way to do what they‚Äôve been asking you to do. It‚Äôll make for a nice bonding experience. But maybe you and your cousin are no longer on speaking terms.For starters, supporting Black businesses shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult. When the Department of Commerce last counted Black businesses in 2012, there were 2.6 million of them. Even Wyoming had a few hundred. But I‚Äôm guessing the problem is finding them, to which I would say: Just do some Googles. I know that‚Äôs probably infuriating to hear from someone whose stated intention is to answer your questions, but I don‚Äôt know where you live. For instance, where I am there‚Äôs a specialty website, Black-Owned Brooklyn, dedicated to shouting out Black-owned businesses in the borough. If there‚Äôs nothing like that in your area, chances are there‚Äôs probably a Black chamber of commerce with a local directory you can peruse. If you don‚Äôt have one of those, you don‚Äôt have to be picky. If you‚Äôve ever seen a Black someone plugging their business underneath a viral tweet or on your Instagram Explore page, try that. Find any old Black business, online or off, that offers something you want to buy, and buy it. The coronavirus is burning the economy down, so I‚Äôm sure any of them would welcome your patronage.But what‚Äôs driving this newfound desire to support Black businesses? Do you think that it‚Äôs important to support entrepreneurs who are best able to serve their community because they‚Äôre from that community? Are you reacting to persistent discrimination toward Black customers by non-Black business owners? Or vice versa? Is it because you think that doing so is the best way to support the liberation of Black people? If this is the mission that you‚Äôre taking up for yourself, then you should go into it with a clear idea of what you‚Äôre doing it for. There are plenty of Black businesses that push products that are harmful to Black people. Assuming that you‚Äôre Black or a member of another marginalized group, what‚Äôs to stop a Black business owner from discriminating against you for some other reason? Says who that capitalism is even the answer at all?Maybe I‚Äôm overcomplicating it. Maybe you just want to put some money in some Black people‚Äôs hands. Well, you don‚Äôt necessarily need to buy something from a Black business to do that. Yes, support Black businesses, but maybe toss some money to the National Bail Out to free some incarcerated Black moms, or to the Black Youth Project 100 to fund some young Black activists, or to the Okra Project Grocery Fund to feed some Black trans and gender nonconforming folks. Or sprinkle a blessing in a random Black person‚Äôs Cash App. Have fun with it.WRITTEN BY"

Small, cozy, and stylish, it was the perfect place to come home to after a long day at the office. We did not know it would soon become our shared office as we went into quarantine.I started out hopeful. On the second day of the coronavirus lockdown, I woke up smiling, joking to my fianc√©e about our new adventure as co-workers. She laughed ‚Äî and then muttered, ‚ÄúGod, I‚Äôm going to miss my solitude.‚Äù It hit me then that we were in for a long journey ahead.For couples who are used to kissing each other goodbye in the morning and not reuniting again until dinnertime, living and working together at home has become a minefield. Work habits and personas are suddenly on full display all day, every day: You might discover that your partner is a loud typer, a Slack giggler, or a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs circle back‚Äù guy.There are logistical issues, too. What happens when you both have Zoom meetings scheduled for the same time? How do you divvy up chores when it seems like everything gets messier more quickly? When do you ever get time apart?

But even with all the challenges, you can make the most of this strange time, and even use it to become closer as a couple. Here are some ways to adjust to your new normal, together.Throughout our relationship, my fianc√©e and I have never spent all of our time together. We have different jobs, different friend circles. So now that we‚Äôre in the same space nearly 24/7, it‚Äôs been vital that we still make time to do our own thing.So we schedule timeouts, little blocks of time during the day to enjoy our own separate interests. I might sit and listen to a podcast while she watches TV. Or she might go out to the garden for some fresh air while I sit and play the guitar. Make time for your own hobbies and delights, and put that time on the calendar to make sure you stick to it.Now that you work together, you have to try and sync your routines. Having a sense of predictability in times of upheaval will help reduce your stress and minimize arguments.Our schedule is as follows:Find whatever works for you, and stick to it.My fianc√©e and I have one table to work on. Once our laptops, phones, notebooks, and cups of tea are spread out across it, there‚Äôs little room for much else. To ensure we can be productive, we make an effort to respect this workspace: We are always tidying up after ourselves and being mindful of what items we actually need around us.Treat your home workspace the same way you‚Äôd treat your actual workspace: If you wouldn‚Äôt leave dishes lying around on your desk at the office, don‚Äôt leave them scattered at home.This is also a good time to have a new conversation about daily chores. Both of you being home all day means there are more dishes to wash and bags of trash to take out. A well-kept home isn‚Äôt just important for your work; it also does wonders for the mind, relieving stress and helping to keep your relationship running as smoothly as possible.As essential as it is to find time apart, it‚Äôs just as important for you and your partner to keep doing things together as a couple. You might rehash the activities you typically enjoy doing and adjust them so you can do them at home. Like going to the pub on Friday nights? Why not open a bottle of wine, dust off those board games you save for the holidays with relatives, and start Friday game nights? Are you normally outdoors people? Schedule in a daily walk around the block, or have a picnic in your garden. Love restaurants? Use this time to learn to make some of your favorite dishes together. Make sure that your couple time isn‚Äôt exclusively focused around screen time, and try to talk about something other than the coronavirus.This is a new, unsettling situation for all of us. For those in relationships, respecting each other‚Äôs needs and boundaries can help you get through it together.WRITTEN BY"
243,Modern User Storage on Android,https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/modern-user-storage-on-android-e9469e8624f9?source=extreme_main_feed---------246-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--8,"To protect user data and reduce the amount of space consumed by apps, Android 10 introduced changes to the behavior of the external storage permission. Android 11 Developer Preview continues this effort while adding improvements designed to help developers adapt to the changes.Most of the apps published on Google Play that request the storage permission do so for common reasons, such as saving files on SD cards or reading media files. These apps are able to save a large number of files on disk that remain after the app is uninstalled. They can also read potentially sensitive files from other apps.With Android 10, we adjusted how storage permission works, to give apps the access they need. This also limits file clutter by encouraging apps to save files in their designated directories which are cleared when an app is deleted.The storage changes in Android 10 followed three basic principles:Apps targeting Android 10 can contribute to their own external app directories and organize media collections (audio, video, images, and downloads) without needing to request the storage permission. The Storage permission only allows apps to read media files shared by other apps in the audio, video, and image collections. However, it does not give read access to files in the Downloads collection that the app did not create. The only way for apps to access non-media files created by other apps in Android 10 is by using the document picker provided by the Storage Access Framework.In Android 11, we will continue to improve the developer experience related to Scoped Storage by introducing the following changes.Android 10 required that all apps use MediaStore APIs to access photos, videos, and music files. This will continue to be our recommendation. However, we understand that many apps depend heavily on APIs that use file paths, including third-party libraries, that cannot easily switch to using file descriptors. So in Android 11, APIs and libraries that use file paths will be enabled again. Your app can use the requestLegacyExternalStorage manifest attribute to ensure compatibility for users running Android 10.Under the hood, I/O requests using file paths are delegated to the MediaStore API. This redirection has some performance impact when used to read files outside of your isolated storage. Further, using file paths does not provide any feature benefits over the MediaStore APIs, hence our strong recommendation to use the MediaStore directly.On Android 10, users were required to confirm each file that an app requested to edit or delete. With Android 11, apps can request to modify or delete several media files at once. The system gallery app will never show these dialogs. We hope that this improvement makes the user experience more streamlined.After we limited access to broad storage, several app developers attempted to use the Storage Access framework to traverse the entire file system. However, SAF isn‚Äôt a suitable tool to support broad access to shared storage. We therefore updated it to limit visibility to certain paths.In Android 11, users will not be able to grant directory access to the root Downloads directory, the root directory of each reliable SD card volume, or external app directories. Apps can still use the Storage Access Framework API and the document picker to ask the user to select individual files from shared storage.For apps that require broad access to shared storage, such as file managers or backup apps, Android 11 will introduce a special permission called MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE. This will grant read and write access to all shared storage, including non-media files. However, the contents of app-specific directories, both within internal and external storage, will not be accessible.We want to continue allowing some apps to have broad access to files on external storage, provided they have a use case that truly requires it. In Android 11, these apps can declare MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE which will allow them to request the user to grant them ‚ÄúAll Files Access‚Äù in settings. The following are a couple of app examples that will be allowed:However, if your app requires access to a single file, such as a word processor app, you should instead use the Storage Access Framework.Before we broadly roll out this policy change in Google Play, we would love to get your feedback on your app‚Äôs specific needs in this area. Please fill out this survey, to share your feedback on Scoped Storage and other features and changes in Android 11.If your app requires MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE or uses APIs that rely on file paths, you must declare requestLegacyExternalStorage=true in your Android manifest so that your app will work as expected on devices running Android 10.You can read more about this in the developer documentation and our talk from the Android Dev Summit 2019.We value your feedback! You can report issues or feature requests through the issues tracker. Stay tuned for upcoming articles about how to use Scoped Storage with the MediaStore and Storage Access Framework APIs.WRITTEN BY"
244,"If You Really Want to Optimize Your Diet, Focus on Fiber",https://elemental.medium.com/if-you-really-want-to-optimize-your-diet-focus-on-fiber-c4ad231806f?source=extreme_main_feed---------247-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"t‚Äôs a puzzle that doctors have long struggled to solve: Inflammatory bowel disease, a gut condition that was once vanishingly rare, now affects roughly three million Americans. Between 1999 and 2015 alone, rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) surged by 44% in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No one is quite sure why.The term ‚Äúinflammatory bowel disease‚Äù encompasses two conditions ‚Äî Crohn‚Äôs disease and ulcerative colitis. Both are associated with improper and damaging inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. ‚ÄúIBD is a relatively new disease,‚Äù says Dr. Gilaad Kaplan, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine and the University of Calgary‚Äôs Cumming School of Medicine. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt really begin to see it until the 1800s, and it‚Äôs almost exclusive to industrialized countries.‚ÄùKaplan says the causes of America‚Äôs escalating IBD rates are almost certainly multiple and may include the injudicious use of bacteria-slaying antibiotics, which can disrupt the function of the human GI tract and microbiome. But while the harms of antibiotic overuse are on a lot of people‚Äôs radars, Kaplan says another, less talked about issue may be contributing to IBD‚Äôs rise: American‚Äôs paltry fiber intakes.While national nutrition guidelines advise men and women to consume between 22 and 34 grams of fiber a day, the average American only swallows about 15 grams.‚ÄúThere are many cohort studies that have shown people who eat less fiber are at high risk for developing Crohn‚Äôs disease,‚Äù Kaplan says. One of the most robust of these studies was a 2013 report from researchers at Harvard Medical School that looked at diet and health data collected from roughly 170,000 women over a period of more than 26 years. It found that those women who landed in the top fifth of the population in terms of fiber intakes were 40% less likely to have been diagnosed with Crohn‚Äôs disease than women who landed in the bottom fifth.‚ÄúThe average person is not even remotely aware of the importance of fiber.‚Äù‚ÄúIBD is complicated ‚Äî it‚Äôs not driven by any one factor,‚Äù Kaplan says. ‚ÄúBut where all the research is taking us today is toward the microbiome.‚Äù And fiber is integral to a healthy and properly functioning microbiome, he says.Fiber is not a vitamin or a mineral. It‚Äôs not an essential nutrient that the human body absorbs and utilizes to shore up the walls of cells or to solidify the strength of nerves. Fiber is a group of carbohydrates ‚Äî found almost exclusively in plant foods ‚Äî that resist breakdown in the small intestine. But it‚Äôs exactly that resistance to breakdown that makes fiber so indispensable to the gut and the trillions of microorganisms that it houses. While low fiber intakes are implicated in IBD, the research on dietary fiber stretches back decades and encompasses the health of the GI tract, the brain, the lungs, and the heart.‚ÄúThe average person is not even remotely aware of the importance of fiber,‚Äù says Dr. Robert Lustig, an emeritus professor of pediatrics and endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity, and Disease. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have a clue.‚ÄùWhen considered alongside discussions of biohacking, ketogenic diets, and some of today‚Äôs other complicated-sounding nutritional fads, talk about fiber can seem fusty and antiquated. Your grandmother drinks a fiber supplement to help her poop. Yawn.But while fiber isn‚Äôt new or sexy, it may have more evidence backing its benefits than any other single component of the human diet. A 2018 review in the Journal of Nutrition compiled decades of evidence linking high-fiber diets ‚Äî and, in particular, the consumption of insoluble fibers from whole grains ‚Äî to a reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes. Other research efforts have found that eating fiber prevents weight gain and obesity in both kids and adults.While fiber isn‚Äôt new or sexy, it may have more evidence backing its benefits than any other single component of the human diet.Fiber‚Äôs benefits aren‚Äôt confined to the gut. A 2018 research review published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that adequate fiber intakes were ‚Äúconvincingly‚Äù associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, coronary artery disease, and all-cause mortality. That review also found evidence that fiber may fend off various types of cancer ‚Äî including cancer of the pancreas and stomach. There‚Äôs even research that finds fiber supports deep, restorative sleep (though it‚Äôs unclear why).To understand how fiber could have all these effects, it‚Äôs important to understand just what fiber is and what it does in the human gut. ‚ÄúThere are two kinds of fiber, and you need both,‚Äù Lustig says. ‚ÄúOne without the other is not nearly as effective.‚ÄùThe two kinds of fiber he‚Äôs referring to are soluble and insoluble. Soluble fibers partially dissolve in water, and many form a gel-like substance during digestion in the small intestine. Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, maintains its fibrous, stringy structure as it passes through the GI tract. ‚ÄúWhen you have both soluble and insoluble fiber, the stringy stuff forms a latticework on the inside of the small intestine and duodenum, and the gel stuff plugs the holes of that latticework,‚Äù Lustig explains. The resulting barrier acts as a natural governor ‚Äî limiting the speed with which the small intestine absorbs the sugar molecules it derives from food. This moderating effect prevents the big insulin spikes that occur when too much sugar floods the bloodstream and liver and that are associated with weight gain and metabolic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes.But fiber‚Äôs ability to helpfully slow down sugar absorption is arguably the least of its attributes. ‚ÄúWhen soluble fiber gets down into the lower intestine, the bacteria there can convert it into short-chain fatty acids that are anti-inflammatory,‚Äù Lustig explains. This conversion produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which lower inflammation not only in the GI tract but also in the lungs, the brain, and elsewhere. Research has linked the consumption of fiber and the resulting uptick in SCFAs to reduced lung inflammation and a lower risk for airway disease and also to a reduction in the types of brain inflammation that contribute to age-related cognitive decline. These same short-chain fatty acids also have anti-cancer effects, according to a 2016 study in the journal Pharmacology and Therapeutics.Insoluble fibers ‚Äî the ones that water can‚Äôt break down and that maintain their string-like structure throughout digestion ‚Äî bind to water molecules and also to stray food particles. This binding helps shuttle water and waste through the upper GI tract and into the colon, promoting the formation of bulkier, softer poop. (That‚Äôs a good thing.) Insoluble fiber also binds to bile acids, carcinogens, and other harmful substances, thereby ensuring they‚Äôre harmlessly dumped out of the body. Lustig says insoluble fibers also act like ‚Äúlittle scrubbies‚Äù on the walls of the colon, helping to clear away dead cells and leftover globs of partially digested food.Last but not least, the trillions of bacteria that comprise the gut microbiome and that live primarily in the colon feed on fiber. Fiber-rich foods not only serve as sustenance for these bacteria, but they have prebiotic effects ‚Äî meaning they promote the health of the gut‚Äôs microflora.‚ÄúFiber has been shown to produce a diverse microbiome,‚Äù says Dr. Berkeley Limketkai, director of clinical research at the UCLA Center for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. He mentions a 2016 study published in the journal Nature that found feeding mice a ‚Äúwestern‚Äù diet low in fiber changed their offspring‚Äôs gut bacteria in unhealthy ways. ‚ÄúThat study showed that if you deprived mice fiber, subsequent generations were born with depleted microbiome diversity and richness,‚Äù he explains. A healthy and diverse microbiome plays a pivotal role in proper immune function, and microbiome dysfunction is associated with diseases of the gut, heart, brain, and lungs.Over and above all of these fiber-specific effects, fiber-rich foods also tend to also be good sources of vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and other healthy constituents, says Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.Willett says that whole foods ‚Äî including some that may surprise people ‚Äî are the healthiest sources of dietary fiber.Most whole plant foods ‚Äî fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes ‚Äî are good sources of fiber. ‚ÄúEverything that comes out of the ground and is not processed,‚Äù summarizes Lustig.But legumes in particular are fiber superstars. A cup of peas, beans, lentils, peanuts, and other legumes packs at least twice as much fiber as a like amount of most fruits or vegetables. If the prospect of loading your diet with beans and lentils has you worried about gas, those worries are well-founded: Gas is one of the byproducts of the kind of healthy soluble-fiber fermentation that produces beneficial SCFAs. Consider flatulence a sign that you‚Äôre doing it right.Willett says that whole grain foods are a source of fiber that research has consistently linked with a reduced risk for obesity and disease. But not all whole grains are created equal. ‚ÄúIt is best to consume them mainly intact, such as brown rice, wheat berries, or steel-cut oats rather than as fine flour,‚Äù he says.The same is true of fruits and vegetables. Lustig says that any form of processing ‚Äî juicing, blending, etc. ‚Äî can degrade the fiber in these foods and reduce or eliminate their healthy effects. For this reason, he recommends eating whole fruits and vegetables instead of slurping smoothies. Berries, apples, and pears are all loaded with fiber. When it comes to common vegetables, broccoli, brussels sprouts, artichokes, pumpkin, and skin-on potatoes are fiber standouts.It may be tempting to load your diet with one or two fiber-rich foods, but Willett says eating a variety is best. He also says the popularity of low-carb diets may be leading American eaters in the wrong direction, nutritionally speaking. ‚ÄúThe elimination of dietary fiber [due to] the very low carbohydrate diets being promoted is a concern,‚Äù he says.Fiber may not be new or exciting. But the science to date suggests that few elements of the human diet are as critical to overall health.WRITTEN BY"
245,Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Record Unemployment Claims,https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-record-unemployment-claims-97391f210e7b?source=extreme_main_feed---------248-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"Last week saw the largest single-week jump in new unemployment claims in American history ‚Äî 3.3 million people filed for unemployment, and likely many more than that are now out of work as people are staying home to slow the spread of COVID-19. These numbers reflect overwhelming job losses in service industries like accommodation and food service, which means lower-income workers are already feeling the impact of this crisis in a major way. Secretary Mnuchin may think these numbers ‚Äúare not relevant,‚Äù but for those who were already struggling to make ends meet, this is a very real crisis.That‚Äôs why we have to do whatever is necessary to get the relief the Senate just approved to these families fast ‚Äî and to keep as many Americans on the payroll as possible.The President is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response that has exacerbated both the public health and economic impact on our country. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don‚Äôt have jobs because our president didn‚Äôt do his job when it mattered.Nearly every country is facing this pandemic ‚Äî but not every country has responded the same way. South Korea, among other steps, deployed intensive testing and contact-tracing measures to slow and control the spread of the virus. Donald Trump didn‚Äôt do that. He didn‚Äôt get ahead of it when he had the chance. And in the absence of an early, aggressive response to flatten the curve, cities and states have been left with no option other than extreme social distancing measures, causing businesses to close and lay off workers. Now we are facing the economic fallout as well as a worsening public health crisis.The White House‚Äôs mindset needs to shift. Effective planning, implementation, and execution are required to address this public health and economic crisis. The Congress is stepping up and doing its job by providing generous and timely unemployment insurance. But once the relief bill is signed into law, Trump will still have to do the hard work to execute it effectively: getting the funds out the door to make those who were laid off financially whole and the small business loans distributed to keep as many people on payroll as possible.But none of that will ultimately matter if we can‚Äôt defeat the coronavirus. We won‚Äôt be able to revive the economy and get people back to work without a public health action plan that saves lives and halts the virus as quickly as possible.WRITTEN BY"
246,The Coronavirus Crisis Checklist for Startup CEOs,https://marker.medium.com/the-corona-crisis-checklist-for-start-up-ceos-5294dd05e5c2?source=extreme_main_feed---------249-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"Dear startup CEOs: It‚Äôs time to shift your mindset.Last week might have been about growth and funky new initiatives. It could have been about hiring employees and closing that new financing round and launching that new product. Last week was about shiny things. Growth was your religion, and your North Star was closing deals and booking revenues. Amen.But we woke up in a different world, a world where part of the population is shielded from normal social life (or will be soon) due to the spread of coronavirus. This new world calls for new rules. Your new religion is now survival, and your new God is called liquidity.I‚Äôm willing to bet none of you had a ‚Äúglobal pandemic‚Äù section in your 2020 financial planning sheet.I spoke to a VC today who summarized it nicely: ‚ÄúIn 12 months it will be easy for you to explain why your startup didn‚Äôt grow in the last six months. But it will be very hard to explain why your startup is dead.‚ÄùWhatever your priorities were in the last couple of months, your new top priority needs to be cash. But there are more things to consider in times like these. Managing a crisis can be hard, especially if it‚Äôs your first and has the magnitude of the current one. So consider these points as a guideline to give you a bit of a direction:Most 2020 plans were created based on a more or less normal worldview. I‚Äôm willing to bet none of you had a ‚Äúglobal pandemic‚Äù section in your 2020 financial planning sheet. So you might as well clear out the entire document and start on a blank page. New realities call for new plans.There is not enough information and clarity about the whole situation to create a robust new plan just yet. Steering your ship in times of crisis will require a lot of course corrections and smaller maneuvers. So make the planning part of your daily war room and adjust the forecast as you gather new information. Your new object of attention in the new planning process will become liquidity.By now, this might be a no-brainer, but it‚Äôs still worth repeating. Most startup CEOs I know have sent their employees home to work remotely, and those who haven‚Äôt should. With a lot of countries implementing various social-distancing policies, remote work seems like the safest and most reasonable thing to do. Of course, this means that productivity is going to drop temporarily. But let‚Äôs be realistic: What would productivity look like if people sat around scared in your office fearing to become infected? Or if they just called in sick and didn‚Äôt show up at all?While implementing a work-from-home policy for your company, don‚Äôt feel the need to reinvent the wheel.While implementing a work-from-home policy for your company, don‚Äôt feel the need to reinvent the wheel. Other organizations have done this before and kindly shared their experiences. Research best practices first, do a test run, and then implement your WFH policy. The quicker the better.My friend Steli Efti, the CEO of Close, has been working remotely along with his staff of more than 50 people over the last five years. His best advice: overcommunicate. With an ongoing crisis that naturally requires more communication and a possible transition to remote work, you have all the more reason to communicate a lot.In my experience, turbulent times call for different levels of communication. There is town hall-style communication where you as the CEO address the entire staff with updates and then answer questions. On top of doing that weekly during the crisis, take the time to address individual team members directly as needed.You will spend an enormous amount of time talking to people and addressing their insecurities over the next couple of weeks and months. Don‚Äôt be afraid to repeat yourself, to be proactive in seeking employees out, and to overcommunicate, overcommunicate, overcommunicate.The concept of ‚Äúwar rooms‚Äù obviously originated from military procedures and means putting together a physical or virtual space to gather all mission-critical information and to bring relevant people together to make quick decisions.Establish a daily war room to bring relevant people together to make quick decisions regarding coronavirus and its impact on your startup and your staff. You should assemble your co-founders and management team regularly to review new information and make decisions. Use those meetings to carefully observe your incoming orders, revenues, and, most importantly, to track your cash flow and cash on hand.The more substantial the impact of the crisis, the more often the meetings will happen, and the longer they will take place. In the beginning, start holding them daily and then reduce intervals when needed.Use the first war room meetings to answer these questions: How are your business operations and supply chain impacted by the crisis? If you‚Äôre selling physical products, could your supply flow be restricted or cut off? Is the distribution of your products affected? A lot of warehouses will have a shortage of workers and lower capacity than in regular times.If you don‚Äôt deal with physical products, take note of the critical business functions that could suffer from people getting sick, staying home, or being temporarily overwhelmed by a transition to remote work. In which parts of your business are you reliant on third-party suppliers, and how can you make sure they will still supply you?Concerning new projects and initiatives: I would (at least for the moment) pause shipping new features or new products and pause opening new locations and generally question everything ‚Äúnew‚Äù until the situation gets clearer and your core operations run sustainably and are stable.As much as you rely on your suppliers, your customers depend on you. So take the time and communicate thoroughly how you will handle your service and if customers should expect any restrictions. Remember to overcommunicate.Your sales have likely already been affected by the new situation. A small number of businesses‚Äô revenues will soar (think online education, video conferencing, e-commerce for household goods, etc.), but most will at least temporarily stagnate or decline. In the B2B industry, signing up new clients through a sales organization might turn out to be challenging because of the lack of physical interactions as well as a general expenditure freeze.The new reality is: You can‚Äôt control your top line, so better prepare to work on cash collection and cost structure.One VC told me about a portfolio company that employs 35 sales reps and usually closes on 20 new clients per month. The number of clients closed for the last two weeks was exactly zero. And from an acquaintance who runs an e-commerce fulfillment center, I heard that orders throughout all industries have decreased by 30% to 40% since last week.The psychological burden of quarantine lockdowns and uncertainty will undoubtedly impact consumer behavior in the short-term. As for mid-term and long-term planning: Of course, specific industries like e-commerce could benefit from the new situation, but it‚Äôs just too early to tell. The new reality is you can‚Äôt control your top line, so better prepare to work on cash collection and cost structure.In every crisis, cash is king. The opposite is also true: The company left without cash on hand can quickly become a fool. So look at your cash position today and calculate your runway based on lower revenue scenarios.In my experience, the most pragmatic thing is to create three scenarios: 1) best case; 2) average case; and 3) worst case. In an ordinary world, ‚Äúbest case‚Äù would mean growing revenues (the 2020 plan you just dumped). In today‚Äôs world, the ‚Äúbest case‚Äù should probably mean steady revenues. The average and worst case would be some degree of revenue declines, for example, -20% and -40%. Sadly, there are already companies where their respective declines approach -100% (think along the lines of a startup in the live events industry).The actual numbers depend on the early signs you gather from your sales and how heavily your company depends on new customers vs. existing ones. Monitor sales and marketing carefully to find out which scenario is most realistic for you. That‚Äôs what your war room meetings will be for.The shorter your runway, the more drastically you should execute the following actions. If you have more than 12 months of runway, even in the average-case or worst-case scenario, you have enough time to observe and could allow yourself to course-correct first in a couple of months. If you are between six and 12 months, you should be very cautious and have a contingency plan ready to execute. If your runway comes out under six months in the average-case scenario (which will be the case for a lot of startups), the time to act is now.At this point, you might be having an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment. It‚Äôs the moment when you realize you‚Äôre much shorter on cash and runway than you initially thought. Things might look much bleaker than at first sight. Welcome to the part that sucks most about entrepreneurship. Your job isn‚Äôt about figuring out the best option anymore. Your job is now finding the option that is the least bad. And this option will probably still hurt, but less than all the other options you have at your disposal.With the new reality around us comes a new goal: preserving cash. That‚Äôs an entirely different modus operandi than executing a growth strategy and calls for different measures.Following the financial crisis in 2008/2009, venture capital investments fell sharply, by over 50% from their peak in 2008. It took over two years before funding got back to the old level at the beginning of 2011. Think about it from the VC perspective: Hoarding cash in times of uncertainty might be the dominant strategy. Nobody wants to invest in a ‚Äúfalling knife,‚Äù even if the macro environment causes it. So don‚Äôt count on your local rocket-fuel dealer to equip you with enough liquidity to steer through the crisis. This time you might be on your own.If you‚Äôre currently raising funds, try to get clarity as soon as possible. Openly address your concerns with your potential partners and get a realistic picture of whether they can and will invest or not. At first glance, most VCs state that they‚Äôre still investing the same, no matter what the situation is with coronavirus or a potential recession. History and statistics show us that most of them effectively won‚Äôt.Focus on the most common action steps to preserve and pull in liquidity in times of crisis. It won‚Äôt be easy: A lot of other companies are in the same situation as you are, so acting quickly and decisively is paramount.One critical thing to keep in mind while optimizing your cash flow: Every dollar you pull in or don‚Äôt pay out has to come from (or be withheld from) somewhere else. So please always think about who you‚Äôre dealing with. If you owe a couple thousand dollars to a big corporate enterprise, paying later probably doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference to them. But if you owe it to a freelance subcontractor whose bookings might have already imploded and who needs to support a family, that‚Äôs an entirely different story. I‚Äôve seen companies that actually fasten their payout cycles in those kinds of situations or even lengthen their collection cycles for more affected industries like restaurants. So please always keep in mind who you‚Äôre impacting on the other side of the transaction.With that being said, let‚Äôs go back to your options for optimizing your cash flow:This is never fun to do, but better to be prepared now than to feel sorry later. Look at the cost breakdown of your profit and loss statement, start with the most significant items (usually payroll or marketing), and work your way down. Ask yourself where your biggest levers lie to preserve cash and cut costs. For each of your scenarios, you should plan on which costs to cut in case revenues fall below the respective threshold of the scenario. Here are the most common things to look at:What I currently see other startup CEOs doing at the moment is freezing hiring and salary increases. A lot of companies have cut external suppliers and freelancers for noncritical projects. Some companies have started to reduce working hours and pay accordingly. Some CEOs are preparing or executing layoffs.With conversion rates dropping and sales meetings not happening, your customer-acquisition costs might soar through the roof over the next days and weeks. Also, higher customer churn and shortfall on payments can lead to lower customer lifetime values. Watch both metrics meticulously in your war room meetings. Adjust your spending according to your new reality. In some cases, increasing marketing budgets and generating more revenues might work out. More commonly, however, saving the budget will produce a longer runway.Opportunities will still be there in a couple of months. There is no need to rush unless your core business is doomed. If this is not the case, focus all your energy on stabilizing and preserving what you have built so far.Keep a close eye on CAC and CLV and make daily adjustments to your spending. If you‚Äôre currently low on cash (less than 12 months of runway in your average case), it might make sense to raise the bar on ‚Äúrequired ROI‚Äù from each ad or sales campaign to make your marketing more profitable in the short term.Depending on your local administration, there might already be measures in place to stabilize the economy. A variety of actions I‚Äôve come across in the past couple of days include 1) deferment of tax payments; 2) a reduction in working hours of employees and a partial refund of salaries by the government; 3) ‚Äúrescue funds‚Äù for specific industries (like hospitality) that provide uncomplicated loans; or 4) a loosening of bankruptcy laws and reduction of personal liabilities.The easiest way to learn about those kinds of programs is to talk to other entrepreneurs. In the past couple of days, many WhatsApp groups have formed around sharing best practices and figuring out access to those aid programs. Join the conversation, ask others for help, and share what you‚Äôve learned yourself.With all the daily challenges, this one might slip your mind, but you should communicate your plans to your investors. Include your runway and a general overview of how the coronavirus situation will most likely impact your business. If it‚Äôs really bad and you‚Äôre going to need new money fast, let them know early. If you have bad news, better deliver it quickly and in a thought-out manner.Every crisis gives birth to a thousand opportunities. The same will undoubtedly be true for this one. But before you pivot your enterprise SaaS company into producing organic face masks, hold on for a moment. Opportunities will still be there in a couple of months. There is no need to rush unless your core business is doomed. If this is not the case, focus all your energy on stabilizing and preserving what you have built so far and get yourself into a stable situation to assess new opportunities down the road.There is a German saying: ‚ÄúVorsicht ist die mutter der porzellankiste.‚Äù Literally, it translates to: ‚ÄúCarefulness is the mother of the porcelain case,‚Äù which basically means ‚ÄúBetter safe than sorry.‚ÄùYour startup in the middle of a crisis is like a box full of fragile porcelain. Prepare, act calmly and cautiously (but decisively), and handle it with care. Avoid inconsiderate hectic rushes and make sure you‚Äôre holding it tight for when disaster hits.We‚Äôre all hoping the current situation will not be as harmful as it could be to people‚Äôs health and nations‚Äô economies, but we also know that as entrepreneurs, we tend to be a tiny bit overly optimistic in times. (How could we have otherwise started our businesses in the first place?) Consider temporarily dialing that optimism down just a little bit for the next couple of weeks. Think about the mother of the porcelain box, prepare yourself, your team, and your company, and remember: Better safe than sorry.WRITTEN BY"
247,Svelte vs. React: A Comparison,https://medium.com/swlh/svelte-vs-react-a-comparison-4ddf3448e4a4?source=extreme_main_feed---------250-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"The fruit bowl of frontend frameworks is full and React is the fat melon taking up all the space. Do we really need another technology to learn? Rich Harris of the New York Times says yes, and SvelteJS is his offering.As an engineer, it‚Äôs important to explore different technologies. It‚Äôs important to identify the tools available to tackle problems. And it‚Äôs important to expand your horizons because then you can look cool on your CV.I won‚Äôt be coy. I think Svelte is incredible. But I also love React, and it‚Äôs what I use every day at work. It‚Äôs what most people use. Svelte has some definite advantages, but does it have a chance of changing that reality? The only way to find out is to view them side by side and decide for yourself.Both React and Svelte boast tools for generating skeleton projects. Create React App is one of the most widely used. Its usage looks something like this.npx create-react-app my-react-appThis command creates a project and installs dependencies. When I ran it on my machine, it took around 3 minutes. This isn‚Äôt too bad, and the CRA generator even warns about it beforehand.The generator did install a whopping 1566 packages, and it doesn‚Äôt even stop there. There‚Äôs some more processing afterward. I don‚Äôt know why it needs that many, but maybe they‚Äôre all being used.In comparison, the Svelte generator can be run like this:This executes in about 2 seconds.An obvious improvement, but it doesn‚Äôt install dependencies. Doing that takes a further 8 seconds.Svelte is clearly faster, but how much does project generation speed matter? Only a one-time gig, and in the end, it‚Äôs about what you get. So let‚Äôs look at the frameworks in a bit more detail.The following is a Shopping Cart component written in React. Here are the important points.Here is the same component in Svelte.With their current formatting, mediated by the Prettier plugin, the Svelte component sits at 25 lines of code compared to React‚Äôs 34. This seems like a win for Svelte, but the trade-off is some weird syntax like the if and the each. Prop declarations are also strange, as you have to write export let <prop-name>; to define what data the component expects.But it‚Äôs impossible to argue with the value binding. You don‚Äôt have to worry about defining the value property and an onChange event for an input box in Svelte, bind:value does it all. You can still access the event object if you need to.State management is also easier. Instead of importing hooks and using setters, you just define a property within the script tags. You then change the value by re-assigning it (not mutating the original value).All considered, Svelte‚Äôs approach seems simpler. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean better. And the syntax is weird. So let‚Äôs move on to another important aspect: bundle size.The vast majority of modern web traffic comes from mobile phones, so the bundle size is more important than ever. Especially if you want to have access to areas with poor internet connections.The CRA build output looked like this.Svelte‚Äôs was this.Clearly, Svelte is generating much less. But CRA is using code-splitting anyway, so perhaps it doesn‚Äôt matter.So, React or Svelte? The answer is probably both. Svelte is a cool framework that requires a bit less work and spits out super-optimized javascript. But it is new. And new means that anything can happen.Conversely, React is well-established and well-supported. There is a whole team working every day to improve the experience, a million tutorials and it seems like every business this side of the Milky Way is using it.In my opinion, Svelte is the clear king, but the truth is that React is just more reliable. For now. Svelte is great for prototyping or working on small personal projects, but it might be worth waiting for a while before throwing all your eggs into that basket.If you want to learn more about Svelte, you should check out Rich Harris‚Äô talk, ‚ÄòRethinking Reactivity‚Äô. Then, Academind has a great introductory tutorial over here. And finally, I will shamelessly plug my own work, ‚ÄòIntroduction to SvelteJS‚Äô.WRITTEN BY"

I was thinking about all the chaos of the last two weeks. What was the message in all of it? There had to be some good.Then, like a freaking spiritual awakening, my mind said something interesting: The world works in mysterious ways ‚Äî mostly, in your favour.It was one of those once in a lifetime insights and obviously, I didn‚Äôt invent the saying. (Whoever said this, thank you.)What brought about this thought was an email a few minutes earlier. It was the blessing in disguise I needed to end the war against my writing career. I never thought the words in that email would exist. I‚Äôd been through hell and back, and now I was parked in the driveway having had everything work out.The world works in mysterious ways and when you understand that it works in your favour, you see your life differently.Chaos becomes ‚Äòthe process‚Äô and the reward is unknown and bittersweet when you receive it. Here is how the world works in your favour.The world throws problems at your life and you don‚Äôt get any warning.These problems look like giant pains in the ass when they bleed their way into your life through the actions of other people and circumstances that appear outside of your control.You‚Äôre shielded, though. Problems help to test you. When you‚Äôre tested by problems, you discover what serves you and what doesn‚Äôt.A problem can take away something you love and only without that piece of you gone do you realize whether you need it, or if it even matters.A piece of me went missing in the last few weeks, and I realized it wasn‚Äôt that important after all. I could live without it and find other ways to live rather than exist.The world is not throwing problems at you; it‚Äôs working in your favour and reminding you of what doesn‚Äôt serve you.What is mysterious about the world is the problems you find yourself dealing with. They are never the problems you‚Äôd select from the Oyster Bar Menu of your favourite seafood restaurant.Nobody comes to your table and says, ‚ÄúWhich item would you like to take from the seafood platter of life‚Äôs problem sir/madam?‚ÄùYou don‚Äôt pick your problems. Problems pick you, and this works in your favour. The problems you encounter teach you lessons. If you had zero problems, you‚Äôd have no lessons.I‚Äôm pretty sure the only people who don‚Äôt have problems are those who are dead. Unless there are problems in heaven ‚Äî then, well, they‚Äôre probably screwed aren‚Äôt they?It‚Äôs mysterious how problems can be some of the biggest highlights of your life when you look back.The style of the problem is not what‚Äôs memorable. It‚Äôs how you dealt with it which creates a lasting impact.If you think I‚Äôm full of crap when it comes to the world working in your favour, think about what you‚Äôre saying.You decide what every problem, situation, and decision means and if you think your life is unfair, perhaps it is your perspective, not the world that is causing you to believe that.All of the pain and suffering has value and it might take months or years for you to realize that value and bank it for yourself.Don‚Äôt give up hope in seeing the world as working in your favor ‚Äî because it is. And you will see for yourself like I have seen today.WRITTEN BY"
249,"Why Pigeons, Not Parrots, Are The Ideal Avian Companion",https://medium.com/@patrickuklinski/why-pigeons-not-parrots-are-the-ideal-avian-companion-d3d668df99f8?source=extreme_main_feed---------252-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"(Source: WriaHasan / Pixabay)As a society, we don‚Äôt appreciate pigeons much. They‚Äôre known for being dirty, annoying, and covering everything from sidewalks to national monuments with their feces. Pigeons haven‚Äôt had a great public image‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto most, they are dumb and disease ridden birds. But in reality, this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. References to domestic pigeons are found both in Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets. Pigeons have been bred for thousands of years to work at our sides‚Ää‚Äî many giving their lives to aid us as messengers of war. And yet, they are far from most people‚Äôs preferred avian pet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa parrot of various species, despite how little captivity suits them.I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm a little biased. I‚Äôve worked with both species‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand while I love parrots wholeheartedly and hope to share my home with them again in the future, they are far from an appropriate pet for everyone. I hope that when I open my home to a bird again‚Ää,‚Ääit‚Äôs a pigeon‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause God, it would just be so much easier. Parrots are extremely emotionally intense animals who truly crave near-constant attention; which is, of course, pretty much impossible for the majority of parrot owners. Pigeons are also dependent flock animals (and should almost always be kept as a pair or group, not alone), but are not prone to destructive behaviors when unattended for long periods of time (and by parrot standards, this is an average workday), such as tearing out feathers obsessively or constant distress calls. Parrots have complex dietary needs, and require fresh fruits and veggies daily, along with a high quality pellet diet; in cases of macaws, particularly hyacinths, they need expensive nuts to supplement that base diet. Pigeons need healthy diets too, but are capable of eating far more seeds and pellets (much cheaper than fruits and veggies) than a parrot. Your pigeon‚Äôs vocalizations aren‚Äôt exactly quiet, but are unlikely to get you evicted from your apartment the way a bored sun conure‚Äôs screeches will.But why are things this way? To make a long story short, pigeons are domesticated‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääparrots are not. Captive and domesticated are two very different things. And while you can have a pet parrot, it has not gone through the process of ‚Äòtaming‚Äô in the same way a dog, cat, or pigeon has. Domestication syndrome is one way we can see this clearly displayed. Domesticated animals typically display vast physical and mental changes from their undomesticated counterparts‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere‚Äôs no mistaking a fantail pigeon for your typical street bird.(Source: Couleur / Pixabay)These changes include craniofacial morphology (seen in many odd-looking pigeon breeds), changes in both total brain size and brain regions, color and shape changes, and overall more docile temperament. The one parrot we may be able to truly consider domestic is the English budgie, showing the typical altered skull shape of domesticated animals, an accentuated chest shape, and a significantly more docile, subdued demeanor (along with shorter lifespans). Some parrot species come with color mutations; however, they do not express the other physical and mental alterations found in domesticated species. Pigeons, however, are arguably as domesticated from wild rock doves as a Chihuahua is from a wolf.(Source: charlemagne / Pixabay)But what‚Äôs so great about having pigeons as pets? For starters, they are nothing at all like their public image. Pigeons are actually very clean birds‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädisease is mainly spread through the feces of wild birds (even then, typically with severe buildup), which isn‚Äôt a problem with a regularly cleaned home for your pigeon. Most diseases pigeons contract are not zoonotic, meaning they cannot be passed on to humans. Furthermore, they are very good about preening themselves and flockmates to remove dirt, and may enjoy a good bath if presented with a shallow dish of water or a gentle misting from a spray bottle. They are also far, far more intelligent than they are given credit for. Pigeons have an amazing ability to recognize faces, patterns, and words. They‚Äôre excellent at categorizing objects‚Ää‚Äî one group of study pigeons was trained to (very successfully) distinguish between paintings by Picasso and Monet. Pigeons can pass the ‚Äòmirror test‚Äô‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin which a small sticker is placed on the bird, and upon seeing its reflection, the bird promptly removes the sticker, showing that it recognized the mirror image as itself. That‚Äôs something that few non-primate animals can do‚Ää‚Äî dogs, even breeds known for their intelligence such as Poodles and Border Collies, do not pass the mirror test. In summary‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey‚Äôre far from stupid.(Source: Life-Of-Pix / Pixabay)Pigeons are also loyal, loving companions who can express affection just as well as any other pet. Those who have been raised properly are quick to bond with knowledgeable owners. Pigeons often enjoy being taken out of their enclosure and being held and petted, or riding on a favorite human‚Äôs shoulder or head. While they can‚Äôt be taught ‚Äòsit‚Äô or ‚Äòlay down‚Äô like a puppy, your pigeon can still learn impressive tricks. It‚Äôs common for pigeons to learn to come when called‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially given that they‚Äôve been bred for centuries to return to their homes after flying for miles. Pigeons can also be potty-trained, either to hold it until you place them at a desired location, or to fly back to an area to relieve themselves. It‚Äôs fairly common for tricks such as flying through hoops or flapping their wings on command to be taught by dedicated owners with a little extra time. They can‚Äôt learn to talk like parrots, as they simply don‚Äôt have the ability; but they can learn to understand what your words mean.It‚Äôs not that parrots don‚Äôt deserve loving homes or great care. It‚Äôs that really, we should have never brought them into our homes in the first place. Most of us will never be able to provide even close to what a parrot would need in our homes.

250,I Promise I‚Äôm Paying Attention‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI Just Have Resting Bored Face,https://forge.medium.com/i-promise-im-paying-attention-i-just-have-resting-bored-face-358e0ecb4ac6?source=extreme_main_feed---------253-74--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"No really, I promise. I‚Äôm listening.I know I look like I‚Äôm staring into middle distance, actively disassociating from your every word. And, okay, it probably looks uncannily as though I just rolled my eyes at you. Slowly. With a degree of awe-inspiring corneal articulation.It isn‚Äôt what it seems.By now, most of us are familiar with the concept of ‚ÄúResting Bitch Face‚Äù ‚Äî what the writer Corinne Purtill describes, in Forge, as ‚Äúa catchall term for the unsmiling expression some people wear when they‚Äôre not thinking about communicating with their face.‚Äù It‚Äôs also, as Purtill points out, an idea that‚Äôs inherently sexist: ‚ÄúThat it includes the gendered expletive ‚Äòbitch‚Äô tells us whose faces we‚Äôre policing this way,‚Äù she writes. These days, with our face-to-face interactions largely modulated through the imperfect technologies of laptop and phone cameras and our devices‚Äô two-dimensional screens, another, similarly gendered phenomenon is primed to edge its way into our awareness: ‚ÄúResting Bored Face.‚ÄùResting Bored Face is exactly what it sounds like: a facial expression that beholders register as boredom. It‚Äôs contextual, too ‚Äî if you‚Äôre noticing it, it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôre expecting the face-maker‚Äôs attention.Unlike the other RBF, this occurrence hasn‚Äôt made its way into the annals of Urban Dictionary just yet, but the concept may be familiar to some who spend far too much time in certain corners of the social web. You know it if you‚Äôve seen it. And, whether a lifelong affliction or circumstantially ascribed, you likely know it if you have one.On Twitter, for example, the term appears intermittently ‚Äî usually in the form of a tweeter‚Äôs wry self-diagnosis, but occasionally as an observation of another person‚Äôs presumed facial predicament. In more than one instance, Resting Bored Face is attributed to the pop star Dua Lipa. Country singer Kacey Musgraves has also been put forward as a potential sufferer. And in a 2019 post on Reddit‚Äôs asktrp ‚Äî as in, Ask The Red Pill ‚Äî forum, a user asks his fellow misogynist conspiracy enthusiasts whether ‚Äúthis face of perpetual un-excitement and boredom‚Äù is intended as a kind of ‚Äúfemale sexual strategy.‚ÄùLet‚Äôs unpack this, shall we?A whole constellation of individual behaviors and adjacent interpersonal dynamics can be summed up by a single, basic fact: Women, and other individuals belonging to one or more marginalized identity groups, are subject to greater physical scrutiny than our white male counterparts. What‚Äôs more, we‚Äôre expected to perform pleasantness. It‚Äôs the same dynamic that undergirds the ‚Äúsmile, honey‚Äù trope, which has become a de facto shorthand for the kind of casual sexism that becomes normalized in a patriarchal society.While most of us have presumably, by now, have gotten the memo about why and how it‚Äôs rude to ask any woman to smile, we may still be subconsciously beholden to certain parallel, deep-seated cultural biases. These biases can inform where ‚Äî or, more precisely, to whom ‚Äî we direct our attention, and how we interpret what we perceive. In the context of perceived racial and cultural difference, sociologists refer to this phenomenon as ‚Äúhypervisibility,‚Äù but the concept can be broadened to apply to any individuals who don‚Äôt fit the ‚Äúnormative‚Äù physicality of power-holders in their milieu. It is, as the USC scholars Katheryn Wright and Kristin Novotny aptly describe it, the difference between ‚Äúbeing seen and being watched.‚ÄùAt the same time, a majority of us are presently struggling to adapt to a whole new way of living, a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù that‚Äôs set to continue for a yet-undetermined period of time. Our emotional resilience is low, and so may be our individual abilities to ape the mannerisms of rapt enthusiasm on a Zoom screen as we work and socialize via videoconference, from homes we‚Äôre discouraged from leaving. The conditions are ripe for Resting Bored Face to become an interpersonal liability.For both the observer and the observed, Resting Bored Face presents a test of empathy and perspective. We‚Äôre all a little distracted and preoccupied and, for many of us, present circumstances may very well be getting in the way of garden-variety ‚Äúemoting.‚Äù And, as we buckle down in our collective mission to get through this difficult time with psychological faculties intact, others of us may be less inclined to check ourselves (before we wreck ourselves) and nip subconscious preconceptions in the bud.Interrogate, then communicate. If you suspect someone‚Äôs zoning out during your virtual presentation or Happy Hour spiel, first ask yourself why you noticed that person‚Äôs emotional reaction (or lack thereof) as opposed to others‚Äô. Might you be unwittingly hypervigilant of some individuals‚Äô expressions on account of subconscious biases? Try not to be too hard on yourself, but do be honest in your self-scrutiny.After you‚Äôve interrogated your own perspective and motivations, you might conclude that it‚Äôs worth opening a discussion with the other person about how they‚Äôre doing. You can mention that you noticed the other person looked less engaged in recent conversations than usual, and you can ask them how they‚Äôre feeling. It‚Äôs important not to accuse, but rather, to listen. The objective here is to identify the issue and arrive at a mutually agreeable solution.And fellow RBF sufferers, don‚Äôt be ashamed to admit your condition! ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt rolling my eyes; that‚Äôs just me trying to soothe my seasonal allergy eyeball itch without touching my face,‚Äù you might say. Or, ‚ÄúWhat looked like slack-jawed disassociation was just good old-fashioned mouth-breathing; I‚Äôm congested from the morning‚Äôs crying jag.‚ÄùFeelings can seem like a minefield, but they‚Äôre unavoidable territory within human coexistence. What better gift than to learn to confront them, while unlearning biases to boot?WRITTEN BY"

And it‚Äôs been awesome for years.The only thing we fight about is whether we‚Äôve actually been in a fight before.No, we aren‚Äôt perfect. We‚Äôve had our moments. But as a whole? We are an unusually happy couple.I‚Äôve also been in messy, ugly relationships too. I get it. I know the pain. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing.We are very deliberate about how we operate. My goal is to share what‚Äôs working really well for us, in hopes that it can be applied in your own life.When I have to tell my girlfriend something I know she won‚Äôt like, I rarely sit and delay telling her. I know we can talk.You shouldn‚Äôt be in constant fear that your partner is going to flip out on you for telling the truth.Reaction anxiety impairs good communication.I‚Äôve been in a relationship where I couldn‚Äôt address the smallest issues without my partner blowing up on me. She‚Äôd immediately get angry and throw a huge fit. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt approach her. It got to the point where I had to start sweeping everything under the rug.Too often, people in similar circumstances, find out about problems when it‚Äôs too late.They ask their partner, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say anything?‚ÄùWith regret, they say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel like I could tell you.‚ÄùIs that ever what you want to hear from your partner? That they have to hide things from you?We are all deserving of truthful and honest relationships. But you can‚Äôt expect the truth if you aren‚Äôt a willing recipient of the truth.Being highly reactive poisons good communication.If you saw us walking together, going to the beach, on a date, you‚Äôd see us chuckling ‚Äî often.We look like two best friends hanging out, joking around, smiling, laughing, poking fun at each other.I can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of keeping a youthful spirit going in your relationship. Reserve a fun space for your partner that shields out the intensity of the outside world. Enjoy each other, against the chaos.Remember‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätease each other with kindness. Some people botch this and get too mean spirited. The goal should be to surprise them with your humor. Nothing beats catching a loved one off guard and seeing them burst out into laughter. I live for it.Have fun. Embrace the finite nature of life. Your time together should feel like therapy from the outside world‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot the opposite.A couple that laughs often will remain a couple for a long, long time.Early on, drew a line in the sand: no tit-for-tat, no gotchya‚Äôs, no points, no bringing up the past to validate our actions.We are firm believers in equity and reciprocity. Those things are necessary for any healthy relationship. However, strict adherence equity will render a relationship stiff and unmanageable.Keep a loose honor system.Help each other out. Do favors for each other. Pay for dinner without pulling out your calculator.Scorekeeping can turn teammates into bitter rivals.Personal example: My ex and I could never start on clean footing. It always felt like we had Hurricane Yesterday hovering over us. We couldn‚Äôt have peacefully agreed on which way was up or down if we had to.We tracked each other‚Äôs behavior like poker chips. Every touchpoint of our relationship grew thorns. We got snagged at every corner. And that is why we didn‚Äôt last.Don‚Äôt keep score. Be cool with each other.If lobster were your favorite food and you ate it for every meal, every day ‚Äî it wouldn‚Äôt be your favorite for long.Well, bad example. Lobster is amazing. But you catch my drift. This same concept applies to relationships.You shouldn‚Äôt be all up in each other‚Äôs space 24‚Äì7. Give each other some elbow room.Proximity enables contempt.Laura and I have busy lives that includes us having separate friends and hobbies. We don‚Äôt get jealous or territorial. We don‚Äôt take roll on who the other person is with.We break.We go out into the world. Then we reconvene and report on how things went. It keep things fresh and reduces tension.Hollywood‚Äôs vision of inseparable love performs poorly in real life. Operationalizing too much idealism leads to bickering, disappointment, and you praying for a weekend alone.Live your own lives. Be responsible about it. And you‚Äôll both be a lot happier.Missing each other isn‚Äôt always a bad thing. But it‚Äôs hard to miss someone if all you do is see them.My friend recently got out of a terrible relationship. He‚Äôs now been in three consecutive bad relationships.I had to be honest with him, I said, ‚ÄúYou really need to start thinking about what it is you actually want in your next relationship. It seems like you are flying blind right now.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a common problem: people letting their feelings be the sole deciding factor, rather than including some sort of requirements in their decisions.And, often, the people that do have requirements, aren‚Äôt disciplined about them.They might say, ‚ÄúI need someone who is driven.‚ÄùAnd proceed to date a long list of lazy people with no goals or grit. These people are literally the generic versions of their previous partner.It‚Äôs maddening.Finding a good partner requires you to enforce a criteria during your search. Exercise discipline. Apply your logic. Don‚Äôt just conjure it.For example:My girlfriend is quite beautiful.However.When I started dating again, I made a vow that this wasn‚Äôt going to be a ‚ÄúWho is the hottest?‚Äù contest. I‚Äôd played that dumb game before. It doesn‚Äôt end well.I chose three things that I wanted in a woman:I placed a premium on those three things. And I was willing to absorb a bunch of other faults just to get them.By being deliberate, and forcing myself to say no when I wanted to say yes, I eventually met the right woman. I got Laura. And there weren‚Äôt many faults coming with the things I wanted.If you are willing to wait for yes, you are ready to be happy.And so, good fellow, I turn to you:Do you actually know what it is you want? If not, please consider it.And after you consider it ‚Äî enforce it.One: your communication should be anchored in trust. Your partner should feel safe speaking the truth. Temper your reactions.Two: laugh as much as possible. Keep a playful spirit going. The more you both laugh, the better the relationship will be.Three: don‚Äôt keep scorecards. Be teammates ‚Äî not rivals. Approach your problems as us vs the problem, not us vs us.Four: practice mutual independence. Don‚Äôt be on top of each other. Give each other room to breathe. Be responsible about it.Five: Have standards and hold yourself to them. Exercise romantic discipline. Get in it for the right reasons.WRITTEN BY"

If the one particular person isn‚Äôt interested in you because of how you look or how you are in bed, remember that‚Äôs about them and their desires, not about you. Another person may want you because of the very thing this person doesn‚Äôt care for. Recognize that nothing is personal. Assure yourself that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you.Listen to everyone‚Äôs opinions of you, remembering they‚Äôre 90 percent about themselves. However, there may be some kernel of truth to what their saying. Hear their words, whatever they may be, and decide for yourself what you think about them.If you‚Äôre not sure where the relationship is heading, or what the other person‚Äôs intentions are, be direct.‚ÄúI really like you and would like to see more of you. I hope you feel the same way.‚Äù Done.Allow yourself to take risks. Do and say things you normally wouldn‚Äôt. Use this as an opportunity to find out how you want to be in a relationship.Getting mixed signals?‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling confused because it seemed like you felt this way, but your actions seemed to convey something different. Can you tell me how you are feeling about me?‚ÄùIf, after some dialogue, they won‚Äôt be direct, then they are not the person for you.When dating isn‚Äôt going well, it‚Äôs tempting and common to see things in black and white.That is a dead-end road.Everyone has their own way of communicating and their own level of awareness, as you‚Äôll discover when you date different people.If a particular dating situation isn‚Äôt working out for you, move on to the next person without labeling this one ‚Äúbad‚Äù because they aren‚Äôt right for you.Many of my clients struggle to find people to date because they‚Äôre not involved in their community.These are the venues where active, confident people who share your values and interests spend their time.You‚Äôll date lots of interesting characters before you meet the right one. Let yourself have fun ‚Äî and learn a lot.Each person you date will teach you something different and expose you to new things in my life for which you‚Äôll always be grateful.Observe yourself and reflect on what went well and what didn‚Äôt.Don‚Äôt wait to be approached ‚Äî either online or in person. How else will you ever know whether the encounter might turn into anything?If the conversation doesn‚Äôt go well, keep asking questions to break the ice. People like to talk about themselves.But beware. Some people like to talk exclusively about themselves. If the conversation doesn‚Äôt eventually move back to you, consider this a red flag. For many people, everything you say about yourself becomes a prompt for something about themselves.I‚Äôve counseled lots of men who‚Äôve found friends, dating partners and long-term relationships that way. But don‚Äôt forget about the catfish.Once I dated a guy who drew stares wherever we went. At first I thought I was imagining it, and I asked if he noticed it, too.He initially denied it, then later confirmed but he wouldn‚Äôt say why.Was he on a wanted list?In the news for some scandal?Only later did I learn he was the mayor of the city we were in.Because he had lied about his job, I cut short our dating, but I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing at the lengths he went to not to tell me.If you take it all to seriously, you will burn out before you make it to your end goal ‚Äî true love.‚ÄîThis story was previously published on The Good Men Project.WRITTEN BY"
254,How Big Technical Changes Happen at Slack,https://slack.engineering/how-big-technical-changes-happen-at-slack-f1569d25ee7b?source=extreme_main_feed---------257-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--9,"Keith Adams and Johnny RodgersMost new things in technology turn out to be fads: patterns of talking and doing that come and go without leaving a permanent mark. Microkernels; EPIC architectures like IA-64; object request brokers; and 1990s‚Äô-style neural nets are gone, and will not return. Sorry for the deep throwbacks; only time proves which things are fads, so for uncontroversial examples we have to reach pretty far back.While it is hard to imagine today ‚Äî at their height ‚Äî all of these defunct technologies were wildly popular, with charismatic, sincere, and smart advocates. They were supported by plausible first-principles arguments that showed why their chosen tech would inevitably triumph. The fads spawned movements, manifestos, conferences, and companies. To be clear, these fads are not to be confused with deliberate frauds, which are much more rare. The motivations behind these technologies were heartfelt. Things just turned out differently, despite all available appearances at the time.On the other hand, a crucial few new techniques are revolutions: potent, enduring changes that confer long-term advantages to their adopters. Object-oriented programming, hardware virtualization, the world wide web, public cloud, CI/CD, and 2010s-style neural nets (reborn as deep learning) are now permanent parts of the world of computing that were once indistinguishable from fads. We are, already, surrounded by concrete technical successes that we did not know how to achieve before these things came along.Like all technology companies, Slack wants to make sure we catch revolutions at the right time, while limiting the energy we spend chasing fads. What strategy can we follow to ensure this? This post outlines our approach to this problem, which we continue to refine and apply through our practice at Slack.We can‚Äôt rely on individual leaders‚Äô intuitions to pick winners; both precision and recall will be too low. Instead we strive to actively invest in exploring new things, knowing that most of these investments will return nothing. To bias our investment towards useful new things and away from fads, we are ruthless in killing experiments early that do not prove valuable. We hope to try a little bit of everything, accepting that this means dabbling with a lot of fads; and we hope to end up riding some waves all the way to shore because our experiences with them keep providing positive returns.This is enough philosophy to build a minimal, descriptive model of our adoption of new technology.This curve is a typical sigmoid describing technology adoption over time. The S shape comes from changes in the rate of adoption. At first, when only a few experimenters are playing around, we have no choice but to adopt it slowly; later on, as it becomes clear what the benefits are, more hands pitch in to capture those benefits, and we quickly adopt the new technology into production use cases during the steeply upward-sloping section in the middle. As the majority of fruitful use cases get eaten up, fewer cases are left, and the ones that remain are the tough ones, so adoption slows down again towards the end of the cycle.Let‚Äôs demarcate these three phases:We‚Äôre not the first to observe that technology adoption follows this sigmoid pattern. Everett Rogers proposed this model in his ‚Äúdiffusion of innovation‚Äù theory in 1962. Rogers wasn‚Äôt describing Erlang or MongoDB; he was a rural sociologist observing patterns in the adoption of farming techniques. It turns out computing practice is not so different from other fields of human activity.To ground this abstract view in something more concrete, let‚Äôs consider some of the technologies that have traversed the phases of Exploration, Expansion, and Migration at Slack.The React library has swept frontend development since its first stable release in 2015. Its utilization of the virtual DOM for rendering elements and its approach to unidirectional data flow made it a compelling technology for Slack‚Äôs desktop UI.Server-side, we‚Äôve been migrating from PHP to Hack since 2016. A key part of that migration has been a gradual introduction of types to our PHP code:Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL that we have turned to as we evolve our data sharding strategy.In contrast to these technologies that have graduated through the phases of adoption, our cross-platform C++ client library did not move beyond Phase 2, and was eventually discontinued.In the end, the runway to a full migration never appeared. We took what we learned from the LibSlack effort and applied it to our mobile and desktop clients in various valuable ways. The code artifact did not achieve enduring adoption but the project informed how we build our clients and organize our engineering teams.Note that these phases are a descriptive model, not prescriptive. We‚Äôre not forcing adoption to follow this sigmoid curve; it just naturally must, no matter how we wish things were. There is no way for early exploration to proceed as quickly as midlife adoption, and there is no way for the final push to get to full adoption to go as quickly as the middle phase went. The three phases are not consequences of any milestones, processes, tools, or people at Slack. They are part of the fabric of technical change, and they would be there whether we noticed them or not.But now we‚Äôve noticed them, and we can use them to make our efforts more successful. The tactics and strategy for each phase are different.Phase 1 is frictionless to enter. When an engineer first starts messing around with a technology they‚Äôre excited about, no permission-granting process or ceremony is needed. It probably happens dozens of times a day at Slack: someone reads about or invents something new, and commences fiddling around with it. Perhaps they have read a blog post about Elixir, or Cassandra, or WebAssembly, or TCR. They download some software, build it, poke around a little, work through some introductory material, and maybe take a stab at applying it to their day job.Most exploration efforts sputter out here. This is good! Giving up here is one of the important ways we resist spending too much energy on fads. However, some things do make it out into our real workflows and codebases. Sometimes, an engineer can just apply this solution in place, because it solves a problem local to their team‚Äôs work. Sometimes, though, the situation is even more exciting: this new widget is useful for an entire class of problems that other teams face. Our intrepid engineer now believes they know something consequential that the rest of us in Slack Engineering do not: that there is a better way for us to do things. Once work starts to affect others‚Äô work, you‚Äôve entered Phase 2.Let‚Äôs take a moment to pity the poor engineer entering Phase 2! For they are now trying to modify other engineers‚Äô behavior. This is going to involve communication, persuasion, and ‚Äî if it is going at all right ‚Äî substantial technical work. For most projects, Phase 2 is the most difficult, time-consuming, and discouraging phase. It is the ‚Äúproduct-market fit‚Äù phase of the technology cycle, and many of the projects that enter it will not successfully complete it.At Slack, client teams are free to choose not to depend on your system, with few exceptions. This may surprise you if you have a lot of experience at an ‚Äúinfrastructure-driven‚Äù engineering company. At some companies, leaders pick winners and losers before the product-market fit negotiation at Phase 2 has reached its conclusion. The goal of having a winner selected before it has been widely deployed is to provide clarity (‚ÄúWhat does the future hold? Which system should I build on?‚Äù) and to economize on the expensive period in Phase 2 where more than one way of doing things needs to be supported.While those are reasonable goals, it is not how Slack chooses to approach the adoption of new systems. We prioritize fad-resilience over speed of adoption. And so, we (intentionally) place the burden of getting other teams to adopt new technology mostly on the change agent. While this can be frustrating for the advocate of a new system, we know of no better substitute. Clearing this hurdle forces selection of Stuff that Works. If the new thing really is as wonderful as we hope it is, it should help the teams that depend on it get things done; this success can move them to adopt it and advocate it.Some of the work of Phase 2 is fundamentally more like product work than like what-you-might-think-is-engineering. You need to do user research to figure out what problems matter. You need to communicate the value of your solution relative to previous practices, in ways your users are prepared to hear. You need to build things that close the gap between current practice and the change you‚Äôre making, to grease the skids for your busy and distracted clients.Successful execution in Phase 2 eventually leads to some self-propelled adoption, where people you did not explicitly sell on the new tech are freely choosing to use it. The end of Phase 2 is close at hand when the new system is a de facto standard, the default practice for new projects. It is unusual to accidentally achieve this kind of adoption. It‚Äôs really hard, and draws on skills that are not part of every engineer‚Äôs professional experience.The self-propelled adoption phase eventually starts to taper off. We are left with a residue of holdouts: use cases that seem especially resistant to the new way of doing things. Some systems that have been quietly working in the background are especially unmotivated to change just because they are not being actively developed. In some cases we are discovering late in the game some ways in which the previous system really worked better. Finally, there are always a few stubborn users who are overly invested in their muscle memory of the old way.While we‚Äôve been talking about ‚Äúthe‚Äù technology adoption curve, there is actually a fork in the road at Phase 3. Even very successful projects might not migrate every last use case to the new way of doing things. For instance, at Slack we have very widely adopted gRPC as an internal API technology. It is solidly in late Phase 3. However, we are unlikely to build a new version of memcached that uses gRPC; memcached‚Äôs custom protocol works well, and is well-supported in the clients we care about. The existence of exceptions like this doesn‚Äôt make gRPC adoption a failure.In other cases, the costs of having More Than One Way (cognitive burden on engineers; operational burden from running the Olde Systeme) are high enough that we will migrate everything to the new way. For such projects, we need a plan to tackle the hold-outs. Different tactics are appropriate for different obstacles. The systems that just haven‚Äôt changed in a long time might need the change agent to adopt them and start moving them into the future. If the holdouts are functionally motivated, by real capabilities the new system lacks, you may need to enhance the new system, or wrap it in code that emulates the old system‚Äôs capabilities.In the occasional case of emotional attachment to the old system, person-to-person outreach is usually a lot more effective than public, high-stakes debate. And please be gentle; your beautiful, new system will be the Old Way some day, too ‚Äî if it is successful enough to live that long.OK, that is a lot of description. What about prescriptions? What do we expect of one another as engineers and engineering leaders at Slack to smooth our progress?When in doubt, remember: you‚Äôre accountable for your team‚Äôs technical success, and your team‚Äôs technical success is‚Äìin the long run‚Äìjudged by the people using your stuff.Want to help us catch the next revolution and eliminate some fads along the way? We‚Äôre hiring.WRITTEN BY"

This was the golden age of the spa town, and the unwell flocked to mountain, desert, or seaside resorts ‚Äî often at the direction of their doctors ‚Äî in order to recuperate in the clean, salubrious air.Fresh air has since gone out of fashion as a primary form of medical treatment. But as vehicle traffic, factories, and seasonal wildfires spread pollutants across large swaths of the country and rates of asthma continue to rise, air purifiers have become a hot retail item. While research on the long-term health benefits of these devices is lacking, experts say they likely do some good ‚Äî certainly for those who suffer from lung-related health problems and probably for everyone else too.A 2011 review of the research on air filters and cleaners found that a range of these products ‚Äî from whole house HVAC filters to portable single-room air purifiers ‚Äî improved symptoms among people with asthma and allergy-related respiratory disease. ‚ÄúAirborne particulates can trigger allergies or act as irritants, and air cleaners can be effective at filtering these out,‚Äù says Dr. James Sublett, author of that review and a clinical professor of pediatric allergy and immunology at the University of Louisville School of Medicine.cience shows that airborne pollutants raise a person‚Äôs risks for a range of diseases. Exposure to ambient air pollution ‚Äî composed mostly of large and small particles of hundreds of different chemicals ‚Äî can interfere with the action of specialized T-cells, which normally help calm down the immune system and reduce inflammation. One 2010 study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that this T-cell interference was associated with higher levels of asthma among kids. The lead author of that study later said these and other pollution-induced immune system changes could also play a role in the development of allergies, cancer, heart disease, autoimmune disease, and endocrine disorders ‚Äî all of which independent research has also linked to air pollution.But it‚Äôs not just immune function and physical well-being. ‚ÄúThere are also lots of studies on air quality‚Äôs associations with mental health,‚Äù says Dr. Mary Prunicki, director of air pollution and health research at the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University. In 2019, research from the University of Cincinnati found that high levels of traffic-related air pollution corresponded with an uptick in anxiety symptoms among children. Young kids exposed to these vehicle pollutants were also at greater risk for anxiety and depression symptoms later in adolescence, the research found. Studies have also turned up correlations between air pollution and mental health disorders in middle-aged and older adults. Brain inflammation and damage caused by pollution may explain the connection, the authors of these studies write.These plug-in air purifiers have limited range, meaning they can usually only clean the air in one or two rooms at a time and only if windows and doors are closed to keep outside air from circulating in.There‚Äôs little doubt that outdoor air pollution is unhealthy. Prunicki says these pollutants inevitably migrate indoors through open doors and windows, where they contribute to the indoor toxins emitted by fireplaces and fuel-burning appliances, paints, new or degrading building materials, mold, and other sources. These too are associated with elevated risks for a range of maladies, from heart disease to cancer.Considering the many health harms associated with bad air, it makes sense that using an indoor air cleaner would help lower a person‚Äôs risks for a range of medical conditions. But Prunicki says the research in this area is sparse. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs not known because the research hasn‚Äôt been done,‚Äù she explains.She and colleagues are in the midst of a study that will assess whether air purification has an effect on lung function, blood pressure, and other health measurables among college students with healthy lungs. But these sorts of studies ‚Äî that is, ones that assess how scrubbing the air of toxins can help healthy folks ‚Äî are few and far between.Some air purifiers may also come with risks. ‚ÄúThere was a time when a lot of these indoor air purifiers used ionization to create charged particles, which would trap [air pollution],‚Äù says Rufus Edwards, an air pollution researcher and professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Irvine. ‚ÄúThe problem is that these also produce ozone, which is very bad in an indoor environment.‚Äù Breathing in ozone impairs lung function and, in the long run, increases a person‚Äôs risk for heart disease and death. While there are plenty of air purifiers that either eschew ionization or produce only trace levels of ozone, he says people still need to be cautious.Despite the hazards of some purifiers, as well as the lack of hard research on their health benefits for healthy folks, experts say they‚Äôre generally a good idea. ‚ÄúWe know without a doubt that indoor air filtration will help asthmatics with their symptoms, so they work,‚Äù Prunicki says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not aware of any downsides.‚Äùhe first and best step in scrubbing indoor air of pollutants, Edwards says, is installing a HEPA filter in a home or apartment‚Äôs heating and cooling system, if possible. HEPA stands for high efficiency particulate air, and it‚Äôs a type of filter that latches onto airborne pollutants. ‚ÄúThese can have a huge impact on reducing particulate exposure,‚Äù he says. Change this filter every three months, and buy filters that have a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating of between eight and 12. MERV refers to the filter‚Äôs ability to capture pollutant particles.When it comes to portable air purifiers ‚Äî the types that plug into a wall ‚Äî both Prunicki and Edwards recommend choosing a model certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). These models are tested for safety and minimal ozone production. Edwards further recommends selecting a model that employs a HEPA filter coupled with mechanical filtration, as opposed to a model with an electronic filter. He says mechanical filters ‚Äî which basically draw air through a filter that catches fine particles ‚Äî clean air more effectively than electronic models. (The CARB website lists these specifics, and plenty of certified models are available on Amazon and from major retail brands like Dyson and Honeywell.)Also important: These plug-in air purifiers have limited range, meaning they can usually only clean the air in one or two rooms at a time and only if windows and doors are closed to keep outside air from circulating in. Unless you‚Äôre willing to buy and pay the electricity bill for multiple units, Sublett says it‚Äôs best to install one in your bedroom at night. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where you spend about a third of your life,‚Äù he says. Just make sure the purifier is rated for the size of the room where you plan to set it up.The combination of a HEPA filter in your home‚Äôs HVAC system and an air purifier in your bedroom provides an effective and (fairly) economical safeguard against airborne pollutants in the home ‚Äî and their attendant health risks.WRITTEN BY"
257,A Descendant of Madam C.J. Walker Speaks on the ‚ÄòSelf Made‚Äô Controversy,https://zora.medium.com/a-descendant-of-madam-c-j-walker-speaks-on-the-self-made-controversy-69a6fbab98eb?source=extreme_main_feed---------260-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"hen I first learned that Netflix was turning On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker by A‚ÄôLelia Bundles into a four-part series, I was thrilled. Not only was the anticipation of an on-screen, scripted dramatization of her life exciting for entertainment purposes, but I was hopeful this visibility might take a Black woman‚Äôs iconic legacy and vault her into a historic household name for all Americans. We‚Äôre now six days into the release of Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker, and I think it‚Äôs safe to say that the limited series has grown visibility for a Black female hair mogul ‚Äî but the question is, which one?Self Made positions the fictionalized character Addie Munroe as the early confidante-turned-rival of Madam Walker‚Äôs ambitions. When they first meet, Addie is selling her own hair growth products door to door. A beat-down Sarah Walker welcomes Addie into her home, where they strike a deal: Sarah, a washer woman whose extensive work with chemical cleaning agents has caused most of her hair to fall out, will launder Addie‚Äôs clothes, and in return, receive free hair treatments. Over time, her hair grows back, and she aspires to work for Addie as a door-to-door saleswoman.When she presents this idea to Addie ‚Äî who is fair-skinned and in possession of ‚Äúgood hair‚Äù ‚Äî she is refused. Addie berates her, saying, ‚ÄúEven in your Sunday best you look like you just stepped off the plantation. These are my products, and I will not have the likes of you associated with them.‚Äù This moment serves a crucial purpose: It establishes an early and prominent villain, a person with the drive and resources to thwart our heroine‚Äôs dreams. It also roots their conflict in the elevation of white standards of beauty in the Black community ‚Äî something we are still dealing with today. Instinctively, we are compelled to root for Sarah Walker even harder. The only problem? This storyline is largely false. It was almost entirely dreamt up by the script writers for the purpose of maximizing tension, conflict, and drama.The truth is that Addie Munroe never existed. Her character is meant to represent a fictionalized version of Madam Walker‚Äôs real-life competitor, Annie Malone. While Malone and Walker were rivals in business, there‚Äôs little historical accuracy in the way Self Made portrays Malone, or her relationship to Walker. Photographs show Annie Malone to have been a dark-skinned woman who, in fact, did employ Sarah Walker as a saleswoman. There is little documentation about their falling out ‚Äî though there was one ‚Äî and nothing to suggest Malone spent much time trying to thwart her competitor‚Äôs success. Some historians have even referred to her as Walker‚Äôs mentor. But however you consider their real-life relationship, the public response denouncing Self Made‚Äôs portrayal of Malone has been swift and loud.In a piece for NBC News, Nadra Nittle writes that Self Made gives the issue of colorism ‚Äúundue attention,‚Äù noting that while Walker likely experienced discrimination because she was dark skinned, there‚Äôs no evidence that it came from her business rival, who was a similarly darker hued woman. Many pieces have also taken care to discuss Malone‚Äôs work as a philanthropist, which, much like Walker‚Äôs, is largely absent from the series. The social media response, in particular, suggests a certain miscalculation on Netflix‚Äôs part. Black women entrepreneurs face enough foes when building businesses. Many viewers don‚Äôt want to see in-fighting between rivals for the sake of narrative conflict, especially when it‚Äôs exaggerated to such a degree.A‚ÄôLelia Bundles, Madam Walker‚Äôs great-great-granddaughter, has been particularly outspoken about the myths that are perpetuated in the Netflix series.The basis of Self Made is the well-researched biography written by the subject‚Äôs great-great granddaughter, who happens to be a journalist. It‚Äôs a story about one woman beating insurmountable odds with unapologetic ambition, perseverance, leadership, and innovative thinking. For a black woman born in 1867, all of this is radical and constitutes a life of far-reaching, global impact. But in telling the story of Madam C.J. Walker, Netflix also tells the story of the very real people and lives who occupied her orbit. We learn about two of her three husbands, as well as her employee Freeman Ransom. We learn about her daughter A‚ÄôLelia Walker‚Äôs marriage, her queerness, and her role in bringing the family and their business to Harlem. All of these people are rendered with varying degrees of historical accuracy. And we learn about Annie Malone. In the effort to animate one luminary‚Äôs life, another‚Äôs life is, at best misrepresented, and at worst dishonored.A‚ÄôLelia Bundles, Madam Walker‚Äôs great-great-granddaughter, has been particularly outspoken about the myths that are perpetuated in the Netflix series, as well as the portrayal of Malone and Walker‚Äôs relationship, which she says is a little too close for comfort to the trope of Black women in conflict. ‚ÄúI find that there‚Äôs a template for stories around Black women in Hollywood. I want to shatter that template because as Black women, we owe our audience stories that, at their core, are authentic and accurate. This is probably a good opportunity to have conversations between authors and Hollywood writers and producers.‚ÄùThough Bundles‚Äô role as a consulting producer entitled her to review the script, make notes, and send feedback to the writers, that was as deep as her involvement could be in the writing. ‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶spent decades researching and writing about all of this. The show runners took some of my suggestions and ignored others.‚Äù But Bundles also recognizes the value in finally telling the story through such a massive platform. Madam C.J. Walker is a household name for many Black American families, but the same cannot be said for her place in the consciousness of white America. And to many folks, the details of her life had previously been shrouded in mystery. ‚ÄúPeople didn‚Äôt even know her name. And now people are talking about her. And now people know Annie Malone‚Äôs name, people who didn‚Äôt know her name last week. And I understand the frustration people feel because we don‚Äôt get to see ourselves very often, and when we do, we want to feel good about what we‚Äôve seen. Both of these women deserve to be remembered and to have their stories told.‚ÄùThere are many wonderful aspects of the series, from the soundtrack and the costumes, to the luminous performances of both Octavia Spencer (Madam Walker) and Carmen Ejogo (Addie Munroe). But perhaps, in future on-screen adaptations of the lives of historical figures, more care will be taken to lift up every story that deserves to be told.WRITTEN BY"
258,Relationship Burnout: 3 Signs You Shouldn‚Äôt Ignore,https://medium.com/on-the-couch/relationship-burnout-3-signs-you-shouldnt-ignore-7ea0244b490c?source=extreme_main_feed---------261-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"Y
ou‚Äôre worried about your relationship.You‚Äôre picking at each other. The gaps between fights is getting shorter; but it‚Äôs taking longer to patch things up.You seem to have lost your connection, your spark. It doesn‚Äôt feel like fun. You know your relationship needs work but you can‚Äôt find the motivation to try.You head away for a weekend together. It‚Äôs nice. But then you get home, the rush of life takes over, and you‚Äôre back where you were. Niggling, annoying each other, going head to head over the same old things.This is the point at which many couples first consider counselling. But then they abandon the idea: research shows couples wait an average of six years before taking a proactive step.The trouble is, things don‚Äôt get better in the interim. Bad habits get ingrained, resentment builds and before you know it, you‚Äôre in the burnout zone.Officially, yes. Burnout ‚Äî exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress ‚Äî is most commonly applied to work situations. But the warning signs are just as easily applied to a relationship.Most experts agree burnout shows up in three key ways. When applied to a relationship, these are the key indicators:Your relationship drains you. You know it needs attention, but you can‚Äôt find the energy or the motivation to keep trying. Even the thought of ‚Äúdate night‚Äù makes you feel exhausted.You feel disengaged from your partner and increasingly negative (or even cynical) about their behaviour, the things they say, their personal quirks ‚Äî and even your suitability as a couple. You don‚Äôt want to admit it but you‚Äôve started to wonder if there‚Äôs another (better) ‚Äúoption‚Äù out there.You go through the motions. You stop making an effort. You‚Äôd rather hang with your phone/device than your partner. The physical intimacy drops away, so does the emotional connection. You‚Äôre at a loss to know what to do. Occasionally you feel like packing up and walking away.If the warning lights are flashing, don‚Äôt panic. But don‚Äôt bury your head in the sand either.Burnout doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs over ‚Äî it just means that your relationship is calling out for some TLC ‚Äî and, possibly, you are too. So follow this four-step process before you do anything else.Check your own state of mind. Sometimes our relationship has contributed to our feeling depressed, anxious, confused or chaotic ‚Äî but it can work the other way around too. Just as commonly, our mental struggles can influence our feelings about our relationship in a negative direction.The saying that we take our distress out on those closest to us is true. So be careful: check that that real problem does not lie with your work, stress levels, family issues and other demands. It‚Äôs not fair for your relationship to take all the heat.Acknowledge your problems. Not every little thing, every time, but if you feel your difficulties have gotten serious, you need to sit down and talk with your partner ‚Äî now. Avoidance is a really dumb strategy: it will escalate negativity and ill-feeling.Be mindful of your language and gentle with your partner. Take issue with their behaviour but not their character. Don‚Äôt be mean. And, most of all, listen to them. Give them space to express their feelings. They have a view ‚Äî and things to say ‚Äî too.If you love each other on any level ‚Äî or did once, or could again ‚Äî stay in the game. Get an outside perspective. Be aware that the advice of friends and people who know you both can be skewed. A couples counsellor may be helpful if you‚Äôre up for, and can afford, it. But, before that, do this:Aim to praise, validate, thank or appreciate your partner three times a day, even if it feels weird or foreign. Focus on their strengths ‚Äî and all the things they do right. Use words, gestures and acts of kindness. It is amazing how much good feeling it can create if you let it.At the very least, it will put you in a better space for whatever lies ahead.Thanks for reading!

259,Classic iPod Hackers Say There‚Äôs No Better Way to Listen to Music,https://onezero.medium.com/classic-ipod-hackers-say-theres-no-better-way-to-listen-to-music-da754fa9ad35?source=extreme_main_feed---------262-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"anuel Mantecon, who goes by Pichi, has several boxes stacked in his bathroom filled with iPod parts. When it‚Äôs time to fix one up for a customer, he takes the boxes down, including one shaped like a sewing kit that he refers to as his ‚ÄúiPod toolbox,‚Äù and refurbishes used iPods out of his bathroom in North Carolina. He works out of his bathroom because it‚Äôs a lot of moving parts, and he tends to leave a bit of a mess. ‚ÄúI know it sounds a little crazy, but it keeps everything out of sight,‚Äù Pichi said.Pichi, 50, is currently out of the workforce due to multiple sclerosis but enjoys fixing up the classic Apple music players for people around the world, who find him through word of mouth or Reddit forums. In the last six or seven years, he estimates that he‚Äôs reconstructed hundreds of iPods.Apple may have discontinued the last of the click-wheel iPods years ago, but Pichi is part of a growing community of tinkerers giving the devices new life. It‚Äôs not just for nostalgia (though that‚Äôs part of it): iPod modders say they earnestly view the devices, with a few modern tweaks, as a superior way to listen to music. That this elite audio quality is packaged in a device that is also dear to their heart makes it even better.The more popular modifications are relatively simple: updates like adding more storage or battery life, or installing firmware that allows for customization of the user interface or downloading games outside of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. Few iPod modders are injecting the music players with wild features or stark new aesthetics.Pichi said that he‚Äôs not that technical or ‚Äúgeeky‚Äù but got into iPod modding after his own iPod Classic‚Äôs battery died. He couldn‚Äôt find anyone to replace it for an affordable cost and felt like he was getting ripped off, so he figured he could do it himself. ‚ÄúI got my iPod wide open there looking like busted spaghetti with wires poking up everywhere,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I just started messing around with it and changed the battery myself.‚Äù‚ÄúI defy you to [find me] a better music playback device.‚ÄùSoon after he figured out how to fix up his own iPod for a modest cost and found a dependable supplier for parts (a project that took two years), Pichi started restoring and selling custom iPods on eBay. A couple years ago, he used a Dremel to cut through the little metal frame inside a fifth-generation iPod Classic so that he could fit the device with a more robust battery and a new logic board. ‚ÄúYou can actually squeeze these things together like a sandwich, but you gotta cut that piece out,‚Äù he said. The iPod was for Ben Schultz, a 29-year-old copywriter in Australia who Pichi characterized as one of the ‚Äúdiehard fans [of] that Wolfson chip.‚ÄùThe Wolfson is an audio chip that converts digital data into sound. It‚Äôs not in every version of the iPod, but it is in the fifth-generation iPod Classic from 2005. Many people argue this one has the best sound quality of any iPod. Some say it‚Äôs the best of any portable music player. ‚ÄúAnyone who says vinyl is better than digital audio is sort of deluding themselves,‚Äù Schultz said. ‚ÄúI defy you to [find me] a better music playback device.‚ÄùThanks to Pichi‚Äôs work, Schultz‚Äôs modded iPod now has about 100 hours of music playback and can hold tens of thousands of songs. Without any mods, the original fifth-generation iPod Classic lasted up to 14 hours with music playback for the 30 GB model and up to 20 hours with the 80 GB model. He now uses it to play, he says, ‚Äúa lot of bootlegged live recordings, bootlegged remixes, even some official remixes, YouTube recordings, anything you think of that can be downloaded.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not just the sanctity of the sound or the lag-free listening experience that draws people to early iPods. It‚Äôs also that making modifications is, especially compared with working on modern Apple devices, fairly easy.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so simple, it‚Äôs almost inviting you to augment it,‚Äù said Ollie Devine, an 18-year-old university student studying computer science in northern England who considers himself a modder. The front face is pretty forgiving and lifts off without too much prodding, and it only has a few pieces inside. ‚ÄúNo glue, no awkward positions, no stinky design, no fuss.‚ÄùDevine also pointed out that it‚Äôs pretty easy to mess with the iPod‚Äôs operating system. Most tutorials online will direct you to Rockbox, which lets you change the device‚Äôs theme, font, and add games, among other things.Max, a 29-year-old in Riga, Latvia, got his first iPod ‚Äî a 4 GB, white, first-generation Nano ‚Äî when he was 14. He said that he got bored about two months in with the device. Around that time, he met someone from the Latvian National University at a computer convention who taught him how to hack the iPod to run new games and other programs.The original iPods had click-wheel games built-in, including Brick, Parachute, Solitaire, and Music Quiz. Soon enough, Max loaded his device with a custom firmware. ‚ÄúI was playing Doom under desks while attending classes.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs pretty wholesome stuff, and it‚Äôs emblematic of the iPod-modding community. Few people are hacking into iPods to obfuscate their data, distance themselves from exploitative corporations, or exercise greater control over their devices. They want to play an old game. Return to a better digital sound. Or just to preserve a time when your playback device didn‚Äôt also store thousands of unread work emails, a million pings from the group chat, hourly spam risk calls, and targeted ads.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so simple it‚Äôs almost inviting you to augment it.‚Äù‚ÄúI do not do it for profit. I am not an iPod repairman,‚Äù said Cruz, a 58-year-old art educator in San Antonio, Texas, who asked to only be referred to by his last name because he works in the public school system. He internally upgraded four iPod Nanos and lined them up to match the color scheme of the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band cover.‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs due to a sense of accomplishment at revitalizing old tech for use in modern times. Maybe it‚Äôs due to a sense of loss at the what-if potential of a device with as simple a concept as an iPod could have evolved into. Maybe it‚Äôs due to knowing that one can personalize, modify, and alter an iPod to one‚Äôs needs, within reason,‚Äù Cruz said. ‚ÄúI know that I enjoy the time I spend researching, repairing, and revitalizing these small wonders.‚ÄùWRITTEN BY"
260,When Science Needs Self-Correcting,https://medium.com/@jstrand_76194/when-science-needs-self-correcting-a130eacb4235?source=extreme_main_feed---------263-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--5,"Admitting scientific errors is hard. It‚Äôs also important.In 2018, I published a paper that reported the most interesting finding of my career. A year later, while trying to figure out why I couldn‚Äôt replicate the effect, I discovered a massive error in the original experiment. The central finding was the result of a software glitch and was completely untrue. I had published a paper with invalid data and false conclusions.This research was about the cognitive effort people use while listening to speech ‚Äî think of that feeling of ‚Äúsquinting your ears‚Äù while trying to understand someone in a noisy bar. The 2018 paper showed a clever way to dramatically reduce cognitive effort: present the speech with a modulating circle that got bigger when the speech got louder. Participants were faster when they could see the circle than in the control condition when they couldn‚Äôt.The data were gorgeous ‚Äî every single one of the 96 participants showed the effect. When publishing the study, my co-authors and I employed many open science practices: the analyses were pre-registered, and we publicly shared our materials, data, and code on the Open Science Framework. The paper got glowing reviews and was published in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. We replicated the effect at another university and felt very pleased with ourselves.We planned follow-up studies, started designing an app to generate the modulating circle for use in clinical settings, and I wrote and was awarded a National Institute of Health grant (my first!) to fund the work.Several months later, we ran a follow-up study to replicate and extend the effect and were quite surprised that, under very similar conditions, the finding did not replicate. The circle slowed people down. I considered everything that might be different between the studies: code, stimulus quality, computer operating system, stimulus presentation software version, etc. The difference was massive enough that I was confident it wasn‚Äôt just a fluke: you don‚Äôt go from 100% of participants showing an effect to 0% without something being systematically different.Finally, I found the issue. In the original experiment, I had unintentionally programmed the timing clock to start before the stimuli were presented in the control condition ‚Äî akin to starting a stopwatch before a runner gets to the line. This meant that the modulating circle didn‚Äôt make people faster, but rather that the timing mistake made the control condition look slower. The effect that we thought we had discovered was just a programming bug.When I identified the error, I was shocked. I felt physically ill. I had published something that was objectively, unquestionably wrong. I had celebrated this finding, presented it at conferences, published it, and gotten federal funding to keep studying it. And it was completely untrue. I was deeply embarrassed to have made such a stupid mistake, disappointed that my finding was junk, guilty for wasting everyone‚Äôs time and polluting the literature, and worried that admitting the error and retracting the paper would jeopardize my job, my grant funding, and my professional reputation.This had been my mistake, but would also have consequences for my co-authors ‚Äî a former student of mine and my post-doc mentor. The replication at another institution (that used the same flawed program) was the basis for my former student‚Äôs masters project and her defense was scheduled in two weeks. A student at another university had just proposed a thesis extending the work. My grant funding was based in part on these results. And I was currently under review for tenure.I found the mistake when I was alone at my laptop, working at home late in the evening. While I sat in the dark (crying), I briefly considered what would happen if I never told anyone. The bug was hard for me to identify; maybe no one else would ever find it. I could just go on with other research and nobody would ever know.Obviously, I decided not to go that route.The list of what I had to do was pretty devastating: call my co-authors, tell my former student to cancel her master‚Äôs defense, write to the journal editor to initiate retraction, contact the National Institute of Health program officer, alert my department chair and dean overseeing my tenure review, and tell my research students. I stayed up all night writing email drafts and, after a new flare-up of panic, checking every other program I‚Äôd ever run to see if I‚Äôd made the same mistake elsewhere (I hadn‚Äôt).The next day was the worst of my professional career. I spent all day emailing and calling to share the story of how I had screwed up. After doing that, part of me wanted to tell as few other people as possible. So why share this with an even wider audience?One reason is that I‚Äôve never heard about a comparable situation. Part of the gut punch of finding this mistake was that I had no idea what would happen to me as a result of it, particularly freshly grant-funded and pre-tenure. I‚Äôve heard of people finding mistakes early in the research process and having to re-run experiments. I knew about the scientists who have stepped up to nominate findings of their own that they have lost confidence in. I‚Äôve heard of people who have had problems in their research exposed by others. But I‚Äôd never heard of anyone who found an error in their own published paper that invalidated the conclusions. It‚Äôs been reassuring that there have been several prominent retractions recently, but when I found and reported the issue in October of 2019, those had not become public. I had no model to follow.The biggest reason I wanted to share this story is that the fallout wasn‚Äôt as bad as I expected. Everyone I talked to ‚Äî literally everyone ‚Äî said something along the lines of, ‚Äúyeah, it stinks, but it‚Äôs best that you found it yourself and you‚Äôre doing the right thing.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt lose my grant. I got tenure. The editor and publisher were understanding and ultimately opted not to retract the paper but to instead publish a revised version of the article, linked to from the original paper, with the results section updated to reflect the true (opposite) results. After spending months coming to terms with the fact that the paper would be retracted, it wasn‚Äôt.Finally, I wanted to write about my experience because even though this mistake didn‚Äôt ruin my career, the fear that it could highlights some serious issues in scientific publishing.Regardless of the nature of errors, the most common fate for papers that are wrong is ‚ÄúRETRACTED.‚Äù This can happen when authors self-correct honest mistakes or when researchers are found guilty of scientific misconduct like deliberately faking data. Given that the majority of retractions happen for pretty damning reasons, it‚Äôs hard to ask people to self-nominate for that category. I expected that revealing my error would lead to a retraction, and that was one of the things that made it difficult to disclose.Mistakes happen. We should embrace systems designed to reduce mistakes, but some will sneak through. When they do, it is in the best interests of scientific progress that they come to light. However, for individual researchers, there are many, many incentives not reveal errors.What are alternatives to outright retraction? Some journals have experimented with ‚Äúretraction with replacement‚Äù that replaces original versions of articles with updated ones. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review‚Äôs development of publishing a ‚Äúrelated article‚Äù with notices in both versions that link to one another is similar and, I think, a great step toward encouraging authors to disclose their own errors (though I‚Äôve encouraged the publisher to make the notice more prominent as it‚Äôs currently very easy to miss). Another option is implementing a distinct category like ‚Äúwithdrawn at the author‚Äôs request‚Äù or ‚Äúself-retraction‚Äù for situations in which an author initiates or cooperates with an inquiry to distinguish those situations from instances of misconduct.I‚Äôm sharing this story to help normalize admitting errors. Although this process has been difficult, the consequences were much less dire than I‚Äôd feared. Changing culture is hard, but one step toward building better science is publicly revealing our own errors and showing how we fix them.ReferencesStrand, J. F., Brown, V. A., & Barbour, D. L. (2018).

That could be either theming through higher-order components, passing themes as props (usually with the help of React.Context) or using popular libraries like styled-components.Today, thanks to ‚ÄòCSS custom properties‚Äô, a.k.a ‚ÄòCSS variables‚Äô, we shift the weight towards plain CSS. That is to say, there‚Äôs still a need for some JavaScript but as you‚Äôll see, it plays a much minor role.As a rule of thumb, the more we use CSS and the less we use JS, the better our apps‚Äô performance will be (with a few exceptions). The reasons for that go well beyond the scope of this post.Another reason would be to make your UI components as universal as possible. That means using universal technologies (JS, CSS, HTML), as oppose to library/framework-specific code (for example, ‚Äòstyled-components‚Äô or even embedding you styling in your React components).That‚Äôs important for maintenance and scale. It‚Äôs much easier to ‚Äútranslate‚Äù UI components from one technology stack to another when most of the styling is done using plain CSS. So, whether you‚Äôre migrating your codebase to another technology stack or even creating another app using different technologies, you‚Äôd find it much easier to do so when most of the styling is done using plain CSS.As an important side note, maintenance and scalability is also a function of using the right tools. I personally use Bit to share and organize all my UI components. That‚Äôs my way of, essentially, building a design system for my team without losing precious time over that. Unlike other tools and methodologies, Bit gives you the freedom to continuously push new UI components, from any codebase to your own component collection in Bit.dev. The alternative would be to work on a whole new project (a UI library project) just to document and share UI components.CSS variables (and the full support that they have in all popular browsers) are something we were all looking forwards to. They‚Äôre not only a solution to storing color palettes and standardized sizes (something we‚Äôre used to solving by pre-processors like SASS) but they actually transform CSS from being completely static to having some sort of dynamics (something that pre-processors are not able to deliver, at least not in run-time).The syntax for declaring a CSS variable is quite simple: ‚Äî- is added to the variable name. Note that variable names are case-sensitive.To use a variable, wrap the variable name with var() .In the example below I‚Äôve also set my selected values to the default theme ‚Äòlight‚Äô by using the variables to my light theme, as values.Notice how I‚Äôve defined my variables at the root level. That‚Äôs not the only way to do it. Variables can be defined under all CSS selectors and even under CSS media queries ‚Äî that, of course, would make them more specific; that‚Äôs a very useful feature that we would not explore in this post.Below, an example CSS for a Button component. Notice how I‚Äôve set the relevant properties to --selected- and not directly to a themed value. So, for example, instead of using--dark-primary-color I‚Äôm using --selected-primary-color .The function below collects all the used (--selected) CSS variables. And sets their values to the selected theme variables. Here, JS is used only to replace the values of one limited set of CSS variables, to another set of values.
(For this to work, make sure you name your CSS properties in a consistent format).The key method here is the setProperty method that lets us select a CSS variable/custom property and set a new value.That‚Äôs about it :)WRITTEN BY"
262,"The Flawed, Twisted Legacy of Jack Welch",https://marker.medium.com/the-flawed-twisted-legacy-of-jack-welch-105b36ff1521?source=extreme_main_feed---------265-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--7,"ack Welch had terrific timing. Or at least he did in one key aspect of his long tenure as the chief executive officer of General Electric: Welch, who died yesterday at age 84, took the reins in the early 1980s ‚Äî shortly before the start of the one of the great bull market runs in the history of the U.S. stock market. He retired in September 2001; his successor took over just a few days before 9/11, and right in time to absorb the dot-com meltdown.This is not to say that the G.E.‚Äôs share price rose through Welch‚Äôs tenure simply because the broader markets did (although having the wind at your back never hurts). Indeed, G.E. decisively outpaced the market in those years. So much so, in fact, that it became one of the true glamour stocks of the 1990s ‚Äî an era when the stock market became a kind of pop culture phenomenon, obsessed over on CNBC, open to wider participation through cheap online trading, hyped relentlessly by a business and finance press experiencing its own parallel boom.This is the period that kicked off the dubious practice of measuring business leadership prowess almost entirely through the prism of share prices, or valuation more generally. And that is where Welch‚Äôs timing was exquisite: It was a time that practically demanded heroes (somebody had to be on the cover over all those magazines!), and Welch was happy to oblige.Welch‚Äôs actual track record and legacy at G.E. the business (as opposed to GE, the ticker symbol) has proved rather more complicated.By the time he retired, a slew of books claiming to reveal Welch‚Äôs leadership ways and wisdom clogged the business section of Barnes & Noble, and finance pundits called him ‚Äúthe CEO of the century,‚Äù among other accolades. In the years after, he wrote his own (mega-selling) books about his business philosophy, opined in the finance media, and founded the Jack Welch Management Institute. He was famous enough to cameo as himself on 30 Rock.But Welch‚Äôs actual track record and legacy at G.E. the business (as opposed to GE, the ticker symbol) has proved rather more complicated. The company has had a rough ride, as Welch‚Äôs hand-picked successor, Jeffrey Immelt, presided over a series of external crises as well as deep-rooted business problems. Most notably: GE Capital, the consumer-finance arm celebrated during the Welch era, turned out to be ill-equipped for the 2008 financial crisis, and was largely dismantled and jettisoned. Indeed, Immelt spent a lot of his tenure walking back the conglomerate model that Welch had assembled, and that was proving too unwieldy and complex for the disruption-filled 2000s.The problems were persistent enough that even the emergence of a new bull market didn‚Äôt help. In a 2017 New York Times column on the occasion of Immelt‚Äôs pending retirement, the writer James B. Stewart noted that G.E. shares had fallen by 25% over the prior decade, ‚Äúin contrast with a 59% rise for the S.&P. 500.‚Äù While Immelt came in for some criticism from the expert observers Stewart spoke to, Welch did, too. Immelt may have been slow in backing away from G.E.‚Äôs strategy of operating a slew of unrelated businesses (so long as each was top performer in its category) ‚Äî but it was Welch who pursued that strategy so aggressively in the first place. This conglomerate approach has become ‚Äúdated,‚Äù as one finance professor put it to Stewart: ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs still used in a few old-line manufacturing businesses, but not in the rest of the economy, where a start-up can destroy your business.‚ÄùUnder Welch, G.E. stock soared because Welch was great, and the proof of that greatness was the soaring share price. Really, there was no way Immelt could repeat that trick indefinitely.Because Welch‚Äôs tenure became so synonymous with a rising share price, you might assume that the G.E. he inherited was an awful mess. Not so. G.E. had decades of strong leadership; in the classic business book Built To Last, authors James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras praise the company‚Äôs ‚Äúremarkable track record of continuity in top management excellence over the course of a hundred years.‚Äù Bloomberg columnist Joe Nocera, in his own look back at Welch‚Äôs legacy last summer, points out that Welch‚Äôs predecessor, Reg Jones, ‚Äúwas widely considered the country‚Äôs best CEO.‚ÄùBut whatever you make of the business Immelt inherited, he definitely inherited an inflated share price. Under Welch, G.E. stock soared because Welch was great, and the proof of that greatness was the soaring share price. Really, there was no way Immelt could repeat that trick indefinitely.If Welch ever felt any responsibility for the problems Immelt faced ‚Äî or doubts about whether his hero status was full deserved ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt go out of his way to show it. In fact, he was reported to have turned on Immelt in private, supposedly even telling others that choosing Immelt was ‚Äúone of the biggest mistakes‚Äù of his career, as one report put it. (Immelt is said to be working on a book that will apparently offer his take on Welch, among other subjects.)Earlier, Welch had sounded a more modest note, telling an audience that despite his apparently wild success and the adulation he enjoyed, it was too early for him to take a victory lap: ‚ÄúMy success,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwill be determined by how well my successor grows [G.E.] in the next 20 years.‚Äù But that was back in 1999, when G.E.‚Äôs stock was still on fire, and the Welch myth was taking its definitive shape. His timing, as ever, was perfect.WRITTEN BY"

He‚Äôs also obese, and drank and smoked for most of his life. But his ill health is not what‚Äôs going to kill him ‚Äî people-pleasing is.Despite his age, he still works at a local pharmacy, delivering medicines door-to-door to those who can‚Äôt collect it themselves. It‚Äôs a meaningful job, especially in these trying times, but with his profile, he‚Äôs at serious risk.I asked him yesterday ‚Äî for his sake and my mothers ‚Äîto tell the pharmacy to get someone else to do the deliveries. His response didn‚Äôt surprise me: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre over-reacting. You need to stop worrying about this thing.‚ÄùIn reality, he‚Äôs more worried than me, but the truth is this: His sense of identity is based on not letting people down. As a result, he‚Äôs terrified of saying no. He calls this old-school, and he thinks that‚Äôs an excuse. I don‚Äôt. I think it‚Äôs a death sentence, for him and my mother.Even in normal circumstances, the risks of people-pleasing can lead to serious health risks. People-pleasers rarely prioritize their own self-care. By putting others first, they spend less time relaxing, exercising, and planning healthy meals, and as a result, are more prone to health problems.But in coronavirus times, people-pleasing can literally kill you ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre one of those at serious risk.If you‚Äôre a grandparent, what are you going to do if your son or daughter asks you to mind their kids? Or maybe your partner isn't taking coronavirus seriously and thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous that your parents can‚Äôt take the children.Are you going to say yes only to keep them happy? Are you going to say yes and silently resent them because they‚Äôre putting your life at risk?Or worse yet, maybe there are others who see you as an easy target and are willing to take advantage of you. They know you can‚Äôt say no and are willing to exploit the situation because they fear for their own safety.When talking about people-pleasing, I usually give people advice on why they need to say no. But when it comes to the coronavirus, I think this much is clear, so I‚Äôll get straight to the how.Here are 7 tactics on how to say ‚Äòno‚Äô when it comes to the coronavirus.Steve Jobs once said that it‚Äôs only by saying ‚Äòno‚Äô that you can focus on what‚Äôs important in life. In this case, it‚Äôs your actual life.So if someone asks you to do something you‚Äôre not comfortable with, try the tactics above. Maybe you explain yourself, maybe you don‚Äôt, but you should be thoughtful, and most of all, don‚Äôt make it personal.Saying yes is easy, and saying no is hard, especially when talking to loved ones. So you need to think about the gravity of this situation, and when you say yes to others, even your family, make sure you are not saying no to life.I‚Äôll be chatting to my dad later today. I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôll let my brother and I do the deliveries over the coming weeks.

Maybe you wore your one pair of sneakers to go for a run and don‚Äôt want to wear them indoors. Or maybe you just want a low-fuss way to get stronger or maintain the strength you‚Äôve already built. These moves, which only require a resistance band, are for you.‚ÄúThis type of band workout is great to do anytime and anywhere, but especially now during social distancing,‚Äù says Michelle Lovitt, an exercise physiologist and strength and conditioning specialist, who designed the workout below. ‚ÄúAnd when the crisis is over, you can continue doing it, especially when you travel.‚Äù All you need is a resistance band and these instructions.(Note: You may need to experiment with how taut to hold the band for each move to make sure it‚Äôs the right level of difficulty ‚Äî if you‚Äôre able to complete the prescribed number of reps with good form but feel like your muscles are very taxed by the final few reps, you‚Äôve nailed it.)Beginner: One set of 10 reps per exercise.Intermediate: Two sets of 10‚Äì12 reps per exercise.Advanced: Three sets of 12‚Äì15 reps per exercise.Hold the band in both hands and step on it with both feet, placing them about hip-distance apart. Keeping your elbows in tight to your sides, bring your hands up to the front of your shoulders. Keeping your hands at your shoulders, squat. As you come up from the squat, drive your hands up into an overhead press.Place the band around your ankles, feet slightly wider than your hips. Tuck your tailbone to activate your glutes and protect your low back. Lower yourself into a squat position, then step to the right, maintaining a wide distance between your feet and making sure not to drag either foot. Repeat to complete your reps, then switch sides and step toward the left.Get onto your hands and knees. Wrap one end of the band around your right foot and hold the other end with your left hand. Slowly extend at the hip as you lift your right leg until your thigh is in line with your back and your calf is perpendicular to the floor, squeezing your glute hard as you lift. Lower the extended leg slowly, stopping short of the starting position. Repeat to complete your reps and then switch sides.Hold the band in both hands and step on it with both feet. Bend slightly at the waist. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, lift your arms out to the side to shoulder height while making sure to keep constant tension on the band and keep your spine in a neutral position.Center the band under both feet and bend forward at the waist, back flat and core engaged. Grab one end of the band in each hand and bend your elbows to pull your arms up to your torso, squeezing your back and keeping your shoulder blades back and down.Hold the band in both hands and step on it with both feet. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, lift your arms out to the side to shoulder height.WRITTEN BY"
265,The Untold Story of the Man That Made Mainstream Encryption Possible,https://onezero.medium.com/the-untold-story-of-the-man-that-made-mainstream-encryption-possible-231c749d5005?source=extreme_main_feed---------268-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--,"Longtime tech journalist Steven Levy‚Äôs new book, Facebook: The Inside Story, details how Mark Zuckerberg transformed a tasteless dorm room social networking experiment into the world‚Äôs biggest social networking business. In honor of that release, we thought we‚Äôd share an excerpt of an earlier Levy book, Crypto, about a man who ran in the opposite direction of Facebook‚Äôs data exploitation and privacy breaches. This is the story of Whit Diffie, who transformed how we think of encryption, paving the way for the digital security we enjoy today.ailey Whitfield Diffie, born June 5, 1944, was always an independent sort. As one early friend remarked, ‚ÄúThe kid had an alternative lifestyle at age five.‚Äù Diffie didn‚Äôt read until he was 10 years old. There was no question of disability, he simply preferred that his parents read to him, which seemingly they did, quite patiently. Finally, in the fifth grade, Diffie spontaneously worked his way through a tome called The Space Cat, and immediately progressed to the Oz books.Later that year his teacher at P.S. 178 ‚Äî ‚ÄúHer name was Mary Collins and if she is still alive I‚Äôd like to find her,‚Äù Diffie would say decades later ‚Äî spent an afternoon explaining something that would stick with him for a very long time: the basics of cryptography.Diffie found cryptography a delightfully conspiratorial means of expression. Its users collaborate to keep secrets in a world of prying eyes. A sender attempts this by transforming a private message to an altered state, a sort of mystery language: encryption. Once the message is transformed into a cacophonous babble, potential eavesdroppers are foiled. Only those in possession of the rules of transformation can restore the disorder back to the harmony of the message as it was first inscribed: decryption. Those who don‚Äôt have that knowledge and try to decrypt messages without the secret ‚Äúkeys‚Äù are practicing ‚Äúcryptanalysis.‚ÄùAlthough Diffie performed competently in school, he never did apply himself. Only stratospheric scores on standardized tests enabled him to enter the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961 to study mathematics. He took up computer programming ‚Äî at first, Diffie now says, to get out of the draft. Diffie accepted a job at the Mitre Corporation, which, as a defense contractor, could shelter its young employees from military service.Diffie‚Äôs team did not have to work at the Mitre office, but in 1966, became a resident guest of Marvin Minsky in the MIT artificial intelligence lab. At the AI lab, information was assumed to be accessible as the air itself. There were no software locks on the operating system written by the MIT wizards.Unlike his peers, however, Diffie believed that technology should offer a sense of privacy. Diffie would often engage his boss, the mathematician Roland Silver, in conversations on security. Inevitably, cryptography entered into their discussions.Silver had some knowledge in the field, and explained that there was a lot of work going on ‚Äî behind steep barriers erected and maintained by the government‚Äôs intelligence agencies. Diffie resented this. Cryptography is vital to human privacy! he railed to Silver. Maybe, he suggested, passionate researchers in the public sector should attempt to liberate the subject. ‚ÄúIf we put our minds to it,‚Äù he told Silver, ‚Äúwe could rediscover a lot of that material.‚ÄùSilver was skeptical. ‚ÄúA lot of very smart people work at the NSA,‚Äù he said, referring to the National Security Agency, the U.S. government‚Äôs citadel of cryptography. Created by President Truman‚Äôs top-secret order in the fall of 1952, the National Security Agency was a multibillion-dollar organization that operated totally in the ‚Äúblack‚Äù region of government, where only those who could prove a ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù were entitled to knowledge. In the early 1970s, none of this was discussed publicly. Within the Beltway, people in the know jokingly referred to the organizational acronym as No Such Agency.In 1969, his funding having run out, Diffie finally left Mitre. He and his girlfriend moved west, and Diffie went to work at John McCarthy‚Äôs Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, where he was led into a deeper consideration of privacy concerns. There, he was referred to an assistant professor of electrical engineering by the name of Martin Hellman.Born and raised in New York, Hellman had got his doctorate from Stanford in 1969 and his first job was at IBM research, where he took a serious interest in cryptography. After he left IBM in 1970, he accepted a post as assistant professor at MIT, where he made crypto the focus of his research, before moving to Stanford. He resisted the temptation to do what the vast majority of scientists in his field had already done: work within NSA strictures. After publishing his first paper in the field of cryptography, he had been stuck for a follow-up. Enter Whit Diffie. ‚ÄúIt was a meeting of the minds,‚Äù says Hellman. Both Diffie and Hellman firmly believed that the advent of digital communications made commercial cryptography absolutely essential. Hellman hired Diffie as a part-time researcher.In March 1975, a dry government document produced a shock wave to the Stanford duo. It was a Federal Register posting from the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) that proposed something seldom ventured in the public literature: a brand-new encryption algorithm that had come out of work IBM had done with the government, called the Data Encryption Standard, or DES.hough Whit Diffie and Marty Hellman regarded the Data Encryption Standard as a tainted and possibly fraudulent gambit by IBM and the United States government, its introduction was in a strange way an important gift to the Stanford researchers. By combing through the available technical data on the proposed standard‚Äîand speculat¬≠ing on what was not made public‚ÄîDiffie and Hellman had a new prism through which to consider their own efforts. Ever since Diffie had heard the first reports of the government standard, at a 1974 chowdown at Louie‚Äôs, the Chinese restaurant where Stanford geeks congregated, he had wondered about the possibility of an NSA trap¬≠door. This led him to a deeper consideration of the concept of trap¬≠doors. Could an entire crypto scheme be built around one?Designing such a system would present considerable challenges, because it would have to resolve a fundamental contradiction. A trap¬≠door provides a means for those with proper knowledge to bypass security measures and get quick access to encrypted messages, some¬≠thing that seems efficient. But the very thought of using a trapdoor in a security system seems like a nutty risk, precisely because crafty intruders might find a way to exploit it. It‚Äôs the same problem posed by a physical trapdoor: If your enemies can‚Äôt find it, you can use it to hide. But if they do, they‚Äôll know exactly where to look for you.This contradiction made the prospect of designing a trapdoor incredibly daunting. After all, the strongest crypto systems were finely tuned in every aspect to prevent their contents from leak¬≠ing. Tampering with their innards to insert a backdoor‚Äîa leak!¬≠‚Äîcould easily produce any number of unintended weaknesses. When Diffie explained this to Hellman, both of them concluded that such a system would probably be impractical. But Diffie still thought it was interesting enough to add to a list he was compiling entitled ‚ÄúProblems for an Ambitious Theory of Cryptography.‚ÄùOne day Diffie and Hellman brought in a Berkeley computer scien¬≠tist named Peter Blatman to attend one of the informal seminars on crypto they had been convening on campus. Afterward, Blatman mentioned that a friend of his was working on an interesting problem: How can you get a secure conversation over an insecure line when the two people in the conversation have never had previous con¬≠tact? Obviously, if the two people hadn‚Äôt known each other previously they would have had no opportunity to exchange secret keys before a private conversation.This was, in effect, a different formulation of the big question that had been bugging Diffie for years: Was it possible to use cryptography to protect a huge network against eavesdroppers, and wiretappers to boot?How could you create a system where people who had never met could speak securely? Where all conversations could be conducted with high-tech efficiency‚Äîbut be protected by cryptography? Where you could get an electronic message from someone and be sure it came from the person whose return address appeared?During his quest, Diffie had struggled to gather information in an atmosphere where almost all of it was classified. And he had wound up with more than anyone could have expected: one-way functions. Password protections. Identification Friend or Foe. Trapdoors. Some¬≠ where in all of that had to be an answer to privacy. Diffie knew that reconciling the different protections offered by these disparate systems was crucial to his quest.One afternoon, things suddenly became clear to Diffie: Devise a system that could not only provide everything in Diffie‚Äôs recently envisioned one-way authentication scheme but could also deliver encryption and decryption in a novel manner. It would solve the untrustworthy administrator problem, and much, much more.He would split the key.Diffie‚Äôs breakthrough itself involved something that, in the context of the history of cryptography, seemed an absolute heresy: a public key. Until that point, there was a set of seemingly inviolable rules when it came to encryption, a virtual dogma that one ignored at the risk of consignment to crypto hell. One of those was that the same key that scrambled a message would also be the instrument that descrambled it. This is why keys were referred to as symmetrical.That is why keeping those keys secret was so difficult: The very tools that eavesdroppers lusted after, the decryption keys, had to be passed from one person to another, and then exist in two places, dramatically increasing the chances of compromise. But Diffie, his brain infused with the informa¬≠tion so painstakingly collected and considered over the past half decade, now envisioned the possibility for a different approach. Instead of using one single secret key, you could use a key pair. The tried-and¬≠ true symmetrical key would be replaced by a dynamic duo. One would be able to do the job of scrambling a plaintext message‚Äîperforming the task in such a way that outsiders couldn‚Äôt read it‚Äîbut a secret trapdoor would be built into the message. The other portion of the key pair was like a latch that could spring open that trapdoor and let its holder read the message. And here was the beauty of the scheme: Yes, that second key‚Äîthe one that flipped open the trapdoor‚Äîwas of course something that had to be kept under wraps, safe from the pry¬≠ing hands of potential eavesdroppers. But its mate, the key that actu¬≠ally performed the encryption, didn‚Äôt have to be a secret at all. In fact, you wouldn‚Äôt want it to be a secret. You‚Äôd be happy to see it distributed far and wide.Now, the idea of ensuring privacy by using keys that were exchanged totally in the open was completely nonintuitive, and on the face of it, bizarre. But using the mathematics of one-way functions, it could work. Diffie knew it, and for an illuminating instant, he knew how to do it using one-way functions.It was the answer. From that moment, everything was different in the world of cryptography.First, by presenting an alternative to systems that worked with a single, symmetrical key, Diffie had solved a problem that had become so embedded in cryptographic systems that it had occurred to almost no one that it could be solved: the difficulty of distributing those secret keys to future recipients of secret messages. If you were a military organization, you might be able to protect the distribution centers that handled symmetrical keys (though God knows there were lapses even in the most vital operations). But if such centers moved into the private sector, and masses of people needed to use them, there would not only be inevitable bureaucratic pileups but also a constant threat of compromise. Figure it this way: If you needed to crack an encrypted message, wouldn‚Äôt the very existence of a place that stored all the secret keys present an opportunity for some creep to get the keys by theft, bribery, or some other form of coercion?But with a public key system, every person could generate a unique key pair on his or her own, a pair consisting of a public key and a private key, and no outsider would have access to the secret key parts. Then private communication could begin.Here‚Äôs how it would work: Say that Alice wants to communicate with Bob. Using Diffie‚Äôs concept, she needs only Bob‚Äôs public key. She could get this by asking him for it, or she might get it from some phone-book-type index of public keys. But it has to be Bob‚Äôs personal public key, a very long string of bits that could only have been gener¬≠ated by only one person in the world‚Ä¶ Bob. Then, by way of a one¬≠-way function, she uses that public key to scramble the message in such a way that only the private key‚Äîthe other half of that unique key pair‚Äîperforms the decrypting calculation. (Thus the secret key is the ‚Äútrapdoor‚Äù in the trapdoor one-way function Diffie was thinking about.)So when Alice sends the scrambled message off, only one person in the world has the information necessary to reverse the calculation and decipher it: Bob, the holder of the private key. Say that the scrambled message gets intercepted by someone desperate to know what Alice had to say to Bob. Who cares? Unless the snooper has access to the unique partner of Bob‚Äôs public key‚Äîthe instrument Alice used to con¬≠vert the message to seeming mush‚Äîthe snoop would get no more than that mush. Without that private key, reversing the mathematical encryption process is too damn difficult. Remember, going the wrong way in a one-way function is like trying to put together a pul¬≠verized dinner plate.Bob, of course, has no problem reading the message intended for his eyes only. He possesses the secret part of the key pair, and he can use that private key to decipher the message in a jiffy.In short, Bob is able to read the message because he is the only per¬≠son in possession of both sides of the key pair. Those who obtain the public key have no advantage in attempting to break the message. When it comes to encrypted messages, the only value of having Bob‚Äôs public key is to, in effect, change the message to Bob-speak, the language that only Bob can read (by virtue of having the secret half of the key pair).This encryption function was only part of Diffie‚Äôs revolutionary concept, and not necessarily its most important feature. Public key crypto also provided the first effective means of truly authenticating the sender of an electronic message. As Diffie conceived it, the trap¬≠door works in two directions. Yes, if a sender scrambles a message with someone‚Äôs public key, only the intended recipient can read it. But if the process is inverted‚Äîif someone scrambles some text with his or her own private key‚Äîthe resulting ciphertext can be unscrambled only by using the single public key that matches its mate. What‚Äôs the point of that? Well, if you got such a message from someone claiming to be Albert Einstein, and wondered if it was really Albert Einstein, you now had a way to prove it‚Äîa mathematical litmus test. You‚Äôd look up Einstein‚Äôs public key and apply it to the scrambled ciphertext. If the result was plaintext and not gibberish, you‚Äôd know for certain that it was Einstein‚Äôs message‚Äîbecause he holds the world‚Äôs only private key that could produce a message that his matching public key could unscramble.In other words, applying one‚Äôs secret key to a message is equivalent to signing your name: a digital signature. But unlike the sorts of sig¬≠ natures that are penned on bank checks, divorce papers, and baseballs, a digital John Hancock cannot be forged by anyone with the minimal skills required to replicate the original signer‚Äôs lines and loops. Without a secret key, the would-be identity thief has scant hope of producing a counterfeit signature.Nor could a would-be forger hope to monitor a phone line, wait until his prey‚Äôs digital signature appears, and then snatch it, with the intention of reusing the signature to create faked documents or to intercept future messages. In practice, a digital signature is not applied as an appendage to the document or letter to which it is affixed. Instead it is deeply interwoven with the digits that make up the actual content of the entire message. So if the document is intercepted, the eavesdropper cannot extract from it the tools to stamp the sender‚Äôs signature on some other document.This technique also assures the authenticity of an entire document. A foe cannot hope to change a small but crucial portion of a digitally signed document (like switching the statement ‚ÄúI am not responsible for my spouse‚Äôs debts‚Äù to ‚ÄúI take full responsibility for my spouse‚Äôs debts,‚Äù all the while maintaining the signature of the unwitting sender). If the message was digitally signed with a private key but unencrypted, such a rogue could intercept it, use the sender‚Äôs well-distributed public key to descramble it, and then make the change in the plaintext. But what then? In order to resend the text with the proper signature, our forger would require the private key to fix the signature on the entire document. That secret key, of course, would be unobtainable, remaining in the sole possession of the original signer.If someone sending a signed message wanted secrecy in addition to a signature, that‚Äôs easy, too. If Mark wanted to send an order to his banker, Lenore, he‚Äôd first sign the request with his private key, then encrypt that signed message with Lenore‚Äôs public key. Lenore would receive a twice-scrambled message: shaken for privacy, stirred for authentication. She would first apply her secret key, unlocking a mes¬≠sage that no one‚Äôs eyes but hers could read. Then she would use Mark‚Äôs public key, unlocking a message that she now knows only he could have sent.Digital signatures offer another advantage. Since it is impossible for a digitally signed message to be produced by anyone but the person who holds the private key that scrambles it, a signer cannot reasonably deny his or her role in producing the document. This nonrepudiation feature is the electronic equivalent of a notary public seal.For the first time, it became possible to conceive of all sorts of offi¬≠cial transactions‚Äîcontracts, receipts, and the like‚Äîto be performed over computer networks, with no need for one‚Äôs physical presence.In short, Diffie had not only figured out a way to assure privacy in an age of digital communications, but he had enabled an entirely new form of commerce, an electronic commerce that had the potential not only to match but to exceed the current protocols in commercial transactions. Even more impressive, his breakthrough had been performed completely outside the purview of government agencies in close possession of even the most trivial details of the most obscure crypto¬≠graphic system.WRITTEN BY"
266,"Cooking, Cleaning, and Sewing Are the New ‚ÄòWellness‚Äô",https://elemental.medium.com/cooking-cleaning-and-sewing-are-the-new-wellness-f905845c732f?source=extreme_main_feed---------269-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--1,"resh Roberson, a Chicago chef, kept hearing the same thing from her club‚Äôs newest members: Dough was their savior.Fresh co-directs the Chicago Bread Club, an organization that runs workshops on making sourdough, biscuits, and babka. While the club welcomes members of all ages, it was this new class of millennial attendees ‚Äî many of them female college graduates ‚Äî who echoed a very specific sentiment. Bread-making, the physical action of mixing ingredients and kneading dough, was a stress reliever.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about following a procedure ‚Äî putting things together, then watching it rise,‚Äù says Roberson, 37. ‚ÄúYou get to be creative and work with your hands‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs also really pretty.‚ÄùBaking bread is having a moment: Social media accounts such as Challah Hub highlight the joy of working with yeast, while 800,000 posts are dedicated to #homemadebread. In cities like New York and Los Angeles, bread-baking gatherings have gained momentum despite trendy gluten-free and no-carb diets. Sales of sourdough starter kits are seeing a resurgence.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a real satisfaction element,‚Äù says Chicago Bread Club founder and co-director Shulamis Rouzaud, 33, who notes another draw: an intrinsic desire to make something. And bread, for many, is a totally accessible DIY product. You just need flour, water, and the ability to follow directions.When referring to baking, Rouzaud avoids the ubiquitous term ‚Äúwellness,‚Äù which conveys a pursuit of something that may or may not be achievable. Instead, she uses ‚Äúwell-being.‚Äù That, she explains, is a more holistic and individual-centered philosophy.Baking is just one of many ways U.S. women now find refuge in activities once associated with domestic drudgery. It‚Äôs something they can proudly tackle and satisfyingly complete, in contrast to other modern-day pressures, be it work or parenting or, I don‚Äôt know, keeping their family healthy during a pandemic.‚ÄúCooking shouldn‚Äôt be viewed as a chore or another to-do, but more as a way to be more present, spend more time with family and friends, and to be able to complete the task.‚ÄùToday, the $4.5 trillion wellness industry extends beyond simply unplugging or indulging at a spa; it speaks more to improving one‚Äôs health and self-worth in new, surprising ways. These labor-intensive trends represent a collective creativity, an empowered will to self-soothe in a world that makes it increasingly challenging to find inner peace.A slew of new companies and groups are rebranding age-old chores as self-care: Cooking becomes an immersive escape from tech. Gardening products sell working with dirt as a personal time-out. Sewing is a form of meditation. ‚ÄúCleanfluencers‚Äù reimagine the art of scrubbing kitchens. Meanwhile, companies like We Are Knitters, which sells yarn kits, have grown exponentially by glorifying the benefits of flexing your fingers.What do these activities have in common? To start, they center around the home. Research has shown that millennials, in particular, feel a gravitational pull to stay in rather than go out. Surveys suggest they far prefer drinking or socializing at home, and one recent study found that Americans in their early twenties spend 70% more time at home than the general population. This shift has inspired startups like the newsletter Girls Night In, which has more than 170,000 subscribers.Girls Night In founder Alisha Ramos says her readership is often too tired, overwhelmed, or cash-strapped to want a pricey night out on the town. (Many others are just simply introverted.) Home serves as a sanctuary from burnout, a safe space. ‚ÄúYou feel secure in your home and that then lends itself to feeling more calm,‚Äù explains Ramos.That said, baking and knitting are not just satisfying the urge to cozy up on the couch. They offer a specific physical release. Intentional repetitive actions can redirect one‚Äôs focus away from anxiety, worries, and depressive thoughts and lull individuals into a relaxing trance. Once people start cooking, for example, they often enter a near flow state. Chopping an onion or forming meatballs are repetitive rhythmic motions, which studies show can improve mental health. It‚Äôs mindfulness with dinner as a reward.Researchers at Tel Aviv University found that repetitive acts increase a person‚Äôs belief that they can manage a situation that is otherwise out of their hands.Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine, explains that physical hobbies could be as potentially effective as medication in lowering blood pressure, provided they‚Äôre performed in a mindful manner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs paying attention to the actual sensory experience and engagement with the activity,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúSo if you notice that other thoughts are intruding, you return back to the exercise you‚Äôre doing.‚ÄùA popular clip from The Big Bang Theory further illustrates this practice: Raj (played by Kunal Nayyar) exalts washing dishes as a newfound form of meditation. ‚ÄúThe key is that while washing dishes one should only be washing the dishes,‚Äù he instructs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It‚Äôs about simply being.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs that idea that motivated entrepreneur Nick Ling to found Pattern Brands, an entire portfolio of companies designed to help millennials enjoy their homes in a more mindful manner. Its first launch, Equal Parts, combines chic cookware with cooking coaches who help twenty- and thirtysomethings gain fulfillment in the kitchen. They help customers build a set of habits and find meaning in activities as routine as Tuesday night dinner.‚ÄúCooking shouldn‚Äôt be viewed as a chore or another to-do,‚Äù Ling explains, ‚Äúbut more as a way to be more present, spend more time with family and friends, and to be able to complete the task. It‚Äôs this idea of finding enjoyment in your daily life ‚Äî at home.‚ÄùResearchers at Tel Aviv University found that repetitive actions have another added benefit: They can increase a person‚Äôs belief that they can manage a situation that is otherwise out of their hands. Ritualistic behavior offers a sense of control.‚ÄúCleanfluencers‚Äù are capitalizing on this. Becky Rapinchuk, creator of the popular cleaning website Clean Mama, is one of dozens of social media influencers extolling the virtues of picking up a Lysol bottle. Her 455,000 followers learn how to properly wash floors, set up a housekeeping routine, or even just make their own natural cleaners. In a frank but friendly tone, she reminds, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get off your phone, you‚Äôre not going to get that done. You need to stop watching Netflix and go unload your dishwasher.‚ÄùHousehold hobbies allow you to exert mindful effort. Consider them the antithesis to a society that has all its needs met without much exertion at all.She says fans describe their homes as a barrier against the anxiety-inducing influences of the outside world. The never-ending news cycle, constant tech communication, even traffic and restaurant noise ‚Äî everything feels chaotic, explains Rapinchuk, so it‚Äôs essential to come home to a haven that is quiet, organized, and spotless. It‚Äôs a type of purification, one of the oldest examples of self-control.‚ÄúYour home is something that you can control,‚Äù stresses Rapinchuk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take some work, but it‚Äôs a lot easier than solving the world‚Äôs problems.‚ÄùAlthough, a clean home gives you more than a sense of control. It gives you a feel-good sense of accomplishment. The ‚ÄúIkea effect,‚Äù as it‚Äôs known, refers to taking far more joy in a handmade object than that which is store bought. You imbue it with more value.As Rapinchuk says of her DIY cleaning liquid recipes, ‚ÄúThere is satisfaction in knowing that you made it and it cost you pennies.‚Äù Not to mention that you were successful in cleaning up what was once a messy area. ‚ÄúWhen you see progress, it makes you more motivated.‚ÄùGardening counts as self-care too. A new survey found that 70% of millennials have taken it upon themselves to become ‚Äúplant parents,‚Äù in part due to the joy that comes from seeing botany thrive. Amanda Dunker is co-founder and CEO of Avalow, a gardening startup resonating with women in urban environments by way of self-watering flower beds. She says her clients love the physicality, as well as the self-esteem boost, in learning how to garden. She sees a group hungry for knowledge and eager to master a new skill.‚ÄúWhen they plant [a seed] and see it flourish, they get to take ownership of that accomplishment,‚Äù reflects Dunker. ‚ÄúIt really relaxes people and empowers people.‚ÄùHousehold hobbies allow you to exert mindful effort. Consider them the antithesis to a society that has all its needs met without much exertion at all. What joy is there in relying on DoorDash and Amazon Prime for everything?‚ÄúIn this modern age, we have lost the ability to be bored and then be inspired and then create something new. I think [home hobbies] are incredibly therapeutic.‚ÄùIn an era when many millennials feel they always need to hustle or transform every talent into a side business, these activities act as both a stress reliever and confidence booster. There‚Äôs no attached pressure. Making things also serves as a necessary creative expression, says Ramos. ‚ÄúIn this modern age, we have lost the ability to be bored and then be inspired and then create something new. I think [home hobbies] are incredibly therapeutic.‚ÄùWellness has long been used to address mental and physical needs, and now that potentially means donning dishwashing gloves to ‚Äúmeditate.‚Äù One could see such efforts as deceptive methods to get us excited about burdensome chores or, as some of these new founders attest, an opportunity to thrive.‚ÄúThe most enjoyable activities are not natural and they can demand an effort,‚Äù says Ling, dispelling the idea that self-care should always come easy. ‚ÄúBut the completion of those activities and learning the skill is fully, intrinsically rewarding.WRITTEN BY"
267,Solitude Is a Privilege Too Many Take for Granted,https://zora.medium.com/solitude-is-a-privilege-too-many-take-for-granted-ba2162b62d95?source=extreme_main_feed---------270-74--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--2,"recent weeks, the theme of solitude has forcibly taken center stage in our lives. Counsel from public health officials around the world has been unwavering: The magnitude of the harm caused by this pandemic will heavily depend on how well people adhere to social distancing protocols. While it‚Äôs too late to contain the spread of Covid-19, there is hope in slowing it down ‚Äî flattening the curve, as they say ‚Äî so long as we stay away from each other as much as possible.Today, more people live alone than ever before: 28% of U.S. households in 2019. None of us can know for sure how long ‚Äúsafer at home‚Äù measures will be in place, but the delicate relationship between solitude and loneliness is one many will likely have to learn firsthand. And science has long shown that prolonged solitude can have irreversible effects on human health. But in this country, even in these conditions ‚Äî or perhaps especially in these conditions ‚Äî spending time alone at home is something that remains a luxury for many people.I was raised in cramped apartments with too many bodies and not enough rooms. With mattresses propped up against living room walls, the roar of my father‚Äôs stubborn snores would rumble from the bed next to mine, which was a bunk bed that I shared with my two brothers. At one time, there were six of us ‚Äî my parents, two brothers, and a teenage cousin who just arrived from Mexico ‚Äî in a one-bedroom apartment.I never lamented living that way as a kid ‚Äî not in a way I had the language for anyway. Besides, everyone I knew lived that way, too: My best friend who also shared a tiny apartment with her two brothers and parents, my t√≠a who transformed the living room into my cousin‚Äôs room, the three ‚Äútroublemaker‚Äù kids in the studio upstairs whose mom was never home because she was always at work.In cities like New York and Los Angeles, where crowding problems disproportionately affect working-class and immigrant neighborhoods, solitude is something only the fortunate can afford. A 2012 study in the journal Social Science Research found that around 70% of crowded units in New York had an immigrant head of household, the majority of whom were Latino. And almost 40% of the residents in these units were children. In 2014, Latino households in Los Angeles were more than 12 times more likely to be crowded than White ones.For children especially, living in crowded homes can have detrimental effects. Studies have shown that children living in these conditions have poorer physical health, lower quality of sleep, and greater behavioral and emotional distress. They‚Äôre more likely to be depressed, anxious, and distracted ‚Äî even when poverty is accounted for. ‚ÄúIn these situations, modern amenities ‚Äî such as floor-to-ceiling windows, extra storage, and a communal roof deck ‚Äî won‚Äôt compensate for a fundamental lack of privacy in a child‚Äôs home every day,‚Äù said Susan Saegert, professor of environmental psychology at the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center.And then there are the productivity pep talks about what people from the past have accomplished in times like these.Shakespeare‚Äôs time in self-isolation following the 1606 outbreak of the bubonic plague, which resulted in the closure of theaters, has been the most cited as evidence that solitude has great potential to be fruitful. Though much of his life still remains a mystery, it is widely believed that in that year, Shakespeare wrote King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. What‚Äôs less mentioned is that at the time, he boasted an impressive real estate portfolio, which, according to Hema Dahiya‚Äôs 2018 book Essays on Shakespeare, included the second-largest house in his hometown of Stratford. Given his socioeconomic position, space and solitude were most likely not issues for him.How many great thinkers have had scientific breakthroughs or produced great works of art in cramped rooms?Almost 60 years later, Isaac Newton, then a student at Cambridge, also had to practice social distancing because of the Great Plague of London (1665‚Äì1666). He spent his time in self-quarantine at Woolsthorpe Manor, his family‚Äôs estate. When he returned to Cambridge the following year, he did so with papers that would become the foundation for early calculus and groundbreaking theories on optics. That year was later referred to as his annus mirabilis, or his years of wonder.How many great thinkers have had scientific breakthroughs or produced great works of art in cramped rooms?Countless writers have meditated on the indispensability of solitude in their creative process. In a 1990 interview with the Paris Review, Maya Angelou told the story of the time she spent in hotel rooms that she rented in every town she ever lived in. She‚Äôd leave her home at 6 a.m., be in the room by 6:30, write until 12 or 1:30 in the afternoon, then go home and ‚Äútry to breathe.‚ÄùVirginia Woolf, Lord Byron, Sandra Cisneros, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and Pablo Neruda have all written about solitude as a positive, necessary thing.Though the bulk of research on solitude focuses on its harmful effects, scientists have increasingly become interested in its therapeutic nature. So long as it is voluntary and practiced by someone who can regulate their emotions ‚Äúeffectively,‚Äù spending time alone is tremendously beneficial to the human psyche. ‚ÄúWhen people take these moments to explore their solitude, not only will they be forced to confront who they are,‚Äù notes sociologist Jack Fong, ‚Äúthey just might learn a little bit about how to outmaneuver some of the toxicity that surrounds them in a social setting.‚ÄùIn crowded apartments, alone time often comes in the form of other people leaving for work or school. In these precarious times, the issue of apartment crowding will almost certainly worsen. There will be no King Lears. As schools remain closed and parents unemployed, relief from excess social stimulation will no longer be an option for many. While many people are coming to terms with the idea that they will be spending much of their time alone for the foreseeable future, solitude remains an unattainable privilege for many families.WRITTEN BY"
268,The Key To Happiness While Social Distancing,https://medium.com/wake-up-call/the-key-to-happiness-while-social-distancing-1946522060a?source=extreme_main_feed---------271-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--3,"There are a lot of stressful factors weighing on us right now amid this global pandemic. But if there‚Äôs something that author Gretchen Rubin of The Happiness Project knows best, it‚Äôs that happy people might be more likely to do something about the world‚Äôs woes. In other words: Finding light during dark times is really important to our collective future.This week, we‚Äôre talking to Gretchen about how to cope with the pandemic. Today, Rubin weighs in on how we can still find some happiness ‚Äî while social distancing from many of our loved ones.Gretchen Rubin: I really don‚Äôt define it, because I think you can get very caught up in, ‚ÄúIs it joy, is it happiness? Is it peace? Is it satisfaction? Is it bliss? Is it hedonic well being?‚Äù And there‚Äôs no one size fits all solution. We can each only build a happy life on the foundation of our own nature, temperament, values, and interests.But during this difficult time, all we can do is try to be as happy as we can be under the circumstances. You can take control by getting enough sleep, making sure that you eat, are exercising in some way, and aren‚Äôt wearing yourself out. Your physical experience is always going to influence your emotional experience. Overall, ancient philosophers and contemporary scientists agree that relationships are key to a happy life. We need to feel like we belong and have intimate bonds.Right now, everybody‚Äôs struggling. So there‚Äôs comfort in knowing that we‚Äôre all socially distancing because we care about each other. Coming together with other people can boost morale, but right now ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre not supposed to do.So with our normal social patterns being disrupted, we need to mindfully either recreate or reinvent social connection.Maybe start a group text with your friends, or learn to use apps like House Party or Zoom. We can take notes from different generations, who really do use social media differently to connect.My 15-year-old uses Snapchat a lot with her friends and she really likes that as a tool. And my 20-year-old daughter is doing voice memos through texts. I‚Äôve always said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to take the time to listen. I just want to read it.‚Äù But she says, ‚ÄúEverybody has time now. And it‚Äôs nice to hear other people‚Äôs voices.‚ÄùAnd then there are some people connecting through video games, or virtual book groups. I‚Äôve heard of people doing a virtual St. Patrick‚Äôs Day party where they all got dressed up in green.I think direct communication is best, but I do think that knowing what everybody‚Äôs up to is just fun and lightweight. And it can bring a sense of comfort to know that everybody‚Äôs going through this.People love familiarity and mastery, but they need novelty and challenge, and it‚Äôs going to be hard to find that when we‚Äôre not out and about doing things.And so I think social media can play a role in that. Obviously, it can be negative and can kind of get people riled up. But it can also be a wonderful source of humor, knowledge and a treasure trove of book, podcast and T.V. recommendations.Research shows, and I think common experience confirms, when people are happier ‚Äî they‚Äôre actually more likely to turn out and think about the world‚Äôs problems. Happier people volunteer more. They give away more money. They‚Äôre more likely to vote. Sometimes people say if you want to be happy, all you want to do is drink margaritas on the beach. But actually happy people want to do things like distribute malaria nets.We‚Äôre much more likely to serve the world if we come from a place of happiness ourselves.Support people whose jobs are at risk. If you can afford to pay workers, like a dog walker, even when they‚Äôre not working, that‚Äôs a great way to give back.And a lot of people are ordering in. Research suggests that ordering in food is safe, and it certainly supports a lot of workers and businesses that are threatened.You can also help out elderly neighbors and family members with grocery runs. Furthermore, one of the best ways to make ourselves happiest, is to contribute to somebody else‚Äôs well-being.This interview was edited by staff writer Amanda Svachula.This appeared in Katie Couric‚Äôs Wake-Up Call newsletter.

269,VC in the Time of Corona,https://medium.com/@yuvalariav/vc-in-the-time-of-corona-8157b029ad07?source=extreme_main_feed---------272-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--4,"As both a founder and an investor, I‚Äôve received numerous calls and messages recently from founders in Israel looking to better understand the local investor thinking given the global COVID-19 pandemic. I decided to dig in to some research to provide guidance in these challenging and fascinating times.Many founders are understandably confused and even stressed.To alleviate some of the confusion and bring transparency and data to founders and investors alike, I‚Äôve spent a couple of days doing phone interviews with VCs who are active in the Israeli tech ecosystem.My conversations were aimed at gathering data about investor mindset and sentiment, and were conducted under the promise that the data shared would be anonymized and non attributed, to encourage maximal openness.Founders, I hope you find the data and advice below useful.The good news is that VCs in Israel are open for business.Nearly all of the funds surveyed reported they are still actively looking at deals. The rest, while assuming a more passive posture, still indicated that they‚Äôd opportunistically invest if an exceptional deal came along.Despite planning to stay active in the market, most investors said they‚Äôd probably be taking fewer initial meetings (or, more likely, calls). However, this seems to be driven less by reduced appetite and more by external factors, mostly:Most investors expressed the belief that meeting pace would pick up once people and families settle into the cadence of working from home with kids.While it‚Äôs clear from the data that VCs in Israel are open for business, it‚Äôs equally clear that ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù looks different today than, say, 3 months ago.My first observation from the data is that the fund‚Äôs age is key in how investors think about capital allocation at this time.Most of those who are managing relatively fresh funds reported making no change in allocation between money for new deals and reserves for supporting their existing portfolio.Conversely, investors at the tail end of their funds indicated making changes to their initial / reserve balance. Most seem to be taking a defensive stance, reserving additional capital to support their existing portfolios. The other, smaller group is playing offense, allocating more capital than planned for new checks, which they expect will yield better returns.Regardless of where funds are in their lifecycle, it is clear from my chats with investors that a big change is upon us. This change in can be summarized as fewer, slower, lower.While not framing reality in terms of the number of deals they might do in the near future, most investors stated that the bar for new investments is higher. Significantly. The quote below captures the current sentiment:We‚Äôre no longer in a market where any decent team with a deck saying ‚Äúcyber‚Äù raises money with few questions asked- Early stage investor surveyedWhen discussing the new bar, investors mostly mentioned:Most investors alluded to the fact that they expect new deals to progress slower than in the past. The key reasons cited for this change were:This is perhaps where consensus was strongest: all participants believe that valuations will be adjusted down, in some cases aggressively, for all new rounds happening in the foreseeable future, reflecting an anticipation of economic slowdown and increased general uncertainty.In ten cases, investors said they were already seeing adjustments, either in portfolio companies being priced by outsiders or in deals they were doing.Reported valuation reductions ranged from 10% to 40%, with a median of 25% and mean of 23.7%.A few notes on the figures above:There‚Äôs still a ton of money looking for opportunity out there. It‚Äôs just a matter of risk. That is to say: a matter of valuation.- Later stage investor (not surveyed), early last weekPerhaps the key question on both founders‚Äô and investors‚Äô minds is: when will things get back to normal?While it‚Äôs definitely too early to say anything about the broader global financial situation, I asked the investors I spoke with to estimate when will early stage investor appetite bounce back to pre-COVID-19 levels?From the answers, it‚Äôs clear that investors fall into two categories:In my opinion, the realities represented by these two groups aren‚Äôt necessarily mutually exclusive: it‚Äôs very likely that, while short-term recovery will be fueled by fresh funds putting their capital to work, the next cycle of VC re-ups will see fewer, smaller funds, and the overall market will contract.In light of all this, what should you, the founders, be doing differently as you‚Äôre talking to investors? Here are a few pieces of advice:First, remember that all of the adjustments and predictions above are strongly affected by sentiments and moods that swing, sometimes on a daily basis. But, volatile as they may be, these sentiments have a very real impact, most notably on investment decisions and terms.Here are three key developments that will likely dictate the pace of market recovery, and shape investor sentiment, in the near future. They are worth tracking and understanding:To state the obvious, you can‚Äôt go into a pitch meeting/call and not address the quarantined elephant in the room. Here‚Äôs what the investors I spoke with expect to see that‚Äôs different:Every company tells me it‚Äôs the best thing to ever happen to them. Feels like Corona is the new AI‚Ä¶- Early stage investor surveyedAs the data suggests, investors are playing a very different game than they were even a month ago. And this ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù is likely to persist for at least a few months. Therefore, my advice for founders would be to adapt, the sooner the better:Whether we‚Äôre headed for a ‚Äúmere‚Äù global economic slowdown (at best) or a full-blown recession (at worst), nearly all sectors will see a drop-off in activity levels for at least a few quarters.The silver lining is that times like these are great for focusing on product, building out the company‚Äôs assets, and preparing for the eventual momentum of a recovering market:I was hesitant to bring up this last point, because it could be somewhat controversial in a ‚Äúraise all you can when you can‚Äù industry. Having said that, this topic came up in more than a handful of conversations, so I think it‚Äôs important to create common knowledge around it.If you‚Äôre a founder who hasn‚Äôt taken any money yet, and you‚Äôre looking to raise your company‚Äôs first round‚Ä¶ maybe wait a few weeks. Even if you think you‚Äôll be successful raising now.The thinking behind this advice is that while things may deteriorate economically in the next month or two, there‚Äôll be more visibility about where they might end up. The decreased uncertainty will lead to more informed, productive conversations around plans, budgets, and milestones.You may be excited to start, now that everyone‚Äôs saying ‚Äúthis is a great time to start a company‚Äù. That‚Äôs true, but it will remain equally true a month or two from now.From personal experience, the founder journey is one of the loneliest experiences a person can have. Despite support from parents, children, friends, spouses, or co-founders, times like these still make the journey lonelier and more challenging.Having said that, I cannot help but end this post on a positive note: the chats I‚Äôve had in recent weeks with founders, employees, and investors filled me with incredible optimism. Everyone I talked to made me feel a true sense of camaraderie and expressed a genuine willingness to help.For my part, I‚Äôd like to do the same: if you‚Äôre a founder (or team) who feels the need to chat for some advice or even just to vent, I‚Äôd be happy to find some time to talk with you. Feel free to email me at yuval.ariav@gmail.comFinally, I‚Äôd like to thank the investors who took a few minutes from their chaotic schedules these days to chat and contribute to the community:Jonathan (LionBird), Tal (Lightspeed), Guy (Harel Insurance Company), Guy (TPY Capital), Avichay (lool), Tal (Dynamic Loop), Liad (Emerge), Lior (M12), Liron (Meron Capital), Tal (Crescendo), Eden (Aleph), Tomer (Viola Fintech), Aviad (Vertex), Omry (Viola Ventures), Ben (Amiti), Philippe (Square Peg), the folks at Bessemer and Ofek, and a couple more who asked to remain nameless.‚Ä¶ and the people who gave indispensable feedback: Racheli Kogan, Roee Nahir, Megan Groves, Elad Raz, Iftach Ariav and Taly Rabinerson.Cheers!WRITTEN BY"

It can result from differing points of view; for example, engineering and sales might see a problem in different contexts. In other cases, it might result from personality clashes; two loudmouths with strong opinions, perhaps.Conflicts sometimes resolve themselves peacefully, but I‚Äôm going to offer some advice for teams that want to better manage conflict and use it to drive more robust solutions and decisions. These are particularly useful for those times when conflicts are persistent, unproductive, or have reached a stalemate.When I wrote about the nonviolent communication framework last year, I never imagined it would resonate with so many people. NVC is a versatile approach to resolving all sorts of conflicts.We often think of conflicts as interpersonal but any difference of opinion can cause it. For example, your lead engineer might want to rebuild your software, while your sales directors want a new feature urgently. Or one co-founder might want to take the business in a particular direction while another prefers a different strategy.At the core of NVC is a straightforward communication pattern: When [observation], I feel [emotion] because I need [universal need]. Would you be able to [request]?The process of filling in the blanks is extremely insightful. It forces you to get specific, to check in with your emotions, and to clarify what‚Äôs really important. It can be transformational.However, there are some drawbacks if you want to use it in a business setting.Whether you‚Äôre new to NVC or a seasoned practitioner, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs not perfect. The most obvious issue is that the format is pretty awkward.Imagine saying this to a colleague:‚ÄòWhen you didn‚Äôt bring me a cup of coffee, I felt disappointed because I have a need for inclusion. Please, could you get me a coffee next time?When you apply the format to the letter, it usually sounds over-prepared and clunky. It‚Äôs not how people normally speak so it can come off as patronising.The second issue is clear from the moment you‚Äôve said your piece. Most people haven‚Äôt done NVC training. Their natural tendency is to respond judgmentally and defend their position, not to self-empathise and investigate.Even when everyone around a table is familiar with the framework, you still need monk-like self-awareness to spit out the formula quickly. NVC requires introspection, and introspection requires space and time ‚Äî two things you usually don‚Äôt have in a conflict.The NVC communication format is a great tool for self-reflection and clarity. However, the key to using NVC in practice is to apply its principles, not necessarily it‚Äôs format. NVC is best thought of as a problem-solving methodology that focuses on uncovering win-win solutions.Here are four principles to help you get to the heart of a conflict and find a better outcome for the team ‚Äî and the business.Our minds are built to defend our own opinions. First, we make intuitive judgements in a fraction of a second. Then our rational brain finds logical reasons to justify those judgements. Once we find enough reasons, we conclude that we‚Äôre right and everyone else is wrong.The intuitive approach is to debate the ideas. Both sides present a persuasive case and eventually, the best idea will triumph. But this approach has some serious flaws. What if the best idea hasn‚Äôt been found? Who is supposed to judge the debate? And who says the best debater has the best idea? After all, a great lawyer can represent a guilty criminal and still win.Starting with the specifics requires an ability to observe the situation without judgement. This doesn‚Äôt come naturally to us as a species. Ancient humans who bypassed snap judgement were promptly eaten by lions, or poisoned by attractive but foul-tasting plants.To uncover the specifics, ask questions such as:Most people need a few attempts to get past their judgements, so when they struggle to observe, exercise a little patience and encouragement.The idea of sharing emotions might sound more appropriate for a therapy session than a problem-solving session. Some people believe emotions have no place at work, and you should focus on logic instead. Aren‚Äôt emotions the root cause of most bad decisions?Well, yes, emotions can lead to poor decision-making. This is because our emotions drive our gut decisions, and our gut decisions drive our reasoning.‚ÄòReasoning was not designed to pursue the truth. Reasoning was designed by evolution to help us win arguments‚Äô ‚Äî Jonathan HaidtGiven that emotions are in the driving seat, all the more reason to get them out in the open.Many of us find it hard to connect with, and talk about, our feelings. To help your team tap into their emotions, ask them curious questions like:Most people‚Äôs emotional literacy is limited to ‚Äòhappy, sad, and pissed off‚Äô, so here‚Äôs a handy list of feelings that might make it easier.Creating a place where people can be vulnerable without fear of abuse is critical for any form of conflict resolution. Vulnerability is the source of connection.Have you ever noticed that when you argue with someone smart, if you manage to debunk their initial reasoning, they just shift to a new, logical-sounding reason?Reasons are like a salamander‚Äôs legs ‚Äî if you cut one off, another grows in its place.When you‚Äôre dealing with a salamander, you need to get to the heart. Forget about reasoning and focus on what‚Äôs causing the emotions. According to NVC, every negative emotion is the result of an unmet, universal need.By universal, we mean a need that everybody has. Here‚Äôs a list so you get the gist:Let‚Äôs illustrate this with a concrete example.Suppose product development has slowed down, reported bugs have increased 30% since last month, and sprint velocity is down by 40%. Your engineer is feeling desperately unhappy and is terrified of building new features because of the risk to the system as a whole.They want to stop building new features and refactor some of the system architecture. But what do you think their unmet universal need is here?I‚Äôd guess that their unmet needs are fun and safety. In order words, if there were an option that didn‚Äôt impact the system and sounded pretty interesting to work on, it would probably be an appealing one for the engineer.But it doesn‚Äôt matter what I think, only how the engineer feels. Validate your assumptions with questions like:You know you‚Äôve uncovered the unmet needs when the answer becomes a resounding ‚ÄòYes!‚ÄôAfter you‚Äôve identified the emotions and needs of all parties, you‚Äôre ready for the ninja move.This is the secret to finding a win-win scenario faster. NVC assumes that our underlying needs are never in conflict; it‚Äôs only the strategies we pursue to meet those needs that clash. The idea is to look for new strategies that meet everyone‚Äôs needs.Let‚Äôs continue with our example of the engineer. Suppose the sales director has a feature request from a big prospect that could mean the difference between closing the deal and losing it.The engineer and the sales director meet to discuss it. And things get tense.The sales director explains that the prospect said, ‚ÄòIf you had a reporting dashboard, I‚Äôd close the deal right now.‚Äô The director is concerned that they‚Äôll miss out on the deal without this feature, and feels altogether rather helpless.I‚Äôd guess that the unmet needs are support and independence. If there was a solution that the sales director could pursue independently, while feeling supported by the business, they‚Äôd probably be quite happy.Now for the reframe.What possible solutions are safe and fun for engineering, and give the sales director more independence and support?This question clarifies the conditions that, if met, would meet everyone‚Äôs needs. It takes the focus away from defending existing ideas to solving a new problem. And in my experience, great people love a juicy new problem to solve.What ideas would you come up with for this scenario? What other questions would you ask the engineer and sales director, to uncover new, creative solutions?Next time you encounter a difference of opinion, whether on your team, in a negotiation, or even in politics, ask yourself what emotions and universal needs are playing out on both sides.How would you reframe the issue to clarify what a win-win solution looks like? And what creative solutions might emerge as bright people put their minds to this new problem?My guess is that more of the planet‚Äôs problems could be resolved faster. And in an increasingly polarised world, it‚Äôs worth a shot.I‚Äôm Dave and I coach CEOs of Series A+ tech companies.

271,How to speed up Node.js modules installation in CI/CD Pipeline as of 2020,https://itnext.io/how-to-speed-up-node-js-modules-installation-in-ci-cd-pipeline-as-of-2020-4865d77c0eb7?source=extreme_main_feed---------274-73--------------------ae741f88_52e6_4632_b2d4_d4446ba00442--6,"2020/3/28 Update: Add pnpmWhen you use Node.js in your project, you need to take care of node_modules installation in your CI/CD pipeline. You may use npm install, npm ci,yarn install and pnpm install, but what is the fastest way of doing so is still a question we are looking for answers. Here in this story I would like to experiment all possibilities I know to find out the final answer.If you are in a hurry, what you have to do are:If you prefer yarnIf you prefer pnpmThe total speed up is around 3x comparing to pure npm installIt is normal that someone already do it in the past, here are some existing works for your reference.To prevent any cache or unexpected behavior, I run the experiment inside a docker container and every time we complete an installation, we run a new container for the next installation.The docker image I use is node:12 and the versions of each component are:I experiment both remote and local registry (verdaccio) scenario to show the influence of network. In local registry, I assumed the user do something like:Which makes the registry url in lock files points to the local registry directly.To mimic a real world scenario, I did experiment in an web app that is created using create-react-app.There are 5 basic commands I use:yarn install --frozen-lockfile is similar to npm ciFor all of them, I add &> /dev/null to remove stdout output and the execution time is averaged from 3 times of execution. (As the execution time is pretty stable, I believe 3 times is good enough)Let‚Äôs start the experiment and see where we will achieve. üòÉThere are 4 parameters we are going to tune:With local registry, you can prevent stale when the network bandwidth is not enough. It is a good way to speed up but may be painful when someone clone your repostiory but unable to access the local registry you used.2. cached node_modulesA common technique to speed up the installation, by zipping node_modules folder and unzipping before installation to eliminate the need of downloading modules again from network.3. global cacheThere is a global cache folder in ~/.npm for npm and ~/.yarn for yarn, by adding global cache in advance, I would like to know if it is possible to speed up.4. --prefer-offlineDetails: https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#prefer-offlineIf true, staleness checks for cached data will be bypassed, but missing data will be requested from the server. To force full offline mode, use --offline.With this option, we can prevent npm or yarn to check remote data and use local cache directly.Below are the result of all configurations:The number is the amount of seconds to complete modules installationFor the source code of this experiment can be found in this repository: https://github.com/jeromewu/npm-vs-yarn-in-cicdHope you find it helpful and if you have any ideas to experiment to speed up even further, please feel free to leave a response or create an issue inside the repository. üòÑWRITTEN BY"
