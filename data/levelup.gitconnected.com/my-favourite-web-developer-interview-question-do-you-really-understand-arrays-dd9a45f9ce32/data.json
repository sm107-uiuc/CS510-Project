I\u2019ve found this one simple question tells me if a developer truly understands the tools they use\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["In my corner of web development, we expect web developers to be familiar with both PHP and Javascript. I\u2019ve found this one simple question tells me if a developer truly understands the tools they use every day:", "Q: What are the similarities and differences between arrays in Javascript and PHP?", "It\u2019s one thing to be able to cut code. It\u2019s another thing entirely to be able to understand the bones of the languages you work with.", "This single question tells me volumes. See, almost every major programming language has arrays, and it would be easy to assume that they\u2019re all more or less the same. Many programmers do.", "This is an incorrect assumption that leads to a plethora of subtle errors, wasteful code, and failures to use a language\u2019s strengths most effectively.", "C is not the first programming language, but it\u2019s the most influential. Many developers first learned on C in university. Both PHP and Javascript derive, at least in part, from C. So there is a passing resemblance, and it\u2019s a good reference point to show how far arrays have come since 1972.", "In C, arrays are strongly-typed, and of a fixed length.", "This is an array. It can only hold integers, and can hold at most 10 elements.", "To use this array, we iterate over it with a for loop \u2014 a pattern that\u2019s been needlessly replicated across programming languages:", "This doesn\u2019t look alien to a Javascript or PHP developer, and therein lies the danger.", "You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking arrays in Javascript are similar:", "They are not. This is patently impossible in C:", "In Javascript, arrays have variable length, and the contents are untyped \u2014 just like any other variable in Javascript. The language takes care of the memory management, so our array can grow and shrink without having to worry about it \u2014an array in Javascript is really a list.", "Iterating over an array can be done badly (or naively):", "But the old-school C approach to iterating over an array is unnecessary. There are unnecessary intermediate variables, there\u2019s the potential for errors stemming from undefined or invalid values(is there actually a value defined in fibonacci[10] ? Is it even an integer?)", "But Javascript is better than that. Arrays aren\u2019t just arrays \u2014 just like functions, they\u2019re first-class objects in Javascript, and they have class methods for handling these sort of things usefully:", "In addition, Javascript arrays aren\u2019t fixed in length like C arrays are, which allows them to grow in interesting ways. You can pop the last element of an array out of the back, and push elements in. You can remove elements form the front by shifting, or add them by unshifting. You can use a different combination of these to treat a Javascript array like a stack or a queue, depending on your use case.", "Arrays in PHP almost look like Javascript.", "Like Javascript, they\u2019re of variable length, and weakly typed. You\u2019d be tempted to think they\u2019re the same.", "Lambda functions aren\u2019t quite as elegant as Javascript (as of ES6) but it\u2019s functionally equivalent to our earlier sample.", "You can also use Javascript\u2019s push and pop (array_push, array_pop ) and shift and unshift too ( array_shift, array_unshift )", "But you can\u2019t do this in Javascript (or C):", "In PHP, arrays are technically hash tables or dictionaries. They use keys to store values, and keys can be any primitive: such as int, float, or strings. Because it\u2019s a dictionary, looking up a value by any key is extremely efficient \u2014 it happens at O(1) time.", "It means you PHP arrays can function as an easy look-up table.", "PHP arrays give you all sorts of flexibility. PHP arrays can be sorted by keys and sorted by values. You can flip an array, reversing keys and values, which can give you all sorts of lookup efficiencies. Finding a particular value anything in a regular unsorted array is O(n) because you need to check against every single value in the array.", "Finding a particular value in PHP can be O(1) quite easily:", "You can do this sort of thing in Javascript, of course, but arrays won\u2019t get it done for you \u2014 you\u2019d need to use an object. But that comes with its own trade-offs: you don\u2019t get regular array operations that involve ordering like sorting and pushing/popping/shifting.", "Iterating over PHP arrays are much simpler and safer, too. You could use a for loop like in C, but why would you? PHP solves the problem of variable lengths and types by giving you foreach loops:", "The loop destructures both key and value, so you could manipulate both.", "For the record, you could use higher level functions as in Javascript above, but in PHP, arrays are not first-class objects, so it requires some core methods:", "This is functional \u2014 pun unintended \u2014 but not as elegant. If you want to code this way (and there are some good arguments for it) you might turn to a library such as Laravel\u2019s Collections. But PHP also allows you to create objects that function like arrays (that you could use in, say, a foreach loop).", "If PHP is your main programming language, you can often forget exactly how much power is embedded in this most basic of language constructs.", "But put simply: arrays are PHP\u2019s more underrated and unassuming superpower.", "Q: What are the similarities and differences between arrays in Javascript and PHP?", "A: In PHP and Javascript, arrays are weakly-typed lists of variable length. In Javascript, arrays are keyed and ordered by integers. In PHP, arrays are sortable lists and searchable dictionaries. Keys can be of any primitive type, and arrays can be sorted by key OR by value.", "Coding tutorials and news. The developer homepage gitconnected.com && skilled.dev && levelup.dev", "Code geek.
