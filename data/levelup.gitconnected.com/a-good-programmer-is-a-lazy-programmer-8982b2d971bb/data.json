A good programmer feels the same way about basic tasks such as looping through a recordset and performing simple logic based on the results with the same zeal as an elementary school student attacking their math homework, minus the full-fledged freak out but possibility not minus the grumbling acceptance of work to be done.", "Let\u2019s face it, coding is sometimes just an advanced form of data entry. It\u2019s something to get through rather than sink our teeth into.", "The art of being a good programmer through laziness is to always be on the lookout for patterns and ways to package them. The goal is to get through the mindbogglingly dull portions of the project as quickly as possible so we can focus more time and effort on the actual problem solving.", "To be fair, most programmers know this to a degree. After all, objects and functions are the fundamental building blocks of development and applications are just packaged building blocks being passed through over and over to produce results. But the good programmer takes these ideas to an extreme level.", "At this point, I will stop and state what should hopefully be obvious: The reverse is not true. A lazy programmer is rarely good. You know the person I\u2019m talking about. Maybe they like to execute that query and stare at the screen for three minutes while it runs rather than opening up a new tab and working on a different piece of code. Perhaps they don\u2019t feel they need proper error handling because \u201ccode is supposed to work perfectly.\u201d Or maybe they are fine taking the long way around because they are there to do exactly what is told to them and not deviate from the plan even if it contains obvious inefficiencies.", "A good programmer is lazy because they prefer working on portions of the project that are difficult rather than typing in code that basically writes itself.", "This isn\u2019t a contest to get the least amount of work done. It isn\u2019t about clocking out at 5, going home and totally forgetting about your work until 8 AM the next day. A good programmer is lazy because they prefer working on portions of the project that are difficult rather than typing in code that basically writes itself. In fact, the best \u2014 and often laziest \u2014 of programmers wake up in the middle of the night with an \u201cAha!\u201d moment because they solved a particularly tough puzzle while they were asleep. Or they look across the dinner table at their significant other, having been coding in their head since food was on the table and suddenly realizing they have no idea what the conversation being conducted in their quasi-absence is all about.", "I\u2019ve certainly never been one that enjoys typing in code just to type in code. Both big and small, I like to package it up. Both big and small? Heck, even when it is tiny. When I was developing my random dungeon generator for table top games like D&D and Pathfinder, I would often need to check a certain radius around a point on the map. It might be a trap that could spring from one square away or an event that could happen from two squares or an encounter that could spot the party from four squares away, no matter the distance, the SQL was virtually the same. So instead of typing in the same section of the where clause, I programmed a function that would accept the x/y coordinates and a radius in order to spit back the SQL.", "Simple. And yet it saved me from manually typing it dozens upon dozens of times AND, perhaps even more important, it ensured the where clause would be free of typos. That means no scrutinizing of code for half an hour only to find I\u2019d typed a 3 instead of a 4.", "I faced a similar pattern when looking up items in the treasure tables to fill a chest or monsters in encounter tables to create an ambush. The field names changed, but the basic algorithm was the same. There would be a record with a weight or frequency (how often it should be randomly pulled from the data set), conditions (such as the level of the creature or treasure, the type of encounter or item, etc.) and a primary key to identify it. The specifics might change, but how you randomly choose a record from this type of dataset stays the same, thus a function was born to do the heavy lifting.", "Sometimes the laziest way of doing something was to have code write code. I\u2019ve never been the biggest fan of templates that ship with development platforms, but I\u2019m a big fan of coding your own.", "When I started with my first \u2018real\u2019 programming job, we used Visual Basic to access a Microsoft SQL Server. (Yes, I\u2019m a dinosaur. I even remember typing on green screen terminals to develop on a VAX/VMS mainframe back in college.) The normal way of creating a data entry form was to include a recordset object that linked to fields on the form, but the recordset object shipped by Microsoft wasn\u2019t without its own bugs and performance issues, so we would do this part \u201cmanually.\u201d And in this case, that meant writing out our own code for inserting, updating and deleting records.", "This resulted in large amounts of code looking up values in fields on the form to build the INSERT or UPDATE statement by hand. Tedious.", "While Microsoft\u2019s recordset object wasn\u2019t always reliable, it at least minimized the amount of code required to do these basic functions. So in order to mimic this benefit while avoiding the recordset object itself, I developed a class that would compare fields on a form to the fields in the database in order to automatically generate the SQL statements needed to perform these basic tasks. Obviously, this was a little more complex than I\u2019ll go into here, but the result replicated the benefits of the recordset object (easier and smaller chunks of code) while subtracting the primary detractor (possibly buggy or inefficient code you had no control over).", "When I moved to working in PHP with MySQL, I ran up against the same type of issue. Big table = lots of code = boring. The big difference here was that less technical people would be working within the same files doing the HTML side of things, so I wanted to ensure some simplicity. And sometimes those big chunks of code are actually easier for the less technical to deal with than a more complicated system of getting the same thing done. Solution: build code that could be run to automatically generate the basic PHP code needed to insert, update and delete records in the database. Basically, building your own template.", "These examples aren\u2019t meant to dazzle so much as demonstrate that looking for patterns is something programmers should do no matter the size of the code. Even something as simple as creating an SQL where clause to bring in records within a certain distance can have a positive effect on how much time it takes you to finish a project. I even have functions that will give me the count, min or max from a table given a certain where clause. And the mere fact that it takes the typo out of the equation can make these functions worthwhile in the long run.", "Most of us with a few years under our belt have worked beside the programmer quite happy to type in line after line of thoughtless code day after day feeling no sense of urgency to search for the most efficient route. And I\u2019m not saying these are bad programmers, but if you are taking the most time to do every piece of your project, you are far more likely to get behind when that surprise puzzle pops up. And there is almost always a surprise.", "This is where looking for the patterns within the coding pays the biggest dividends. The time saved not typing in code that requires little thought can be put towards feature everyone thought was going to take a short amount of time but the reality was much longer.", "The basic mentality for a lazy programmer? Always look for a pattern.", "Coding tutorials and news.
