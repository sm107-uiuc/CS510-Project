You remember, \u201cjust a big iPhone\u201d. Sales absolutely exploded out of the gate, to the point where merely being an incredible business now disappoints people. It has been an awesomely weird decade. And it seems like it\u2019s about to get weirder.", "There\u2019s a lot of rumor mill smoke and code-leak fire out there right now. It seems pretty clear that we\u2019re on the verge of a new iPad \u2014 possibly multiple iPads \u2014 with a key new component: a keyboard with a trackpad. If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve probably used one of these devices before. It\u2019s called a laptop.", "I kid, but I also don\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad thing. I think there\u2019s something interesting going on here.", "Again, since day one we\u2019ve joked about the iPad being \u201cjust a big iPhone\u201d. But what is now clear is that Apple is thinking about the iPad much more akin to a MacBook \u2014 with one very key difference: it runs iOS.", "Those of us who are iPad lovers \u2014 I\u2019m firmly in this camp \u2014 long ago realized that the iPad (at least the larger models, the iPad mini is something wonderfully different still) was more in the vein of laptop rather than a big smartphone. I\u2019ve carried an iPad around on a nearly daily basis for much of the past decade. Overall, I use it more than my MacBook. And for many things \u2014 things I used to do with a laptop \u2014 I use it exclusively.", "Yes, that\u2019s because I use it with a keyboard. I currently use Apple\u2019s, but I\u2019ve tried and used many over the years. Again, basically from the get go. And this trackpad \u2014 if that\u2019s what it is \u2014 will push me farther into that camp. Of the remaining 10% of things I get frustrated with when it comes to using the iPad in this way, 90% of those are related to the fact that much of the web still wants you to have a mouse/trackpad in some capacity. Given that Apple solved most of the \u201cmobile\u201d Safari issues for iPad with iOS 13 (iPad OS), such a pointer device will get us very, very close to laptop computing perfection.", "Now, is that what we want? I\u2019m honestly not sure. I see it both ways. On one hand, it\u2019s sort of a shame that the \u201cif you see a stylus, they blew it\u201d iPad not only now has a stylus, but it\u2019s going to have a keyboard and trackpad. That is to say, this is seemingly not the device Steve Jobs set out to build. Again, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. It just means that ideas have evolved. And who knows, maybe Jobs was shortsighted in this regard. It\u2019s possible! Likely, even.", "Still, there\u2019s a romantic notion of being \u201cjust a big iPhone\u201d in some ways. You know, Jobs sitting in that leather chair during the demo, just flipping through the web with his finger. A truly touchable tablet. The web at your fingertips, quite literally. Simplified computing.", "Yet we still haven\u2019t quite lived up to the promise of third-party touch-based applications for this device. There are many fantastic ones. But the business side of the equation never took hold as it did for Mac-based software, for example. There are many reasons for this, and I largely fault Apple for them. But that\u2019s a different story.", "The point now isn\u2019t whether the iPad should be changing to be more laptop-like, it\u2019s that it is changing in that way. And again, I think that\u2019s fine. Good in some ways, less good in others. It is what it is. And what it is is a convergence of the iPad with the MacBook not because the MacBook gained a touchscreen, but because the iPad gained a point-and-clicker.", "At the same time, the MacBook is morphing to be closer to the iPad. While the touchscreen never happened, a \u201csimple\u201d way to port iPad apps to the Mac did. And now, again, if rumors are to be believed, the CPU that powers the iPad will soon make the jump to the Mac.", "So what we\u2019ll be left with is an iPad powered by an ARM chip, with a keyboard and trackpad, that runs iOS apps and can run the full web \u2014 meets a MacBook powered by an ARM chip, with a keyboard and trackpad, that can run the full web and iOS apps.\u00b9", "One will be top-heavy (the iPad), the other bottom-heavy (the MacBook). The iPad will probably be a bit lighter (but with the keyboard/trackpad maybe not!). The MacBook may be a bit more powerful (but maybe not!). The MacBook will have an OS that is more conducive to \u201cpower users\u201d, specifically for coding \u2014 but there\u2019s no reason that shouldn\u2019t change as well over time with keyboard and trackpad firmly in place.", "The main difference will be that on one you\u2019ll be able to touch the screen, while on the other you probably shouldn\u2019t, lest you want a grubby screen.", "That is to say, the main difference will be that one is iOS-based, and one is macOS-based. And the real difference there is that one is touch-first and one is trackpad-first. But this is a pretty blurry line!", "Again, I think that\u2019s fine. And in some ways, it\u2019s great that Apple has left the choice up to users, not worrying about cannibalization. But the choice is about to be less clear than it has ever been.", "So much for \u201cjust a big iPhone\u201d. More like \u201cjust a touch MacBook\u201d.", "\u00b9 And yes, macOS apps. But the line between those and iOS apps will likely blur over time too, assuming Catalyst gets better and bigger.", "A collection of posts by M.G.
