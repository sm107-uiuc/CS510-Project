To be perfectly honest, most of it still completely baffles me. But hopefully that\u2019s encouraging to any fellow non-experts who might be reading this, eager to get their feet wet in M.L.", "Machine learning was one of those things that would come up from time to time and I\u2019d think to myself \u201cyeah, that would be pretty cool\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure that I want to spend the next few months learning linear algebra and calculus.\u201d", "Like a lot of developers, however, I\u2019m pretty handy with JavaScript and would occasionally look for examples of machine learning implemented in JS, only to find heaps of articles and StackOverflow posts about how JS is a terrible language for M.L., which, admittedly, it is. Then I\u2019d get distracted and move on, figuring that they were right and I should just get back to validating form inputs and waiting for CSS grid to take off.", "But then I found Brain.js and I was blown away. Where had this been hiding?! The documentation was well written and easy to follow and within about 30 minutes of getting started I\u2019d set up and trained a neural network. In fact, if you want to just skip this whole article and just read the readme on GitHub, be my guest. It\u2019s really great.", "That said, what follows is not an in-depth tutorial about neural networks that delves into hidden input layers, activation functions, or how to use Tensorflow. Instead, this is a dead-simple, beginner level explanation of how to implement Brain.js that goes a bit beyond the documentation.", "Here\u2019s a general outline of what we\u2019ll be doing:", "If you\u2019d prefer to just download a working version of this project rather than follow along with the article then you can clone the GitHub repository here.", "Create a new directory and plop a good ol\u2019 index.html boilerplate file in there. Then create three JS files: brain.js, training-data.js, and scripts.js (or whatever generic term you use for your default JS file) and, of course, import all of these at the bottom of your index.html file.", "Now go here to get the source code for Brain.js. Copy & paste the whole thing into your empty brain.js file, hit save and bam: 2 out of 4 files are finished.", "Next is the fun part: deciding what your machine will learn. There are countless practical problems that you can solve with something like this; sentiment analysis or image classification for example. I happen to think that applications of M.L. that process text as input are particularly interesting because you can find training data virtually everywhere and they have a huge variety of potential use cases, so the example that we\u2019ll be using here will be one that deals with classifying text:", "We\u2019ll be determining whether a tweet was written by Donald Trump or Kim Kardashian.", "Ok, so this might not be the most useful application. But Twitter is a treasure trove of machine learning fodder and, useless though it may be, our tweet-author-identifier will nevertheless illustrate a pretty powerful point. Once it\u2019s been trained, our neural network will be able to look at a tweet that it has never seen before and then be able to determine whether it was written by Donald Trump or by Kim Kardashian just by recognizing patterns in the things they write. In order to do that, we\u2019ll need to feed it as much training data as we can bear to copy / paste into our training-data.js file and then we can see if we can identify ourselves some tweet authors.", "Now all that\u2019s left to do is set up Brain.js in our scripts.js file and feed it some training data in our training-data.js file. But before we do any of that, let\u2019s start with a 30,000-foot view of how all of this will work.", "Setting up Brain.js is extremely easy so we won\u2019t spend too much time on that but there are a few details about how it\u2019s going to expect its input data to be formatted that we should go over first. Let\u2019s start by looking at the setup example that\u2019s included in the documentation (which I\u2019ve slightly modified here) that illustrates all this pretty well:", "First of all, the example above is actually a working A.I (it looks at a given color and tells you whether black text or white text would be more legible on it). Which hopefully illustrates how easy Brain.js is to use. Just instantiate it, train it, and run it. That\u2019s it. I mean, if you inlined the training data that would be 3 lines of code. Pretty cool.", "Now let\u2019s talk about training data for a minute. There are two important things to note in the above example other than the overall input: {}, output: {} format of the training data.", "First, the data do not need to be all the same length. As you can see on line 11 above, only an R and a B value get passed whereas the other two inputs pass an R, G, and B value. Also, even though the example above shows the input as objects, it\u2019s worth mentioning that you could also use arrays. I mention this largely because we\u2019ll be passing arrays of varying length in our project.", "Second, those are not valid RGB values. Every one of them would come out as black if you were to actually use it. That\u2019s because input values have to be between 0 and 1 in order for Brain.js to work with them. So, in the above example, each color had to be processed (probably just fed through a function that divides it by 255 \u2014 the max value for RGB) in order to make it work. And we\u2019ll be doing the same thing.", "So if we want out neural network to accept tweets (i.e. strings) as an input, we\u2019ll need to run them through an similar function (called encode() below) that will turn every character in a string into a value between 0 and 1 and store it in an array. Fortunately, Javascript has a native method for converting any character into ASCII code called charCodeAt(). So we\u2019ll use that and divide the outcome by the max value for Extended ASCII characters: 255 (we\u2019re using extended ASCII just in case we encounter any fringe cases like \u00e9 or \u00bd) which will ensure that we get a value <1.", "Also, we\u2019ll be storing our training data as plain text, not as the encoded data that we\u2019ll ultimately be feeding into our A.I. - you\u2019ll thank me for this later. So we\u2019ll need another function (called processTrainingData() below) that will apply the previously mentioned encoding function to our training data, selectively converting the text into encoded characters, and returning an array of training data that will play nicely with Brain.js", "So here\u2019s what all of that code will look like (this goes into your \u2018scripts.js\u2019 file):", "Something that you\u2019ll notice here that wasn\u2019t present in the example from the documentation shown earlier (other than the two helper functions that we\u2019ve already gone over) is on line 20 in the train() function, which saves the trained neural network to a global variable called trainedNet . This prevents us from having to re-train our neural network every time we use it. Once the network is trained and saved to the variable, we can just call it like a function and pass in our encoded input (as shown on line 25 in the execute() function) to use our A.I.", "Alright, so now your index.html, brain.js, and scripts.js files are finished. Now all we need is to put something into training-data.js and we\u2019ll be ready to go.", "Last but not least, our training data. Like I mentioned, we\u2019re storing all our tweets as text and encoding them into numeric values on the fly, which will make your life a whole lot easier when you actually need to copy / paste training data. No formatting necessary. Just paste in the text and add a new row.", "Add that to your \u2018training-data.js\u2019 file and you\u2019re done!", "Note: although the above example only shows 3 samples from each person, I used 10 of each; I just didn\u2019t want this sample to take up too much space. Of course, your neural network\u2019s accuracy will increase proportionally to the amount of training data that you give it, so feel free to use more or less than me and see how it affects your outcomes", "Now, to run your newly-trained neural network just throw an extra line at the bottom of your \u2018script.js\u2019 file that calls the execute() function and passes in a tweet from Trump or Kardashian; make sure to console.log it because we haven\u2019t built a UI. Here\u2019s a tweet from Kim Kardashian that was not in my training data (i.e. the network has never encountered this tweet before):", "Then pull up your index.html page on localhost, check the console, aaand\u2026", "There it is! The network correctly identified a tweet that it had never seen before as originating from Kim Kardashian, with a certainty of 86%.", "Now let\u2019s try it again with a Trump tweet:", "Again, a never-before-seen tweet. And again, correctly identified! This time with 97% certainty.", "Now you have a neural network that can be trained on any text that you want! You could easily adapt this to identify the sentiment of an email or your company\u2019s online reviews, identify spam, classify blog posts, determine whether a message is urgent or not, or any of a thousand different applications. And as useless as our tweet identifier is, it still illustrates a really interesting point: that a neural network like this can perform tasks as nuanced as identifying someone based on the way they write.", "So even if you don\u2019t go out and create an innovative or useful tool that\u2019s powered by machine learning, this is still a great bit of experience to have in your developer tool belt. You never know when it might come in handy or even open up new opportunities down the road.", "Once again, all of this is available in a GitHub repo here:", "ITNEXT is a platform for IT developers & software engineers to share knowledge, connect, collaborate, learn and experience next-gen technologies.", "Software developer, JavaScript enthusiast, boxing fan"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
