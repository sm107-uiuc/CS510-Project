Sign up for my newsletter here.", "A chatbot is a service, powered by rules and sometimes artificial intelligence, that you interact with via a chat interface. The service could be any number of things, ranging from functional to fun, and it could live in any major chat product (Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages, etc.).", "\u201cMany businesses already have phone trees and they do work though most users get grumpy using them. Text based response trees are much easier and faster and that is what I expect a lot of early bot interactions to be. Sometimes with ability to chat with a live person.\u201d \u2014 Josh Elman, Partner at Greylock", "If you haven\u2019t wrapped your head around it yet, don\u2019t worry. Here\u2019s an example to help you visualize a chatbot.", "If you wanted to buy shoes from Nordstrom online, you would go to their website, look around until you find the shoes you wanted, and then you would purchase them.", "If Nordstrom makes a bot, which I\u2019m sure they will, you would simply be able to message Nordstrom on Facebook. It would ask you what you\u2019re looking for and you would simply\u2026 tell it.", "Instead of browsing a website, you will have a conversation with the Nordstrom bot, mirroring the type of experience you would get when you go into the retail store.", "Watch this video from Facebook\u2019s recent F8 conference (where they make their major announcements). At the 7:30 mark, David Marcus, the Vice President of Messaging Products at Facebook, explains what it looks like to buy shoes in a Facebook Messenger bot.", "Buying shoes isn\u2019t the only thing chatbots can be used for. Here are a couple of other examples:", "See? With bots, the possibilities are endless. You can build anything imaginable, and I encourage you to do just that.", "But why make a bot? Sure, it looks cool, it\u2019s using some super advanced technology, but why should someone spend their time and energy on it?", "It\u2019s a huge opportunity. HUGE. Scroll down and I\u2019ll explain.", "You are probably wondering \u201cWhy does anyone care about chatbots?

I\u2019ll tell you why people care about chatbots.", "It\u2019s because for the first time ever people are using messenger apps more than they are using social networks.", "Let that sink in for a second.", "People are using messenger apps more than they are using social networks.", "\u201cPeople are now spending more time in messaging apps than in social media and that is a huge turning point. Messaging apps are the platforms of the future and bots will be how their users access all sorts of services.\u201d \u2014 Peter Rojas, Entrepreneur in Residence at Betaworks", "So, logically, if you want to build a business online, you want to build where the people are. That place is now inside messenger apps.", "\u201cMajor shifts on large platforms should be seen as an opportunities for distribution. That said, we need to be careful not to judge the very early prototypes too harshly as the platforms are far from complete. I believe Facebook\u2019s recent launch is the beginning of a new application platform for micro application experiences. The fundamental idea is that customers will interact with just enough UI, whether conversational and/or widgets, to be delighted by a service/brand with immediate access to a rich profile and without the complexities of installing a native app, all fueled by mature advertising products. It\u2019s potentially a massive opportunity.\u201d \u2014 Aaron Batalion, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners", "This is why chatbots are such a big deal. It\u2019s potentially a huge business opportunity for anyone willing to jump headfirst and build something people want.", "\u201cThere is hope that consumers will be keen on experimenting with bots to make things happen for them. It used to be like that in the mobile app world 4+ years ago. When somebody told you back then\u2026 \u2018I have built an app for X\u2019\u2026 You most likely would give it a try. Now, nobody does this. It is probably too late to build an app company as an indie developer. But with bots\u2026 consumers\u2019 attention spans are hopefully going to be wide open/receptive again!\u201d \u2014 Niko Bonatsos, Managing Director at General Catalyst", "But, how do these bots work? How do they know how to talk to people and answer questions? Isn\u2019t that artificial intelligence and isn\u2019t that insanely hard to do?", "Yes, you are correct, it is artificial intelligence, but it\u2019s something that you can totally do yourself.", "There are two types of chatbots, one functions based on a set of rules, and the other more advanced version uses machine learning.", "Chatbot that functions based on rules:", "Chatbot that functions using machine learning:", "\u201cBeware though, bots have the illusion of simplicity on the front end but there are many hurdles to overcome to create a great experience. So much work to be done. Analytics, flow optimization, keeping up with ever changing platforms that have no standard. For deeper integrations and real commerce like Assist powers, you have error checking, integrations to APIs, routing and escalation to live human support, understanding NLP, no back buttons, no home button, etc etc. We have to unlearn everything we learned the past 20 years to create an amazing experience in this new browser.\u201d \u2014 Shane Mac, CEO of Assist", "Bots are created with a purpose. A store will likely want to create a bot that helps you purchase something, where someone like Comcast might create a bot that can answer customer support questions.", "\u201cMessaging is where we spend a ton of our time and expect to communicate. It is ridiculous we still have to call most businesses.\u201d \u2014 Josh Elman, Partner at Greylock", "You start to interact with a chatbot by sending it a message. Click here to try sending a message to the CNN chatbot on Facebook.", "So, if these bots use artificial intelligence to make them work well\u2026 isn\u2019t that really hard to do? Don\u2019t I need to be an expert at artificial intelligence to be able to build something that has artificial intelligence?", "Short answer? No, you don\u2019t have to be an expert at artificial intelligence to create an awesome chatbot that has artificial intelligence. Just make sure to not over promise on your application\u2019s abilities. If you can\u2019t make the product good with artificial intelligence right now, it might be best to not put it in yet.", "\u201cEveryone going after AI to try make this scale seems a little too soon. Texting to a computer that doesn\u2019t understand many things you are saying can be very aggravating. So be careful early not to over promise, and give users guard rails\u201d \u2014 Josh Elman, Partner at Greylock", "However, over the past decade quite a bit of advancements have been made in the area of artificial intelligence, so much in fact that anyone who knows how to code can incorporate some level of artificial intelligence into their products.", "How do you build artificial intelligence into your bot? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you covered, I\u2019ll tell you how to do it in the next section of this post.", "Building a chatbot can sound daunting, but it\u2019s totally doable. You\u2019ll be creating an artificial intelligence powered chatting machine in no time (or, of course, you can always build a basic chat bot that doesn\u2019t have a fancy AI brain and strictly follows rules).", "\u201cThe difficulty in building a chatbot is less a technical one and more an issue of user experience. The most successful bots will be the ones that users want to come back to regularly and that provide consistent value.\u201d \u2014 Matt Hartman, Director of Seed Investments at Betaworks", "You will need to figure out what problem you are going to solve with your bot, choose which platform your bot will live on (Facebook, Slack, etc), set up a server to run your bot from, and choose which service you will use to build your bot.", "\u201cWe believe that you don\u2019t need to know how to program to build a bot, that\u2019s what inspired us at Chatfuel a year ago when we started bot builder. We noticed bots becoming hyper-local, i.e. a bot for a soccer team to keep in touch with fans or a small art community bot. Bots are efficient and when you let anyone create them easily magic happens.\u201d \u2014 Dmitrii Dumik, Founder of Chatfuel", "Here are a ton of resources to get you started.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to balance that urge to just dogpile the latest thing when you\u2019re feeling like there\u2019s a land grab or gold rush about to happen all around you and that you might get left behind. But in the end quality wins out. Everyone will be better off if there\u2019s laser focus on building great bot products that are meaningfully differentiated.\u201d \u2014 Ryan Block, Cofounder of Begin.com", "Don\u2019t want to build your own?", "Now that you\u2019ve got your chatbot and artificial intelligence resources, maybe it\u2019s time you met other people who are also interested in chatbots.", "Chatbots have been around for decades, but because of the recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there is a big opportunity for people to create bots that are better, faster, and stronger.", "If you\u2019re reading this, you probably fall into one of these categories:", "Wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if you had a place to meet, learn, and share information with other people interested in chatbots?
