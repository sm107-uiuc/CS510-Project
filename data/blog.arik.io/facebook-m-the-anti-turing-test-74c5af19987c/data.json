M\u2019s capabilities far exceed those of any competing AI. Where some AIs would be hard-pressed to tell you the weather conditions for more than one location (god forbid you go on a trip), M will tell you the weather forecast for every point on your route at the time you\u2019re expected to get there, and also provide you with convenient gas station suggestions, account for traffic in its estimations, and provide you with options for food and entertainment at your destination.", "As many people have pointed out, there have been press releases stating that M is human-aided. However, the point of this article is not to figure out whether or not there are humans behind it, but to indisputably prove it.", "When communicating with M, it insists it\u2019s an AI, and that it lives right inside Messenger. However, its non-instantaneous nature and the sheer unlimited complexity of tasks it can handle suggest otherwise. The opinion is split as to whether or not it\u2019s a real AI, and there seems to be no way of proving its nature one way or the other.", "The biggest issue with trying to prove whether or not M is an AI is that, contrary to other AIs that pretend to be human, M insists it\u2019s an AI. Thus, what we would be testing for is humans pretending to be an AI, which is much harder to test than the other way round, because it\u2019s much easier for humans to pretend to be an AI than for an AI to pretend to be a human. In this situation, a Turing test is futile, because M\u2019s objective is precisely to not pass a Turing test. So what we want to prove is not the limitations of the AI, but the limitlessness of the (alleged) humans behind it. What we need therefore is a different test. An \u201cAnti-Turing\u201d test, if you will.", "As it happens, I did find a way of proving M\u2019s nature. But good storytelling mandates that first, I describe my laborious path to the result, and the inconclusive experiments I had to conduct before I finally got a definitive answer.", "When I first got M, our conversation started like this:", "\u201cI use artificial intelligence, but people help train me,\u201d was M\u2019s response to my question regarding its nature. That can mean many things, because using AI is not the same as being a completely autonomous AI. So I kept bugging it about its nature.", "Some people opined that what M refers to as AI is that there are people typing out all the responses, but the tool that helps them do that is based on machine learning. However, directly asking about that didn\u2019t yield any new insights.", "M\u2019s assertiveness regarding its nature is set in stone. Nonetheless, there were some minor tells that arguably betrayed the underlying human nature of this chatbot. To test its limit, I have asked it to perform a set of complicated tasks for me that no other AI out there could pull off.", "I told it where I work, and then slightly modified my request.", "The most noteworthy aspect of this reply is that \u201cGoogle Maps\u201d wasn\u2019t capitalized, suggesting that maybe, just maybe, a human typed it out in a hurry. And indeed, even with some other requests, its responses have proven not to be as impeccable as the ones we\u2019re used to from Siri. For instance, when I asked it to find some nice wallpapers for me taken from the Berkeley stadium depicting the Bay Area at night, preferably with the Bay Bridge, the Transamerica Pyramid, and the Sather Tower being in the picture, M did manage to find some very nice wallpapers for me, but it said that it couldn\u2019t find any with the Campanile. As consolation, though, it said it would let me know if it found any that fit my criteria more precisely:", "Now, the first issue with the above response is that the wallpapers it sent me did have the Transamerica Pyramid, and M knew they did. What they didn\u2019t have was the Sather Tower, so why is it saying it\u2019s going to let me know about pictures with the Transamerica Pyramid?", "The second issue is that it\u2019s called the \u201cTransamerica Pyramid,\u201d not the \u201cTransamerican Pyramid.\u201d And lastly, note the two \u201cwith\u201ds and the \u201cI\u2019l\u201d. It has made two typos! And indeed, that was not the only time it did:", "While a lot of humans struggle with the distinction between \u201cits\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s,\u201d for an AI, that should not have been an issue. Even so, it might have been trained wrong, so as such, these lapses are not sufficiently conclusive. Even the delayed responses I mentioned earlier could have been deliberate, including the fact that there\u2019s a typing indicator shown when M is preparing a response, rather than sending the whole string instantaneously as a regular AI would. The results and indications so far didn\u2019t satisfy me, so I was still looking for a way to prove that there are real humans behind M. Just how could I make them come out, make them show themselves?", "As it happens, the answer came to me at a time when I wasn\u2019t actively looking for it. The movie in Cupertino ended rather late, and I asked M whether there was any place I could get dinner at afterwards that would still be open at that time. There were only two places open, but I wasn\u2019t sure whether their kitchen would still be open, too. Thus, I asked M whether it could call them and figure that out. And indeed, it said it could!", "So I asked M whether it could call my friends (nope). Whether it could call me (nope). Apparently, it could only call businesses for me, but not individuals. So what do I do? I make up a business and ask M to call it.", "So M asked me for the phone number, and I simply gave it mine. About five minutes later, I receive a call with no caller ID. When I pick up, I hear some rumbling noises in the background, say \u201chello,\u201d and then the other end hangs up. Immediately afterward, the following exchange happens with M:", "Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have a landline phone number, so I was a bit disappointed that not even this experiment could prove M\u2019s nature.", "A few days later, I had to get some work done during the weekend, and while at the office, I realized that the company did have one. The experiment had to be repeated!", "About three minutes later, we get a phone call in the conference room. When I pick up, a distinctively human, female voice says, \u201cHello?\u201d As it happens, I had accidentally set the phone to mute before that, so she didn\u2019t hear me saying the company name. Still, the voice was most definitely human. And because the reader shouldn\u2019t be taking me at face value, I made a recording of that whole encounter:", "Immediately afterward, M sends a reply.", "What\u2019s more, it appears to me that they forgot to block the caller ID for that particular call, because I got to see the phone number they were calling from.", "So there, very clearly, M was calling from +1 (650) 796\u20132402. As can be seen on the photo, the automatic reverse-lookup matched that number to Facebook. Thus, here we are. We have definitive proof that M is powered by humans. The next question is: Is it only humans, or is there at least some AI-driven component behind it? As to this problem, I\u2019ll leave it as a homework assignment for the reader to figure out. In the meantime, I shall enjoy having my own free personal (human) assistant."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
