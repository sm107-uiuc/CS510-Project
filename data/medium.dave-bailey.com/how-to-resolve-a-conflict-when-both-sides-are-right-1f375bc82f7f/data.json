If everyone has the same idea, chances are it\u2019s obvious and not very insightful.", "But conflict is hard. Especially in a startup, where you\u2019re sandwiched between huge opportunity and certain death.", "There are lots of different reasons for conflict at work. It can result from differing points of view; for example, engineering and sales might see a problem in different contexts. In other cases, it might result from personality clashes.", "Conflicts sometimes resolve themselves peacefully, but I\u2019m going to offer some advice for teams that want to better manage conflict and use it to drive more robust solutions and decisions. These are particularly useful for those times when conflicts are persistent, unproductive, or have reached a stalemate.", "When I wrote about the nonviolent communication framework last year, I never imagined it would resonate with so many people. NVC is a versatile approach to resolving all sorts of conflicts.", "We often think of conflicts as interpersonal but any difference of opinion can cause it. For example, your lead engineer might want to rebuild your software, while your sales directors want a new feature urgently. Or one co-founder might want to take the business in a particular direction while another prefers a different strategy.", "At the core of NVC is a straightforward communication pattern: When [observation], I feel [emotion] because I need [universal need]. Would you be able to [request]?", "The process of filling in the blanks is extremely insightful. It forces you to get specific, to check in with your emotions, and to clarify what\u2019s really important. It can be transformational.", "However, there are some drawbacks if you want to use it in a business setting.", "Whether you\u2019re new to NVC or a seasoned practitioner, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s not perfect. The most obvious issue is that the format is pretty awkward.", "Imagine saying this to a colleague:", "\u2018When you didn\u2019t bring me a cup of coffee, I felt disappointed because I have a need for inclusion. Please, could you get me a coffee next time?", "When you apply the format to the letter, it usually sounds over-prepared and clunky. It\u2019s not how people normally speak so it can come off as patronising.", "The second issue is clear from the moment you\u2019ve said your piece. Most people haven\u2019t done NVC training. Their natural tendency is to respond judgmentally and defend their position, not to self-empathise and investigate.", "Even when everyone around a table is familiar with the framework, you still need monk-like self-awareness to spit out the formula quickly. NVC requires introspection, and introspection requires space and time \u2014 two things you usually don\u2019t have in a conflict.", "The NVC communication format is a great tool for self-reflection and clarity. However, the key to using NVC in practice is to apply its principles, not necessarily it\u2019s format. NVC is best thought of as a problem-solving methodology that focuses on uncovering win-win solutions.", "Here are four principles to help you get to the heart of a conflict and find a better outcome for the team \u2014 and the business.", "Our minds are built to defend our own opinions. First, we make intuitive judgements in a fraction of a second. Then our rational brain finds logical reasons to justify those judgements. Once we find enough reasons, we conclude that we\u2019re right and everyone else is wrong.", "The intuitive approach is to debate the ideas. Both sides present a persuasive case and eventually, the best idea will triumph. But this approach has some serious flaws. What if the best idea hasn\u2019t been found? Who is supposed to judge the debate? And who says the best debater has the best idea? After all, a great lawyer can represent a guilty criminal and still win.", "Starting with the specifics requires an ability to observe the situation without judgement. This doesn\u2019t come naturally to us as a species. Ancient humans who bypassed snap judgement were promptly eaten by lions, or poisoned by attractive but foul-tasting plants.", "To uncover the specifics, ask questions such as:", "Most people need a few attempts to get past their judgements, so when they struggle to observe, exercise a little patience and encouragement.", "The idea of sharing emotions might sound more appropriate for a therapy session than a problem-solving session. Some people believe emotions have no place at work, and you should focus on logic instead. Aren\u2019t emotions the root cause of most bad decisions?", "Well, yes, emotions can lead to poor decision-making. This is because our emotions drive our gut decisions, and our gut decisions drive our reasoning.", "\u2018Reasoning was not designed to pursue the truth. Reasoning was designed by evolution to help us win arguments\u2019 \u2014 Jonathan Haidt", "Given that emotions are in the driving seat, all the more reason to get them out in the open.", "Many of us find it hard to connect with, and talk about, our feelings. To help your team tap into their emotions, ask them curious questions like:", "Most people\u2019s emotional literacy is limited to \u2018happy, sad, and pissed off\u2019, so here\u2019s a handy list of feelings that might make it easier.", "Creating a place where people can be vulnerable without fear of abuse is critical for any form of conflict resolution. Vulnerability is the source of connection.", "Have you ever noticed that when you argue with someone smart, if you manage to debunk their initial reasoning, they just shift to a new, logical-sounding reason?", "Reasons are like a salamander\u2019s legs \u2014 if you cut one off, another grows in its place.", "When you\u2019re dealing with a salamander, you need to get to the heart. Forget about reasoning and focus on what\u2019s causing the emotions. According to NVC, every negative emotion is the result of an unmet, universal need.", "By universal, we mean a need that everybody has. Here\u2019s a list so you get the gist:", "Let\u2019s illustrate this with a concrete example.", "Suppose product development has slowed down, reported bugs have increased 30% since last month, and sprint velocity is down by 40%. Your engineer is feeling desperately unhappy and is terrified of building new features because of the risk to the system as a whole.", "They want to stop building new features and refactor some of the system architecture. But what do you think their unmet universal need is here?", "I\u2019d guess that their unmet needs are fun and safety. In order words, if there were an option that didn\u2019t impact the system and sounded pretty interesting to work on, it would probably be an appealing one for the engineer.", "But it doesn\u2019t matter what I think, only how the engineer feels. Validate your assumptions with questions like:", "You know you\u2019ve uncovered the unmet needs when the answer becomes a resounding \u2018Yes!\u2019", "After you\u2019ve identified the emotions and needs of all parties, you\u2019re ready for the ninja move.", "This is the secret to finding a win-win scenario faster. NVC assumes that our underlying needs are never in conflict; it\u2019s only the strategies we pursue to meet those needs that clash. The idea is to look for new strategies that meet everyone\u2019s needs.", "Let\u2019s continue with our example of the engineer. Suppose the sales director has a feature request from a big prospect that could mean the difference between closing the deal and losing it.", "The engineer and the sales director meet to discuss it. And things get tense.", "The sales director explains that the prospect said, \u2018If you had a reporting dashboard, I\u2019d close the deal right now.\u2019 The director is concerned that they\u2019ll miss out on the deal without this feature, and feels altogether rather helpless.", "I\u2019d guess that the unmet needs are support and independence. If there was a solution that the sales director could pursue independently, while feeling supported by the business, they\u2019d probably be quite happy.", "What possible solutions are safe and fun for engineering, and give the sales director more independence and support?", "This question clarifies the conditions that, if met, would meet everyone\u2019s needs. It takes the focus away from defending existing ideas to solving a new problem. And in my experience, great people love a juicy new problem to solve.", "What ideas would you come up with for this scenario? What other questions would you ask the engineer and sales director, to uncover new, creative solutions?", "Next time you encounter a difference of opinion, whether on your team, in a negotiation, or even in politics, ask yourself what emotions and universal needs are playing out on both sides.", "How would you reframe the issue to clarify what a win-win solution looks like? And what creative solutions might emerge as bright people put their minds to this new problem?", "My guess is that more of the planet\u2019s problems could be resolved faster. And in an increasingly polarised world, it\u2019s worth a shot.", "Hi, I\u2019m Dave Bailey and I coach tech CEOs from Series A to pre-IPO.
