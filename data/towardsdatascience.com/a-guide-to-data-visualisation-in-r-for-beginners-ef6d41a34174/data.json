If the results of an analysis are not visualized properly, they will not be communicated effectively to the desired audience.", "In this tutorial, we will learn how to analyze and display data using R statistical language. We will begin with basic plots and move on to more advanced ones later in the article.", "A basic familiarity with R and its syntax will get you started easily.", "R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is also extremely flexible and easy to use when it comes to creating visualisations. One of its capabilities is to produce good-quality plots with minimum codes.", "We shall briefly go over the steps required to install R :", "Alternatively, you can use RStudio over the base R GUI.", "After R has been downloaded and installed, you can launch it from your Applications folder(MacOS) or Desktop Icon(Windows). Just type in the following commands to check if R has been installed properly and running.", "Datasets can either be built-in or can be loaded from external sources in R.", "To load the built-in dataset into the R type the following command in the console:", "Now, load the file with the help of the read command. In this case, data is in the form of a CSV file named airquality.csv which can be downloaded from here", "The above code reads the file airquality.csv into a data frame airquality. Header=TRUE specifies that the data includes a header and sep=\u201d,\u201d specifies that the values in data are separated by commas.", "Once the data has been loaded into the workspace, it is time to explore it to get an idea about its structure.", "We can see at a glance the mean, median, max and the quartile values of the variables.", "The graphics package is used for plotting base graphs like scatter plot, box plot etc. A complete list of functions with help pages can be obtained by typing : library(help = \"graphics\").", "We get a scatter/dot plot here wherein each dot represents the value of the Ozone in mean parts per billion.", "The plot shows that Wind and Ozone values have a somewhat negative correlation.", "We get a matrix of scatterplots which is a correlation matrix of all the columns. The plot above instantly shows that:", "We can quickly discover the relationship between variables by merely looking at the plots drawn between them.", "We can easily style our charts by playing with the arguments of the plot() function.", "The plot function has an argument called typewhich can take in values like p: points, l: lines,b: both etc. This decides the shape of the output graph.", "You can read more about the plot() command by typing ?plot() in the console.", "We can also label the X and the Y axis and give a title to our plot. Additionally, we also have the option of giving color to the plot.", "In a bar plot, data is represented in the form of rectangular bars and the length of the bar is proportional to the value of the variable or column in the dataset. Both horizontal, as well as a vertical bar chart, can be generated by tweaking the horiz parameter.", "A histogram is quite similar to a bar chart except that it groups values into continuous ranges. A histogram represents the frequencies of values of a variable bucketed into ranges.", "We get a histogram of the Solar.R values. By giving an appropriate value for the color argument, we can obtain a coloured histogram as well.", "We have seen how the summary() command in R can display the descriptive statistics for every variable in the dataset. Boxplot does the same albeit graphically in the form of quartiles. It is again very straightforward to plot a boxplot in R.", "There is a very interesting feature in R which enables us to plot multiple charts at once. This comes in very handy during the EDA since the need to plot multiple graphs one by one is eliminated.For drawing a grid, the first argument should specify certain attributes like the margin of the grid(mar), no of rows and columns(mfrow), whether a border is to be included(bty) and position of the labels(las: 1 for horizontal, las: 0 for vertical).", "Note: You can use function documentation to know more about a given function by typing ?plot name. Also, example(plot) runs the demo of the plot directly in the console.", "R comes equipped with sophisticated visualisation libraries having great capabilities. Let us have a closer look at some of the commonly used ones.", "In this section, we will use the built-in mtcars dataset to show the uses of the various libraries. This dataset has been extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine.", "Lattice package is essentially an improvement upon the R Graphics package and is used to visualize multivariate data. Lattice enables the use of trellis graphs. Trellis graphs exhibit the relationship between variables which are dependent on one or more variables. Let us start by installing and loading the package.", "The attach function attaches the database to the R search path so the objects in the database can be accessed by simply giving their names. (See ?attach() for more details)", "Before proceeding with the working of the lattice package, let us do a little pre-processing of the data. There are two columns in our mtcars dataset namely gear and cyl which are categorical in nature. We need to factorize them to make them more meaningful.", "Note: since we have attached the dataset mtcars, we do not need to specify mtcars$gear or mtcars$cyl.", "Now let us see how we can use the lattice package to create some basic plots in R.", "It is very straightforward to use the lattice library. One simply needs to plug in the columns for which the plot is desired.", "The ggplot2 package is one of the most widely used visualisation packages in R. It enables the users to create sophisticated visualisations with little code using the Grammar of Graphics. The Grammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers.", "The popularity of ggplot2 has increased tremendously in recent years since it makes it possible to create graphs that contain both univariate and multivariate data in a very simple manner.", "Let us create a few plots to understand the capability of ggplot2", "geom_point() is used to create scatterplots and geom can have many variations like geom_jitter() ,geom_count()etc", "We know that the dataset mtcars consists of certain variables which are in the form of factors. We can utilise this property to split our dataset", "The color parameter is used to differentiate between different factor level of the cyl variable.", "Another useful feature of ggplot2 is that it can be styled according to the size of the attributes.", "In the above example, the value of qsec indicates the acceleration which decides the size of the points.", "With ggplot2, one can also create unique and interesting shapes by layering multiple points of different sizes", "Plotly is an R package that creates interactive web-based graphs via the open source JavaScript graphing library plotly.js. It can easily translate the \u2018ggplot2\u2019 graphs to web-based versions also.", "Let us now see how we can utilise plotly to create interactive visualisations. We will be working with the same mtcars dataset that used in the lattice graphs demonstration.", "The plot above can also be exported in form of a web page to keep its interactiveness intact.", "The scatter plot can be styled by giving in the appropriate color codes.", "It is also possible to plot markers and lines in the same graph, with plotly. Here we will create an arbitrary data frame to showcase this feature.", "Although this is not a complete list of the packages used for visualisation in R, these should be enough to get you started.", "Geographic data (Geo data) relates to the location-based data. It primarily deals with describing objects with respect to their relationship in space. The data is usually stored in the form of coordinates. It makes more sense to be able to see a state or a country in the form of a map as it gives a more realistic overview. In the section below, we will briefly outline the capabilities of R in terms of geographical data visualisation.", "We will be working with a sample superstore dataset of the ABC company. The dataset consists of locations of their stores in the US. Let\u2019s load in the data and check out its columns.", "We will create a crude map by simply the Latitude and the Longitude column.", "The output isn\u2019t an exact map but it does give a faint outline of the US boundary.", "maps package is very useful and pretty straightforward when it comes to plotting the geographical data.", "Using the map() function to plot a base map of the US", "Building a point map on top of the base map using symbols() function", "The commands used with the map function are kind of self-explanatory. However, you can read more about it on their documentation page.", "The geographical data visualisation holds a lot of importance where the data consists of locations. One can easily visualise the exact places and areas and convey a better picture.", "We have seen how simple and easy to start visualisation using R. One can either opt to create visualisations from scratch or use the pre-built packages.
