You\u2019ve come to the right place.", "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the most basic Git commands \u2014 the ones that you will need to know most of the time when working with Git. More specifically, here you\u2019ll learn how to create a Git repository for your project and how to use it to document all future changes in that project. And completing this tutorial should take less than fifteen minutes of your time, assuming that you won\u2019t have any problems with the installation process (which I hope most people won\u2019t). So let\u2019s get right into it.", "In a nutshell, Git is an open-source Version Control System that allows you to keep track of your project changes over time. For instance, with Git you can easily check what was the state of each file in the project at a given time, and even revert it to that state if you want to. It also makes it much easier to manage projects in which multiple people are working simultaneously, each one on their own computers.", "Git is not the only Version Control System available (other examples: SVN, CVS, Mercurial), but it\u2019s the most used one nowadays. If you are a software developer, web designer, data scientist, or work on basically any other kind of project involving text files, learning how to use Git will surely be a very valuable skill for you.", "In this tutorial, we\u2019ll be running Git commands from the command-line terminal (also known as command prompt in Windows), so it can be helpful if you already have some experience with using the terminal. But don\u2019t worry if you have never used it before \u2014 you will still be able to follow this tutorial.", "First, let\u2019s open a command-line terminal on your computer. Here are some quick ways to do it depending on your operating system:", "We\u2019ll start by checking if you already have Git installed on your computer \u2014 and if it isn\u2019t, we\u2019ll install it. Type git --version on the terminal and press enter. If Git is installed, you\u2019ll see the currently installed version, as in the screenshot below. If you already have Git, you may skip directly to the next section, \u201cSetting up your data\u201d.", "If you get something like git: command not found, then you will need to install Git. On MacOS, running git --version may already prompt some installation instructions, and you will just need to follow them. If that\u2019s not your case, follow the instructions below, depending on your operating system:", "After installation, you need to configure your name and e-mail \u2014 they will be used to identify you in your \u201ccommits\u201d (I\u2019ll explain what they are later). Do it by running these two commands in the terminal with your personal data:", "That\u2019s it. Now you are ready to start using Git!", "While Git is mostly used by programmers, it can actually be used for any project with one or more computer files. In this tutorial, you will use Git to manage a project containing two simple text files: one with a shopping list and another with a to-do list. The commands you\u2019ll use to manage this project are exactly the same as what you would use for a programming project.", "Let\u2019s start by creating the project directory and two text files in it. Create a directory named my_lists somewhere in your hard drive and create two text files inside it, with the following content:", "This will be our project\u2019s initial state.", "Using the terminal, navigate to my_lists, the directory you\u2019ve just created. You can do that with the command cd. If you don\u2019t know how to do navigate using the terminal, here are some instructions: On Windows / On Linux or MacOS. After navigating to my_lists, if you run ls (on Linux/MacOS) or dir (on Windows), you should be able to see the two files you created.", "Now, run git init to make your project directory officially a Git repository. After that, you can run git status from inside that directory at any moment to check what\u2019s happening within it. If you do it now, you will see that your repository has \u201cno commits yet\u201d and that the two files are marked as \u201cuntracked\u201d:", "To make those files start being tracked by Git, you need to \u201cadd\u201d them to the repository. You will use the command git add for that. Any of these options will do the trick:", "After adding the files, run git status again and you should see something like this:", "Now the two files are in what is called the \u201cstaging area\u201d. This means that those files will be included in the next commit you make.", "In Git, a commit is a snapshot of the project state at a given time. Think of it as a version of the project that will be stored forever, such that in the future it will be easy for you to see what has changed since then, and you\u2019ll even be able to revert the project back to that state if you want. Every time you make important changes in your project you should create a new commit, so that your work gets registered in the project\u2019s history.", "After adding the two files to the staging area, you can create your first commit with the command git commit -m \"Your commit message\" . Be sure to always write a meaningful commit message describing what has changed, because that message will be seen by anyone checking the project history.", "After committing, run git log. This will show your commit history. At this point, you should only have one commit in the log, like this:", "Note: you can also run the command git commit without the -m option \u2014 this will open a text editor that will ask you to input a commit message. But be careful, because depending on your system this may open a command-line text editor like vim, which can be hard to exit if you don\u2019t know how to use it. You can also change the default text editor with the command git config --global core.editor <editor> .", "After creating a Git repository for your project, the next step is to use it to document future changes. So let\u2019s get back to our example: suppose that you\u2019ve just found out about a major virus outbreak happening in your city and that forced you to modify your shopping and to-do lists, as shown below:", "As before, you can check the repository\u2019s current state with the command git status. This will show that Git has detected changes in both files:", "But you can also have more details on what has changed since your last commit with git diff. This will show all that has changed in all files, line-by-line:", "Usually, unchanged lines are printed white, while new lines are green, and deleted lines are red. Note that lines that have been modified actually show up as if the old version had been deleted and a new line had been added.", "To create a new commit with those changes, the process is the same as what you did to create the first commit: you\u2019ll first use git add and then git commit.", "While you could create a single commit for the changes in the two files, let\u2019s create one commit for each file. First, run git add shopping_list.txt to add this file to the staging area. After that, you can check which changes have been added to the staging area with git diff --staged. This command will show exactly which changes will be committed if you run git commit now.", "If everything is as expected, now create a new commit with those staged changes by running git commit, just like you did when creating your first commit. Again, make sure to include a meaningful commit message. After that, as an exercise, you can create a third commit with the changes in the file list.txt.", "If you\u2019ve done everything correctly, you now have three commits in your repository. You can check that with git log, and you should see something like this:", "That\u2019s it. Now you know how to create a Git repository for your project and how to make new commits for all your future changes. In general, most of the time you work with Git you will be using these few commands that you\u2019ve just learned.", "Of course, there\u2019s a lot more to Git than that \u2014 the goal of this tutorial was only to get you started with the basic workflow described above. Here is a list of a few other things you can do with Git (including links with further details):", "In general, you can find very helpful advice on how to use Git in online forums like StackOverflow.
