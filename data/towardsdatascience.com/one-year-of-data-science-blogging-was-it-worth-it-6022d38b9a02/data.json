Here I am, writing my 115th article \u2014 but this is the first one focused on data science soft skills. So, was it all worth it? That\u2019s what this article aims to uncover, among other things.", "Here\u2019s a quick summary \u2014 yes, blogging about data science is definitely worth it. Data science is hot right now, and new tools/libraries are released daily, so you can never run out of things to write about. For a newcomer, I think the most interesting statistic is the earning potential \u2014 so let\u2019s get that out of the way.", "Here are my average earnings for the past year (blogging only):", "Is that much? In the US, probably not. In my country (Croatia), that\u2019s about 2 average monthly salaries. So yeah, making money blogging sounds much easier for us outside the United States, if we don\u2019t factor in the difficulties of sounding fluent in a foreign language.", "Here are some other stats of mine you might find interesting:", "But it\u2019s not all about the money. I know it\u2019s easy for me to say, but blogging isn\u2019t a sure deal most of the time. In some months my articles get 200k+ views, and on other months I struggle to get half of that. Blogging is not your average 9\u20135, as there\u2019s no guarantee on how much you\u2019ll earn.", "Also, this uncertainty won\u2019t get you out of the bed at 5 AM, so money alone isn\u2019t that strong of a factor. Below I\u2019ll list and explain both the good and bad sides of committing to blogging as your side hustle, and also how to get started.", "Let\u2019s talk about good things first \u2014 as those outweigh the bad things by a large margin.", "Things don\u2019t get much better than knowing you\u2019ve helped someone with your writing \u2014 code in this case \u2014 to solve tasks in a more simple or efficient way. Receiving positive feedback is something that happens a lot when you publish good content \u2014 both through the comment section and social media.", "The latter happens more often, I have to admit, at least once a week in my case. There\u2019s always someone on LinkedIn telling me how article X helped them to solve a problem, and after writing 100+ articles that\u2019s just what I need to keep the motivation levels up.", "I\u2019ve read in many places that blogging is an essential tool for advancing your career and I can\u2019t agree more. There are many reasons why, let me list a few:", "The latter one is very important, as it opens up new opportunities \u2014 and good opportunities \u2014 because if an employer likes your writing there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be respected in the company from day one.", "If you\u2019ve been in data science for more than a month you know that getting a job isn\u2019t that easy, as most positions are senior. That\u2019s where blogging can give you the edge, even if you don\u2019t have enough work experience.", "Besides regular job offers, every here and now a proposal for a side gig arrives \u2014 which just might be something you prefer if you intend to make blogging a daily job.", "For every good thing, there\u2019s a bad thing, and blogging is not an exception. It\u2019s up to you to decide how much these affect you, just be prepared that not everyone will like what you have to say.", "Every now and then there\u2019s someone in the comment section who feels the need to correct my grammar.", "Sure, you should always spell check your writing, but as most of us are writing in a foreign language, occasional typos are inevitable. That\u2019s perfectly fine, as long as there aren\u2019t too many of them in a single piece.", "Be prepared \u2014 there\u2019s always a sad person somewhere with nothing else to do just waiting for the opportunity like this. I don\u2019t know why though, as if a single misplaced letter makes your piece unreadable. I\u2019ve learned to ignore them, and that\u2019s the best thing you can do.", "It\u2019s not enough to state something once \u2014 the key idea should be repeated or rephrased multiple times through the article. This is not that common in simple tutorial-based data science articles, but is quite common in opinion pieces.", "Well, many times I\u2019ve been making bold assumptions in the introduction section and prooving those assumptions later on. There\u2019s always someone who won\u2019t read the entire piece but will jump to the comment section asking questions that were answered in the article, just a couple of paragraphs below.", "Ignoring those people is a good thing to do, as sometimes there\u2019s just too many of them to fight with. Also, repeat the key idea multiple times through the article, as I\u2019ve already said.", "If you\u2019ve decided to give blogging a try \u2014 congratulations, you\u2019ve made a great decision. There are many great platforms out there, but Medium is the best place to start in my opinion, for multiple reasons:", "Also, writing for a large publication makes the curation process much faster (read the curation guidelines beforehand). I\u2019ve started by reading the Write for Towards Data Science article, checking their guidelines, and submitting my post via email.", "I think that writing for TDS should be the end-goal of any aspiring data science writer, as it is a well-established publication with tons of followers and monthly views.", "Don\u2019t get discouraged if they don\u2019t accept your piece \u2014 again, check their guidelines, and make sure your article is decent. You can always re-submit.", "I\u2019ve mentioned that Medium is a great place to start, and TDS is the place to start for any aspiring data scientist, but what if you want more freedom? That was the case for me a couple of months back, as I wanted to further diversify my income streams.", "I have to admit \u2014 creating YouTube videos is so time-consuming that I haven\u2019t committed to it 100% yet, but it\u2019s a great option to build a following and also earn a couple of bucks down the road.", "For the website, I\u2019ve chosen to build it with WordPress, as it\u2019s the easiest option. Still, I prefer Medium\u2019s post editor over that buggy little thing on WordPress.", "And that are 3 additional streams of income, just like that. Those will take years to build properly, but time will pass either way, so why don\u2019t make the best of it?", "To summarize \u2014 yes, you should start blogging about tech and data science as soon as possible. Here are the things you should remember:", "And that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s not as easy as it might look, but it\u2019s not that hard either. Also, there are so many topics to write about, at least in data science, so you shouldn\u2019t run out of ideas any time soon.", "Loved the article?
