This means there are only 4 free books as things stand. I\u2019ve been reading to see if there is something that can fill in, if you find something please send your suggestions so I may read through (It must be free please).", "Note: There are no affiliate links associated to any of my recommendations and I am in no agreement with any of the authors.", "This is an unusual book to start with! Not because it\u2019s controversial or anything, but simply because it is not directly about Data Science.", "Python is a popular language among Data Scientist (as well as R), and this book quite literally can take you to expert levels. The book describes the best practices to follow when programming in Python and if you read Data Scientist should know Software Engineering best practices, you\u2019d know this is more important than ever.", "More and more Data Science projects are being taken into production which creates a heavy demand on Data Scientist to have more end-to-end skills. This book is a great starter.", "You may download this book for free in the link below!", "Jake VanderPlas hit the nail on it\u2019s head with the naming of this book ; It\u2019s one of those \u201cNever throw this book away\u201d books.", "From NumPy, to Pandas, to Matplotlib and Machine Learning, Mr. VanderPlas gives a comprehensive overview for how we can face day-to-day challeneges such as manipulating, transforming, and cleaning data; visualizing various kinds of data; and using data to build statistical or machine learning models.", "The most Ideal, easy to read reference book!", "Note: It has been brought to my attention that this book is copyrighted, hence technically not making it free \u2014 See notes at the top of the page for more details.", "The explanations of concepts and coding examples are very intuitive and useful people that want to begin working on personal projects.", "In fact, in my opinion, I believe that after reading (or whilst you read) this book it is imperative that you go and build something with your new knowledge.", "It is a very practical book and you should most definitely take your time to answer the questions!", "To acquire this book please visit Amazon", "Personal Advice? Don\u2019t read this before bed! You want to read it when you have the most energy.", "This book is by far the most complex of all the books I\u2019ve suggested and also one that you will be referring back to very often. It dives deep into statistics and is written in quite a complicated manner since it\u2019s heavy on the Math behind many things we will encounter as a Data Scientist.", "I\u2019ve put this book here not to show off as if I am smart \u2014 I am not, but I can learn anything I want to, just like you! \u2014 but to set the standard. If we want to become top Data Scientist, we have to be willing to do things that most people aren\u2019t willing to do such as diving deep into the underpinnings of what holds our field together.", "Note: If you aren\u2019t from a Mathematical background, I highly recommend you gain some exposure to Machine Learning algorithms in simpler ways, such as implementing them, before trying to read this one.", "Don\u2019t fear the Math, Read The Elements of Statistical Learning.", "I am quite surprised this book isn\u2019t spoken of as much as some of the other books on this list. Andrew Ng, the Founder of Coursera and the instructor of some of the best courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, curated his most valuable lessons from working at companies such as Google and Baidu and put them on paper for us to leech from.", "In my personal opinion, after reading a book like ____ which provides us with a practical way of using machine learning, this book is the best book for a super-set. It is about being a great team member which includes being productive, efficient and a great team player (in-case it wasn\u2019t obvious).", "Note: To get the free book, you will be asked to fill in some details and it will be emailed to you upon completion.", "As agreed, I\u2019ve given you 4 free books that will take your Data Science skills to the next level. However, as a bonus I will provide __ more books that will take your Data Science skills to the next level \u2014 the only difference with th(ese)is book(s) is that they aren\u2019t free. But hey! There is nothing wrong with paying for good quality.", "If I had a girlfriend, she\u2019d probably be jealous of my admiration of Abhishek Thakur\u2019s work. One of the most hands on people I have ever come across, it makes sense why he is a Kaggle 4x Grandmaster!", "He has released a book that gives us an insight into his world and honestly, it has been one of the best reads \u2014 in terms of the amount of practical knowledge I derived from it \u2014 this year for me.", "Note: The book requires you have good knowledge of Machine Learning so get yourself up to scratch and pick up this bad boy!", "Purchase Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem on Amazon.", "I\u2019ve summed up books that have taken me to new heights. I have not read all the books surrounding the Data Science field so it\u2019s possible I\u2019ve missed a very important book.
