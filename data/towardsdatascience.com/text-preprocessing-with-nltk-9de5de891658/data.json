The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a manner that is valuable. To this end, many different models, libraries, and methods have been used to train machines to process text, understand it, make predictions based on it, and even generate new text. The first step to training a model is to obtain and preprocess the data. In this article, I will be going through some of the most common steps to be followed with almost any dataset before you can pass it as an input to a model.", "The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming language. It consists of the most common algorithms such as tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, sentiment analysis, topic segmentation, and named entity recognition, some of which we will be making use of in this article.", "First we import the required NLTK toolkit.", "Now we import the required dataset, which can be stored and accessed locally or online through a web URL. We can also make use of one of the corpus datasets provided by NLTK itself. In this article, we will be using a sample corpus dataset provided by NLTK.", "We print the corpus so that we can take a look at the text, study it, and make note of special characters and other changes that might need to be made before training a model based on it.", "We now look at how to extract some statistics from the corpus, such as the number of sentences, etc. using tokenization. These statistics can later be used to set some parameters while training a model. Tokenization is the process by which big quantities of text are divided into smaller parts called tokens. It is crucial to understand the pattern in the text in order to perform various NLP tasks. These tokens are very useful for finding such patterns. NLTK has a very important module tokenize which further comprises of sub-modules -", "Now that we have some numerical descriptors of the dataset, we can take a look at stemming and lemmatization.", "What is Stemming?Stemming is a kind of normalization for words. It is a technique where a set of words in a sentence are converted into a sequence to shorten its lookup. The words which have the same meaning but have some variation according to the context or sentence are normalized. Stemming is hence a way to find the root word from variations of the word.", "NLTK provides many inbuilt stemmers such as the Porter Stemmer, Snowball Stemmer and Lancaster Stemmer. We will look at the differences between the Porter Stemmer and the Snowball Stemmer.", "Once we create an instance of the stemmers, we write a function which takes each sentence of a corpus as input and returns the stemmed version of the word.", "We observe that the 2 stemmers are nearly the same, except in the case of some adverbs, where the Snowball Stemmer seems to give a better output closer to the root word.", "Some differences between the Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer are -", "As a general rule of thumb, the Snowball Stemmer stems words to a more accurate stem.", "What is Lemmatization?Lemmatization is the algorithmic process of finding the lemma of a word depending on their meaning. Lemmatization usually refers to the morphological analysis of words, which aims to remove inflectional endings. It helps in returning the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.", "The NLTK Lemmatization method is based on WordNet\u2019s built-in morph function.", "We write some code to import the WordNet Lemmatizer.", "Now that we have downloaded the wordnet, we can go ahead with lemmatization. Lemmatization can be done with or without a POS tag. A POS or part-of-speech tag assigns a tag to each word, and hence increases the accuracy of the lemma in the context of the dataset. For example, the word \u2018leaves\u2019 without a POS tag would get lemmatized to the word \u2018leaf\u2019, but with a verb tag, its lemma would become \u2018leave\u2019.", "Now that we have created instances of the lemmatizers, we write a function which takes as input each sentence of the corpus and returns its lemmatized version.", "In order to get results more in accordance with the context of the dataset, POS tags can be used with the lemmatizer.", "I hope this article was a good introduction to text preprocessing using stemming and lemmatization, and the associated differences between the two. Apart from these, there are many other tasks to be done before the corpus can be fed into a model to train, such as removal of newlines, special characters, conversion to lower case, etc. These will be covered in future articles. The full code used in this article can be accessed here.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Senior at IIT Kharagpur.
