We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "In a matter of only a few months, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread all over the world, leading to a de facto global pandemic. In many countries and regions, the confirmed cases are still growing exponentially. Following the reported confirmed case numbers daily, I am very concerned about how the virus is affecting people\u2019s life, the markets and global economy. Originally from Beijing, China, the memory about the 2003 SARS outbreak remain fresh. However, I was astonished to find out so many people in the West are so indifferent to the severity of COVID-19: \u201cIt\u2019s just a flu\u201d, \u201cit only affects old people\u201d, \u201cmedia propaganda\u201d, \u201cherd immunity\u201d\u2026 Those altitudes from the general public keep me up at nights.", "Perhaps some people are not impressed by the reported number of cases and think those most of the infected cases are far away on the other side of the world. I agree indeed looking at those confirmed case numbers are abstract. Here I made some plots to put those numbers into perspectives.", "Caveats: the model is only as good as the source of the data. All the confirmed cases of COVID-19 are provided by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), which compiled officially reported numbers from WHO and governments around the world. Without a doubt, there is under-reporting from most of the countries because of the lack of diagnostic tests, lack of transparency from the governments, and people who fail to take the test because of ignorance.", "All the figures below are based on confirmed COVID-19 cases as of March 15, 2020.", "Many visualizations (such as this) only show country-level statistics. From the region-level plot, we can separate different provinces of China and states in the US. Hubei, once the epicenter of COVID-19, along with almost all other provinces in China, has flattened in the number of confirmed cases. Iran, South Korea, Italy, along with many European countries surpassed many Guangdong, the 2nd hardest hit Chinese province.", "Next, let\u2019s look into how fast COVID-19 spread within regions. I fitted the cumulative confirmed cases with an exponential function, y=exp(a + bx). Here, I used ordinary least square (OLS) to determine the parameters a and b, the slope b corresponds to the steepness of the exponential curve.", "In reality, almost nothing follows exponential growth indefinitely. However, the initial outbreak of an infectious disease can be modeled with an exponential function. For different regions, I fitted the cumulated number of confirmed COVID-19 cases during this initial period, defined by having 50 cases for at least 5 to 10 days. Sorting the fitted slopes (b) from exponential functions, I found a striking list of countries with growth rates larger than Hubei around the lockdown on 01/23, including Iran, Finland, Portugal, Italy, South Korea, Denmark, Slovenia, and Spain, many of which are experiencing the exponential growth now (as of March 15th). In addition, the state of New York and Washington in the US also ranked 15 and 19 among the fastest spreading regions in the world.", "On the flip side, we can also discover the regions and countries with the slowest spreading of COVID-19. The top 20 are almost exclusively in Asia, many of which are remote and less populated provinces in China such as Ningxia, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. Of note, COVID-19 cases exists in Singapore and Japan since mid-February yet spread much slower, probably due to the early and effective implementation of social distancing.", "One way to put the number of infected people into perspective is to normalize it against the population size of the region or country. Below I plot the top 20 regions/countries with the largest percentage of the population infected with COVID-19. San Marino, an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, ranked the 1st in COVID-19 density by population. Other low population countries such as Iceland also top the list.", "Another way to make sense of the numbers of infected people is to normalize against the area of the region/country to derive the density of the cases in terms of geography. Again, San Marino top the list because of the small area. Many cities and city states are also among the top: Macau, Singapore, and Washington DC.", "A more impactful way of putting the numbers of COVID-19 cases in perspective is to quantify its burden to hospitals within the regions. This can be done by normalizing against the hospital capacity, which is measured by the estimated number of hospital beds.", "The current COVID-19 infected patients are enough to occupy 72% of the hospital beds in San Marino, which only has one hospital. Other countries with very high burden include Iceland, Iran, Italy and Qatar, with COVID-19 patients taking over 10% of the hospital beds. Note that this is assuming the best case scenario where patients are proportionally distributed around hospitals so that they won\u2019t flood to the same hospital.", "One should also consider the number of beds in ICU and the number of available mechanical ventilators, which are essential for saving those patients with severe symptoms. According to American Hospital Association, beds in ICD accounts for ~5% of all hospital beds in the US. Assuming all those patients would need ICU stay, the ~10% hospital beds become a scary ~200% ICU capacity.", "I was able to estimate hospital beds for states in the US using data from here. As you can see in the plot, the confirmed cases in San Marino has already exceed the number of hospital beds. The hospital burden of Italy jumped to ~23%. Three states in the US, New York, Washington and New Jersey also ranked in the top 20, with 16%, 12% and 4% all hospital beds potentially occupied by confirmed COVID-19 cases, assuming all require hospitalization.", "Your home for data science.
