But Neural Networks don\u2019t \u201clearn\u201d the way humans do, instead it\u2019s just really good at fast pattern matching. Today\u2019s research mainly focuses on bigger models with larger datasets and complicated loss functions. But the next revolution is likely going to be more fundamental. Let\u2019s take a look at two approaches: adding logic with Stacked Capsule Auto Encoders and Self-Supervised Learning at scale.", "This about sums up what most AI scientists already know: Deep Learning is really good at doing narrow, pattern based tasks such as object or speech recognition. The challenges are to make the AI 1) Learn with less examples 2) Be more robust to trivial adversary attacks and 3) Be able to reason 4) Plan more complex action sequences.", "The key insight here is that with Convolutional Neural Networks, we simply added a little bit of structure (the convolution) to a Fully Connected Neural Network, and it helped the network with image recognition tremendously.", "Hinton now changes the basic neuron structure to a \u201cCapsule\u201d which consists of 1) a logistic unit to recognize a shape 2) a matrix for the pose and 3) a vector for other properties such as deformation, velocity, color, etc. The added structure should help the Neural Network recognize and store information about shapes, poses, and the other properties. Full Neurips paper here. Get started with AI here.", "Shown below, the algorithm shows clear separation among the 10 digit categories in MNIST after unsupervised training. This means we can train the Neural Net using just 10 labeled samples (one for each digit).", "Imagine a baby playing with blocks numbered 1\u201310\u2026after a while the baby should be able to group similar numbers together (regardless of pose, deformity, etc) even though she doesn\u2019t know what the numbers mean. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening here.", "Hinton\u2019s Stacked Capsule Auto Encoders is an example of building knowledge structure into a Neural Network, which enables the network to reason. In the instance of MNIST, it\u2019s recognizing how a digit is composed of many parts.", "Taken a step further, you can imagine that we can represent other relationships this way, like capabilities (can walk, can fly, etc) and features (has head, has wings, etc). From here, it\u2019s easy to see how a computer will be able to reason an animal is a bird because it has wings and can fly.", "Tesla\u2019s autopilot is another example of combining Neural Networks with logic systems. In that case, Neural Nets are only used used to do object recognition, then a set a of manually written rules give directions to the car, for example \u201cA pedestrian is walking in front of the car, apply brakes and come to a stop\u2019.", "The biggest differences are 1)Hinton\u2019s relationship system is trainable using gradient descent, but pure symbolic systems are not and 2) Vector representations on trained systems can do similarity but symbolic systems cannot. For example, \u201cHumans are similar to apes because they have 4 legs, a rounded face, and are about the same height.\u201d", "You can imagine other ways of combining logic and systems, like integrating symbolic reasoning inside a Neural Network or a cascade system where logic starts out fuzzy and then gets firmed up by symbolic rules. But it\u2019s definitely not clear which method is best.", "What if we skipped this fancy footwork with capsules, can the network still learn these relationships? That\u2019s what Yann LeCun is thinking.", "Babies learn this way. They first observe the world and learn about gravity by watching objects fall. So if you show a 10-month baby an object suspended in air, they will be very surprised \u2014 the baby learned about gravity and expected object to fall because they have been observing the world.", "Yann\u2019s thesis is if we are able to get Neural Network do video prediction, then we have a way of letting the computer learn all sorts of relationships about the world by itself without injecting specific relationships into the network structure.", "But predicting future video frames is hard because the future is actually unpredictable, so the network will try to combine all the possible futures into one blurry image. Yann thinks energy-based models may make this possible soon.", "Most of the discussions around AI today focus on making bigger models and more complicated loss functions. But the inventors of Neural Networks are leading research that attacks the core short comings of Neural Nets.", "While it\u2019s unclear which method will lead to the next breakthrough, I\u2019m very optimistic some of the research will work and cause a dramatic increase in AI capability. Users of AI would benefit by paying close attention and integrating the breakthroughs as quickly as possible.", "Thank you to my friends Hanoz Bhathena and James Zhang for reading drafts of this.", "Get the full video recording of the talk", "Learn to build your own Deep Learning Computer here and start practicing AI", "Your home for data science.
