Just this week, the prototypical Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company, Salesforce, was added to the Dow Jones Industrial average. It\u2019s now the third largest component of the index. Since the Covid crisis, the accretion of value to these companies has even accelerated.", "Looking at Salesforce data, it\u2019s clear that a large part of its growing valuation comes from increasing revenue. Salesforce and other SAAS companies just keep making more money.", "Still, that isn\u2019t the only factor. Look at the company\u2019s Price-to-Sales ratio, or stock \u2018multiple\u2019. Over the last 5 years it hovered around 8 before spiking to almost 12 this year. This change has many of us wondering, have SAAS valuations gotten ahead of themselves?", "To answer that question, brilliant venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has an answer \u2014 low interest rates.", "This got me wondering, how well can we model tech company valuations using just interest rates? If we average all SAaS companies together, can we ignore things like revenue growth, margins, customer acquisition, lifetime value, retention, and other metrics that comprise the classic SaaS model?", "I attempted to answer that question using some basic modeling techniques in R. Code and data for the project are all available here. The exercise provided a few excellent lessons in the pitfalls of both simple models and the assumptions we make about software company valuation.", "First, I gathered a list of all the largest publicly traded SaaS companies in the United States. Mike Sonders has a great list, and I just had to add a few that he missed. Next, I collected historical price-to-sales data (aka \u2018multiples\u2019) for these companies. The best source for this was macrotrends, which has great financial information.", "Finally, I recorded a few measures of interest rates over the same period. I first got the effective federal funds rate from the St Louis Fed website. Then, I decided that a better measure might be the yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds as these would reflect expectations of future interest rates. Gathering this information was easy using marketwatch. The final result of the data collection was a large matrix.", "Each column represented an earnings quarter and each value represented a price-to-sales ration. At the bottom are interest rates, measured as perentages.", "To start, I wanted to see if there was any obvious visual relationship between interest rates and SaaS multiples. Since the data was already in Excel, it was easy to plot the average SaaS company P/S ratio (blue) against the 10yr yield, the 30yr yield, and the effective federal funds rate.", "There did seem to be a decent correlation, but the different scales made it hard to tell. The same plot with normalized data is below.", "Now the relationship isn\u2019t so clear. Doing a quick check, it seems like SaaS multiples are pretty inversely correlated with the 30yr yield and to a lesser extent the 10yr. Multiples also seem to have some relation to the fed funds rate, but not an obvious one. Confirming this in R was easy.", "Most surprising is how closely multiple expansion is related to the simple advancement of time. Comparing SaaS multiples to a basic increasing sequence, I got a correlation of 0.86! I generated simple plots with these variables measured against each other to see if I was missing anything.", "One problem with comparing averages directly is that they hide some information. In this case, younger SaaS companies tend to trade for very high multiples - likely due to a combination of hype and higher revenue growth. These companies biased the average multiple for recent quarters.", "To avoid this bias, I normalized P/S data for each company in order to weigh all rows equally.", "Now, with clean data and some intuition about what I was looking for, it was time to build some basic models.", "The R language makes building linear models a breeze with the \u2018lm\u2019 function. Using \u2018lm\u2019 it was easy to construct simple formulas to see how closely they tracked real SaaS data. I decided to construct all kinds of polynomial relationships between the various interest rates measures to see which one performed best. Here are some of these models below in R.", "Each of these models represents some kind of polynomial combination of time, the 30yr yield, the 10yr yield, the fed funds rate, and normalized SaaS multiples", "Many of the models I constructed were unecessarily complex. For instance, there is no obvious reason why a polynomial sum of the fed funds rate, the thirty yr yield, and the ten yr yield should perform well. Still, that is what I observed. Perhaps this was a classic case of overfitting, or else maybe there is some deeper relationship between short and long term rate expectations.", "The quality of these models could be easily calculated using the R \u2018predict\u2019 function. Then the \u2018rmse\u2019 function was used to calculate the root-mean-squared-error between predicted values and the actual SaaS averages.", "The complex models performed the best. Again, this is probably due to overfitting. The true test would be to use these models to predict future data.", "I selected a few of the better performing models from the previous section and looked at their formulas", "With these formulas in mind, I plotted them against the actual SaaS data to see how they looked. The normalized Saas multiples are the red points, and the model predictions are the blue points.", "I think it\u2019s fair to say that the relationship between tech stocks and interest rates is not completely clear. While it makes intuitive sense for lower rates to expands SaaS multiples, we need some really complex polynomial models to get a good fit with the data. I have heard finance gurus say things like \u2018each half point rate cut leads to 2 points of multiple expansion\u2019. While this has been true under certain circumstances, it certainly isn\u2019t an absolute law.", "Now, there are many possible reasons for my failure to get at a nice, clean relationship between rates and multiples. Perhaps there were not enough companies to aggregate, so individual differences in businesses skewed things too much. Perhaps the relationship isn\u2019t really linear. Multiples are very high now with a near-zero federal funds rate, but they were also high when the economy was booming and the rate was closer to 2%. Perhaps there are larger macro-level variables that are missing from my analysis, including investor sentiment. In fact, from this coarse data the best single predictor of SaaS multiples is time. Each quarter of the bull market expands multiples beyond what interest rates alone would predict. Tech folks are all hoping for some quantitative reason that they are getting so rich so fast. Maybe like our animal spirits, the real reason is unquantifiable.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Engineer in San Francisco.
