Statistically speaking, it\u2019s highly unlikely that one person can know everything unless it\u2019s on a very specific topic. As data scientists, we\u2019re typically treading into different areas of expertise as they relate to data science and programming. Even if we just focus on one specialization, the reality is that technology is constantly evolving, as our the tools that we have at our disposal and that are best-fit for the task at hand. With this constant evolution comes the need to be inquisitive, to adapt to changes, and to constantly be learning.", "As good data scientists, it\u2019s important that you never shy away from using the resources available to you at every opportunity. If you\u2019re not sure on something, there is no shortage of resources one can use to help solve a problem, answer a question, or learn more about a specific topic. Even if you don\u2019t plan on using it right away \u2014 it can never hurt to know where to look!", "In this blog post, I will go over the top 5 resources that are available (for free!) to every data scientist \u2014 and to every person looking to learn more about a topic or simply to grow their skillset and improve their abilities.", "One of the first resources I like to look through as I\u2019m learning a new library, a new function within a library, a new programming language, etc. is the documentation for that specific library / function / language. In many cases, the documentation has been meticulously curated to provide explanations and examples of what each specific component does and what you can expect when working with it. While some libraries have incredibly in-depth and methodical documentation, sometimes the documentation can be a little lackluster.", "These days, the documentation typically allows for open-source collaboration, so as people feel that the documentation is not complete enough they can add explanations as they feel necessary. While these additions typically have to be approved by the project leader, most are happy to accept helpful collaboration from users.", "In some cases the documentation may be a bit too technical, provide too broad a scope of what the library or language does, not go into enough detail, or \u2014 as I mention above \u2014 just be a little lackluster. In this case, I like to turn to\u2026", "Blog posts (such as the one you\u2019re reading right now) allow people to share knowledge that they\u2019ve accumulated on any number of topics. Some people know how to tell a story and can suck you in from the moment you read the first few words. They have a gift for explaining things in a way you hadn\u2019t necessarily thought about \u2014 maybe sprinkling in some examples here and there. Before you know it, you understand the topic that, just a few minutes ago, had you swimming in a whirlpool of confusion.", "The best part about blog posts is that people typically don\u2019t write them unless they feel a certain level of comfort with the topic they\u2019re discussing. With that, you can rest a bit more assured that you\u2019re gaining knowledge from someone that may not be a subject matter expert necessarily, but they felt confident enough in what they were discussing to write on it.", "The downside to blogs is that sometimes they can get a little long as people tend to ramble. Other times, they get a little off-topic and don\u2019t quite hit the nail on the head. In a lot of cases, they may explain a general overview of what you\u2019re looking for but don\u2019t quite get to what you REALLY needed. If what you\u2019re looking for is the answer to a specific problem, then I might recommend\u2026", "StackOverflow is one of the most useful websites / forums for any person in a technical field. In addition to helping data scientists answer questions and solve problems that they may have encountered, it\u2019s also something that programmers use when they run into hurdles. StackOverflow is an honest representation of the data science / programming community, where people go to ask questions and have those more experienced (or at least someone who\u2019s discovered an answer to the specific issue) answer the question. Sometimes the questions are as simple as the proper syntax for running a specific method or function. Other times, people get into much more technical problems such as the proper way to instantiate and set up a neural network.", "Because StackOverflow is essentially a forum for people to ask and answer questions, in many cases you will find people that are having the same issue that you\u2019ve run into. Data science, while still a relatively new field, is seasoned enough that people have gone through the same exercises and run into the same problems you have. Languages and libraries have been around long enough for people to find and fix bugs, and troubleshoot many of their own problems. If someone has been curious enough to ask a question, then it\u2019s likely that someone else has taken the time to answer their question.", "In some cases, people don\u2019t like to ask their own questions, can\u2019t find their specific questions or an answer that adequately solves their problem, don\u2019t learn as well by reading, or they just like figuring things out on their own. If that\u2019s the case, consider taking a look at\u2026", "In today\u2019s day and age, you can find a video for just about anything \u2014 whether you\u2019re looking to build a machine learning model, do some work on your car, learn a new recipe to cook, or even just find some entertainment. Enter YouTube. YouTube is a website that allows users to post videos on just about any topic, and in many cases those videos are explanatory and can help you learn something new or expand your knowledge of an existing topic.", "Using YouTube for programming and data science is no different. In a world where online schools and boot camps exist, it\u2019s not hard to find a video going into extreme (sometimes too much) detail about any aspect of data science or programming. New to Python and you\u2019re trying to learn how to build a function? There\u2019s a video for that. Trying to learn how to build out a recommender system? There\u2019s a video for that as well. Interested in neural networks? You guessed it. No shortage of videos for that.", "Ultimately, YouTube is similar to StackOverflow in that it\u2019s people helping people (or creating entertaining content for people), only this time it\u2019s in video format. Maybe taking advice from total strangers that you can\u2019t talk to face-to-face isn\u2019t your cup of tea. Maybe you have some hesitations about the pedigree of the person giving you advice. If these are your concerns, then the best resource you can use, that often goes overlooked is\u2026", "I touched on this earlier within the blog, and the truth is that data science and programming is a very tight-knit community. We\u2019re a group of people that are always happy to talk about what we know, what we\u2019re working on, and what we\u2019d like to learn. I have yet to run into a data scientist within my network that hasn\u2019t been willing to sit down and chat over coffee (or a happy hour drink or two) and discuss their knowledge and how they got there.", "Using your network is a resource that often goes overlooked because most people don\u2019t like to \u201cbother\u201d others. The problem here starts with looking at using your network as a bother to others. Most people are happy to make a genuine connection with others, especially when it means getting to talk a little bit about themselves and their knowledge.", "Not everyone is a people-person. The good news is that if someone isn\u2019t big on talking about themselves, answering your questions, or sitting down and just chatting \u2014 odds are they\u2019ll let you know before you actually get out to do that. They may not answer your message, they may turn you down. Don\u2019t sweat it! The first step is putting yourself out there and actually interacting with people. Even if you think you\u2019re not a people-person now, as you find some common ground and topics to talk about, conversation tends to flow freely. Don\u2019t be afraid to leverage your network to help you grow as a person and as a data scientist!", "Google is where I usually start before I end up at any of the previous resources (except maybe for networking). By knowing how to use Google effectively, you can often find a variety of valuable resources that help address the problem at hand. Effective Google searching cuts down on the time you spend looking for something, and allows you to spend more time actually solving your problem. Be careful not to get lost down the rabbit hole though \u2014 because Google provides so many different results it\u2019s easy to overlook the ones that may be most useful.", "While this isn\u2019t meant to be an all-encompassing list of resources, it\u2019s the top-five that I\u2019ve found useful in my journey as a data scientist (and before jumping into that industry as well). The internet is a place full of knowledge. Be careful though, as not all of it is going to be helpful and it certainly won\u2019t always be right! Tread carefully, always be willing to learn, and live a life inquisitive. A good data scientist is always asking questions and always looking to learn!", "Your home for data science.
