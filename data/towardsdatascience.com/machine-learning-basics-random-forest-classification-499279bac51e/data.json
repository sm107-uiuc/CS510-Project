Therefore, it can be referred to as a \u2018Forest\u2019 of trees and hence the name \u201cRandom Forest\u201d. The term \u2018Random\u2019 is due to the fact that this algorithm is a forest of \u2018Randomly created Decision Trees\u2019.", "The Random Forest Algorithm is an advancement to the existing Decision Tree Algorithm which suffers from a major problem of \u201coverfitting\u201d. It is also considered to be more faster and accurate in comparison with the Decision Tree Algorithm.", "It combines the results of multiple Decision Trees and classifies the output based on the result. Let is practically solve a dataset with this algorithm.", "In this implementation of the Random Forest Classification model, we shall use a Social Network Advertisement dataset which I had already used in building the SVM Classifier. It consists of three columns. The first two columns are the independent variables, namely the \u2018Age \u2019and the \u2018EstimatedSalary \u2019and the last column is the dependent variable \u2018Purchased\u2019, which is in the binary format denoting whether the individual has bought the product (1) or not (0).", "Using these data, we have to build a Classifier for a product company that will classify whether a person of a particular age and drawing a particular amount of salary will purchase their product that is advertised on a social media platform.", "As always, the first step will always include importing the libraries which are the NumPy, Pandas and the Matplotlib.", "In this step, we shall obtain the dataset from my github repositary which is stored as SocialNetworkAds.csv and store it to the variable dataset. Then we shall assign the corresponding variables to X and Y. Finally, we shall see the first 5 rows of our dataset.", "We shall split the data into the training and the test set. In this,we have kept the test_size=0.20. It denotes that 20% of the data will be kept as the Test set and the remaining 80% will be used for training as the Training set. As there are 400 rows, about 80 data points will be assigned to the test set and remaining 320 data points will be used for training purposes.", "This is an additional step that will increase the speed of the program as we scale down the values of X to a smaller range. In this, we scale down both the X_trainand the X_test to a small range of -2 to +2. For example, the salary 75000 is scaled down to 0.16418997.", "Once the training test is ready, we can import the RandomForestClassifier Class and fit the training set to our model. The class SVC is assigined to the variable classifier. The criterion used here is \u201centropy\u201d . The other criterion that can also be used is the \u201cgini\u201d. The classifier.fit() function is then used to train the model.", "In this step, the classifier.predict() function is used to predict the values for the Test set and the values are stored to the variable y_pred.", "This is a step that is mostly used in classification techniques. In this, we see the Accuracy of the trained model and plot the confusion matrix.", "The confusion matrix is a table that is used to show the number of correct and incorrect predictions on a classification problem when the real values of the Test Set are known. It is of the format", "The True values are the number of correct predictions made.", "From the above confusion matrix, we infer that, out of 80 test set data, 77 were correctly classified and only 3 were incorrectly classified, leaving us with an accuracy of 96.25%.", "In this step, a Pandas DataFrame is created to compare the classified values of both the original Test set (y_test) and the predicted results (y_pred).", "This step is an additional step which is not much informative as the Confusion matrix and is mainly used in regression to check the accuracy of the predicted value. Try spotting out the value which was incorrectly predicted!", "In this last step, we visualize the results of the Random Forest Classification model on a graph that is plotted along with the two regions.", "In this plot, There are two regions. The Red region denotes 0, which consists of people who have not bought the product and the Green region denotes 1, which consists of the people who have bought the product.", "If you notice closely, we can see the red colored - 3 wrongly classified data points in the test set with the difference in color in the specific region.", "Thus in this story, we have successfully been able to build a Random Forest Classification Model that is able to predict if a person is going to buy a product based on his age and salary. Do feel free to try out various other common classification datasets that are available on the net.", "I am also attaching the link to my github repository where you can download this Google Colab notebook and the data files for your reference.", "You can also find the explanation of the program for other Classification models below:", "We will come across the more complex models of Regression, Classification and Clustering in the upcoming articles.
