They are especially useful to avoid repetitions of code and make your program more organized and easier to debug. Although you can always define your own functions, Python provides multiple built-in functions that are always available to use. In this article, we explain 10 of those functions in detail. Let\u2019s get started!", "The dir([object]) function returns a sorted list of strings containing the attributes and methods of any object in Python. This function takes as input a single object and is useful to get information about the operations we can perform with this object.", "Among others, we can use the dir function with:", "As you can observe, the dir function returns a list containing all methods (even magic methods) available for dictionaries in Python.", "In the following code block, the dir function returns all attributes and methods defined in the glob module.", "We create a new class called Rectangle that defines a rectangle by its height and width. Next, we create an instance of this class named rectangle_1. Then, we obtain all attributes and methods (including inherited magic methods) of the rectangle_1 object using the dir function.", "The enumerate(iterable, start=0) function adds a counter to an iterable (e.g a list) and returns an enumerate object. This object can be used directly in a for loop, obtaining every iteration a two-item tuple of the form (index, item).", "As shown above, the enumerate function creates an iterable of tuples that can be unpacked directly in the for loop specifying two variables.", "Alternatively, we can use the next() function to iterate through the enumerate object, since this object supports the iteration protocol, meaning both __iter__ and __next__ methods are implemented. The next function returns the next tuple from the enumerate object every time it is called.", "In order to inspect the enumerate object, we can convert it to a list using the built-in function list() in the following manner.", "By default, the enumerate function starts counting at 0. However, in some cases, you want the counter to start at a different number. We can easily change the starting index by specifying the index (integer) in the second parameter (start) as shown below.", "The eval(expression[, globals[, locals]]) function executes a string containing Python code and returns the result. This function takes 3 arguments: (1) expression, (2) globals, and (3) locals. The first argument contains the string to be evaluated as a Python expression. The other two arguments are optional and contain global/local methods and variables.", "As shown below, using the eval function, we can not only evaluate expressions but also call methods and functions.", "The eval function works only with expressions, trying to pass a statement as input will raise an exception (SyntaxError).", "Although the eval function comes in handy when evaluating expressions introduced by the user, the function has important security drawbacks. The user can pass untrusted code to the eval function, being able to even delete files of your system. A solution to this problem is to restrict the execution environment of the eval function by modifying the global and locals arguments.", "If you want to know how more about the eval function I really recommend you take a look at the following article.", "The all(iterable) function returns True when all elements in a given iterable (e.g a list) are true. If not, it returns False.", "In Python, the following values are considered False (falsy values):", "All those values evaluate to False in a boolean context and they can be used in an if or while statement as well as with operands and, or, and not.", "The all() function returns False if one of those falsy values is contained in the iterable as shown below.", "The any(iterable) function accepts an iterable (e.g a list, dictionary, or tuple) as input and returns True if any element of the iterable is true. If not, it returns False.", "As with the all() function, any() is not limited to evaluating boolean data types. This function evaluates if the values of the iterable are truthy or falsy, returning True if any value is truthy. (See values considered falsy in part 4)", "To check if a value is either truthy or falsy we can use the bool() function as shown below.", "A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to obtain the index where the value can be found in the table as shown in the image below.", "The hash() function returns the hash value of an object (if it has one), meaning provides the index to look up in a hash table.", "As you can observe, this function returns an integer (hash value) if an immutable object is provided as input. On the contrary, the hash() function raises an exception (TypeError) if a mutable object is provided since mutable objects (e.g lists) are unhashable (they can change over its lifetime).", "The hash() function returns always the same numeric output value when a particular input is provided, meaning it is a deterministic function.", "Keep in mind that the output of the hash function can be different on your computer since this function is platform-dependent.", "Python uses hash tables for dictionaries and sets. Consequently, we can easily determine if an object belongs to a dictionary or set since we know its index in the memory array (output of the hash function). Therefore, the time complexity for searching an element in a dictionary or set is only O(1) (without hash collisions).", "On the contrary, if we store the elements on a list, we need to search potentially through every element of the list to determine if a given element is present (time complexity O(n)).", "The following block of code shows that searching for an element in a set is substantially faster than in a list.", "As I previously said, the input of the hash() function should be an immutable object. For this reason, we cannot use mutable objects as keys of a dictionary or as elements of a set.", "As shown above, a TypeError is raised when trying to use a list as a key of a dictionary.", "The callable(object) function returns True if the object passed as argument is callable. If not, returns False.", "A callable object is an object that can be invoked with the function operator (). Python has five callable objects: (1) functions, (2) methods, (3) classes, (4) class instances (if the __call__ method is defined), and (5) generators.", "As shown below, the callable function returns True if any of those objects are provided as input. On the contrary, if we provide an integer, the function returns False.", "The range([start], stop, [step]) function returns an immutable sequence of integers (range object), taking as input three parameters:", "Start and step are optional parameters, being stop the only required parameter when calling the function. To visualize the elements of a range object, we can convert it to a list using the built-in function list().", "The following block of code shows multiple ranges of integer generated using the range function.", "The range function is often used together with for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.", "As shown above, the upper limit of the range function is always excluded.", "Although less frequently, the range function is also used with while loops and if statements.", "The len(object) function returns the number of items in an object. As shown below, the input of the len() function can be a collection, a sequence, a NumPy array, and even a Pandas Series.", "The len() function is often used together with the range() function to iterate over the indices of an iterable.", "As shown below, we can iterate over the numbers from 0 up to the length of the iterable using the syntax range(len(iterable)).", "The following block of code produces the same output as before, but in this case, we iterate over the items of the list instead of over the indices.", "The round(number[, ndigits]) function returns a floating-point number rounded to n digits after the decimal point. The second argument of the function is optional, and if it is omitted, the function returns an integer as output.", "As shown below, we can easily round the pi number to two decimal places or to the nearest integer with the round() function.", "Python includes many more built-in functions that perform mathematical operations such as:", "Besides the official documentation, there are a wide variety of web pages where you can find interesting examples!", "If you are still interested in knowing more about built-in functions. Read part 1 :)", "Python offers a wide variety of built-in functions that are always available to use, making your programming life much easier as you do not need to waste your time writing your own code. Additionally, the Python Standard Library as well as third-party modules provide many more functions to deal with everyday programming.
