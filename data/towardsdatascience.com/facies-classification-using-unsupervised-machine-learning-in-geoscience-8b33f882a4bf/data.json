The different types of facies based on these properties include sedimentary facies, lithofacies, seismic facies, etc.", "The physical and organic characteristics found in these rock units usually provide some insight into the different process and systems (e.g. depositional environments) which may have occurred in the region. Combinations of several facies with physical models and other geological data can help provide informative low-dimensional models of the geologic region, leading to better insights regarding the geology of the region.", "In oil and gas exploration, knowledge of the depositional environment is vital as it can help in providing a decent picture of the petroleum systems involved. A petroleum system consists of source rocks (organic matter rich rocks which generate hydrocarbons if heated sufficiently), reservoir rocks (set of rock units that holds hydrocarbon reserves which migrate from the source rock), and seal rock (relatively impermeable rock units that form a barrier around reservoir rocks, preventing hydrocarbon migration beyond the reservoir). A succession of facies with sandstone units, for instance, might be an indicator of a good reservoir, as they tend to have high permeability and porosity, ideal conditions to store hydrocarbons. A common rule known as Walther\u2019s Law of facies stipulates that vertical succession of facies reflects lateral changes in the depositional environment i.e. Two adjacent facies within the rock record must have been deposited laterally in formation. Therefore, the amount of hydrocarbon in place may be estimated by observing the lateral extent and geometries of the facies containing the reservoir units.", "The main sources of data with regards to sub-surface rocks come from a variety of sources, most of which involve drilling. The ideal source of data for facies classification is core (rock) samples obtained from drilled wells as they allow for direct assessment of the sedimentary structure. However, these are expensive to obtain and are not always a feasible option in some cases due to costs. In these situations, indirect measurements are necessary. In this study, I will focus on wireline logs. Wireline logging involves the process of lowering instruments into a borehole and recording measurements that detail the physical characteristics of the surrounding rock and fluids with depth. It is a means of assessing reservoirs since it aids in the differentiation between oil, gas, and water containing formations, determination of porosity, as well as the approximate amount of hydrocarbons present in each formation.", "In order to assign facies using log data, an analyst is required to analyze the records and determine the approximate lithology with depth. With larger datasets, this can become quite tedious and very inefficient in terms of time. Automation of this procedure is therefore necessary and may be helpful in giving a quick and reasonably accurate picture of the regional geology. I will demonstrate how unsupervised learning can help with this process using K-means clustering.", "The analysis is focused on the northwestern region of Kansas, USA, specifically the Forest city basin. This basin has predominantly been a shallow oil and gas province with some coal production.", "My focus was on the Nemaha region within the Forest city basin, which is known to have occurrences of oil and gas and had a couple of wells drilled there. The data was obtained courtesy of the Kansas geological survey which has public records for different wells in the region (Please see https://www.shalexp.com/kinney-oil-company for more details on wells).", "The well logs were obtained in LAS file format from here and were examined for data quality and completeness. A criterion for selection was the presence of eight curves that were deemed necessary for the analysis. The table below shows the associated curves and the properties they provide about the rock formation. These values are all a function of depth measured in feet.", "Using a wide array of logs is useful as they not only provide information on properties such as the lithology, porosity, and electrical conductivity of a formation, but used in conjunction with each other, can boost the accuracy of lithology estimation by performing better in situations where individual logs might fail. I analyzed several of the wells and was able to obtain 6 wells with the required curves available. These curves from the different wells were then combined into a single CSV file for processing. The well names and the formation at each depth were also included. The formation information was obtained at http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Magellan/Qualified/index.html. Oil wells belonging to Kinney Oil", "Descriptive statistics were obtained on the raw data to determine the presence of missing values and potential outliers. Outlier removal is essential as their presence can increase variability in data, making the results of an experiment less likely to be statistically significant.", "The counts differed across the different well logs which indicates missing values for some logs. In addition, some well logs which contained no data had a value of 999 imputed instead. Normally, the issue of missing values can be addressed by imputing the mean or median of the available values. However, geology can be quite complex, and simply replacing missing values with the mean may not reflect the actual geology. The total missing values accounted for a small fraction of the total data so they were dropped instead. The Unnamed column was also dropped as it corresponded to the index for the data measurements.", "So missing data have been removed, but if we pay attention to the maximum values for each well log, we will notice some situations where the maximum values are significantly greater than the mean which are red flags for outliers. Let\u2019s visually inspect some of these data.", "We can see some data that significantly greater than the general population for some of the logs, especially in the resistivity log (ILD). Note that values as high as 10,000 \u03a9/m for ILD do occur in nature for certain lithologies. But resistivity values for most rock types fall within a range, and values as high as 10000 \u03a9/m also encapsulates 2000 \u03a9/m in that range. Judging by the relatively low prevalence of values that high, removing those values may improve clustering results. Using the ILD curve as a reference point, I found keeping values that fell within the 99.95th quantile resulted in a cut off value of around 2000 \u03a9/m for the ILD. It was gentle enough to minimize data loss.", "As some lithologies may result in big spikes in certain physical measurements (e.g. ILD, CILD), the natural log was opted for to minimize the variability in measurement values. This was applied to the ILD and CILD logs due to the large range in their values. Finally, the processed logs were saved to a CSV file.", "After pre-processing the data, it is important to do some feature selection to ensure faster training, as well as less complexity in our model and improved accuracy. In our data set, we have two logs that give very similar information; the resistivity (ILD) and conductivity logs (CILD). We can verify this by checking the correlation between the logs to see how strongly related they are.", "While there are some high correlation values, for this study correlations of 0.8 and above were deemed statistically significant. I picked a high value because some logs do measure very similar properties in terms of lithology, but they also have important differences that can help differentiate lithologies apart. The logarithmic resistivity and conductivity values have a near-perfect correlation i.e they give us basically the same information. The conductivity was therefore dropped from the features list.", "Next, the data were scaled using the scale module from the sklearn package. The issue with k-means clustering is we have no idea which cluster separation is the most accurate representation of our data. Therefore I employed two techniques that can give us an idea of what the optimal cluster size could be.", "Let\u2019s begin with the Elbow technique. This method runs K-means clustering for a specified number of clusters and calculates the within sum of squares i.e the sum of differences between each point in a cluster and its assigned cluster centroid. The optimal cluster is usually selected as the point in which the sum of squares is minimized and subsequent changes for increasing clusters are minimal. Let\u2019s make an analysis for clusters ranging in size from 1 to 12", "Next, we plot these values as a function of the number of clusters used", "Although not very apparent, we can see the curve begins to somewhat flatten around no of clusters = 5. We can further evaluate the optimal cluster size by looking at the silhouette score. The silhouette score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). Silhouette coefficients near 1 indicate that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters. A value of 0 indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters and negative values indicate that those samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster. Let\u2019s calculate the silhouette scores for the different number of clusters starting at no of clusters = 5.", "The silhouette score had its highest values at no of clusters = 8. The value of 6 had a very similar silhouette score but having more separation is better in facies identification. This is due to the fact that some lithologies tend to get interbedded with each other so more clusters might reveal these patterns.", "Using the KMeans algorithm from the sklearn\u2019s cluster module, the well log data were clustered into 8 groups. I utilized a 100 random initial centroid seeds to increase the probability of finding a cluster separation that best describes the data.", "The well logs and facies as a function of depth for some of the well were plotted using codes modified from Brendan Hall.", "The plots show there is a lateral variation of lithologies in this region due to variations in the facies around the same depth. We can validate these results by obtaining some knowledge of the Kansas stratigraphy. According to KGS geology, the dominant lithologies in this region are; sandstones, shales, dolomite, limestones with some silt, chert, and chalk. Analysis of core samples also suggests the presence of gypsium and pyrite amongst others. My analysis highlighted 8 facies which are reasonable results based on the known information. Different rocks have different well log responses, and these responses used in combination can give us a pretty good idea of what the underlying lithology is. Different log responses for different lithologies can be found here and here.", "If we consider the Viola formation for instance, in the Woody Acres well its represented predominantly by Facies 2. It is characterized by extremely low gamma-ray values, density values between 2.5\u20132.8 g/cm3, DT values on the low end (47\u201367 \u00b5s/ft). The PE values show a jump halfway through the formation suggesting the presence of another lithology, but its overall properties suggest a dolomitic layer with some limestones inclusions in it. In the Baumgartner well, the PE values in the bottom half of the formation jump towards a value of 5 b/E, which is indicative of limestones. The top half shows similar properties to dolomite in terms of the PE value, and its decreasing Neutron porosity coupled with a relatively stable density suggests this facies to be a combination of dolomites and limestones i.e a dolomitic limestone layer. We can, therefore, attribute Facies 7 and 5 as limestone and dolomitic limestone respectively.", "The Kinderhook formation in the Hartter well shows a jump in the gamma readings, an increase in neutron porosity, with relatively stable density readings and a much lower resistivity reading. The sudden increase in the sonic porosity in addition to the previously mentioned properties points to a shale layer for Facies 4. The Viola formation in this well also has very similar properties, but the sonic porosity values are lower, and the slightly higher resistivity values compared to the Kinderhook formation suggest the inclusion of sands, limestone, or dolomites. However, the PE values are lower than that of dolomites or limestones suggesting Facies 1 is a sandy shale layer. Finally, the low gamma values in the top parts of the Hunton formation, coupled with the drop in the neutron porosity and increase in density and PE values in the dolomitic range suggest a dolomitic sand regime for Facies 3.", "Reference to KGS geology reveals the Viola formation to be composed of fine to coarse-grained limestones and dolomites containing variable quantities of chert. It also highlights the Hunton formation to be generally composed of gray to brown, fine-grained, crystalline dolomite or limestone with minor chert in some parts. It is also slightly coarser-grained, and slightly sandy dolomite with vuggy porosity with some chert in other parts of the formation. These agree with my analysis which shows limestones and dolomites constitute the majority lithology in these formations.", "Unsupervised machine learning can be a great way to derive some quick insights from your data in a cost-effective manner and could be a guide for additional supervised work as demonstrated in this study. However, as attractive as the prospects of this technique are, it is important to be aware of the caveats associated with this method.", "The optimal number of clusters is not easy to predict and can be subjective in most cases. Most lithologies are not completely homogenous and tend to include different rock types, so finding an optimal k value is difficult and sometimes not possible, and may require some a priori knowledge. Additionally, the clusters can change depending on the initial centroid starting location. It is also not a practical solution for situations where there is an enormous amount of data. In those cases, it is preferable to use supervised learning techniques. In future work, I will demonstrate how a convolutional neural network can be applied to facies classification, as well as evaluating its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and other metrics.", "Comments and feedback are welcome.
