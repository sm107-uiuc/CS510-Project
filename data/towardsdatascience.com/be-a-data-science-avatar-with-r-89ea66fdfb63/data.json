Earlier only the biggest commercial corporations and conglomerates were using it but now this technology is available to small businesses as well.", "More use of technology means more demand for people who can use said technology. Therefore, the global requirement for skilled Data Scientists has gone up significantly as well.", "When it comes to Data Science, R is one of the most prominent and popular programming languages for it. Learning R is a sure shot way to find success as a Data Scientist. Not only that! R is also used by various IT and social media companies for Machine Learning, sentiment analysis, and behavior analysis researches as well. It is one of the most widespread programming languages.", "There are many reasons why R is better than many other languages that can be used for Data Science and machine learning. Some of those reasons would be:", "R has been around since 1992 and is still one of the most popular languages for Data Science and academic research. There are more than 2 million users worldwide and this number only seems to be increasing.", "R has more than 2 million users worldwide. The R community is far-reaching and very helpful at the same time. Many conferences and events are organized around the world throughout the year for users to get together and discuss new ideas and also to help new users.", "R is open-source. It is free to use, contribute and develop.", "With static graphics in R\u2019s base graphics packages and add on packages like ggplot2 and plotly providing dynamic and animated graphics, R\u2019s data visualization process is compared to none.", "Complex statistical computations and operation can be performed with a few simple commands in R.", "There are multiple repositories online that store thousands of packages that extend and improve the R environment. The CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) repository houses more than 15,000 R packages.", "Learning anything is simple with hard work, dedication, and a little imagination. Learning R is not that different.", "Here is a step-by-step guide to learning R:", "(Introduction to the R environment and installation)", "Learning about the R environment should be your first step. This would include exploring the changes and updates in the current version of R, different IDE\u2019s available, online repositories for suitable packages, etc.", "After this, you should install the R base packages and a suitable IDE (I would recommend RGUI or RStudio).", "Let\u2019s get started with the basics of R. The following topics are necessary to build a solid foundation for R programming.", "While learning this, you should also focus on the syntax of various functions, commands and control structures. R has a very flexible syntax, which makes it easy to learn as well as easy to make mistakes. You should follow programming best practices to be able to write consistent and clean code.", "Once you have a good handle on the basics and syntax of R, you should brush up on basic statistics and mathematics. Although R has commands that can perform complex sets of operations easily, it is always good to actually know what the commands are doing with the data behind the scenes. Concepts like linear and non-linear regression, time-series analysis, principal component, and factor analysis are very useful and commonly used in data science and it is very helpful to know how to perform these with R.", "Data manipulation is the very first step of any data analysis. It is the process of changing and conforming data to the required format for further analysis. R has many useful and convenient functions for data manipulation. It also has various libraries for data manipulation, cleaning, and reshaping. Cleaning and reshaping the data properly make the analysis process much easier and accurate.", "The best way to learn and make progress with R is to build projects of your own and practice. Practical experience is the best teacher for anything. Start simple like a calculator and increase the difficulty from there. In no time, you will be analyzing large datasets of real-world data or performing complex Data Science algorithms.", "Data Science is like fire and its high time that you starting cooking your food on it. As the gap between the high demand and the low supply of quality Data Scientists narrows, you should get started with Data Science asap. And learning R Programming is probably the easiest way possible for the same.", "Learning R is easy. It will also prove to be a terrific decision for your career and future. By following the above steps and a little bit of hard work, you will be a master R programmer in no time.", "Your home for data science.
