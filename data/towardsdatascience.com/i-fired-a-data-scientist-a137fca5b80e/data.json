Mis-management of the issue can lead to a high turn-over and a toxic team atmosphere. I want to share a solution called Insight-Driven Development (IDD), a few examples of it, and five steps to adopting it. IDD aims to create a high performing, engaged, and happy Data Science teams that embrace non-ML work as much as the fun ML stuff.", "Like What You Read? Follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter. Check out my \u201cInfluence with Machine Learning\u201d guide. It helps data scientists to communicate better.", "Disclaimer: This post is not endorsed or sponsored by any of the firms I work for. I use the term Analytics, Data Science, and ML interchangeably.", "\u201cHey man, it\u2019s not working out. We have to roll you off the project. Sorry.\u201d Alex, a competent Data Scientists, looks at me emotionless. I feel helpless, nervous, and sad.", "He\u2019s probably cursing me with the strongest languages.", "So, I just \u201cfired\u201d one of the two data scientists off the project. Why? Alex hated doing data work. He\u2019s very vocal about it. He used all kinds of excuses to \u201coffload\u201d it to someone else. We talked about it; he still did a half-a*s job. Other people got frustrated and complained about why only Alex got to do the cool stuff. We, as a team, were going to fail if this continued. So, here we are.", "\u201cSh*t dude. I am sorry.\u201d Alex said, finally. Damn, that\u2019s awkward.", "The \u201cAlex Problem\u201d is quite common among data science teams. Many data scientists feel bored and unmotivated. I think there are two root causes:", "That day, I \u201cmanaged\u201d the Alex Problem, and I felt sh*t. At that moment, building high performing, engaged, and happy Data Science team became my mission.", "At the minimum, I want a system that would encourage the data science team to embrace non-ML work and have some fun doing so. Well, the obvious solution is to force people to do it (we all get paid to work, right?). But it\u2019s not sustainable. So, the solution has to be practical, enjoyable, and self-motivating.", "In the following years, I started a journey of trying and mixing core ideas from Product Management, Agile Software Development, and Management Consulting. I think I found the solution: Insight-Driven Development (IDD).", "Typically, there are two types of ML projects: business-focused and software-based projects. In this article, let\u2019s discuss the principles of IDD in the context of business-focused ML projects. The outputs of these projects are typically executive-level presentations or dashboards. The team needs to use specific ML techniques, from simple to sophisticated ones, to find some insight.", "Depends on how this post does, I can deep-dive into 1) how IDD works across the early, mid, and late phases of the project and 2) how to adapt IDD for software-focused ML projects (e.g. the outputs are full-stack solutions that integrate with core operations).", "To utilize IDD, you need either a team of experienced people with unique crafts and are motivated to try new things or a group of junior generalists who are driven, can get stuff done, and moldable. If not, IDD is not for your team (and you should take another look at your hiring strategy).", "IDD comes down to doing two things differently:", "First, let\u2019s look at how Work Packages can be defined differently with an illustrative example. Below are two Backlogs without and with IDD for the same project, at the same Sprint, and with the same immediate goals.", "How do we typically manage ML projects? In most ML projects, we divide Work Packages into four groups:", "Some projects may have a Business verticle if it\u2019s a management consulting type of engagement.", "What\u2019s changed? In IDD, the most apparent change is that there are more \u201cAnalytics\u201d items (things in Yellow). Each Analytics item is carefully phrased in a kind of analysis; each analysis aims to drive out interesting insights; each insight contributes to the bigger business problem based on our hypothesis. Hence, this approach has the name of Insight-Driven Development.", "What happens to the data and infrastructure work? If we look closer, each Analytics item includes the ETL and Infrastructures in the \u201cDefinition of Done.\u201d Data and infrastructure work are still very critical. We are not avoiding them, but doing them as part of the journey to an insight. There are certain caveats to this approach. For example, some data and infrastructure work has to be standalone, especially in the early phase of the project. We will discuss more in a follow-up post.", "How do we assign work? It seems like there are a lot more items that are analytics related. It isn\u2019t practical to assign all of them to the Data Scientists. People have different strengths, experiences, and interests. So, this brings us to the second aspect of IDD: accountability assignment.", "Typically, the roles define people\u2019s accountability. For example, data engineers own and work on all, and likely only the data-related stuff.", "In IDD, each person\u2019s accountability shifts toward outputs from their immediate roles. The team \u201cworks around an insight.\u201d Each person owns the final delivery of insights. To keep a balance of quality, each expert sets the standard, leads the programming (if needed), and be the final quality gatekeeper for her domain expertise.", "With this in mind, the work assignment will look like this with and without IDD. The main difference is that people can lead work outside of their immediate role and domain with support from others.", "Note that particular work still requires highly specialized skills, and it\u2019s best to assign to the experts. You, as the project lead, need to monitor workload and provide enough guidance to people who are leading the work outside of their immediate expertise (e.g. a data engineer creating a customer analysis). Each team member needs to work closely and communicate expectations and timing.", "I have been using IDD on both business- and software-focused ML projects with teams of business analysts, data experts, data scientists, and software engineers with varying years of experience. It\u2019s been working well, and I am going to keep using and refining IDD. Concretely, IDD works because it lets everyone to:", "Every team at every company works differently. So, please take the principles and apply them accordingly. Do expect some confusion, tension, and uncertainty. Be patient, things will click.", "If you like the approach, here are what you can do to adopt IDD at your company.", "Step 1. Make sure your teams and friends understand IDD. So, share this article with your friends and teams with the title of \u201cMust Read.\u201d \ud83d\ude09", "Step 2. Pick a small ML project that is business insight focused (e.g. use ML to find new customer segment and size the potential). Ideally, it should be something you can complete within 2\u20134 months with a team of 5 experienced engineers.", "Step 3. Assemble your A-team. The core team should be you (as the project lead), a data engineer, a machine learning engineer, a software engineer, and a UI designer. You may need part-time support from a business analyst and IT.", "Step 4. Go for a coffee or drink with the team and align on this approach (I find people are more open to new ideas when we are outside of the office).", "Step 5. Start the project. Resist the temptation of reverting to the old way of working. Give it some time for the team to learn (and fail). Pay attention to how individuals deliver the IDD.", "Here are a few Don\u2019t Dos to save you from some awkward moments:", "If you are interested in this topic, our friends at Neptune wrote a fantastic blog on How to Build Machine Learning Teams that Deliver.", "I hope you like this. I\u2019d love to hear how IDD works for your team (and how it doesn\u2019t). You can get in touch with me on Medium, LinkedIn, or Twitter.", "Depends on how this post does, I will follow up to discuss how IDD works for software-focused ML projects (e.g. the outputs are full-stack solutions that integrate with core operations).", "Your home for data science.
