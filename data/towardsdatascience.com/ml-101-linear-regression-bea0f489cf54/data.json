The simplest but also one of the most\u2026 | by Vaishak V.Kumar | Towards Data Science", "h1": "ML 101: Linear Regression", "description": "Have you ever wondered how scientists can predict things like the weather, how economists predict how well the economy will do in the future or how bots can infer the sentiment of tweets? The secret\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Have you ever wondered how scientists can predict things like the weather, how economists predict how well the economy will do in the future or how bots can infer the sentiment of tweets? The secret sauce is a technology called Machine Learning. Closely related to Statistics, machine learning is the art and science of finding patterns given some data. These patterns are then used to make predictions on important outcomes or shed light on the relationships underlying the observed data.", "Supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that deals with looking at some variables (Xs) to predict another set of variables (Ys). This requires us to have a dataset that has both the X and Y variables. This is the most common type of machine learning that you\u2019ll see done in the world.", "Today, we will learn the most basic yet most important type of supervised learning model: Linear Regression. Regression is the task of predicting the exact numeric value that a variable will take. For example, predicting the exact temperature of a place, predicting the number of customers who will buy a video game etc.", "One interesting application of a linear regression model could be to understand how the price of a commodity changes over time. Let\u2019s take a look at orange prices in the US for every year since 1980. The prices are shown in USD for a pound of navel oranges. There are two columns: Year and Price. A quick glance tells us that prices have gone up each year, but what is harder to tell, is the precise relationship between Year and Price over the last 40 years.", "While looking at the spreadsheet is useful, visualizing data graphically can reveal more patterns. Let\u2019s plot these points on a 2D graph with Year on the X axis and Price on the Y axis. As we said before, we want to predict the Y variable by looking at just the X variable.", "The assumption behind linear regression is that the effect of the X variable (Year in this case) is constant over time. That is, the price increase between 1990 and 1991 is the same as the price increase between 2005 and 2006. This is what makes Linear Regression \u201clinear\u201d. To be clear, in the real world, data is messy and never quite fits a model so cleanly. However, Linear Regression works surprisingly well in many real cases.", "Our task is now to find a line that passes through all the points in the data that we observe. There are many different lines that we can fit to this data. The two parameters that we control are the intercept \u2014 the point on the Y axis where the line intersects it, and the slope \u2014 how much the line rises upward as you move along the X axis.", "How do we choose the right line to model the data?", "If our points sat along a perfect line then you could just connect any points and you\u2019d get the right line, but because data tends to be \u201cnoisy\u201d we\u2019ll have to do something else. The best line is given by a process called \u201cordinary least squares\u201d or OLS. This method says that you want to pick the line that minimizes the distance between every point and the line. The distance between a point and the line is called the \u201cerror.\u201d So, we want to reduce the total error of our line.", "Now that we have a line that has the smallest possible error, we can predict the prices of oranges in 2020. All we have to do is find 2020 on the X axis, then draw a straight line from there to our linear regression line, then draw a straight line from there to the Y axis. The reading on the Y axis, tells us what the predicted price is!", "Now for something cooler! We can use more than just one variable to predict the prices. Let\u2019s try using two variables: the year and rainfall in the previous year. Now that we\u2019re in 3 dimensions, we\u2019ll put the year on the x axis, previous year rainfall on the z axis and price on the y axis.", "Now instead of a line, we\u2019ll fit a plane to the data. The logic is still the same. We need a plane that has minimum error between itself and the data points that it needs to model.", "To get the prediction all we need to do is find the year 2020 on the X axis, the 2019 rainfall on the Z axis and find the Y reading! That\u2019s it! You now know how to do linear regression!", "Now let me flag some of the cons of this method. Linear Regression can be very sensitive to outliers. Suppose you have some faulty data where there\u2019s one point that\u2019s way off, then you\u2019re going to get a line that\u2019s tilted towards that point and not really capturing the real model. So, it\u2019s important to make sure that the data is clean and that outliers are removed before running linear regression.", "Your home for data science.
