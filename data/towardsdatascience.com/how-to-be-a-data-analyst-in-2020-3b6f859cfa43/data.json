Now, internet users make up 58% of the global population and generate over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data a day. As technological advancements continue to outpace the number of people with relevant STEM knowledge, there\u2019s an increasing need, more than ever before, for engineers, data scientists, and data analysts. The demand for data analysts is so high that the average salary for a data analyst in the US is around $70,000!", "In this article, I\u2019ll give you my perspective on what a data analyst does, the skills required to be a data analyst, and some takeaways from my experiences.", "I\u2019ve read several articles that gave me a laundry list of things that a data analyst does, but in the simplest sense, you are analyzing and visualizing data. Each company has their own databases that you can query from. These companies also have their own tools for data visualizations, like Tableau, that you use to visualize your insights and findings.", "In business, there are many types of data, like product data, marketing data, and operations data, and similarly, there are several types of data analysts, like product analysts, marketing analysts, and operations analysts. What differentiates these jobs from each other is the domain knowledge relevant to each category, but ultimately, they are synonymous with the term \u2018data analyst\u2019.", "The spectrum of what a data analyst does ultimately depends on the company that you\u2019re working for, but generally, a data analyst will go through the following workflow in the image above. Let\u2019s walk through it.", "Each analysis starts with a problem or a task. The level of difficulty of these tasks can differ greatly. An example of a simple task is if you were asked to write a query to provide a statistic, like yesterday\u2019s sales in dollars. An example of a more difficult task is when the answer isn\u2019t clear and you\u2019re asked to explore the data. E.g. If you were asked to figure out why last month\u2019s sales performed much worse than other months.", "Once you receive a problem, you\u2019ll usually write a query or a number of queries to explore and gather the information that you need to solve the problem. This means that you\u2019ll probably need to know SQL or Python (or both) to gather the information you need.", "Continuing with the previous example, if you were asked to figure out why last month\u2019s sales performed much worse than other months, you might query the average customer review rating last month to see if there was a problem with the product, or you might query last month\u2019s marketing spend compared to other months to see if there was a significant cut in marketing spend.", "The next step is to gather your insights. Sometimes, gathering your insights means copying and pasting your insights into an Excel sheet. Other times, it means saving your queries that you used to find the information that you need for the next step.", "Once you gather your insights, you may be required to visualize your findings. Sometimes, it\u2019ll be as simple as making a bar graph in Excel. Other times, it means creating an extensive dashboard to be used by C-suite executives. The skills required in this step depends both on the company and the project. It includes but is not limited to, Powerpoint, Excel, Tableau, Matplotlib, etc\u2026", "Lastly, you\u2019ll be required to communicate your results, whether it be through a slide deck with several static graphs or a dashboard with several KPI metrics. Similar to the STAR method for answering behavioral, you would walk through the problem, the task, the approach you took, and the end results(s).", "I know that I\u2019m generalizing by simplifying and I know this doesn\u2019t encompass every single thing that a data analyst does in his/her day-to-day. However, for those who have absolutely no idea what a data analyst does the same way some of you have no idea what a speech-language pathologist does, this provides a decent idea of what they do.", "If this sounds of interest to you, that\u2019s great! At the beginning of 2020, Jeff Hale published an article, \u201cMost In Demand Tech Skills for Data Analysts\u201d. Through scraping and analyzing several job posting websites, he concluded that the top four skills for data analysts from most important to least are SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python.", "SQL is a programming language used to access and manipulate databases. Think of databases as a collection of tables, with a table being a collection of rows with the same variables. Think of an Excel table, like the one below:", "A query is a request for data from a database table or combination of tables. Using the table above, I would write a query if I wanted to find all patients that were older than 23 years old. As a data analyst, you\u2019ll be querying data on a frequent basis, either to retrieve information for other employees or to solve more complex problems.", "In case you don\u2019t already know, Excel is a spreadsheet program that allows you to enter data into the rows and columns of a sheet. You should know how to use basic functions like SUMIF, IF statements, and COUNT to name a few. Additionally, you should know how to create graphs and pivot tables. In practice, because companies value collaboration, you may be required to use Google Sheets, which is essentially the same thing.", "To be honest, Excel is something that I learned through experiences. If you don\u2019t have the opportunity to learn by doing, there are some amazing YouTube videos (that are also free) that you can use to learn Excel! See below.", "Tableau is a data visualization tool that\u2019s widely used across all industries. Typically, companies use Tableau to create dashboards, which are tools that display live and real-time metrics for businesses to look at. For example, a marketing team might create a dashboard that displays daily conversions, daily marketing spend, and daily website traffic.", "Python is a versatile programming language that is popular among data analysts and data scientists. Specifically, in Python, there are various libraries that one can use to perform data analyses like NumPy, Pandas, and Sci-kit Learn.", "If you want to learn how to use Python and these libraries, there are several resources that you can leverage online, like DataCamp, Udemy, Coursera, and Udacity. While I don\u2019t have any particular preference in learning Python, I encourage you to choose one resource and stick to it!", "If you like my work and want to support me\u2026", "Your home for data science.
