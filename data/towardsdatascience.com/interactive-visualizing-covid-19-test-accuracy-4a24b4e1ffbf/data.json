Above is 1,000 people.", "For the sake of easy numbers, let\u2019s say 2% of our population has Covid-19. This is the disease\u2019s \u201cprevalence.\u201d You can see about 2% of the group above is infected (orange).", "(Note: 2% is on the high side. For comparison, North Dakota is the \u201chotspot du jour\u201d and while we don\u2019t know the state\u2019s actual current prevalence, in the last 10 days there were 5,793 new cases for North Dakota\u2019s 762,062 citizens, or 0.7% of the population).", "To understand the accuracy differences between the most common Covid-19 tests, we\u2019re going to simulate how these tests might perform if we tested all 1,000 people in our population. We\u2019ll look at 5 different tests:", "Before we get into the tests themselves, let\u2019s understand what \u201caccuracy\u201d means for detecting an infection. There are 2 parts to a test\u2019s accuracy: Sensitivity and Specificity.", "To understand these metrics, we\u2019ll divide up our population between people who are actually healthy and people who are actually infected (Note: This is obviously impossible to do in real life, hence the need for tests in the first place).", "Above we have all 980 healthy people. Again, black is healthy.", "And here we have all 20 infected people. Orange means infected.", "Specificity measures how accurately a test diagnoses people who are not infected (i.e. healthy people).

For example, when PCR tests are based on a Nasopharyngeal Swabs (where they poke your brain with a Q-tip through your nose) they\u2019re less sensitive (73% sensitive), whereas a PCR test based on a sputum sample (coughing up phlegm) is more sensitive (97.2% sensitive)(src).", "Below, I\u2019ve tried to report both analytical and clinical measures, where possible. But for the sake of our experiments we\u2019ll use the \u201canalytical\u201d performance, since that measure is more readily available.", "When testing an actual sample of 1,000 people, results will vary quite a bit. For example\u2026", "Above you can see our 1,000 person population divided by their test results (for our hypothetical test). People who tested negative are in the top group. People who tested positive are in the bottom group.", "You\u2019ll notice a few infected (orange) people in the top group. These are the false negatives.

When a test has lower specificity, more people who are not infected will get incorrect positive results.", "Now that we understand the different metrics of test accuracy (specificity and sensitivity), let\u2019s look at some measurements for real tests and see how they\u2019d perform on our population.", "Diagnostic tests tell you whether the disease is present at the time of the test.", "PCR tests are the most common type of test. Even though the CDC\u2019s first attempts at these were faulty (src), PCR tests are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d and the most accurate. The downside: They require trained personnel, expensive equipment and several hours to complete (src).", "Rapid antigen tests became available more recently, starting in May. They\u2019re easier to operate on site and can return results in about 15 minutes (src), but they\u2019re generally less accurate. Part of the assumption with these tests is that they can be performed more frequently; even if they\u2019re less sensitive, more frequent tests can be effective over the long run (src).", "The FDA approved the Abbot ID NOW test back in March. This is the test they used in the White House (src). (We all know how that worked out.) Like other rapid tests, these work on site and can return results in 5\u201313 minutes. They\u2019re also supposed to be more accurate than antigen tests, but some studies suggest it\u2019s not as accurate as advertised (src).", "Antibody tests determine if the patient was infected at some point in the past.", "Blood serum tests detect the disease 1 to 3 weeks after the initial infection (src). They\u2019re generally accurate and you\u2019ll get results back in 3 to 7 days (src).", "Obviously flipping a coin isn\u2019t an effective way to detect Covid-19 (Dad!), but let\u2019s see what that looks like:", "As expected, you can see that about the same number of people test positive as test negative, and the infected people (orange) are evenly mixed through both groups.", "Where did this \u201ccoin toss\u201d idea come from? If you google \u201ccovid testing coin toss,\u201d you\u2019ll see several credible sources using this analogy.", "For example, this Scientific American explainer writes:", "\u201cWhat if there were a nearly perfect test with 99 percent sensitivity and specificity? Seems awesome, doesn\u2019t it? If that test were used in a country with 1 percent prevalence, then the predictive value of a positive test would be only 50 percent \u2014 a coin toss!\u201d", "\u201cBut the accuracy of even these tests depends on the percentage of people in the population who have actually been exposed to the virus. For example, in a population where the prevalence of infection is 5%, a test with 95% specificity and 95% sensitivity will return the same number of false positives as true positives, making any individual result no more useful than the flip of a coin.\u201d", "These examples are true, but a bit confusing. It\u2019s important to look at how they\u2019re qualifying the \u201ccoin flip\u201d statement. In both of these examples, they\u2019re referring to the test\u2019s Positive Predictive Value, which measures \u201cIf I get a positive test result, what\u2019s the probability that I actually have covid?\u201d", "This is different from saying \u201cTests provide no more information than doctors tossing coins in the air,\u201d but it does bring up an important point about how tests are used in practice.", "In real life, test results alone aren\u2019t necessarily sufficient to diagnose a person. You also have to consider their context and the person\u2019s prior probability of infection (e.g. Does it seem likely the patient could have been exposed? Did they come in contact with other confirmed patients? Are they symptomatic?).", "For example, suppose a positive result with no prior knowledge of the patient\u2019s exposure has a 50% chance of being a true positive, but if you know that person was previously exposed, the positive test result is much more likely to be true. Alternatively, in a population with a low prevalence, if a patient with no prior exposure gets a positive result, you might be a bit more skeptical that it\u2019s a false positive.", "This also explains why you might see the CDC change their screening criteria; as Covid\u2019s prevalence rises and falls, so does our prior probability of exposure and testing strategies will change to adapt.", "Who am I? No, no, who are you?!", "Hi! I\u2019m Eli Holder. I help clients design and develop effective interfaces between busy people and their messy data.
