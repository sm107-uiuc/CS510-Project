It is used to predict future values based on past observed values. The components you might observe in the time-series analysis are Trend, Seasonal, Irregular, and Cyclicity.", "In the case of such datasets where only one variable is observed at each time is called \u2018Univariate Time Series\u2019 and if two or more variables are observed at each time is called \u2018Multivariate Time Series\u2019.", "In this article, we will focus on the univariate time series for forecasting the sales with Auto ARIMA functionality in python which is almost similar to Auto ARIMA in R.", "Usually, in the basic ARIMA model, we need to provide the p,d, and q values which are essential. We use statistical techniques to generate these values by performing the difference to eliminate the non-stationarity and plotting ACF and PACF graphs. In Auto ARIMA, the model itself will generate the optimal p, d, and q values which would be suitable for the data set to provide better forecasting.", "Please note that this package was first named as \u201cPyramid\u201d and later changed to \u201cpmdarima\u201d.

You can get the dataset [here]", "After reading the dataset, make sure you do not have null values and change the data type of the \u2018Month\u2019 variable to a datetime object. Also, set the index of the dataframe to this variable using the set_index method.", "To understand the pattern of the data, we can simply plot using .plot() method.", "From the above, we can observe that there is a seasonality associated with the data. Every year there is a spike in increasing sales which continued from 1964 to 1972.", "Stationarity is an important concept in time-series and any time-series data should undergo a stationarity test before proceeding with a model.", "We use the \u2018Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\u2019 to check whether the data is stationary or not which is available in the \u2018pmdarima\u2019 package.", "From the above, we can conclude that the data is non-stationary. Hence, we would need to use the \u201cIntegrated (I)\u201d concept, denoted by value \u2018d\u2019 in time series to make the data stationary while building the Auto ARIMA model.", "Split into train and test datasets to build the model on the training dataset and forecast using the test dataset.", "Auto-Regressive (p) -> Number of autoregressive terms.", "Integrated (d) -> Number of nonseasonal differences needed for stationarity.", "Moving Average (q) -> Number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.", "In the Auto ARIMA model, note that small p,d,q values represent non-seasonal components, and capital P, D, Q represent seasonal components. It works similarly like hyper tuning techniques to find the optimal value of p, d, and q with different combinations and the final values would be determined with the lower AIC, BIC parameters taking into consideration.", "Here, we are trying with the p, d, q values ranging from 0 to 5 to get better optimal values from the model.

In the basic ARIMA or SARIMA model, you need to perform differencing and plot ACF and PACF graphs to determine these values which are time-consuming.", "However, it is always advisable to go with statistical techniques and implement the basic ARIMA model to understand the intuitive behind the p,d, and q values if you are new to time series.", "You can get the dataset and the complete code from my GitHub [here]", "Thank you for reading and Happy Learning! \ud83d\ude42", "Your home for data science.
