It gives us the tool to reconstruct the physical world for different kind of purposes, such as industrial or medical applications.The Graphics Turing Test in this field was passed a long time ago, as the current state of Photography and Cinematography proves. Reality and Fantasy are virtually indistinguishable, and animators can create photorealistic worlds in a matter of days.", "Graphics Turing Test: The subject views and interacts with a real or computer generated scene. The test is passed if the subject can not determine reality from simulated reality better than a random guess.", "A considerable help in this topic comes from the very recent advances in AI. Ian Goodfellow introduced a few years ago a new type of Neural Network Architecture called Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), able to push the boundaries of what is possible in Computer graphics. The applications are endless, but as Stan Lee taught us, great powers come with great responsibilities. Indeed generating images and videos indistinguishable from reality might pose a real threat to our Society, if not properly controlled. Watch this video of a Fake Obama generated with AI to understand what I mean.", "Simulating the dynamics of a fluid has always been a huge mathematical challenge. State-of-the-art techniques require massive computing power, even more for real-time simulations. First, it\u2019s important to remind that the term fluid includes liquids, gases and plasmas. Smoke, wind, water, fire are some examples of fluids.If you are familiar with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), you have encountered Navier-Stokes equations multiple times on your path. These partial differential equations relate the velocity, pressure, temperature and density of a moving fluid, extending the previous simpler models introducing the effect of viscosity. We are not going to describe them since they are very complex and not suitable without a proper background in fluid mechanics, but if you\u2019re interested in them you can check the link at the end of the article.Finding the solutions of these equations is not suitable for two reasons: they are data-dependent, so methods are truncated to fit within a computational budget, and might exhibit really slow asymptotic convergence.", "To solve these issues, machine learning has recentrly introduceda novel way to model fluid dynamics environments as a supervised regression problem. Neural networks and Regression forests gave good results, but they require a dataset of solutions provided by an exact solver. This is not possible during the test on simulations since the initial frames are generated by the model itself (which is not an exact solver). Results are imperfect, and the applications of this model get limited.", "A new exciting approach to describe the physical world involves the concept of intuitive or na\u00efve physics. This new field of AI concerns the ability to predict outcomes of physical interactions involving macroscopic objects based on experience. Let\u2019s see an example: babies do not know what gravity is, but through experience, they own the concept of it. The idea is to create artificial neural models able to model intuitive physics. Into this camp falls the work of Tompson et al. (link at the end), who developed a novel and tailored ConvNet architecture to replace existing Eulerian-based solvers and introduced a new training-loss which guarantees faster convergence.", "Obtaining realistic human body modelling is one of the main goals in computer graphics. The surface of the body needs to deform naturally. In real-time applications, the body is controlled by skeletal movements. For this reason, the surface is linked to its skeletal pose and the animation of the skin is a function of it. How is this achieved?", "The most common algorithm is Linear blend skinning (LBS), used also by Unity and Unreal. It is not computationally intensive and gives good results in the majority of situations. Still, there are some drawbacks. The main issue is the excessive loss of volume for strong bends or unrealistic effects during rotation of joints.", "A second important strategy is data-driven body models. This model divides the parameters for pose and shape and permits a deeper control of the body. The main problem here is the absence of control for non-linear dynamics. What do I mean with non-linear dynamics? Soft tissues, like the belly of a person, do not react in a linear way to forces. It bounces, rotates, jiggles. These movements cannot be properly described by non-linear models.To solve this problem, data-driven dynamics models were introduced. These algorithms are typically used for facial movements or cloth dynamics. A very interesting application of this last category was applied recently by Casas and Otaduy (link of the paper at the end). They successfully developed a data-driven model to simulate non-linear soft-tissue dynamics trained with publicly available skeletal motion data. As every machine learning model, also this novel methodology cannot properly describe deformations far from the training set. The only way to overcome this limitation, when necessary, is to adopt physics-based body models. These models are extremely precise but significantly more complex.", "A third great challenge is the simulation of cloth. Cloth material recovery methods need complex experimental set up to acquire physical properties. Reproducing the correct behaviour of fabric might be extremely complicated, and researchers are applying machine learning methods to recreate the dynamics of it. Understanding properties of cloth do not find its application only in Animations, but also in totally different fields. Let\u2019s consider a virtual try-on system for clothing: capturing the dynamics of this material can open to a new broad range of services offered in e-commerce. This is especially true if we consider the advances in Virtual Reality, which would allow a more realistic virtual shopping giving us the possibility to try clothes virtually.Retrieving physical properties of a dynamical system is achieved in multiple ways at the moment. The most straightforward approach is through measurements, sampling physical quantities and estimating dependent properties. A second important strategy is to simulate, optimize and iterate the dynamical system, extracting features progressively closer to the real value.", "We have just seen three challenges of AI in Computer Graphics. In the reproduction of the physical world, these three categories are blended: think of a flag moved by the wind. In this case, all three concepts are present in a single event.", "There is, of course, a whole set of unsolved problems, and I am going to analyse them in a following article. If you enjoyed this article, I\u2019d love it if you hit the clap button \ud83d\udc4f so others might stumble upon it.
