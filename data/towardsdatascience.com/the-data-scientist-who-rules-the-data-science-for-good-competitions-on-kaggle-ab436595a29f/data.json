Being able to communicate the insights is necessary so that others can take the required actions based on the results of these findings. One of the most effective ways to communicate data is through storytelling. But to be compelling storytellers, we need to simplify things and not complicate them so that the real essence of the analysis is not lost. In short, don\u2019t simply show data, tell a story with it.", "In this edition of the Kaggle Grandmasters\u2019 interview, I bring to light the amazing and inspiring journey of a master storyteller: Shivam Bansal, a Kaggle Kernels Grandmaster and a Senior Data Scientist at H2O.ai. He is currently based out of Singapore and is involved in H2O.ai\u2019s APAC activities. Shivam is a Computer Science graduate from India. He went on to obtain his Masters in Business Analytics from the National University of Singapore in 2019, where he also won the Outstanding Capstone Project Award.", "Shivam has very interesting and a focussed Kaggle journey and in his own words :", "\u201cI joined kaggle in January, and by the end of the year, I became kernels Grandmaster, reached overall rank 2nd, won 10 kernel awards (including three weekly kernels awards and four swag prizes), and also won 3 kernel competitions of data science for goods challenges.\u201d", "Here is an excerpt from my conversation with Shivam :", "Shivam: I got to know about Kaggle in 2014 when I was working in my first company. I was developing a text analytics framework, including sentiment analysis, and at the same time, a similar competition was also running on Kaggle. I did not join Kaggle at that time but used it as a reference for some good discussions and knowledge. I joined kaggle after four years, in early 2018 and took part in one of the competitions on toxic comment classification. In that competition, I learned a lot from many Kernels shared by others. I realized that Kaggle kernels are one of the most valuable tools for anyone trying to learn and practice data science. I also decided to share one of the kernels as part of the competition, and luckily it was selected as the winner for one of the awards.", "In April 2018, I participated in Data science for good competition organized by DonorsChoose, Kaggle, and Google. I created a hybrid recommendation engine in a kernel, and it was selected as the winner of the competition. This was my first major win on Kaggle.", "Shivam: I enjoy participating in data science for good challenges. These competitions present an exceptional, unique, and challenging set of problem statements. Unlike traditional ML specific competitions in which a leaderboard does the evaluation, these competitions are more open-ended. Such competitions demand solutions that are complete in almost all aspects of data science \u2014 from data mining, cleaning, engineering, analysis, modeling, visualizations, insights, and, most importantly, storytelling. I like the fact that these competitions are very close to real-life data science projects.", "Shivam: Any analytics or a data science problem is inherently unstructured. This means that there are no clear goals and tasks to be done; hence, it is sometimes difficult to model and approach. I always try to bring a structure in the problem statement by breaking it down into smaller tasks. I then try to connect the tasks and prepare a rough pipeline containing the possible solutions/codes for every job.", "As a first goal, I make sure to create an end to end version of my kernel with all components and tasks ready. At this point, the results may not be effective, and state of the art, but I iteratively improve my kernel by adding visualizations, insights, explanations, code refactoring, etc. This type of approach brings clarity in the entire problem state and the solutions and also helps in improving the skills related to analytical thinking, structured thinking, and critical thinking.", "Shivam: Visualizations are a crucial part of the entire data science workflow. The ability to clearly show information and insights present in a dataset is highly appreciated and sought after skill in the industry. Be it at the EDA stage or the post-modeling stage; visualizations play an essential role. The end-users of your work may not always understand the technical aspects of a data or the results, but when visualized using different plots, interactions, animations, and a variety of graphs, it becomes more apparent. There are many areas in which visuals show importance \u2014 Data Storytelling, presenting insights from the data to business users, and even explaining black-box machine learning models.", "Shivam: My goal is to contribute to the new products that H2O.ai is currently building and also help improve DriverlessAI with new features and recipes. Some of the areas that I am looking to make an impact are unsupervised machine learning, natural language processing, auto-insights, visual analytics, natural language generation for auto-narratives, and AI to do BI. I also actively work with sales and pre-sales teams in the APAC region to get more customers onboard, educate prospective customers, and assist in their specific projects and queries. Additionally, I also work with customer success teams to help different organizations enable AI in their projects.", "Shivam: Apart from Kaggle, I have learned a lot from blogs and websites like Analytics Vidhya, Towards Data Science, and KDnuggets. These blogs are good sources to get to know about a new concept. To get a more comprehensive knowledge of data science, I recommend courses from experts like deeplearning.ai and fast.ai.", "Shivam: Solving the micro-finance problems for the underbanked population in developing countries. Many individuals or small enterprises are denied loans because they do not have access to banks and thus have no credit history. I would want to use concepts like network science, graph theory, and unstructured data to develop models to assist this segment of the population.", "Shivam: Data science is all about ideas and experiments. It is all about trying those ideas and experiments, and re-iterating again and again until a successful stage is reached. It\u2019s about developing a mindset of \u2018willing to try\u2019 different experiments and failing. It\u2019s also about taking the first step and keep improving.", "Another valuable advice would be to always think from an end to end perspective. This means that it is necessary to keep a business perspective in mind while developing a data science solution. This thinking helps in coming up with a creative and relevant solution for any business problem at hand.", "Lastly, while starting to learn about data science, there are plenty of useful resources on the internet, take one, start one, stick to it, and complete it. With so many resources out there, it is easy to get distracted, and I have seen many people failing to achieve that. To get the most out of any course, the best way is to complete it.", "Shivam\u2019s kernels on Kaggle are always a great amalgamation of thorough research, crisp documentation, and good quality visualizations. The hard work that he puts behind his work is tremendous and is pretty obvious. Ben Shneiderman once said that the purpose of visualizations is insight, not pictures, and Shivam\u2019s kernels are a testimony to this fact.", "Your home for data science.
