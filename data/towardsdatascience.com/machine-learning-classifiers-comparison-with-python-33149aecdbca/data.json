Some of the most widely used algorithms are logistic regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, stochastic gradient descent, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests and support vector machines.", "Determining the right estimator for a given job represents one of the most critical and hardest part while solving machine learning problems. Each estimator is suitable for a specific type of data and problem. Scikit-learn, one of the most popular Python libraries for machine learning, provides the following chart to guide the user on the decision process for choosing the most appropriate estimator.", "Classification models must be evaluated to determine their degree of effectiveness for performing a specific task. While good classification models are useful for prediction purposes, poor classification models lead to unreliable outcomes, and thus, are not useful for the user.", "Performance evaluation metrics are based on the total number of the following variables:", "which are visually represented in a matrix (i.e. confusion matrix) where one of its axis is the label that the machine learning model predicted, and the other the actual label:", "There are four main performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of classification models:", "For the following example, let\u2019s evaluate the performance of five different classification models (i.e. logistic regression, support vector classifier, decision tree, random forest and Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes classifier) on the Framingham Heart Study data set (a study conducted to identify the common factors that contribute to cardiovascular diseases) to determine the one that leads to the most reliable outcomes.", "The following Python code will be divided into five major steps. Lines of comments are included to provide a brief explanation and guide you through the coding process.", "According to the plot above, the Framingham Heart Study contains more data points corresponding to women than to men.", "The plot above reveals that the Framingham Heart Study is a heavily unbalanced data set. Most of the data points correspond to a negative class (i.e. low risk of developing a cardiovascular disease in ten years). Further data balancing will be necessary to address this issue.", "Interesting. Even though the total number of data points corresponding to men was lower, the plot above suggests that the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease on men is higher than on women.", "The plot above shows an equal number of classes is equal after having used the Random Under Sampling technique to balance the data set.", "According to the results from the table above, the support vector classifier obtained the best accuracy, recall and F1 scores, and the second best precision score, making it the most reliable machine learning classifier for this data set. On the other hand, it can be stated that the decision tree and Gaussian Naive Bayes models had the poorest performance, and thus, are not reliable classification models for this data set.", "After the support vector classifier has been identified as the most reliable machine learning classifier, the next step would consist in tuning its parameters to determine if its performance can further be improved.", "It is worth specifying that during the instantiation of the machine learning classifiers in the code above, their parameters were set to the default ones, except for the max_iter parameter in the logistic regression model to achieve model convergence and the dual parameter in the support vector classifier since the number of samples is larger than the number of features.", "In the previous example, the classification models were built using the entire data set (i.e. data points corresponding to men and women), which assumes that the factors that contribute to cardiovascular diseases have the same weight on both genders. As a way of practicing your coding skills, try splitting the data set by gender and build classification models for each one. Compare their performances using the evaluation metrics discussed in this article and evaluate if it results more convenient to have independent classification models for each gender or a common one for both of them.", "Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms have many useful and diverse applications to solve problems and complex tasks. In addition to data science, they have become highly popular research trends within academics and professionals with new emerging research lines in a wide range of fields. Researches continue updating and developing new programming libraries and packages for multiple programming languages and software to facilitate the implementation and execution of such algorithms.", "Python represents a great free and open-source programming language capable of performing a wide range of machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science and data analytical tasks. Some of its most popular machine learning and deep learning libraries include scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Pandas and NLTK. Data scientist and analysts must take the best out of these tools to solve real-life complex problems and tasks to bring added value to an organization, client or research field.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
