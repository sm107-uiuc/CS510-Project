Popular computer vision techniques such as image classification and object detection have been used extensively to solve a lot of computer vision problems. In image classification, an entire image is classified. Object detection extends image classification by detecting the location of individual objects present in an image.", "Some computer vision problems require deeper understanding of the contents in the images. Classification and object detection may not be suitable to solve these problems. The need for an effective technique to solve some critical computer vision problems gives rise to the invention of Image Segmentation.", "Every image is made up of a group of pixel values. Image Segmentation is the task of classifying an image at the pixel level. A machine is able to analyse an image more effectively by dividing it into different segments according to the classes assigned to each of the pixel values present in the image.", "The distinct technique employed in Image Segmentation makes it applicable in solving critical computer vision problems. These are problems that require detailed information about the objects present in an image, details that cannot be provided by classifying the entire image or providing bounding boxes for the objects present in the image.
