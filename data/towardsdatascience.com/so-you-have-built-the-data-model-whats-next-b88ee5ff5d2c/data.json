As I moved deeper into this role, I was exposed to more data-modeling related projects, on top of insight-generation analysis projects. It was an exciting process, from feature selection to fine-tuning model parameters, until we get a nice, working model.", "Then challenge strikes. I didn\u2019t know what to do next to get my model live in production. I spent weeks asking and researching around on what to do next and found the following in summary.", "I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re already aware of the evaluation parameter required for a model. Be it MAE, MAPE, RMSE for regression-based model or precision, recall, AUCPR for a classifier-based model. It\u2019s quite standard practice to understand how well your model is performing. Read more about the evaluation metrics here.", "Looking deeper into the evaluation, you can look at other measures to understand how the model will be performing in different conditions and what is the best way to use it.", "Now onto the more \u201cchallenging\u201d part of making data models live. You need to start thinking about the tech stack: where this model will be sitting for production, what are the different data pipeline components needed.", "You can start by creating an architecture design. This explains how components from your model will work together, from data inputs, model trigger, model serving, to model output and consumption. Here is one example of how things might work out.", "First, you have a backend server/service that receives a request when the model needs to run. Then it pushes the job into a queue and responds to the user to wait while the job is being processed. Eventually, the worker will pick up the job, remove it from the queue, and process it. It is taking all the data needed from the registered feature store (or internal database), and doing transformation in the model. When the transformation is done and the model output is generated, the worker will show it to the server, which relays it back to the user.", "After setting up the architecture, you can start working on deployment and test the end-to-end pipeline.", "Is it producing the expected output? Are the delay time acceptable?", "Make sure that you explore possible data architecture with the data engineers, and discuss approaches of product-model integration with the product engineers in your organization.", "Specifically for the deployment framework, you can go to this post and this post which I find useful.", "When your model is being put into production, it usually means there is going to be some service(s) for your organization depends on it. Depending on how critical your model or product is, you might need to set up different alerts for different sets of people or teams in your organization.", "Some factors to be considered when setting up the monitoring and/or alerting for the model :", "Documentation is an important part of model maintainability and reproducibility. With good documentation, you can help onboarding people faster into the project, be it for issue investigation, or further work on the project. This is especially useful when those work is being done by people that are not involved in the development or deployment process.", "Below are the components to be shown in model documentation (refer to the Kaggle Model Documentation Guidelines)", "Your work as an analyst doesn\u2019t necessarily stop when you are done with fine-tuning and saving the model. There are still many things to be thought about and worked on to get this model live on your product. It is nice if you can directly hand over the model to the data engineering team and let them do the rest, but understanding how to get this done will also be useful in your collaboration with them.", "Good luck with taking your model into production!", "Thank you for the Gojek Data Engineering team, Data Scientists, and Data Science Platform team that helps me understand these concepts on my previous projects :)", "Your home for data science.
