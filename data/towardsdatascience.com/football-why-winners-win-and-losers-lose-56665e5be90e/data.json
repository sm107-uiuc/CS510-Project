Disclaimer: they are both important.", "The process of data collection for this notebook is described in this Kaggle kernel: Web Scraping Football Statistics", "In the next visualization, we will check how many teams from each league were in top 4 during last 5 years. It can give us some info about stability of top teams from different countries.", "As we can see from these bar charts, there are teams that in last 5 years were in top 4 only once, which means it is not something common, which means if we dig deeper, we can find that there is a factor of luck that might have played in favour to these teams. It\u2019s just a theory, so let\u2019s look closer to those outliers.", "The teams that were in top 4 only once during the last 5 seasons are:", "In this section, we will try to find some patterns that can help us understand what are some of the ingredients of the victory soup :D. Starting with Bundesliga.", "By looking at the table and barchart we see that Bayern every year got more points than they should have, they scored more than expected and missed less than expected (except for 2018, which didn\u2019t break their plan of winning the season, but it gives some hints that Bayern played worse this year, although the competitors didn\u2019t take advantage of it).", "As we can see from the chart above that in 2014 and 2015 Barcelona was creating enough moments to win the title and do not rely on personal skills or luck, from these numbers we can actually say that THE Team was playing there.", "In 2016 there were lots of competition between Madrid and Barcelona and in the end, Madrid got luckier / had more guts in one particular game (or Barcelona got unlucky / didn\u2019t have balls) and it was the cost of the title. I am sure that if we dig deeper that season we can find that particular match.", "In 2017 and 2018 Barcelona\u2019s success was mostly tributed to actions of Lionel Messi who was scoring or making assists in situations where normal players wouldn\u2019t do that. What led to such a jump in xPTS difference. What makes me think (having the context that Real Madrid is very active on transfer market this season) can end up bad. Just subjective opinion based on numbers and watching Barcelona games. Really hope I am wrong.", "In EPL we see the clear trend that tells you: \u201cTo win you have to be better than statistics\u201d. Interesting case here is Leicester story of victory in 2015: they got 12 points more than they should\u2019ve and at the same time Arsenal got 6 points less than expected! This is why we love football, because such inexplicable things happen. I am not telling is total luck, but it played its role here.", "Another interesting thing is Manchester City of 2018 \u2014 they are super stable! They scored just one goal more than expected, missed 2 less and got 7 additional points, while Liverpool fought really well, had little bit more luck on their side, but couldn\u2019t win despite being 13 points ahead of their expected.", "Pep is finishing building the machine of destruction. Man City creates and converts their moments based on skill and do not rely on luck \u2014 it makes them very dangerous in the next season.", "In French Ligue 1 we continue to see the trend \u201cto win you have to execute 110% because 100% is not enough\u201d. Here Paris Saint Germain dominates totally. Only in 2016 we get an outlier in the face of Monaco that scored 30 goals more than expected!!! and got almost 17 points more than expected! Luck? Quite a good piece of it. PSG was good that year, but Monaco was extraordinary. Again, we cannot claim it\u2019s pure luck or pure skill, but a perfect combination of both in the right place and time.", "In Italian Serie A Juventus is dominating 8 years in a row although cannot show any major success in Champions League. I think by checking this chart and numbers we can understand that Juve doesn\u2019t have strong enough competition inside the country and gets lots of \u201clucky\u201d points, which again derives from multiple factors and we can see that Napoli outperformed Juventus by xPTS twice, but it is a real life and in, for example, 2017, Juve was crazy and scored additional 26 goals (or created goals from nowhere), while Napoli missed 3 more than expected (due to error of goalkeeper or maybe excellence of some team sin 1 or 2 particular matches). As with the situation in La Liga when Real Madrid became a champion I am sure we can find 1 or 2 games that were key that year.", "Details matter in football. You see, one error here, one woodwork there and you\u2019ve lost the title.", "I do not follow Russian Premier League, so just by coldly looking at data, we see the same pattern as scoring more than you deserve and also interesting situation with CSKA Moscow from 2015 to 2017. During these years these guys were good but converted their advantages only once, the others two \u2014 if you do not convert, you get punished or your main competitor just converts better.", "There is no justice in football :D. Although, I believe with VAR the numbers will become more stable in the next seasons. Because one of the reasons of those additional goals and points are errors of arbiters.", "As there are 6 leagues with different teams and stats, I decided to focus on one, in the beginning, to test different approaches and then replicate the final analysis model on other 5. And as I watch mostly La Liga I will start with this competition as I know the most about it.", "Now let\u2019s see those number on a chart.", "From the charts above, we can clearly see that top teams score more, concede less and get more points than expected. That\u2019s why these teams are top teams. And totally opposite situation with outsiders. The teams from the middleplay average. Totally logical, no huge insights here.", "Z-Score is the number of standard deviations from the mean a data point is. We can use it to find outliers in our dataset by assuming that |z-score| > 3 is an outlier.", "12 outliers in total detected with zscore. Poor Osasuna in 2016 \u2014 almost 30 not deserved goals.", "As we can see from this data, being in outlier space top does not yet make you win the season. But if you miss your opportunities or receive goals where you shouldn\u2019t and do that toooooo much \u2014 you deserve relegation. Losing and being average is much easier than winning.", "IQR \u2014 is the difference between the first quartile and third quartile of a set of data. This is one way to describe the spread of a set of data.", "A commonly used rule says that a data point is an outlier if it is more than 1.5 \u22c5 IQR above the third quartile or below the first quartile. Said differently, low outliers are below Q1 \u2212 1.5 \u22c5 IQR and high outliers are above Q3 + 1.5 \u22c5 IQR.", "So we can say that it is very probable that every year in one of 6 leagues there will be a team that gets a ticket to Champions League or Europa Legue with the help of luck on top of their great skills or there is a looser that gets to the second division, because they cannot convert their moments.", "Our winners and losers with brilliant performance and brilliant underperformance.", "Football is a low-scoring game and one goal can change the entire picture of the game and even end results. That\u2019s why long term analysis gives you a better picture of the situation.", "With the introduction of xG metric (and others that derive from this) now we can really evaluate the performance of the team on a long run and understand the difference between top teams, middle class teams and absolute outsiders.", "xG brings new arguments into discussions around football what makes it even more interesting. And at the same time, the game doesn\u2019t lose this factor of uncertainty and the possibility of crazy things happening. Actually now, these crazy things have a chance to be explained.", "In the end, we have found that it is almost 100% chance that something weird will happen in one of the leagues. It is just a question of time how epic that will be.", "Original work with interactive charts can be found here.", "Data and Cloud Developer, love technology in general, maybe too much humor and never too serious, based in amazing Barcelona"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
