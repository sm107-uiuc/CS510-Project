Technologies \u2014 like the Johns Hopkins dashboard, contact tracing, and data analytics \u2014 compose the \u201cvirtual front lines\u201d of our attack on the pandemic and continuously prove to be driving sources of change. However one question still remains: Exactly how valuable are these fields?", "In this article we will take a snapshot of where Data Science is in 2020 and take a deep dive into where salaries and other forms of compensation stand.", "To answer this, let\u2019s move on over and check out Payscale: a salary insights platform. Taking a look, we can see that it reports that the current median salary for a Data Scientist is $95,973 with a range spanning from 66k to 134k.", "However, that\u2019s not the whole picture. If we look closely, we also see that Payscale reports an average bonus of $9000 along with $976 \u2014 $25k in profit sharing and $1k \u2014 $10k in commission.", "As you\u2019d expect, the amount of experience does have a direct correlation to pay. Take a look at this graph for a quick breakdown!", "The key takeaway can be deduced from the binned years of experience. What pops out is the fact that the median salary can be met fairly quickly: according to this graph, within the first five years, you can be making more than the median salary of a Data Scientist!", "Moving on, let\u2019s take a look at how location affects salary:", "As expected, silicon valley is once again raking in the big bucks. However, I wouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions too quick; these salaries are highly correlated to the cost of living within the region.", "For example, even though working in San Francisco nets a~30 percent salary increase, you could still be making less than someone working in Atlanta after accounting for CoL (Cost of Living). Let\u2019s look a bit deeper into this: using this CoL calculator, we can see just how big of a discrepancy there is between San Francisco and Atlanta:", "Atlanta is significantly cheaper when it comes to every department! Just to show you how significant this is, let\u2019s take a look at the average national rent: $1,468. This comes out to the average monthly rent being $1380 in Atlanta and a whopping $3392 in San Francisco. In all, this nets an annual difference of $24,144! This still does not account for other fees like utilities and groceries; both of which vary significantly between the two cities. So before you take that six figure salary, make sure it actually is a six figure salary!", "So now that we have a good understanding of how much a Data Scientist makes, how does it stack up to other Computer Science professions?", "This list figure gives us a good snapshot of the ranges similar career salaries fall into. The most surprising thing to me personally is that the median salary for a Data Scientist is over $10,000 more than a Senior Software Engineer! Likewise, the median salary of a Data Scientist is significantly greater than every profession listed \u2014 crazy right?!", "For a more in depth look into the salaries of different positions, let\u2019s dive into the Stack Overflow Coding Salary Calculator. As stated within the page, the calculator \u201cis based on the comprehensive data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, and this large, extensive survey data allows us to build an accurate model that reflects trends in how coding work is being compensated around the world.\u201d", "The thing that pops out immediately is the placement of Data Engineer and Data Scientist as the top three paying developer roles in every country the data was collected from. When looking at the countries, you can notice how much different roles and their compensation vary depending on region; for example, take a look at the ranking of QA or test developers amongst the different countries. The fact that the data roles are so consistently ranked is an amazing sign. It shows that all countries require and value data scientists to the same extent!", "However, there\u2019s a catch. Before you go off and think that the best way to make money is becoming a data scientist check this excerpt the stack overflow researcher made in the calculator:", "[W]e have evidence here that high salaries for data scientists and data engineers can be accounted for by high education and high experience levels alone. Data scientists are highly paid, but not more so than a similarly educated developer doing other kinds of work. (Both bachelor\u2019s degrees and even higher degrees are associated with significantly increased pay for people who code.) Over the past several years, data science and data engineering work have been moving away from an extreme outlier position into the mainstream of software work.", "In short, although data engineers and data scientists do make the most money, a major factory that plays into the salaries is higher education and experience. As noted above, the individuals who tend to pick up data roles are much more likely to have degrees and years of experience.", "So, how much is a data scientist worth in 2020? Well, if you want a straight answer ~$100,000 on average.", "BUT before you go off and start applying to data scientist roles chasing money, let me highlight something. As stated in the developer calculator above, data scientists do not make significantly more than a similarly educated developer.", "It is important that you come to the realization that, more than the money you make when you pick up the job, you should value the amount of enjoyment you get from the role. At the end of the day, similarly educated and experienced developers will make fairly identical salaries.", "Find the role you\u2019re passionate about and the money will follow. Don\u2019t flip that around and chase the money hoping to find your passion!", "Your home for data science.
