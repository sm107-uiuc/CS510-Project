Here, I wanted to talk about the analytic value the nine different risk scores we built. In healthcare, an approximation for how sick someone is is if a patient goes back to the hospital following a discharge.The importance of this from both the care and policy landscapes can\u2019t be overstated . So a useful heuristic we developed when building model features across analytics@hf is \u201cdoes X predict readmissions?\u201d I\u2019m glad you asked, dear reader. It actually creates a", "We built a literature-beating model with just our social determinants personas\u2026and we did it in 20 minutes using DataRobot. Here it is \u2014 it\u2019s a glm-ensemble of xgBoosted trees with early stopping, some anomaly detection, random forest with gini importance, Vowpal stagewise polynomial feature classifier (but that doesn\u2019t really matter). We ran our analysis in 20 minutes courtesy of DataRobot!", "Pretty charts aside, the point is I don\u2019t even need other features to create an awesome readmissions model. In fact, when I add in my 800ish column modeling asset (on which I should write a blog) the auc creeps up to 0.80, which is definitely worth the work but the effort vs reward should be kept in mind by the data science project manager.", "What do our 9 risk scores tell us?", "Probably two things. Let\u2019s see the correlation matrix:", "A trick to doing PCA by eye, and don\u2019t tell your stats teachers, is to order your correlation matrix by the angle of the eigenvalues.", "Using the standard orthogonal transform in R\u2019s Psych package\u2019s PCA function we tried to figure out what latent factors underlie these 9 scores.", "What do we find? Well we see two real drivers of variance (93% of the variance is explained by two factors). You could make a case that we should force 3 factors given housing circumstance loads equally on both, but we don\u2019t get much more variance explained doing that. So we call the latent factors \u2018Social Situation\u2019and \u2018Work-Related.\u2019 And they make logical sense. Going forward, we\u2019ll use the component scores for parsimony.", "Can we create a persona view for social risk?", "Let\u2019s finish this exploration with a customer-segmentation type analysis, only for the social scores. According to the gap statistic method we should expect 18 clusters in our data (of 9 columns and 1.4 million rows). So I ran k-means on the risk scores and wrote down names for the groups based on their risk scores aggregates. I also created a severity score so a business unit might know which cohort to prioritize, using the descriptions to connect to social services like SNAP , PATH or food pantries. We\u2019re currently using these scores to help our care managers connect members with these types of resources via a social connection platform called NowPow.", "This is the kind of thing we can share with decision makers and clinicians to help them prioritize which members need which type of social support. Most of our members are low risk on most of the scores. The ultimate goal is a clear view of risk levels, intervention scores and recommended programs to help members get connected with services that can help them be healthier, safer and more stable lives.", "So we learned two things You can get industry-leading prediction results by incorporating social risk scores into your health outcomes models. We have two or three latent factors in the description of social risk and we can use them to create personas for more targeted intervention.", "One last thing to discuss\u2026why doesn\u2019t everyone just do this? I\u2019ll write more about this in a future post but to create all this, I used Python, R, Tableau, Excel, DataRobot and most importantly, the snipping tool. There\u2019s no perfect package, there\u2019s no one kind of beautiful soup, just get the job done as compellingly as possible as quickly as possible. Two variables (speed and completeness of story) to trade on some economist\u2019s marginal curve; your value as analyst is where on the curve you lie.", "Your home for data science.
