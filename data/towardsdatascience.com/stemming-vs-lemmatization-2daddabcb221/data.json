In this blog, you may study stemming and lemmatization in an exceedingly practical approach covering the background, applications of stemming and lemmatization, and the way to stem and lemmatize words, sentences and documents using the Python nltk package which is the natural language package provided by Python", "In natural language processing, you may want your program to acknowledge that the words \u201ckick\u201d and \u201ckicked\u201d are just different tenses of the same verb. this can be the concept of reducing different kinds of a word to a core root.", "Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers.", "Often when searching text for a certain keyword, it helps if the search returns variations of the word. For instance, searching for \u201cboat\u201d might also return \u201cboats\u201d and \u201cboating\u201d. Here, \u201cboat\u201d would be the stem for [boat, boater, boating, boats].", "Stemming is a somewhat crude method for cataloging related words; it essentially chops off letters from the end until the stem is reached. This works fairly well in most cases, but unfortunately English has many exceptions where a more sophisticated process is required. In fact, spaCy doesn\u2019t include a stemmer, opting instead to rely entirely on lemmatization.", "One of the most common \u2014 and effective \u2014 stemming tools is Porter\u2019s Algorithm developed by Martin Porter in 1980. The algorithm employs five phases of word reduction, each with its own set of mapping rules. In the first phase, simple suffix mapping rules are defined, such as:", "Note how the stemmer recognizes \u201crunner\u201d as a noun, not a verb form or participle. Also, the adverbs \u201ceasily\u201d and \u201cfairly\u201d are stemmed to the unusual root \u201ceasili\u201d and \u201cfairli\u201d", "This is somewhat of a misnomer, as Snowball is the name of a stemming language developed by Martin Porter. The algorithm used here is more accurately called the \u201cEnglish Stemmer\u201d or \u201cPorter2 Stemmer\u201d. It offers a slight improvement over the original Porter stemmer, both in logic and speed. Since nltk uses the name SnowballStemmer, we\u2019ll use it here.", "In this case, the stemmer performed the same as the Porter Stemmer, with the exception that it handled the stem of \u201cfairly\u201d more appropriately with \u201cfair\u201d", "Stemming has its drawbacks. If given the token saw, stemming might always return saw, whereas lemmatization would likely return either see or saw depending on whether the use of the token was as a verb or a noun", "In contrast to stemming, lemmatization looks beyond word reduction and considers a language\u2019s full vocabulary to apply a morphological analysis to words. The lemma of \u2018was\u2019 is \u2018be\u2019 and the lemma of \u2018mice\u2019 is \u2018mouse\u2019.", "Lemmatization is typically seen as much more informative than simple stemming, which is why Spacy has opted to only have Lemmatization available instead of Stemming", "Lemmatization looks at surrounding text to determine a given word\u2019s part of speech, it does not categorize phrases.", "Here we\u2019re using an f-string to format the printed text by setting minimum field widths and adding a left-align to the lemma hash value.", "Notice that the lemma of `saw` is `see`, `mice` is the plural form of `mouse`, and yet `eighteen` is its own number, *not* an expanded form of `eight`.", "One thing to note about lemmatization is that it is harder to create a lemmatizer in a new language than it is a stemming algorithm because we require a lot more knowledge about structure of a language in lemmatizers.", "Stemming and Lemmatization both generate the foundation sort of the inflected words and therefore the only difference is that stem may not be an actual word whereas, lemma is an actual language word.Stemming follows an algorithm with steps to perform on the words which makes it faster. Whereas, in lemmatization, you used a corpus also to supply lemma which makes it slower than stemming. you furthermore might had to define a parts-of-speech to get the proper lemma.", "The above points show that if speed is concentrated then stemming should be used since lemmatizers scan a corpus which consumes time and processing. It depends on the problem you\u2019re working on that decides if stemmers should be used or lemmatizers.", "Thanks to Jose Portilla\u2019s work for helping throughout", "Note- All the code explained has been given in the GitHub repo with some more examples to enhance your knowledge and get a better grip over this topic.
