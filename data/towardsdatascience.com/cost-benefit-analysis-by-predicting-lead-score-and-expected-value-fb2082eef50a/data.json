Anytime someone comes to their website, they either enroll in course or do not. Those who are not getting enrolled even after seeing the course information are called leads.", "Now, to attract those leads back to their courses company tries different strategies like e-mail marketing or special discount etc. problem is that if, for example, the company have 50 leads, and it sends out an email to all 100 of them, it is possible that only 10 or 15 of them will enroll. Thus, there is a loss of money and effort on the company\u2019s behalf which take us to a cost-benefit analysis that we will later.", "The solution is to use predictive modeling to determine the probability of each lead enrolling in the course so that the company only give discounts or sends email to those high potential leads.", "To see the whole analysis check out this Notebook. It follows a classification method where the model is trained with target variables called conversion(0,1) as where 0 means customer will not return and 1 means customer will return.", "One hot encoding is a method of converting categorical variables into numeric values so that it can be interpreted by machine learning models. The random forest is an ensemble method which works iteratively by selecting a subset of variables as predictor and tries to reduce the variance of the model. Read more about random forest in this book \u201cAn Introduction to Statistical Learning\u201d.", "By applying a machine learning model, I have produced the probability of each lead becoming their customer and is shown in the picture below. These are just a subset of all the values which we can arrange in order from highest probability to lowest.", "Above we saw the result in term of probability, below is the result in terms of binary information simply stating yes or no.", "Although the accuracy is 80% we should understand it is taking probability of 0.5 as a threshold for classification. In other words, whosoever have probability greater than 0.5 is considered Not Churn, and otherwise for churn. That is a bad idea because maybe 0.1 is the right threshold, or 0.2 or maybe 0.3 in order to get the best outcome.", "Precision: It states how many of the positive predicted values from our model are really correct. (True positive) divided by (True Positive + True Negative)", "Recall: It is also called true positive rate, which states that out of all the people positives how many of them are correctly predicted. (True Positive) divided by (True Positive + False Negative)", "False Positive Rate: Out of all the negative, how many of them are actually predicted as negative.", "In simple words, the AUC curve solves the problem of defining the correct threshold-based classification. It changes the value of threshold from 0.0% to 100.0% rather than keeping it at 0.5% and draws a graph which allows us to determine best possible outcome.", "It might seem complicated but the crux is that the red line at around 0.58 signifies that the best threshold to classify the result is at 0.58. Meaning that class 0 if less than 0.58 and class 1 if greater than 0.58 to produce best possible accuracy.", "Depending upon the business use cases each cell of confusion matrix (true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative) can have different impact on the outcome. For example, wrongly classifying someone as having cancer where he later finds out he does not (False Positive) have cancer may cost him money and stress, however, wrongly classifying someone not having a cancer where later he realized he had a cancer (False Negative) will cost him his life, the latter is obviously more consequential. Thus, we can formulate a method where each cell of confusion matrix contains its probability and we multiply each cell by some value \u201cv\u201d based on historic vales of our business. See below the probability for each cell:", "Note: We can also define a decision boundary of our classifier based on expected value.", "Now going back to the initial stage of our business problem, let\u2019s assume the sales team of X Education decided to send out an email notification to all the leads that are classified as likely buyers. And will not send an email to the class that is classified as non-buyers.", "Cost for each email sent: 5$ (hypothetical)Profit if customer purchases: 100$ (hypothetical)", "True positive: Saying the customer will churn we send out no email.True Negative: Saying the customer will not churn we send the email and customer will purchase.False Positive: Saying customer will churn but he does not, so no email sent and no benefit incurred.False Negative: Saying customer will not churn when he actually does, so we send out the email but he does not purchase.", "Expected Profit = matrix multiplication of probability and cost-benefit matrix", "After summing the values we get:", "If X Education uses my model to classify new customers and e-mail those who are classified as potential buyers it can generate an overall expected profit of $70485.", "Note: To take the analysis further we can use probability priors in case we have highly imbalance class distribution", "Your home for data science.
