My statistics professor was relentless in emphasising Occam\u2019s Razor and parsimony. Social scientists are obsessed with finding causal relationships in models, often through experiments.", "In machine learning, we get introduced pretty early on to the bias-variance trade-off, and the perils of overfitting.", "The basic idea, according to Wikipedia:", "\u2026the bias\u2013variance tradeoff is the property of a set of predictive models whereby models with a lower bias in parameter estimation have a higher variance of the parameter estimates across samples, and vice versa.", "Lost yet? There are a ton of excellent explanations out there, but let\u2019s try to crack this without graphs, math or greek.", "Let\u2019s start with the simplest of models. A mental model.", "Suppose you\u2019ve never seen a bird before. Ever. And you\u2019ve been asked (by your imaginary boss) to either:", "You\u2019d probably observe what a bird, or several birds look like, and make a few generalisations about the bird.", "Suppose next, that you come across a flock of crows and you conclude the following:", "Congratulations! You\u2019ve built your first model in the bird-verse.", "Of course, one doesn\u2019t have to be a bird expert to know that \u201call birds are black\u201d is an incorrect conclusion, but remember \u2014 you\u2019ve never seen a bird before! Your model is overfitted, where you\u2019ve picked out too many details from the crow and tried to generalise it to an entire population of birds. You wanted to describe birds, but ended up describing crows.", "After getting a telling-off from your boss, you return to the bird-verse and build another model. \u201cKeep It Simple, Stupid\u201d came the advice. You then observe some other birds and conclude:", "That\u2019s not quite right either. We\u2019ve avoided the problem of making generalisations based on idiosyncratic features of some birds. However, we\u2019ve gone too far by making a single declaration on what we presumed was a universal characteristic amongst birds.", "Not unreasonable by any stretch, but still wrong.", "That\u2019s when we say a model is under-fitted. You\u2019ve only taken one characteristic, but it doesn\u2019t return a consistent prediction or explanation of what birds are or would be. In this case, you wanted to describe birds, but you ended up catching every one with feathers.", "Let\u2019s try and bring this back to stats and machine learning parlance. In the first model, we\u2019ve reduced the bias in explaining a local sample of birds, but there\u2019s more variance when generalising to another sample.", "In the second model, we\u2019ve gotten a low variance predictor that performs well when generalising to more bird samples, but faces more bias when confronted with a sample of stuff that has feathers, but is clearly not a bird!", "We gravitate between over-fitted and under-fitted models, iterating through various models of how things function until we come to a satisfactory understanding of how things work. Once you start thinking about models simply, you\u2019ll start noticing the bias-variance trade-off everywhere.", "Establishing relationships, building models and getting to the root of things we observe in our environment is intrinsic to human nature. It\u2019s really not that different from how we build models for machine learning. And it\u2019s no wonder machines end up like us.", "Thanks for reading!
