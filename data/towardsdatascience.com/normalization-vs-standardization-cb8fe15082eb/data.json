The magnitude of different features affects different machine learning models for various reasons.", "For example, consider a data set containing two features, age, and income. Here age ranges from 0\u2013100, while income ranges from 0 to a huge amount which is mostly higher than 100. Income is about 1,000 times larger than age. So, these two features are in very different ranges. When we do further analysis, like multivariate linear regression, for example, the attributed income will intrinsically influence the result more due to its larger value. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is more important as a predictor. Therefore, the range of all features should be scaled so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance.", "For this exact purpose, using Feature Scaling is essential.", "In this article, we will be discussing what, why of feature scaling, the techniques to achieve feature scaling, it\u2019s usefulness, and python snippet to achieve feature scaling using these techniques.", "The flow of discussion will be as follows,", "Feature scaling is a technique to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.", "However, every dataset does not require features scaling. It is required only when features have different ranges.", "This can be achieved using two widely used techniques.", "Normalization (also called, Min-Max normalization) is a scaling technique such that when it is applied the features will be rescaled so that the data will fall in the range of [0,1]", "Normalized form of each feature can be calculated as follows:", "Here \u2018x\u2019 is the original value and \u2018x`\u2019 is the normalized value.", "Standardization (also called, Z-score normalization) is a scaling technique such that when it is applied the features will be rescaled so that they\u2019ll have the properties of a standard normal distribution with mean,\u03bc=0 and standard deviation, \u03c3=1; where \u03bc is the mean (average) and \u03c3 is the standard deviation from the mean.", "Standard scores (also called z scores) of the samples are calculated as follows:", "This scales the features in a way that they range between [-1,1]", "Let us now implement these techniques using a simple python code.", "The dataset that we will be using is Wine classifier data from Kaggle.", "This data set is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.", "Importing pandas and reading data in CSV ( Comma Separated Values) to the data frame using pandas.", "Head() returns the first five elements in the data.", "Now let us explore each column/ feature in detail.", "Here we can see that the values of feature alcohol range from 11\u201315", "Clearly we can see various statistical function values and the minimum value around 11.03 and maximum value around 14.83", "Here we can see the values of features malic lie in the range of 1\u20136 with few outliers.", "Let us now perform normalization and standardization. And compare the results.", "Now, let us apply normalization to each of the features and observe the changes.", "Normalization can be achieved using MinMaxScaler.", "Applying normalization on features, alcohol and malic", "Standardization can be achieved using StandardScaler( )", "Applying standardization on features, alcohol and malic", "Let us now plot to understand the results.", "\u201c Normalization or Standardization?\u201d \u2014 There is no obvious answer to this question: it really depends on the application.", "For example, in clustering analyses, standardization may be especially crucial in order to compare similarities between features based on certain distance measures. Another prominent example is the Principal Component Analysis, where we usually prefer standardization over normalization since we are interested in the components that maximize the variance.", "However, this doesn\u2019t mean that normalization is not useful at all! A popular application is image processing, where pixel intensities have to be normalized to fit within a certain range (i.e., 0 to 255 for the RGB color range). Also, a typical neural network algorithm requires data on a 0\u20131 scale.", "Thanks for the read. I am going to write more beginner-friendly posts in the future too.
