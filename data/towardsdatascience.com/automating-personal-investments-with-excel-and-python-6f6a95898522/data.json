So, I see here two possible situations which you might fit in:", "Either your job does not exactly offer you the programming skills you are looking for or, in fact, it does not offer you any opportunity to use it at all.", "Whatever is your case (even one not included in the above), in this post you might find an interesting Python project to start right now. So, what is it anyway? I managed to develop a way you can input the Stocks you own and track each Stock performance in a daily-basis.", "First of all, what does the code actually do? Put simply, you must provide 3 inputs regarding each one of the Stocks you own in an Excel file and, then, use the Python Script shared in this post in order to update each one of these Stocks performance, in a daily basis.", "Which information is needed to be input in an Excel file? The Stock Transaction Code (\u201cticker\u201d), the Number of Stocks (\u201cqty\u201d), and the Total Cost (\u201cpriceBought\u201d) you had for each Stock. Very simple, right? Besides the fact that these inputs are very straight forward, it\u2019s important to highlight that you need to input them just once.", "PS: I\u2019m from Brazil, so I considered an example in which I selected some Stocks from the Brazilian Stock Market.", "Without further ado, let\u2019s finally take a look at the code itself.", "My goal here is to share the way I structured the analysis and to highlight the things I judge are the most important ones. It\u2019s also important to mention I encourage you to search for any library, methods, or attributes you are not sure how it works.", "You are supposed to execute the following each time you want to load data from the past.", "The library you might have never heard about is yfinance. This is the heart of our code, since it provides, through the Yahoo Finance API, the Stocks Prices (and several other information) you also potentially would like to track.", "PS: You may notice the syntax I used in the Excel File Input image, it\u2019s important to ensure you write the Stock Negotiation Names as they\u2019re available in Yahoo Finance.", "Remember the Excel file I had mentioned earlier? In my example, it\u2019s saved as \u201cStock.xlsx\u201d on the same directory I saved my .py file (that\u2019s why you don\u2019t have to worry about providing the entire file location as you could have seen in other examples, such as \u201cC:/Documents/\u2026\u201d)", "Apart from the logical structuring, which I highly encourage you to take a moment to understand, I listed the most important things:", "This is the end of what I named \u201cPart 1\u201d. What you\u2019ve got until here? You created a Pandas DataFrame covering each Stocks Prices you considered in the Excel File \u201cStock.xlsx\u201d for each Day the Market was open in the past \u201cperiod\u201d time (in this case, 2 months).", "In order for us to avoid creating several Excel files, you may notice that I overwrote the original file. You should be able to see something like the following (snapshot from part of the table):", "You are supposed to execute the following every day the Stock Market is open.", "I only added the matplotlib.pyplot library (any guesses on what we are going to do?).", "This depends on how you will save your .py files. Doing it the way I wrote above, \u201cPart 2\u201d would be considered as a different .py file (there is a Part 1 .py separated file, \u201cStockHistory\u201d, since I just need to execute it once). If you prefer to have it all in just one .py file, just ignore this piece of code and have it all the other code lines together (however, you need to notice you are going to perform unnecessary tasks daily).", "closePriceList is a list composed of each Stock Price on the day the method is being executed (have you noticed the \u201c[-1]\u201d element? Take a look at what this line of code provides).", "The main point here is to \u201cappend\u201d a new column to the Excel file we have been using. Each one of these columns will be composed of a list of the most recent Stocks prices.", "This is the longest block of code, but its goal is simple: to handle df in order for each of its lines to be provided as lists. These lists are needed in order to generate the following:", "This portfolio owner should consider changing strategy, isn\u2019t that right?", "I hope you have liked it.", "This is my first post on Medium. The important thing here is to share some useful things which could be done using Python, especially for those who don\u2019t directly work with it but wish to learn more about it. You can adapt this code to plot accumulated balance and to differentiate the day you bought each Stock, for instance.
