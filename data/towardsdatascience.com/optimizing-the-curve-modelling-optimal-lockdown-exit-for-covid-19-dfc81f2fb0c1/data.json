A large number of models also estimate the impact of control measures, such as lockdown, on an infected curve ( \u201cflattening the curve\u201d ). However, very few models seek to answer the key question \u2014 how to introduce and relax control measures in an optimal way? (\u201coptimizing the curve\u201d). Because, indeed, strong control measures, such as lockdown, have a huge adverse societal and economic effects.", "In this article I will provide a simplified model, that would include estimation of optimal control measures. It would answer the question of how to optimally enter and then exit the lockdown or relax any other control measures. I would not dive into complicated math behind optimization and will provide intuitive examples, where possible. As you will see, the resulting model will be in under 100 lines of Python code (without the interactive plot part) and will use well-known libraries \u2014 NumPy and SciPy to compute the solution.", "As I mentioned before, there are few models and studies that apply optimal control to COVID-19 modelling. You may find several of them here. They include a lot of sophisticated math. In the article, I specifically omit it to explain the concepts in a more understandable way. Thus, the model provided here would be simplified and should be considered mostly educational. It should neither be treated as a realistic forecasting model nor serve as a basis for any decision-making.", "This article will have the following sections:", "Here is the full code for the model, scenarios, and comparison.", "As one famous British statistician George Box said:", "\u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful\u201d.", "With that in mind, I hope the model provided here would serve useful as an additional point of view to all existing ones and as a foundation for building more advanced and realistic models.", "Let\u2019s dive right into creating the model!", "Choosing the right modelling approach is crucial. We want to estimate the number of infected individuals and how control measures affect it (both \u2018estimate the curve\u2019 and \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 parts). Only with both of those estimates, we are able to predict the optimal control strategy. In that case, the most common approach is to estimate the compartmental epidemiological model, such as the Susceptible-Infected\u2013Removed (SIR) model or any of its extensions. In this article, we won\u2019t dive deeply into concepts behind SIR-based models, as they have been extensively covered in many other materials (for example here, or here).", "We will use an extended Susceptible-Infected-Removed model. It will account for a considerable latency period of SARS-CoV-2, also it would reflect which of infected individuals become hospitalized and affect healthcare system capacity, as well as which individuals recover and which decease due to the virus. We would also add a parameter u(t) to the model, which would reflect the strength of control measures (social distancing policies, lockdown, etc., everything connected to non-pharmaceutical interventions). Besides, our model will have varying fatality rate, which will depend on whether healthcare capacity is overwhelmed or not.", "In that sense, we will have 6 compartments in our model:", "In compartmental models individuals transition between compartments depending on time and some parameters. These parameters may be described in the \u201crate-probability-population\u201d flowchart as in this article: \u201cthe rate describes how long the transition takes, the population is the group of individuals that this transition applies to, and probability is the probability of the transition taking place for an individual\u201d.", "From a maths perspective, our model is a system of 6 ordinary differential equations (ODE), each representing the change in the value of a compartment given a fixed change in time (t).", "Where, both for flowchart and ODE representation:", "Let\u2019s provide an intuitive example to explain more clearly how the model works. Assume a population, where there are 99 susceptible individuals and 1 infected. This individual, at time t=1, immediately exposes others to the virus (immediately, as the rate here is = 1). How many others \u2014 depends on beta and the proportion of susceptible individuals left in the population (S/N), and, also, on the control strength u(t). All the exposed individuals, after latency time (tLat), also become infected (all, because probability here is = 1), in addition to that individual in the beginning. They, in turn, start exposing others to the virus causing a rapid virus spread.", "After their infectious period (tInf) passes, some of them would transition to Recovered, some of them would develop more severe symptoms and transition to Hospitalized (that depends on the probability of developing only mild symptoms \u2014 pMild). From there, after time tHosp, they could either transition to the Deceased compartment with probability pFatal, or to Recovered compartment with probability (1-pFatal). If at some point in time healthcare capacity overflow occurs \u2014 pFatal increases considerably, as it is a functional parameter in our model.", "We defined a model, that reflects \u2018estimate the curve\u2019 and \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 parts, but it still lacks optimal control. Let\u2019s assume, that the control strength u(t) is optimal at time t if the following two conditions are both met:", "So, u(t) may be considered optimal if it minimizes both the capacity overflow and control measures. Mathematically, u(t) is considered optimal in our model if it minimizes the following cost function C(u):", "The chart below also illustrates the idea behind the formula.", "In the equation of cost function Term I accounts for the area under the curve of capacity overflow and Term II for the area under the curve of control measures. By minimizing the combination of those terms, we ensure, that the defined conditions 1 and 2 are both met. But the question is left \u2014 what techniques are used to minimize such complex cost function?", "We stated, that we need to select such u(t) for each time period t that C(u) (the \u201ccost of our control u\u201d) would be minimal. When we want to model a 2-year time period, where T = 730 days, we need to select some combination of 730 different u(t)\u2019s that would be most effective in minimizing C(u)! That type of problem may require advanced solving algorithms tailored for large-scale non-linear dynamical optimization, which are complex by their nature and require lots of computational resources to find the exact optimal solution.", "However, in this article we would develop a simpler approach, which will lead us to a well-approximated optimal solution in just a few seconds, consuming fewer resources and using well-known Python libraries, such as SciPy and Numpy. We also would compare our solution with a more precise one obtained with an advanced solving algorithm in the \u201cComparison\u201d section.", "So, instead of finding the right combination of dozens of different u(t)\u2019s for the whole T at once, we will:", "This approach, when we adjust our model during its runtime, based on its own measurements, is known as simple model predictive control (MPC). A good explanation of how model predictive control is applied to COVID-19 models may be found in the series of videos here.", "Our approach also may be illustrated as follows.", "Here we split our time period into 4 horizons. During the first horizon t(h1) we see, that the only u, at which there is no capacity overwhelm, is \u201cStrong\u201d and hence apply it. At t(h2) we see that \u201cStrong\u201d control u is no longer required, and the only u, that satisfies both condition 1 and condition 2 is \u201cMedium\u201d, so we adjust u to \u201cMedium\u201d. Similarly, at t(h3) we see, that \u201cWeak\u201d u is the only optimal and adjust our u to it. At t(h4) the control measures may finally be relaxed.", "This approach is relatively simple and gives us additional flexibility. We can state, that we would adjust our u each week (h=7 days) or each month etc., which is a more realistic control policy. However, that simplicity and flexibility come at a cost. To arrive at a well-approximated optimal solution, we would have to carefully choose the frequency of our control interventions (f) and the right control horizon (h).", "Let\u2019s create a simple Python class, that will store everything required for the model. The init method of our class:", "Class MSEIR accepts all our parameters and performs some basic transformations needed right away:", "Now, let\u2019s define the ODE system, that we would solve in our model:", "The _ode method calculates what will be the values in our compartments in the next time period, given values in the current and, also, all the parameters and rules we defined previously. In terms of math, the technique used by _ode is a simple numerical Euler\u2019s method for solving ODE. There may be more sophisticated techniques, that give better precision, we will compare our solution with them in the \u201cComparison\u201d section.", "The next step, logically, is to create a method, that will run _ode for each time step to get all the predicted values of compartments. This is done by the method solve.", "In this method, we firstly create a list of lists C with our initial values of compartments, which is later filled with next values. We also define y and Uf variables, which are responsible for recognizing, whether U is fixed or there is some real data on control measures. Also, U is transformed in accordance with step size dt used in the model.", "The key solving technique lies in for loop. For each point in time t we select the necessary control cU and run _ode method using the last values in list C as our initial values of compartments. We store the results of _ode in variable nVal and append it to C list, so they become the last values. After the for loop finishes, we obtain the final solution.", "The full code of the model now looks as follows.", "As you notice, our current model lies in just under 50 lines of code. Feel free to experiment with it!", "As for now, the model includes \u2018estimate the curve\u2019 and \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 parts. But what about optimal control? To code it, we would require SciPy, which is a de-facto standard library for scientific computing in Python. We would need simps method for calculating integrals in our cost function and minimize method to apply function minimization algorithms. Let\u2019s add the cost function to our class.", "Method _costf, similarly to solve method, obtains the solution for our ODE system. But instead of returning the solution, it calculates the cost function, based on that solution, and returns the cost function\u2019s value. It accepts control u(t) (as x) and initial conditions similar to _ode method. Such design is required to use scipy.minimize on it.", "Having the cost function, let\u2019s modify our solve method according to our simple model predictive control framework.", "The key modification lies in for loop \u2014 the optimization of U starts only if:", "When optimization starts \u2014 the current compartment values and time horizon of optimization (hor) are stored in the args variable. Args and _costf are supplied to SciPy\u2019s minimize method, which uses a selected minimization algorithm to find under what cU the _costf would have minimal value during the given control horizon (hor). We also set some bounds for cU, because our strength of control is a value, that is always between 0 and 1. The minimization algorithms in SciPy, that are suitable for our bounded minimization problem are: \u2018L-BFGS-B\u2019, \u2018TNC\u2019, \u2018SLSQP\u2019 and \u2018trust-constr\u2019.

It is calculated simply as a decrease in the Susceptible population per time period.", "Our model is fully-working now. Just to finalize it, let\u2019s add a method that produces a representative plot. We will use a plotly library to produce visualizations.

All of the characteristics are taken as ones in this article:", "Unfortunately, the epidemic outbreak couldn\u2019t be suppressed right at the beginning and there is no vaccine. Fortunately, we now have a model, which allows us to estimate different scenarios and optimal control policies, based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (social distancing, masks, lockdown, etc.). We want to model the possible outcomes for the next 2 years. Let\u2019s create a Python dictionary with all our arguments, that we will use in the model.", "Now, let\u2019s use our model and estimate the first very simple scenario.", "In this \u2018do-nothing\u2019 scenario, we don\u2019t have any control and hence no economic or societal costs associated with it.

As we see, the number of Deceased drops significantly to 42,481 (2.56% fatality ratio). However, there are two concerns. Firstly, the control duration is infinite, so the lockdown or any other measures may never be relaxed. Secondly, this is the only scenario here, where herd immunity is not obtained in the end (Susceptible in the end / Total population > 1/Basic reproduction number, by means of formula in this article). Hence, the relaxation of control measures would cause a new wave of infections.", "Now, let\u2019s assume more realistic scenarios, where the officials of the city had already introduced some control measures during the first 120 days of the epidemic.

After about 23 days of strict control, it started to get removed. This scenario shows what happens if it fell down to zero after 120 days since the first infected individual. Here the control ends at 2020\u201304\u201329. We see, that shortly after a control end, the second wave of infections occurs, causing drastic healthcare capacity overflow. In the end, this policy leads to 207,112 Deceased (4.72% fatality ratio), which is really closer to \u2018complete zero control\u2019 scenario 1.", "What if after 120 days the officials suddenly revealed how to optimally control the epidemic?

In such a perfect case of lockdown exit \u2014 the amount of Deceased is almost twice as less compared to the previous scenario (104,464 vs 207,112 individuals). Although, the overall control is 85% more strict (889 vs 480 in terms of area under u) and it lasts up to 2020\u201309\u201311, which is longer by 125 days, compared to the previous scenario.", "As for now, we have considered two scenarios, where the officials introduced some control measures during the first 120 days of the outbreak. But what if the officials had an optimal control policy since the very beginning?", "Here the scenario of perfect optimal control right from the beginning is considered. Control strength is reviewed daily and minimal required measures are introduced. Under that scenario, the control ends at 2020\u201308\u201310 with 93,526 Deceased individuals and 2.56% fatality ratio. The key point here is that the fatality ratio is the same as in scenario 2 of constant control, but the control has a finite duration of 179 days and is much less strict. Also, except for scenario 2, this scenario implies the lowest amount of Deceased.", "Indeed, due to daily precise interventions, such control policy is difficult to implement in practice. What if the officials tried to implement optimal control policy with interventions each month or so?", "This final scenario is similar to previous, but with more realistic interventions frequency of 43 days. The control is slightly stricter (769 vs 717 in terms of area under u) and ends a week sooner, at 2020\u201308\u201302. The total amount of Deceased is 93,632 individuals with the same 2.56% fatality ratio.", "The 6 scenarios in total were considered.", "Let\u2019s provide a table that summarizes the key metrics of each scenario.", "It is clear, that the optimal control scenario has an advantage over others. With optimal control, it is possible to cut down the number of Deceased individuals at the end of the epidemic by almost 60% compared to zero control (from 229,689 to 93,526). Optimal control policy also has the same fatality ratio as constant infinite control, but it lasts a finite amount of time \u2014 179 days, after which the control is zero. In addition, it was shown, that the optimal control policy could be made more practical with interventions every 43 days, instead of each 1 day, and it would have relatively the same effect.", "As it was mentioned, there are more advanced solving algorithms for both ordinary differential equations and large-scale dynamic optimization problems. The article here is a good example of those. The model build there uses a Python library Gekko, which provides a set of tools for large-scale non-linear dynamic optimization. The model uses Interior Point solving method for ODE and dynamic optimization, with notable IPOPT solver under the hood.", "We will use that model as a benchmark but will modify it by adding Hospitalized and Deceased compartments, so it will have exactly the same compartments as our current Modified SEIR (MSEIR) model. Here is the full code for comparison.", "Let\u2019s use the same set of arguments for both models and compare the results.", "Below is the chart with comparison results. The blue lines denote the solution of Gekko+IPOPT model.", "And the summary table with the key results of both solutions.", "U(t) curves of both models are similar, whereas Gekko+IPOPT model produced the curve of shape more similar to this article, where the exact solution is computed. The final value of Deceased is equal between the two models. Also, the Solution time of Gekko model, as shown in its print output, equals 27.409 seconds, whereas for MSEIR model it took 1.182 seconds of wall-clock time to find the solution.", "In this article, we estimated the epidemic model, which includes optimal control measures and answers the question of how to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d with economic and societal costs in mind and how to enter and exit lockdown or any other control measures in an optimal way. We considered a case of a city, where the virus with characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 has already spread and there is no vaccine expected.", "We showed how optimal control measures may decrease fatalities associated with the disease at minimal required strength of control. Our optimal control policy yields 60% less fatal cases compared to the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d scenario in 179 days of control time, after which herd immunity is obtained in population, compared to infinite time and no herd immunity in constant control scenario. We also tweaked optimal control into more practical policy with control interventions performed approximately every month, instead of daily interventions in perfect optimal control scenario.", "The model we used to estimate optimal control, although it is simple, it leads to a well-approximated optimal solution, as seen from the comparison section. It\u2019s simplicity also adds benefits: blazingly-fast computation time for such large-scale dynamic optimization problem, and a huge amount of flexibility, as we can define any intervention frequency and control horizon, customize cost functions and add varying parameters, such as fatality rate.", "The model is still full of assumptions, associated with both the deterministic SIR framework and our simple model predictive control approach.
