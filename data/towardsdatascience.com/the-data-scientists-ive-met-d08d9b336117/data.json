I keep meeting the same Data Scientists, and I keep giving the same advice. Over the last year and a half, I\u2019ve begun to hear stories that echo one another. The industry has unrealistic expectations for Machine Learning in their business. Data Scientists have unrealistic expectations too. Data Science is 90% focused on data preparation and software engineering. As the Data Scientist, you are taking on a business transformation role.", "So far I\u2019ve met the same 5 Data Scientist, and in order of value to a business are as follows:", "An individual with a hobbyist or light academic interest in Machine Learning. There is no industry experience in adding value to a business.", "These people will have done a self-directed course in Machine Learning. There will be little focus on software engineering and project management. University courses or masters degrees don\u2019t fare much better. The theory has its place, but can be learnt on the job. I have yet to meet an employer impressed by a Masters in Machine Learning.", "The Aspirant may take part in Machine Learning challenges. These projects give you data on a silver platter. A large part of Data Science is discovering context and preparing the data.", "Aspiration and ambition are essential in Data Science. We are building impossible products of yesteryear. Keep this energy, if you stop learning new tools you fall behind. Self-Learning is essential in software engineering and the same applies to data roles.", "My recommendation to you is to find any industry experience you can to get a taste of the real world of Data Science. It will be hard to find a Data Science job, so try something Data Science adjacent. A Web Analyst role is a suitable entry point. Even with this title, you may be the most advanced Data Scientist in the company.", "This person is a Data Analyst at a large company. You are an expert on your businesses data sources and context. The best Data Scientist will still have to relearn what you know. Your insight is vital to most end-to-end data products at your company. You generate a weekly report, and people no longer pay much attention. You feel concerned people ignore these reports.", "I see a desire to grow from most Analysts. You may know a querying language and a programming language. You may feel like it\u2019s time to learn a programming language. You want more from your role. Data Science and Machine Learning are exciting to you and your company if you could figure out where it fits.", "Data Analytics and Data Visualisation are foundational in Data Science. The industry expects good data visualisation. Industry dreams of Machine Learning.", "My advice to you is start calling yourself a Data Scientist and one day you\u2019ll believe it. I recently met a boss who told a subordinate he was not allowed to call himself a Data Scientist. I met a team of analysts with an overnight title change to \u201cData Scientist\u201d for all, despite no skill change. My point here is companies are being fluffy with the term, so please feel free to do so as well. Come up with your own definition and justification and stick to it!", "Learn a programming language (I recommend Python) and SQL. If you have done this then the next step is some small scale projects. You may be the closest thing your company has to a Data Scientist now so let\u2019s leverage that.", "You have a PhD, your team has PhDs, and you prefer to hire people with PhDs. Your core product is data-based or has high potential from Machine Learning. Your academic prowess shines through on long-term projects. Projects culminate in the publishing of a white paper. They may be valuable, but not actionable in the short term and any interest fades to apathy.", "You lack the tools to integrate your ideas into your product. These teams often \u201cthrow work over the wall\u201d to a separate team of software engineers who build a product.", "You are an academic, learning new things is your best skill. Learn Software Engineering and take ownership of your product. Other teams will be keen to teach if you are keen to learn. This approach transforms you from a researcher into a Data Scientist. You now own your end-to-end product.", "The competition has a Data Science team. Your company decides to not fall behind. Your company tried to hire a rock star capable of all aspects of Data Science. your company most likely failed. Machine Learning was the main skill tested in your interview. If you were the first hired Data Scientist your main job is now digital transformation. It was never the companies intention that you would be self-managing, but it\u2019s your best asset. Your success is dependent on your agency. You will get blocked a lot. You will have to have many side projects for the slow days.", "You know the value of good software engineering. Processes and tools used by IT look appetising and if you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll use them too. Despite the similarity, IT will deny you resources and business priority.", "You will thrive on your ability to recognise the UX problem of Data Science. If your work isn\u2019t actionable and accessible the business will forget. A focus on low-hanging fruit will show the business what Data Science is capable of. You may get a chance to deliver a single large project of immense value. This kind of work sets you up for consulting next.", "Ask if you\u2019re providing value, if you are, prove it.", "I am calling this one \u201cThe Dream\u201d because of the unrealistic expectations from both sides. Aspirational candidates love Machine Learning almost as much as the company does. but you both don\u2019t understand how difficult the journey of Data Science is going to be.", "The following skills to be essential to a Data Science team (I say the team and not individual). I do not expect any single Data Scientist to have all these skills, but if you do well done!", "The Dream Data Scientist is a:", "Our current goal is to grow towards \u201cThe Dream\u201d Data Scientist. I posit this is an unsustainable symptom of the current industry expectations. I\u2019ve seen this problem before with the role of \u201cWeb Masters\u201d and recently with \u201cFull Stack Developer\u201d. Trying to hire all these roles at once, and in a single individual, is setting us up for failure. As an individual specialises in a few of the above, not all. If you are hiring a Data Scientist, hire a mix that shares the above skills between them and work well together.", "Your home for data science.
