Determine the condition of the equipment or plan when maintenance should be performed, are extremely strategic decisions that impact costs and productivity.", "Machine Learning methods have been emerged as a promising tool in predictive maintenance applications to prevent failures in production lines. However, the performances of these solutions depend on appropriate data analysis and the choice of the right analytic methods.", "In this post, we face a predictive maintenance task like in other previous related articles: Predictive Maintenance with CNN and Predictive Maintenance with CRNN. The particularity here is that we use only a single high-frequency signal source to produce our final predictions. The application of a specific transformation based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) is fundamental to extract features from the signal. This step enables us to adopt a residual convolutional neural network structure, which learns the correct hidden structure of our data.", "Our task involves the study of a hydraulic pipeline under pressure conditions. The data are collected by the UCI repository. In the Condition monitoring of hydraulic systems is tracked the activity status of various system components.", "The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows and temperatures while the condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump and accumulator) is quantitatively varied.", "More precisely, we focus on monitoring the status of the whole system (identified with the stable flag label as stable or not stable) analyzing the motor power. This KPI is monitored by a single sensor that registers the signal with a sampling rate of 100 Hz.", "The time series slices we are trying to classify have a shape similar to the one plotted below.", "The raw signals are standardized using the first-order difference and clipped to limit the insane values. The standardized signals are in this way used to generate MFCCs.", "MFCCs are commonly derived as follows:", "It\u2019s common to see their application in the audio analysis but we utilize them here for their ability to deal with high-frequency data.", "As introduced before, we used a convolutional based network to forecast the system status of our hydraulic pipeline. We add in our convolution blocks some bost using residual skip connections.", "Deeper networks are harder to optimize. Adding extra layers to a network we are increasing the training process difficulty. It becomes harder for our optimization algorithm to minimize the loss. Residual structures attempt to solve this issue adding skip connections. A skip connection adds a mapping from one initial point in the network to a forward point. If there are no more things the network can learn, the network\u2019s weights remain unchanged, otherwise, if improvements are registered (in loss or metric optimization) the network weights change consequently.", "Below an example of a residual block that we can easily use in our network architecture. Also, different variations in the number of layers, in the activation functions or the kernel size are possible according to the problem needs. The only thing that must be unchanged when using this kind of block is the dimensionality inside it. In our example, we take care to operate padding in convolutional operations and make the initial dimensionality equal to the latest convolutional layer to operate the final connection.", "We compare our approach with a dummy baseline which consists of classifying our test samples always belonging to the majority class in the test data (stable condition). Our network achieves 87% accuracy on unseen test data. This a good result and a big improvement from our baseline, which registers 66% accuracy.", "In this post, we carried out a predictive maintenance task. More in detail we predicted the general condition of a hydraulic test rig only considering the motor power. The signals taken into consideration were characterized by high-frequency, which made inevitable some preliminary manipulation of our data. We created valuable information operating a feature extraction process based on MFCC. The new signals generated were used to feed a deep learning model based on residual connections to produce the final predictions.", "If you are interested in the topic, I suggest:", "Your home for data science.
