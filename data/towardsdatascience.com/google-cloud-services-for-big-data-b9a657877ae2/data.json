All those services are integrated with other Google Cloud products, and all of them have own pros and cons. In this article, we will review what services GCP can offer for data and Big Data application, what those services do, what benefits and limitations have, what is the pricing strategy of each service, and what are the alternatives.", "Cloud PubSub is a message queue broker that allows applications to exchange messages reliably, quickly, and asynchronously. Based on the publish-subscription pattern.", "The following diagram describes the basic flow of the PubSub. Publisher applications publish messages to a PubSub topic; the topic sends messages to PubSub subscriptions; the subscriptions store messages; subscriber applications read messages from the subscriptions.", "You pay for transferred data, per GB.", "Cloud IoT Core is an IoT devices registry. This service allows connect devices to the Google Cloud Platform, receive messages from devices, and send messages to devices. To receive messages from devices, IoT Core uses Google PubSub.", "You pay for data volume that you transfer cross this service.", "Cloud Dataproc is a faster, easier, and more cost-effective way to run Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop in Google Cloud. Cloud Dataproc is a cloud-native solution that covers all operations related to deploy and manage Spark or Hadoop clusters. In simple terms, with Dataproc you can create a cluster of instances, dynamically change the size of the cluster, configure it, and run there MapReduce jobs.", "You pay for each used instance with some extra payment. GCP bills for each minute when the cluster works.", "Cloud Dataflow is a managed service for developing and executing a wide range of data processing patterns including ETL, batch, streaming processing, etcetera. Dataflow is used for building data pipelines. This service is based on Apache Beam and supports Python and Java jobs.", "Cloud Dataflow jobs are billed in per-second, based on the actual use of Cloud Dataflow.", "Dataprep is a tool for visualizing, explore and prepare data you work with. You can build pipelines to ETL your data for different storage. And do it on a simple and intelligible web interface.", "For example, you can use Dataprep to build the ETL pipeline to extract raw data from GCS, clean up this data, transform to needed view, and load the data into BigQuery. Also, you can schedule a daily/weekly/etcetera job which will run this pipeline for new raw data.", "For data storing you pay for data storage. For executing ETL jobs you pay for Google Dataflow.", "Cloud Composer is a workflow orchestration service to manage data processing. Cloud Composer is a cloud interface for Apache Airflow. Composer allows automates the ETL jobs, for example, can create a Dataproc cluster, perform transformations on extracted data (via a Dataproc PySpark job), upload the results to BigQuery, and then shutdown Dataproc cluster.", "You pay only for resources on which deployed Composer. But the Composer will be deployed to 3 instances.", "BigQuery allows us to store and querying massive datasets, up to hundreds of Petabytes. BigQuery is very familiar to relations databases by its structure, it has table structure, uses SQL, also supports batch and streaming writing into the database, integrated with all GCP services, including Dataflow, Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, etcetera. It\u2019s best for use in interactive queuing and offline analytics.", "You pay separately for stored information(for each Gb) and for executed queries.", "With reference to executed queries, you can choose one of two payment models, either pay for each processed Terabyte or pay the stable monthly cost. It depends on your preferences.", "Google Cloud BigTable is Google\u2019s NoSQL Big Data database service. It\u2019s the same database that powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail. Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and high throughput, so it\u2019s a great choice for both operational and analytical applications, including IoT, user analytics, and financial data analysis.", "Cloud Bigtable based on Apache HBase.", "This database has a very big capacity and suggested for using if you have more than Terabyte data. BigTable is the best for time-series data, and IoT data.", "BigTable is very expensive. You pay and for nodes(minimum $0.65 per hour per node), and for storage capacity(minimum 26$ per Terabyte per month)", "GCS is blob storage for files. You can store any amount of any size files there.", "GCS has a couple of pricing plans. In a standard plan, you pay for 1Gb of saved data.", "There are a couple more services, that I have to mention.", "Now you are familiar with the main data services that GCP provides. This knowledge can help you to build a good data solution. Of course, Clouds are not a panacea, and in case, if you use Clouds in the wrong way, it can very affect your monthly infrastructure billing.", "So, very carefully build the architecture of your proposal and choose the necessary services for your needs to reach the needed business goals. Explore all benefits and limitations for each particular case. Care about costs. And of course, remember about the scalability, reliability, and maintainability of your solution.", "If you want to know more, you can review the following:", "Your home for data science.
