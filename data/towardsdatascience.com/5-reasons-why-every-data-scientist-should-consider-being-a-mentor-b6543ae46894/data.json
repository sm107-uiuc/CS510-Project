In fact, getting into the field now is more challenging than when I started 4 years ago.", "Many of the people joining the field, either now or earlier in the field, start with the field by self-studying the different aspects of the field and building different projects to include in their portfolio when they apply for jobs.", "Although self-studying is my favorite approach to learn a new programming language or develop a new skill, often, when we work on our own, we don\u2019t get the experience we need from an industrial side of things.", "The best solution to that is to have a mentor. Almost all newcomers try to find a mentor \u2014 or more \u2014 to guide them through the practical and industrial aspects of the fields. Learning from someone who went through the same journey we are on can teach us more than going through all the theories and the equations.", "In this article, I will not talk about the benefits of having a mentor to guide you, help you, and give you advice that gets to the finish line. Instead, I will talk about the benefits of being a mentor. Of helping someone who just started to reach their goals.", "I have been on both sides of the equation; I was a mentee and a mentor. I have to be honest with you; I learned equally from both and maybe even more from being a mentor.", "That\u2019s why I thought about writing this article to tell you my 5 reasons as to why I think everyone in data science \u2014 and tech, in general\u2014 should consider being a mentor.", "When you take on a mentee, you\u2019re proving that you\u2019re an expert in your field of expertise. One of the most challenging things that may stop you from becoming a mentor is the worry that you may not know everything, and hence you\u2019re not an expert.", "Well, you shouldn\u2019t worry about that; you got to where you are now because you do know what you\u2019re doing. It may not feel like you\u2019re an expert, but no one knows everything. Being a mentor will increase your knowledge and full-on any knowledge gaps that you might have.", "So, you will be developing your knowledge and leading your mentee to develop theirs simultaneously. By doing so, you\u2019ll prove that you\u2019re a leader and an expert in the field.", "When your mentees start their own career, taking on mentees of their own, you\u2019ll be one of the reasons they inspired those mentees to transfer their knowledge and become new leaders in the field.", "Sometimes, when we are involved in our projects and our company life, we forgot to touch with the new advancements in the field. We develop a one-sided work mentality.", "For example, being in data science from the academic side will stop me from addressing some problems from an industrial perspective. That mentality is often why academia and industry are somewhat far apart and have a big gap in between them.", "Taking on a mentee will help us refresh our mentality and gain new experiences of what people go through now when getting into the field. As I mentioned before, data science is a rapidly developing field. A person might have been through 5 or 6 years ago joining the field is completely different from what people right now need to go through to kick their data science career.", "Mentoring someone will help you gain perspective of the struggles, the new techniques, and the new challenges newcomers need to go through to get to where you are. Gaining this knowledge will give you an edge and a new look at the field that will help you advance more in your own career.", "Everyone knows this; there is no better way to understand something than to teach it to someone else fully. Once you can successfully explain something to someone else, then you fully understand it.", "Most data scientists or programmers understand what they are doing, but often that is not great at transferring their knowledge. When you do something for quite some time, it becomes second nature to you, and you find it difficult to explain its inner details.", "I like to think of that the way you would teach your native language to someone else. Not all of us can teach their native language properly. The reason is, we have been using this language for a long time; some of the grammar behind specific structures became natural to you that you might forget how they come to be.", "Developing your own teaching style requires you to go back to the basics, which is always a good idea to understand your work better and strengthen your knowledge base.", "When you teach someone a complex concept, you will find yourself searching for the best way to explain it to be fully understood without overcomplicating it. Doing will help you develop your science communication skills and eventually lead you to become a better speaker.", "Being a data scientist, it more than just writing code and manipulating data; communication and listing are essential skills to any data scientist. You need to carefully listen to any new project's business requirements to develop it correctly.", "Mentoring someone will help you work on your listening skills, become a better listener, and hence a better data scientist. When you\u2019re communicating with a new person to the field, they may not use the same vocabulary that an experienced person would.", "Which is a good thing because many of your clients will probably use the same vocabulary as a newcomer. Translating any vocabulary to a technical one will give you a new understanding of the different ways the same concept can be expressed.", "This probably my favorite reason for them all. So far, I talked about the benefits you can get if you took on a mentee, but being a mentor is not a one-way street. Being a mentor is a great way to give back to the community.", "Making your own way in data science, you just have read a lot of articles written by others, maybe you have been mentored by an experienced data scientist in your early career, or may you had great guidance from colleagues when you first started.", "Helping others achieve what you have achieved, learn what you have learned is one of the best, most fulfilling ways to give back to the community. Giving back is important to help you grow as a person and a data scientist. Not to mention, it will give you a great sense of accomplishment and fulfillment that you won't get any other way.", "No one can make it on their own. To succeed in life or your career, you need to have a mentor and guidance. Sometimes this guidance is not direct, but all of us had some guidance at any point in our career.", "Being a mentor is more than just the transfer of knowledge and experience between two people. It is a two-way road between the mentor and the mentee; both can offer each other benefits.", "The mentor offering to invest their time in developing another professional. And the mentee providing a fresh perspective into the mentor's work mentality. The act of mentoring can provide a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction to the mentor by receiving different benefits that reward them both personally and professionally.", "So, I leave you with this, consider being a mentor, transferring your knowledge to newcomers, and becoming a leader and an inspiration to many others to come.", "Your home for data science.
