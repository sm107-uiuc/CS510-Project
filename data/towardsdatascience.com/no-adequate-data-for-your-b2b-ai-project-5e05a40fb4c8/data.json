You find newer startups sprouting up around the globe trying to cash in on the hype and sometimes they create more confusion among people, where they portray AI as some superhuman machine that will change your life forever. Is that really true?", "Well technically yes, but not how these guys say it\u2019s going to be. AI is real and is here to stay. It is going to augment human capabilities and redefine the machine-human interactions and it\u2019s already happening.", "But whats the immediate future? Well, I feel it\u2019s going to be smart automation and we can already see the trends shifting in its favor.", "More companies are adopting smarter work methodologies and are on a path to total digital transformation. It is the right time for startups and small companies working on AI and ML to pitch in their expertise and knowledge to a larger client base to help them in their digital transformation. Easier said than done, right?", "Building production-ready machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) applications could be challenging in many ways. There is so much to consider that often times you end up with a badly trained model or you have an ML backend that is a disaster when it comes to response time.", "But does that mean the problem that you are tackling is too complex or cannot be solved by statistical learning tools?", "Well, maybe, but before making any conclusions and lose a potential client, take a look at our strategy in helping our clients understand the scope of their AI project and educate them on what value additions we could offer. Maybe it could help you devise your own methodologies based on your company portfolio.", "As with any AI or ML project, the success or failure is defined to a great extend by the data available for the learning machine (LM). Often times, we encounter companies both big and small having either a lot of unstructured data or no data at all.", "The latter is more challenging because with no or very small data we cannot comprehend the scale of the problem and developing a good AI model becomes difficult as we may not be able to prepare the model for real-world contingencies.", "It\u2019s easy to walk away in case you feel the use case is nothing pathbreaking, but what if the use case seems so cool and you might be on to something if you decide to work on it, but the data is trash?", "What I have learned is that lack of data should not be the reason you walk away from it.", "We have incorporated some methodologies to help our clients leverage the capabilities of AI to transform their workflow. A neat little concept called feedback learning or iterative learning is the key to this. This step focuses more on proper data acquisition and less on model perfection.", "It helps the clients to get upfront and personal exposure to AI technology and helps them educate themselves on positioning this technology in the right way possible. This method could also be used in case of a large amount of unstructured data, which could only be annotated by a domain expert.", "For example, if you have a dataset containing a set of attributes defining people's eligibility for a loan. Only an expert from the banking domain will be able to identify the right combination of attributes that define if a person is eligible or not. Such insights are what defines the quality of the data and the capacity of the model trained on it.", "Such insights may be missing from datasets most of the time because the real life is far from a Kaggle dataset. So what do you do in such cases?", "Feedback learning to the rescue !!!", "As I mentioned, feedback learning is primarily aimed at acquiring the right dataset from the client, and model improvement is secondary. There are some key elements to the feedback learning.", "The interactive dashboard is the main piece of the puzzle. It lets the user/client/data operator to quickly interact with our backend for data annotation, model training, version controlling models, manage deployments, view dataset, etc.", "The above images show a feedback learning dashboard for a smart IVR. The purpose of the model is to learn intents and entities based on transcribed text from a speech-to-text model.", "The main challenge for the application was the availability of a good dataset and the data available was very unstructured. Client requirements dictated the need for a highly scalable and portable learning backend that could be migrated to different service providers catering to different user bases.", "This meant that the model would have to learn dynamically to identify various intents and entities, which makes it difficult for us to account for all possible scenarios.", "In addition to that, the model needs to be lightweight and superfast in response time, because it will be acting behind an IVR, where call traffic will be very high and we do not want the model to cause any delay in the workflow.", "We started off initially by going through the data available to us. With insight from the client, we identified intents and entities needed to build the baseline model. Once the model was built and the hyperparameters were identified, we delivered the dashboard with the end-to-end capability to build the dataset, annotate it, train model, etc. The AI backend was integrated into the IVR system. This is usually our alpha release.", "Now, whenever a call comes through, the transcribed text can be sent to the AI backend to get predictions, where the model tries to extract intent and entities from the sentence.", "This info is logged to the database and can be reviewed by the client-side operator. If he finds mistakes in the AI parsed output, he could edit it and send it for retraining the model. The operator can add/remove intents and entities as per the use case.", "Ultimately over time, we get a good baseline dataset to build an appropriate AI model. This will be done as our production-beta release.", "The above example is pretty basic, but you could also extend this for many other use cases. We are yet to try it out for computer vision problems, but for use cases in natural language processing (NLP), predictive modeling, time series, etc we have had quite a lot of success with this method.", "Yes, it does have its limitations. For example, hyperparameter tuning being one of them. Since the model training is done iteratively through the dashboard by a non-AI expert, proper model training and benchmarking may not be possible. Also, over-fitting or under-fitting may occur depending on the type of data and annotation schemes.", "So what is the real purpose? The real aim of this exercise is to build properly annotated data in case your client wants to automate his workflow with AI, but lacks proper data or if the available data is too fragmented.", "It also helps them get an idea of how AI could help them in their digital transformation roadmap.", "This methodology was incubated by us a year back and we have successfully delivered multiple AI projects in NLP, predictive modeling, etc with the help of it. A leading pharma company, a food delivery service in the EU, telecom company in the US are some of our leading clients who benefitted from the above methodology.", "Hope this inspires you in formulating newer methodologies to scale and help your clients seamlessly transform their workflow with the power of AI.", "Your home for data science.
