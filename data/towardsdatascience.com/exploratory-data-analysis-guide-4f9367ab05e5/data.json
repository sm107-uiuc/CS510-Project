In this post, I will show one approach to structure EDA workflow and to conduct it in a more organised and efficient way when working with tabular data (just data from here onwards).", "Although EDA is going to vary from project to project and data to data, there are some basic exploration we would have to do for most projects. With this in mind, we can split EDA into two steps:", "Step 1: Basic exploration: Common to most data", "Step 2: Custom exploration: Specific to the data at hand", "By streamlining the first step with a template, we can speed up the overall process.", "If you want to follow along with the code on your computer, make sure you have pandas, pandas_profiling, matplotlib and seaborn installed. Function definitions in helpers module is available in Appendix at the end of this post.", "Let\u2019s import the necessary packages and update default settings:", "We will use selected columns from titanic dataset as our example:", "Let\u2019s define target and feature columns. Declaring target to a variable at the beginning of the code will make it easier to update code when the target name changes from data to data. That is, you would only have to change the code in one place below instead of multiple places in your code.", "Before we start exploring, let\u2019s make sure to set aside some data for test:", "We are ready to start exploring the training dataset! \ud83d\udd0e", "By basic exploration, you may recall that we are referring to any exploration that are common to most data. To streamline this step, we will prepare a template by leveraging automation tool as well as custom functions. Therefore, let\u2019s split the basic exploration step into two parts:", "The idea behind the template is that we just have to update a few parts in the template when we have new data and can get basic exploration with little effort. Once basic exploration is completed, it\u2019s important to carefully analyse all the charts and aggregate statistics, and create a summary of key findings. This analysis will help shape step 2 of the exploration.", "We will use Pandas Profiling package to automate parts of the basic exploration. We can create Pandas Profiling report (just report from here onwards) in .html file like this:", "With just 2 lines of code, we get an awesome report containing data overview, descriptive statistics, univariate and some bivariate distributions, correlations and missing value summary. Output report will look similar to this. You will notice that you can use the tabs at the top right corner to jump to sections and look at more detailed information by clicking on toggle buttons.", "You can change the title that appears on the top left corner with title and turn on dark mode with dark_mode arguments. For instance, when creating a report, extending the first line to below will get you a report titled \u2018Training Data Report\u2019 in darker mode (which I find nice):", "While I think that creating html report is the best way to use the report, it can be accessed in Jupyter Notebook using one of the following options:", "I recommend try running these options to find your preference. If you want to learn more about the package, see their documentation page.", "It\u2019s likely that automation tools like Pandas Profiling may not cover all parts of basic exploration. If you find yourself doing the same exploration over and over again when working on different projects, and they are not included in the report, then create custom functions or use pandas built-in functions or methods to cater for the gap.", "One key trick to keep the template as clean as possible is to abstract away certain functionalities into custom functions and save it in a separate module. Examples in this post use functions from custom module called \u2018helpers\u2019. The code used for each function is available at the end of this post.", "In this section, we will look at a few example explorations one can do to complement the report. Let\u2019s start with summary for all variables:", "Although this output may seem like a duplicate of what the report shows, looking this information side by side for all variables can be useful. From this output, we can see that deck is missing in roughly 4 in 5 records and age is missing in about 1 in 5 records. Let\u2019s split features into two groups:", "Checking out summary statistics for continuous variables is also useful. The following function extends pandas DataFrame\u2019s .describe() method:", "Here, we can see the descriptive statistics and the summary of outliers. Outlier here is defined using John Tukey\u2019s rule. 12% of fare values are outliers.", "Visualising the distribution of continuous features for each target class can give us insights on their usefulness in discriminating target classes:", "Similar summaries and visualisations can be done for discrete values:", "We can see the number of non-missing and unique values in the first two rows. In the last two rows, we can see the most frequent value and its frequency count.", "Now, let\u2019s visualise the discrete features. By imputing with \u2018missing\u2019, we can see if those records with missing values are more or less likely to have survived relative to the other categories in the feature:", "In this section, we have looked at summary statistics side by side for features and visualised features\u2019 relationship with target to gain some insights on their usefulness in discriminating target classes. I hope you will create your own template for basic exploration using some or all of the ideas mentioned supplemented by your own favourite ways to explore data.", "Once basic exploration is completed, it\u2019s important to carefully analyse output and create a summary of key findings. Here are a few examples:", "Understanding the context of the problem you are trying to solve with data is valuable and can help you sense check the data or interpret the findings. Reading about the problem or talking to relevant stakeholders regarding the problem are good ways gain that understanding. In Titanic\u2019s example, we could google around information to understand the disaster better. After doing a little bit of reading, we will soon find out that there was a \u2018women and children first\u2019 protocol during an emergency which played a role in who was more likely to have survived. Contextualising data this way is helpful in making sense of the data exploration findings and understanding the problem better.", "After completing the basic exploration and analysing its output, the next sensible thing to do is to check your hypothesis and assumptions, and answer specific questions using data. This is where you can be creative and do unique explorations for your data. As this step of the exploration vary from data to data, we won\u2019t look at many examples. Here\u2019s one example where we can answer a question with data:", "How does the survival rate compare between females and males within each class?", "As we can see from the heatmap, women were far more likely to have survived than their male counterparts within and across each class.", "While we have looked at a classification example, the idea could also be adapted for a regression or unsupervised learning problem as well.", "Would you like to access more content like this?
