However, if you just arrived at the data science party, chances are that those words will sound empty: while today\u2019s interviews at \u201cA.I. companies\u201d would likely involve the inside-out of, say, ordinary least squares, most candidates would probably have little-to-no-idea of what non-monotonic reasoning even mean. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d you may ask at this point (\u201cShould we hire them anyway?\u201d you may also ask, but that\u2019s a tough one).", "In a slogan, the unreasonable effectiveness of data happened (as a concept, not just the seminal Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira, 2009, which is, unsurprisingly, a very iconic representation of that concept).", "To see what I mean it\u2019s time to take a deeper dive into the glorious days of the first A.I.: hold your breath.", "\u201cYou could attach prices to thoughts.

So, what was Google\u2019s way out of this?", "As it turns out, deep knowledge of English or commonsense beliefs are not necessary at all to reliably classify a message as spam. We can sidestep the problem of language meaning by transforming the challenge into a simple statistical question: how many times the words \u201cpartnership\u201d and \u201cpetroleum\u201d are to be found together in a spam vs legit message?

While details differ, most of those successes had one move in common: substituting the long and hard work of representing complex knowledge into an optimization problem of some sort; since we could not scale out intelligence, we scaled data harvesting instead.", "In a sense, most of what we\u2019ve learned after the A.I. winter is not really how to build smarter machines: to me, the biggest take-away message is indeed that a lot of practical problems which we thought would require intelligence, could actually be solved by a stupid algorithm and tons of data points.", "The brainchild of \u201cintelligence as curve fitting\u201d is today\u2019s deep learning hype.", "\u201cIt is not worth an intelligent man\u2019s time to be in the majority.

The very idea of neuron-like structures that learn \u201cmimicking the human brain\u201d (yes, people actually say that out loud) is indeed pretty old: what changed recently is that hardware and algorithmic improvements made possible (well, simplifying things quite a bit) to train bigger nets on more data, and drastically improve performances on all sorts of tasks. The general idea of \u201cintelligence as curve fitting\u201d is still the same: given enough data and clever computational techniques, we make again and again the trade from \u201cexpensive\u201d and \u201celusive\u201d knowledge to \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cmeasurable\u201d optimization.", "Funny enough, the difference between humans and machines has become evident not so much in how many answers they got right/wrong, but more in how they are wrong.

Take for example a very cool project, deepmoji, that uses deep learning to produce a model that \u201chas learned to understand emotions and sarcasm\u201d. Even if the original paper is pretty interesting, it\u2019s also fairly easy to realize that \u201cunderstand sarcasm\u201d may prove to be slightly more elusive than advertised. Consider the pair of sentences below:", "While in the first case DeepMoji detects sarcasm and suggests appropriate \u201cangry\u201d emojis (awesome!), the second sentence, which differs only by three letters (N-O-T), is completely misunderstood: there\u2019s no sarcasm at all there. As before with images, this shows that we did not really \u201cunderstand\u201d sarcasm in the first place, but we were \u201cjust\u201d able to train neural networks to pick up statistical features that, under certain conditions, proved to be precise enough.", "Let us stress just two final points before wrapping up:", "In the end, as impressive as \u201ccurve fitting\u201d has become, there\u2019s a growing number of practitioners that believe that A.I. is in deer need of new ideas, not more data/GPUs (Geoffrey Hinton, a true pioneer of deep learning, recently stated that we should \u201cthrow it all away and start again\u201d). We will mention some pioneering developments we like at the very end, since we now have to ask: what should we do with all this newly found Artificial Stupidity?", "\u201cSometimes it seems as though each new step towards AI, rather than producing something which everyone agrees is real intelligence, merely reveals what real intelligence is not.\u201d D. R. Hofstadter", "Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb, 2018 is a recent book by three economists that analyzes the A.I. renaissance through the lenses of economic theory. Their core argument is fairly simple: A.I. means lower cost of predictions, and since predictions have great and widespread business values, a lot of economic processes will be changed in the near future as A.I. permeates every aspect of our personal and corporate life.", "At this point, it should be clear that the \u201cA.I.\u201d they have in mind is clearly not what McCarthy and friends set out to build during that summer at Dartmouth; what they have in mind is a plethora of small, task-specific, finely optimized pieces of software that will solve narrow business problems better than existing systems \u2014 a spam filter, a carousel of recommended books in an e-commerce, a notification on when to buy a ticket to Chicago, optimizing for weather, airlines price fluctuations, etc.", "This, and \u201cjust\u201d this, is the current A.I. revolution, which is taking by storm consumer and enterprise markets by simply be better at \u201cstupid\u201d tasks: while these prediction machines won\u2019t achieve any level of intelligence or understanding, combined together they lower the costs and increase the efficiency of many processes.", "In this perspective, while tech is not the main actor anymore, it\u2019s obviously the enabler of this new business ecosystem: without the booming of open source engineering tools and libraries, educational resources, computational power, sheer data, none of this swarm of \u201cA.I. for X\u201d companies would have been possible and a lot of situations would still be fairly un-optimized. As prediction gets abstracted and encapsulated with even better libraries and services, we can see a near future in which A.I. components will be as common in a code base as today is interacting with a database. While exchanging the big dream of understanding intelligence with aptly optimized curve fitting tools is certainly disheartening to some, taking A.I. from university labs into the wild business world was a necessary step to renew interest, increase funding and attract talent. From the business point of view, there are multi-billion dollar opportunities out there who require just a bit of science and the right amount of data (McKinsey estimates A.I. may create more than $3.5T in value annually): for \u201cprediction-based A.I.\u201d spring, certainly not winter, is coming.", "Obviously enough, all this \u201cdumbed-down\u201d A.I. will be worthless in comparison to what (even a fraction of) \u201ctrue\u201d A.I. could achieve; unfortunately, the one thing A.I.-as-a-field did very consistently throughout the years, is to fail spectacularly to match its own expectations. In this respect, the advent of \u201cprediction machines\u201d, while less exciting and game-changing than the future advent of \u201cthinking machines\u201d, marks an unprecedented milestone in the history of the discipline \u2014 i.e business value above a symbolic \u201cpoint of no return\u201d.", "While hype and optimism will continue to come and go, \u201ccurve fitting\u201d finally gave A.I. a seat at the big table: it\u2019s indeed true that sometimes wise beats smart.", "\u201cHofstadter\u2019s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter\u2019s Law.\u201d D.

Well, this is a very hard prediction: nobody knows how far the target is and\u2014even worse\u2014 nobody knows what path will lead us there. As hinted above, it seems highly unlikely that \u201cbottom-up approaches\u201d alone or \u201csymbolic reasoning\u201d alone will suffice: how to effectively combine the two in full generality, however, is still a mystery. On the more \u201csymbolic\u201d part of the spectrum, a recent wave of incredible ideas, papers and tools in probabilistic programming promises to marry logic and probability in an unprecedented way: if you are curious on our own take on it, we recently published a long, opinionated and cognition friendly post with runnable code samples.", "If A.I. history \u2014 which we so partially and subjectively reviewed\u2014teaches us something, I feel confident in putting forward three suggestions:", "And what about A.I. startup founders (if anyone cares about them at all)?
