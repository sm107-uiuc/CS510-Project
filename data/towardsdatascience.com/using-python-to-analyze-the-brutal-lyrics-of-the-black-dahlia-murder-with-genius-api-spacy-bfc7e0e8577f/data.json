Back in 2006, my buddy burned a CD of his favorite metal songs, and \u201cMiasma\u201d from BDM\u2019s album Miasma was on it. Once I heard that song, I was hooked for life and have seen them perform live five times. Formed in 2001, BDM quickly rose up as one of the most popular American death metal bands. Their last seven albums charted on the Billboard 200 with their fifth album, Ritual, peaking at 31 in 2011!", "The subject-mater is dark and morose, and the music feels like the embodiment of rage and depression, but as an angsty teenager in the early 2000's, the energy and the anger of Death metal struck a chord with me. I could relate to it. To this day, I find comfort in melodic riffs, double kicks, and grumbling vocals because they put me in a trance-like state, relaxing me and focusing my mind. I find Death Metal to be the perfect music for coding and working out, and I like to start my day headbanging to blast beats.", "I am extracting the lyrics from Genius.com. Because of the blood curdling screams and the unearthly growls used in heavy metal, lyrics can sometimes be quite difficult to understand. That\u2019s why I use Genius to decipher them. Genius.com is a platform for annotating lyrics, and collecting trivia about music, albums and artists.", "Although the website doesn\u2019t allow users to extract lyrics using the API, I am using a Genius API wrapper that parses the Genius HTML with BeautifulSoup. The process results in a pandas DataFrame that contains the song title, url, artist, album and lyrics. Find the wrapper on my GitHub in a file named getLyrics.py.", "To use the wrapper, pass your Genius API token and the artist into the GeniusLyricCollector. Then call get_artist_songs() to populate the DataFrame.", "Before analyzing data, it is always best to explore and clean it as needed. Right off the bat, I notice row 2 has no album listed, so I know I need to clean the data, and I want to add some features too. In order to preserve the original dataframe in case I need to go back to it, I\u2019ll copy it and work on the copy. I check the included albums:", "I only want songs from their 8 studio albums. Verminous hasn\u2019t released and has no lyrics, Black on Black is a tribute album and A Cold-Blooded Epitaph is an EP, so I\u2019ll exclude all of those.", "Feature engineering is the process of using data mining techniques and domain knowledge to extract features from raw data. I want to engineer some features that will give me insight into the lexical richness of the albums. I\u2019ll define lexical richness using a few different factors. I\u2019ll add a word count, unique word count, and unique words/word count (lexical diversity). While it can be a useful measure and is a simple calculation, the basic problem with calculating lexical diversity this way is its sensitivity to text length. Luckily, the length of each album is fairly similar. Several different ways have been devised to overcome the problems with the method, but I\u2019ll use the simple calculation.", "I also add the album\u2019s year of release and sort by the column.", "During a 2019 interview for kerrang.com, lyricist, vocalist and band frontman Trevor Strnad discussed albums, ranking them worst to best. In last place, he put Miasma, the band\u2019s second studio album. Having grown up with the album, I love it, but he said the album felt unfocused, in part because they were riding such a high from their early success with Unhallowed. The stats show that Miasma has the fewest words and the fewest unique words suggesting that Trevor is correct about the themes and the lyrics being less defined compared to other albums. He wasn\u2019t able to give the album the attention he thought it deserved.", "To visualize the data, I\u2019m using plotly express since it produces interactive visualizations in only a few lines of code! Below is a histogram showing the distribution of word count by album.", "Box plots are a great way to visualize the quartile statistics. Using pandas\u2019 describe(), it is easy to generate the raw quartiles too. Using Plotly Express, it is possible to set the quartile algorithm used in the box plots. It defaults to linear.", "Once again, we can see the Album Miasma doesn\u2019t have quite the range and diversity of the other albums. Looking at the albums that have lower lexical diversity, I notice that those are all of the albums with well defined themes: Nocturnal, Ritual, Abysmal, and Unhallowed. Ritual for example, is their highest charting album, but has a lower lexical diversity than other albums. This is likely due to songs like \u201cOh Great Burning Nullifier\u201d that have repeating patterns, like chants, which are thematic to the album.", "SpaCy is \u201can industrial-strength\u201d Natural Language Processing library for Python. It was developed using Cython under the hood, making it fast and and efficient for large-scale text processing tasks like Parts-of-speech (PoS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER). I\u2019m going to use the part of speech tagger to get a deeper look into the lyrics and themes used in the albums.", "If you\u2019re new to spaCy, I recommend checking out their installation page since they have a lot of installation options. SpaCy is compatible with Python 2.7 / 3.5+ and runs on Unix/Linux, macOS/OS X and Windows. The latest spaCy releases are available via pip and conda. Otherwise, these commands will get you up and running.", "Using spaCy, I can split the text into tokens, and use the part of speech tagger to identify all of the nouns, verbs and adjectives. I\u2019m going to take a look at the top 15 adjectives per album to see what patterns emerge. It is important to note that spaCy is powerful, but not perfect. It uses statistical models to predict parts of speech or named entities.", "Instead of analyzing the raw word, I\u2019m going to analyze the lemmas. Lemmatisation is a technique that normalizes the language by reducing the word to a root form while maintaining that it is a real word. Another commonly used normalization technique is called Stemming.", "Notice in the above code snippet, I create a dataframe and populate it with the word token, the part of speech tag, and the lemma. When I calculate the counts for ADJ, I\u2019ll use the lemma instead of the token.", "Rightly so, it is clear that death, darkness and human fragility are major themes in the BDM\u2019s music. The word \u201cdead\u201d tops the list for all albums except Unhallowed and Nocturnal, two of their early hit albums. Although a lot of the same words show up in each album, there are a few thematic differences. For example, in Nocturnal I can see the words \u201cunholy\u201d, \u201cwretched,\u201d and \u201cnecromantic\u201d appear multiple times which are thematically representative of a world cast into eternal darkness, like the album conveys. Using a plotly express bar chart, the data is easy to visualize.", "Although the lyrics are only a small portion of what I enjoy about death metal, they are interesting to analyze. Even without running techniques like K-means or LDA, spaCy can help identify themes in the text using the features like the tagger and named entity recognition. Looking at The Black Dahlia Murder\u2019s lyrics, they represent anger and depravity, depression and insanity. While some may shy away or feel putrefied by the descriptions of malice, I embrace it and the music, and I am forever a fan of the fast double kicks, the hypnotic melodic riffs, and the amazing vocal range of the Black Dahlia Murder. I can\u2019t wait to hear what they bring forth in Verminous.", "Check out my other tutorials for more information about NLP and Data Science:", "Your home for data science.
