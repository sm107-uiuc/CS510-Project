What is the problem you are trying to solve? As a trained McKinsey consultant, nobody knows better than I do the principle of having to define your problem up front, laying out a use case for the work you are doing.", "But if you are learning data science, I think you should throw that principle out the window and take up a new one: Learning Through Play. Underlying this philosophy is the idea that \u2014 if your objective is to learn new technical skills \u2014 you should think up projects with no particular end objective in mind, other than the fact that you want to do it and you think you might gain something stimulating from participating in the activity. I\u2019m going to argue in this article that the principles of Learning Through Play apply just as much to Data Scientists as they do to pre-schoolers. We will look at what the behavioral psychologists say about Learning Through Play and I hope you will join me in concluding that if you try it any other way you will miss out on important learning that you won\u2019t find anywhere else.", "To all pre-school children the world is new and they need to make sense of it in their early years. Most behavioral psychologists and educators agree that the most effective way of doing this is through play. It is through play that children take advantage of a safe environment to explore and test out the skills they will need as they grow \u2014 their social and cognitive skills, their emotional maturity and their self-confidence.", "The book Einstein Never Used Flash Cards lists five characteristics of play which differentiates it from work:", "Importantly, there are two critical differentiators between work and play. The first is who it is initiated by. Play is mostly initiated by the participant, never by a leader, co-ordinator or authority figure. And play is completely process-oriented with no defined up-front objective.", "Outside of my work, I frequently take on personal learning projects to continue to develop my technical Data Science skills and to keep up to date with the latest technology. One of the many examples of this is when I recently completed a personal project where I worked on creating a network of characters from the TV series Friends so that I could analyze and visualize that network.", "I didn\u2019t realize this so explicitly until I am writing it down now, but all my personal learning projects follow the principles of Learning Through Play. To use my Friends project as an example:", "Like the world of a pre-schooler, the world of a Data Scientist is massive and at times overwhelming. Where do I start? What do I do next? How do I know I can do this? What might go wrong? But the more you play, the less massive those questions seem and the more confident you become that you can take on any challenge that comes your way.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am not arguing against formal education and learning objectives in Data Science \u2014 these are absolutely still necessary especially for people starting out in the field. But I am arguing that great data scientists can only become great data scientists by Learning Through Play. Here are three reasons why:", "I have absolutely no doubt that I Learn Through Play. All the new things I have used or applied at work in my recent memory have been things that I was exposed to through fun personal projects. If I had not taken on those projects, I would never have even known about the methods that I then applied in my work.", "But how about you? Here are some questions to ask yourself to determine if you are effectively Learning Through Play:", "Learn Through Play has been my mantra for several years, though I\u2019m only just getting round to articulating it now. I\u2019m convinced it should be the mantra of all Data Scientists.", "Originally I was a Pure Mathematician, then I became a Psychometrician and a Data Scientist. I am passionate about applying the rigor of all those disciplines to complex people questions. I\u2019m also a coding geek and a massive fan of Japanese RPGs. Find me on LinkedIn or on Twitter.
