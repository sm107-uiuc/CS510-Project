The goal was to help a large tech firm understand how they could ethically leverage brain data.", "With the rise of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), development of deep learning solutions to help improve BCIs accuracy, and drop in the cost of EEG (Electroencephalography) headsets, a growing number of startups and large tech firms are looking for new ways to generate revenue from brain data.", "Indeed, the development of brain-computer interfaces will fuel a lucrative data market and accelerate the development of \u201cNeurocapitalism\u201d. Several companies are already engaged in a race to find the best strategy before both invasive & non-invasive BCIs become a mass-market product.", "In this article, I\u2019ll explain the business importance of brain data combined with algorithms, the possible future business models related to BCIs, how BCI and AI combined will create stronger product ecosystems, and the concept of \u201cNeurocapitalism\u201d.", "For those of you unfamiliar with the term \u201cBrain-Computer Interface\u201d, it defines a device that allows for direct communication between the brain and a machine.", "In other words, a BCI is a \u201ccomputer-based system that acquires brain signals, analyzes them, and translates them into commands that are relayed to an output device to carry out the desired action\u201d (1).", "Several companies already develop head-worn devices to understand human intent by using machine learning techniques to classify the electrical signals produced by brains. By using specific tools, it becomes possible to turn these biometric signals into actionable insights for measuring emotion and providing control of connected devices.", "In this article, I will often mention \u201cMachine learning\u201d for two reasons. The first one is that BCI can help create better data network effects and collect strategic data. The second one is related to how ML can help BCIs become market-ready.", "Indeed, the development of a brain-computer interface is closely associated with Machine Learning. ML techniques (including Deep learning) play a key role in \u201cfeature extraction and classification of EEG/ECoG signals\u201d (2).", "Based on my experience, decoding the brain electrical activity with high variability and non-stationary noise into a meaningful signal is difficult. As such, the use of machine learning techniques is key to solve BCI applications.", "For instance, deep learning (ML subset) seems promising to learn from raw EEG data to extract better features to improve performance and robustness.", "To tackle the challenges in BCI application, several organizations work to improve the extraction of essential features from EEG signals.", "Moreover, when BCIs are \u201cassociated with devices, internal parameters are provided to the algorithms constantly, such as pulse durations and amplitudes, stimulation frequencies, energy consumption by the device, stimulation or recording densities, and electrical properties of the neural tissues\u201d (2). Moreover, \u201cAI algorithms can identify useful patterns in brain data and produce a desired functional outcome.\u201d (3)", "From a customer experience standpoint, the use of AI and BCI combined could look like this. Let us imagine that you see someone wearing a t-shirt you like on the street. Later, as you\u2019re scrolling on your favorite social media app, you see a similar-looking t-shirt on a sponsored post.", "The person wearing this t-shirt might look like you thanks to some automated content based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This scenario could become a reality soon.", "By leveraging BCIs, it becomes possible for companies to collect key marketing data such as memory activation.", "This situation will enable companies to collect even more personalized data about consumers and radically change the way we interact with everyday devices.", "Brain-computer interface will give companies the ability to \u201ctrack customer journeys, sentiments and preferences\u201d (4) on a deeper level and send tailor-made ads and experiences to increase sales straight to their brains or wearable devices.", "BCIs could also be used to \u201coptimize internet ads and TV spots\u201d (5). It is safe to assume that brain waves data instead of cookie data will become the new norm for future web-based advertising.", "If a company like Google would decide to develop BCIs, they could detect whether you\u2019re paying attention to video ads, how you feel about them, and whether they are personally relevant to you or not. A company like Apple could develop a BCI that would select music playlists according to your mood.", "Other companies might develop applications to also collect your brain data using a BCI made by another company (A bit like Google Play and third-party mobile applications).", "These same large tech firms will also mostly benefit from new forms of BCIs. Indeed, some companies can already make a brain-computer interface in the form of headphones (6). Other forms of BCI will help bring the benefits of BCIs to the masses in a form factor that people wear on a regular basis. That is why brain data is becoming extremely strategic for companies.", "A headset capable of running a range of third-party applications can now be purchased for $100 (7).", "During my mission, we have concluded that advanced tech firms must already start preparing for the acceleration of the neurocapitalism era.. The upcoming years will be impacted by the commercialization of brain data in the consumer market as well as the development of devices made to interact with BCIs.", "Non-invasive brain-computer interface will make people trade their brain data for services from private companies.", "Beyond simply manufacturing brain-computer interfaces, I expect large tech firms to develop a real ecosystem of free applications and other devices alongside BCIs.", "Based on our analysis, we believe that the main business model for BCI will be the one called \u201cPay with data\u201d. For example, some BCI applications like music selection could be offered for free in exchange for users to grant full access to all their brain data related to this application (8).", "This data could then be organized and either used for targeted advertising purposes or sold to third parties at a premium. By improving the quality of the service and the relevance of ads, this business model will help increase the lock-in effect of customers.", "Lock In Effect: Strategy in which a company makes it extremely difficult for their customers to leave them.", "Companies could also leverage brain data to improve product recommendations and greatly increase each customer\u2019s lifetime value. This is strategic for most eCommerce companies. In that case, brain data will help an existing business model.", "We also expect to see BCIs become the user interface of the future, enabling more seamless communication with devices. As such, large tech firms will try to add BCI-related features to their current product ecosystem strategy. They could then collect data from multiple sources/devices including BCI/brain data. Brain data will help improve the efficiency of the ecosystem and maximize both customer retention and customer lifetime value.", "The integration of BCI into existing product ecosystem will also help increase sales. For instance, if a consumer is paying attention to a specific product in a store, the BCI-powered smart-glasses can classify the thought related to the price and send this information to the store that can use some dynamic pricing to adapt the price.", "Most businesses selling online content will highly benefit from the use of brain data. For instance, media companies could use brain data to decide what content to create. BCIs could also measure the level of attention of each reader and adapt the content in real-time.", "It would become possible to improve the relevance of ads/affiliate links next to each content. Brain data could also be used to create better content recommendations and higher engagement. Companies could then charge for usage (e.g. Netflix).", "Other companies might have access to your brain data through their app as well as other data about you. For instance, LinkedIn could sell information about your past job experiences and data related to how you reacted to some specific job ads. As such, companies could sell access to premium data or even sell API access to raw data made with brain data.", "Another interesting business model could be related to workers\u2019 efficiency. Some companies have already leveraged BCIs to \u201cdetect changes in emotional states in employees on the production line, the military and at the helm of high-speed trains\u201d (9).", "Existing BCIs combined with wireless sensors constantly monitor the \u201cwearer\u2019s brainwaves and stream the data to computers that use Machine Learning to detect emotional spikes such as depression, anxiety, or rage\u201d (10).", "In my opinion, B2B BCIs will represent a significant market. Specialized companies will promote BCIs as a way to increase the overall efficiency of the workers by modifying the frequency and length of break times to reduce mental stress. I expect to see most BCIs concealed in regular safety helmets or uniform hats.", "I assume that some specific jobs will require BCIs (pilots, truck drivers, etc.).", "Employees brain data could become a new revenue stream. Indeed, brain data could be sold to other companies for dataset related purposes or market studies.", "I believe brain data will become a fundamental component in the production of many machine learning-based products. Most current tech products or services depend on the quality of user data. The more users of an application, the more data can be collected, to better train the models, which provide better accuracy, which in turn attracts more users.", "In my opinion, Brain data will further strengthen businesses built upon data network effects. Having access to brain data means a better dataset for ML initiatives, better ML means better services/products, etc. Companies without the ability to leverage brain data will have less powerful data network effects.", "Almost all companies/industries will be impacted by brain data. The consequences for data collected through the use of BCIs reach far beyond targeted ads. For instance:", "I expect to see many companies develop free applications for BCI devices. These applications will serve as Trojan Horse to collect brain data, then turning the data into a competitive moat that will help improve other products/solutions.", "Data moat: A data moat is a \u201ccompetitive advantage you hold against other businesses based on your proprietary data set\u201d (14).", "Despite these promising potential new revenue streams, I must highlight the current lack of clarity as to which devices qualify as BCIs. Indeed, there is a regulatory gray area for non-invasive BCIs. To some experts, that means our society is going to need some rules, about how brain \u201cdata is collected, stored, and used\u201d (15).", "It is safe to say that most large tech firms have a history of unethical use of customer data. I expect large tech firms to invest lot of time and money on content that explains how they will protect your data privacy. When BCIs will become mainstream, data privacy will become a major diffenrentiating factor .", "AI Consultant \u2014 Working on Brain-computer interface and new AI business models \u2014 Support my
