What used to be typically seen as just a traditional food, mushrooms are now being widely consumed and acknowledged for their healing and health abilities. With more and more people interested, foraging for mushrooms in the wild is likely to increase and I wanted to understand if edible or poisonous mushrooms could be easily identified and what that looks like.", "The raw dataset utilized in this project was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes categorical characteristics on 8,124 mushroom samples from 23 species of gilled mushrooms.", "The target variable assessed was a class distinction of \u2018edible\u2019 or \u2018poisonous\u2019 and was mostly balanced from the start.", "The explanatory variables covered a range of descriptive and visual characteristics on the structure of each observed mushroom \u2014 such as, cap color, odor, ring number and stalk shape. There were originally 21 explanatory variables in my dataset, all were categorical. A few feature visualizations are plotted with Seaborn below (pre-one-hot encoding):", "I also utilized EDA to visualize the relationship between the features and the classes of the dataset. There were definitely instances that showed a clear separation:", "After getting a bit of insight into my dataset through EDA, I dug into the modeling. It should be noted that my dataset was mostly clean from the start \u2014 but there were still several areas for cleaning. The main areas of pre-processing my data for modeling were:", "So what models did I run?", "I ran a baseline dummy classifier (predicts the majority class), Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. I utilized grid search to tune the hyper parameters of each (not including the baseline model). My best estimators and their test scores are shown below:", "My classification models all performed really well with the dataset! Which was definitely surprising to me\u2026. but I\u2019ll touch more on that later.", "A few thoughts on my models \u2014 Logistic Regression, which had a score of 99% would normally be an excellent choice. However, given that the model predicted a few false negatives (and that could be deadly in this case), I would say that the other 3 models performed perfectly and as such, are much better suited to classify mushrooms.", "Since my models performed so well, it was clear to me that they were able to identify specific traits that greatly influenced the classification of an edible versus poisonous mushroom. And that was exactly what I was hoping for!", "I explored the feature importance from my decision tree classifier and my random forest classifier and plotted the top 10 below. There were some overlaps and some variation as shown\u2026 and as you can also see, odor_n, standing for none, was selected by both models for greatest importance.", "And finally, a few simple rules to identify a poisonous mushroom\u2026.", "I was able to put together a simple list using what I learned from my feature importance analysis and EDA. That said, I am not an expert and this list should not be applied in the real world \u2014 but I was able to draw some conclusions which are worth sharing for the purpose of this project.", "2. Gill Size: If the gills are narrow, it is likely to be poisonous.", "3. Spore Print Color: White, red, \u2018chocolate\u2019 are likely to be poisonous.", "4. Bruises: If the mushroom does not have bruises, it is likely to be poisonous.", "5. Stalk Surface Above Ring: If it appears silky, it is likely to be poisonous.", "To expand on this project and perhaps pick a \u2018final\u2019 model, I would like to see if there is similar data available for future analysis. This way I can test my models further and perhaps find some insight into what will work best in a real world situation. A few models performed perfectly on my dataset, so its worth questioning if the dataset was perhaps compromised and therefore, testing my models on another dataset could provide further validation.", "Additionally, using my conclusions paired with image classification could also be a worthwhile experiment.", "If you\u2019re interested in the code behind this project \u2014 check out my Github: https://github.com/AlisonSalerno/Classification-model-project", "Your home for data science.
