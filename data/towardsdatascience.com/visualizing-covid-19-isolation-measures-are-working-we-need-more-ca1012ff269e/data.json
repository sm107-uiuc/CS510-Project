The state took decisive action, ordering \u201cshelter in place\u201d 5\u20137 days before New York, and it appears to have made a huge difference, though obviously not the only factor in play.", "Given the success of countries like Singapore and Taiwan in controlling the spread of the virus using aggressive testing and isolation measures, it is reasonable to think that taking aggressive isolation measures early has helped California control the spread and will help other states across the nation.", "While it may seem obvious to many that aggressive isolation measures would be effective, a number of states have still not implemented any shelter in place/stay at home orders, or any other form of strong isolation.", "Implementing those isolation measures may represent our best opportunity at fighting the virus\u2019 spread in a world where the United States currently has the most confirmed cases worldwide.", "The second important point: all states appear to be following a similar pattern of exponential growth, as you\u2019ll see below \u2014 even those with smaller numbers of cases.", "Given that many of them appear to be earlier in the curve, it is imperative that seize the opportunity to take action and implement isolation measures while their situations may still be more controllable.", "The charts below show the growth in total number of cases per state for states outside of the \u201ctop 10\u201d. You\u2019ll notice all of the curves share a similar shape. I\u2019ve limited each graph to no more than 10 states for clarity of viewing.", "Social distancing and isolation may be the best tools we currently have in our global fight against the novel coronavirus, and according to the data, when implemented correctly they are working.", "I hope those in leadership positions will take the necessary actions swiftly, and that each of us will take this seriously, do our parts, and stay home to the best of our ability.", "And of course, all of this isolation does not come without cost. We will also need social solutions, government intervention, new innovation, and a whole lot of empathy to help each other through what will be an extremely challenging and devastating experience, mentally, spiritually, and financially, especially for the most vulnerable segments of our population and economy.", "With cautious optimism, I believe we are capable of rising to the occasion, but I will not attempt to explore those issues here. From inside my apartment where I will remain with my family, wishing us all the best.", "For further details behind my analysis, or to see the Python code behind it, you can visit my Github here.", "Just understand that this is a work in progress, and don\u2019t expect me to clean anything up \ud83d\ude06", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
