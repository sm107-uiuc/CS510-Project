So, the delay in one second allows her to aim and make a powerful shot instead of a weak shot without delay. You just walk toward the bot, opencv detect bot and build a box around him, and after that program try to make a shot. I made the point with possible position of the head in the box, so program will keep move camera to this point and click after achieving that point.", "Be ware, that using time.sleep(1.0) cause losing 1 second in recording video, because program paused for 1 second (10 fps). You can change this line with time.sleep(1.0) to pyautogui.PAUSE=1.0 and added after click returns to default pyautogui settings (by following way \u2014 pyautogui.PAUSE=0.01). I shouldn\u2019t recommend you this because programm accuracy will make some strange moves (such as shoot when moving toward the target point).

It\u2019s important, because if model detect two or more boxes she will jumped from one to another without any actions (but it works not perfect and something buggy).", "Then we found centerX and centerY coordinates \u2014 to this point our model will move. For moving calculated moveX and moveY. If move very big (line 191\u2013194) we are make this move smaller \u2014 that improve accuracy of moves along with (line 195\u2013198): if model are close (5 px or smaller) to target, make next move equal to 0(so no move on this axis will allowed, move on another axis which is great then 5). If we achieved \u201ccenter\u201d \u2014 model will perform our supposed set of actions (line 204\u2013212). Here you can try used pyautogui.PAUSE along without time.sleep(1.0).

For example, when defeat_bots.py moves are not undestandable by you, those monitoring outputs can helps you to see, what model will do in next frame, which moves select, in which directions moves next, how much pixels...
