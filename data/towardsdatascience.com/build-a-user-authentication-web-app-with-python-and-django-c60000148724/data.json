It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. For this tutorial we will be using mainly class base views(CBV) because they are a lot more easy to understand, save time and already have test built into them as compared to the functional base views(FBV) which are a lot more easy to customize but do not have test built into them.", "In order to better understand and appreciate this tutorial, a basic understanding of python and the django framework is essential.", "All of the above with the exception of Bootstrap 4 can be installed directly from the requirements.txt file by running the following code on the command line pip install requirements.txt", "N.B: The requirements.txt file is found on this projects github repo.

This is simply a class containing a OneToOneField() with information relating to a specific user.", "Next we create a signals.py file in our authapp as seen below. As defined in the official Django documentation, signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place.
