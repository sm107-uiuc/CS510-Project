Many thanks to Ultralytics for putting this repository together.", "You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. On a Pascal Titan X it processes images at 30 FPS and has a mAP of 57.9% on COCO test-dev.", "YOLOv3 is extremely fast and accurate. In mAP measured at .5 IOU YOLOv3 is on par with Focal Loss but about 4x faster. Moreover, you can easily tradeoff between speed and accuracy simply by changing the size of the model, no retraining required!", "YOLOv3 has a problem though, despite being so accurate, it is biased. The bias is towards the size of the object in the image. If encountered with bigger objects while training, it cannot detect the same object of a smaller scale perfectly.", "YOLOv3 detects features in images and learn how to recognize objects with this information. Layers near the start detecting really simple features like edges and layers that are deeper can detect more complex features like eyes, noses, or an entire face. It then uses all of these features which it has learned, to make a final prediction. Herein lies the flaws of this system \u2014 there is no spatial that is used anywhere in a CNN and the pooling function that is used to connect layers is rendered inefficient.", "YOLOv5 consists of three parts :", "The model head helps in the process of feature extraction. The model backbone consists of CSP Nets which help extract essential features from tensor passed through the model head. CSPNets enable quicker inference as well. The tensor from the model backbone is passed through the model neck which has feature pyramids, which try to eliminate bias with respect to size of objects.", "To know more about feature pyramids, check this out", "To know more about YOLOv5, check this out.", "Check out the YOLO v5 repository at", "For our use case, I have created a similar repository at", "To detect a license plate in the car image, save it in the sample_cars folder of the directory.
