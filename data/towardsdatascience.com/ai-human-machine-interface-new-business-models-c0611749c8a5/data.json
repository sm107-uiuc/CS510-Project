In reality, manufacturing companies have decades of investment in industrial protocols, the huge install base of proprietary equipment/systems and archaic user interfaces. Based on these elements: How can you drive innovation, flexibility and growth at a global scale in such a fragmented environment?", "HMI is about how people and automated systems interact and communicate with each other.", "The Human Machine Interface is the intermediary between a machine and the operating personnel. HMI is without a doubt, the most important tool in the hands of operators and managers to keep an eye on production in a machine hall or factory.", "HMI has long ceased to be confined to just traditional machines in industry and now also relates to computers, digital systems or devices for the Internet of Things (IoT).", "From an operational point of view, the operator of a machine must be able to see at a glance the condition and processes in his area of responsibility. What is happening behind the machine? Are engine and valve states in the setpoint? Are the tank levels sufficient for uninterrupted production?", "The most important task of the HMI is to display complex process variables quickly and concisely for easy interpretation of production information.", "Building a good HMI is not easy since the basis of building HMIs largely depends on the understanding of human physical, behavioral and mental capabilities. In other words, ergonomics forms the principles behind HMIs.", "Good HMI design must allow users to understand the behaviors of the systems, which in turn must appear plausible to them. Soft factors, such as the system explaining itself (explainable AI) not only play a major role in improving the quality of interactions but also allow machines to imitate emotional behaviors that encourage acceptance and usage.", "Human Machine Interface has also changed from buttons and diodes in control rooms, through web visualization to cognitive solutions.", "In reality, a machine or plant can only ever be as good as its interface to humans. That is why every investment in an optimally designed human-machine interface is strategic. Data visualization and textual representation can enable operators and managers to precisely coordinate and control production processes in a factory but we could do more with Machine Learning.", "Traditional HMI solutions were stand-alone, isolated terminals that were deployed by an OEM (Orginal Equipment Manufacturer) as part of a machine. New HMI solutions based on Machine Learning are either pre-configured to send data to the cloud or an on-premise solution.", "Today, a status is displayed using a labelled LED signal lamp, illuminated buttons and display panels, and computer-supported user interfaces on a screen. Beyond HMI, I believe that switches, LED Indicators, joysticks and switch panels manufacturers will have to make their products more intelligent by using smart sensors connected to an AI-powered human-machine interface that they would have created themselves\u2026 A fundamental shift in business model is being enabled by IoT sensors: a move from products to services.", "Beyond working with B2B companies, it will become easier to collaborate with B2C companies by better leveraging IoT sensors and creating new applications for HMIs or HMIs products such as LED lamps or switch buttons. However, data collected from IoT sensors is only useful when you can derive useful intelligence from it, and preferably in an automated way\u2026", "This new shift will encourage companies to transition from creating HMI solutions to building sensor networks and managing machine learning projects.", "Indeed, IoT sensor solutions today are mostly only responsible for data acquisition. When we merge the sensor with AI in terms of machine learning, this creates a predictive tool that can be sold to other organizations. Through IoT sensors, we can measure and collect data related to movement, temperature or vibration of a machine. Once the data is gathered, we need to apply a machine learning technique to classify and analyze it. The available machine learning options are numerous, ranging from logistic regression to neural networks.", "To understand how these technologies could work together, picture a widely distributed array of IoT sensors collecting data throughout a manufacturing facility, and streaming it rapidly back to a central neural system.", "We can imagine also that the data generated through these elements will be integrated into an independent predictive maintenance system through a module system or sold to other companies to help them create better products.", "For instance, traffic lights manufacturers could build a new product (based on new LED-equipped with smart sensors) that can change color on their own when a vehicle drives over the inductive loop in the road\u2019s surface.", "I expect to see more technological partnerships between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and industries. OEMs will have to create new added value for their products and ultimately help their clients innovate. I predict that OEMs will become less merely suppliers but more innovation partners.", "We\u2019re in the early stages of an evolution from highly complex approaches to much more intuitive interfaces.", "This necessity to modernize HMIs is at the beginning of its lifecycle with \u201cnew\u201d technologies like facial recognition capabilities becoming standard in mobile devices. I realized that voice control is among the most preferred interfaces with the most significant percentage of HMIs since it allows hands-free control and, therefore, less distraction.", "The future of HMI will be related to AI. Over time, these systems will naturally generate extensive amounts of data. Indeed, companies will expect HMIs equipped with some Machine learning algorithms that can learn from all the data generated from IoT sensors and adapt to the ongoing behaviour of the operator. Moreover, the system will have to be efficient enough that it learns from previous computations that have been made to generate reliable, repeatable decisions and results that are acceptable in vigorous computation and operation of the connected devices.", "In my personal view, this is a big change in business models for OEM companies. Obviously, there will be some winners, and there will also be those who don\u2019t quite get it right and fall by the wayside.", "Your home for data science.
