How will you do that?", "Again, it\u2019s pretty simple. Just draw a line that best fits all the points shown in the scatter plot, and the line equation will give you the relationship between variables.", "That\u2019s the basic idea of Regression. It is quantifying the relationship between variables by fitting all points using a function.", "The method used to determine the best fitting line is out of the scope of this article. But if you\u2019re interested, it\u2019s done by a technique called ordinary least squares.", "The example that we just saw is called simple linear Regression which involves only one independent variable or feature (advertising cost on TV).", "But the same concept of Regression can be expanded to multiple independent variables or features, which is called multiple linear Regression.", "For example, check out this table.", "Here, we have advertising costs spent on TV, radio and newspaper along with the respective sales revenue.", "We won\u2019t be able to visualise the relationship on a 2D plane, but the concept of linear Regression can still be applied to determine the best fitting function for all these points.", "And the function will be of the form:", "So this is the basic idea behind Regression.", "Now let\u2019s look at how to implement Regression using Excel.", "The first step is the add data analysis toolpak", "Data Analysis ToolPak is not available by default, and you need to activate the add-in separately.", "To activate, go to File -> Options -> Add-ins and then activate the Analysis ToolPak.
