Therefore, more innovative approaches are needed, such as using Artificial Intelligence methods and practices that provide flexibility and learning ability, especially in cyber defense.", "Considering cyber defense, the existing Artificial Intelligence methods and architectures can be listed as follows;", "A. Neural Nets: Neural networks have a long history, which began in 1957 with the discovery of \u201cperceptron\u201d by Frank Rosenblatt. In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm developed for supervisory learning of binary classifiers (functions that decide whether the input represented by vector numbers belongs to a particular class). One of the most popular elements of these neural networks is artificial neurons [3, 4]. A small number of perceptrons working together can learn and solve problems. But neural networks can consist of a large number of artificial neurons. Neural networks consisting of a large number of artificial neurons can provide mass parallel learning and decision making functionality. The most prominent feature of these networks is their operational speed. They are very suitable for pattern recognition, learning, classification, and response to attacks. They can be applied to both hardware and software [5].", "Neural networks are also suitable for intrusion detection and prevention [6, 7, 8, 9]. Scientific studies shows how effective to use these networks for DoS detection [10], computer worm detection [11], spam detection [12], bot detection [13], malware classification [14] and digital forensic research [15].", "One reason neural networks are popular in cyber defense is their high speed if they can be implemented in hardware and used in graphics processors. Third generation neural network \u2014 applications of spiking neural networks that mimic biological neurons more realistically are among the new developments in neural network technology. Systems provided by FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) that allow neural networks to develop rapidly and adapt to changing threats make significant contributions to cyber defense [16].", "B. Expert Systems: Expert systems are the most used Artificial Intelligence tools. The expert system is software used in the activity areas in some applications to finding answers to questions presented by a user or another software. It can be used directly to support decisions in areas such as medical diagnostics, finance, or cyberspace. There are a variety of specialist systems for solutions to problems, from small technical diagnostic systems to complex, very large and sophisticated hybrid systems. Conceptually, an expert system includes a database of expert knowledge about a particular application area. The empty knowledge base and extraction engine are collectively referred to as the expert system shell. To be used, it must be filled with information. The expert system shell should be able to be supported by the software to add information to the knowledge base and be extensible for user interactions and other programs that can be used in hybrid expert systems. Developing an expert system primarily means selecting /adapting an expert system shell, and secondly, acquiring expert knowledge and filling the knowledge base with information or dataset. The second step is much more complicated than the first step and takes much more time. An example of expert systems that can be used in cyber defense is security planning [17]. An expert system used in this field significantly simplifies the task of choosing security measures and provides guidance for the best use of limited resources. In addition, the use of expert systems in intrusion detection goes back to old times [18, 19].", "C. Intelligent Agents: Intelligent agents are software components with some features of intelligent behavior that make it special (proactivity, understanding, and responding to agent communication language). These software components have planning, variability, and deep thinking capabilities. It has been adopted as a concept in software engineering where software agents are thought of as proactive and agent communication language. However, when comparing agents and objects, it can be shown as differences that objects can be passive and do not need to understand any language (although it accepts messages with well-defined syntax) [17].", "There are studies showing how effective intelligent agents against DDoS attacks are used in cyber defense [20, 21]. It is also stated in some of these studies that it is possible to develop a \u201ccyber police\u201d consisting of mobile smart agents after solving some legal and commercial problems [22]. In addition, hybrid multiple agents, neural network-based intrusion detection systems [23], and agent-based distributed intrusion detection systems [24] are other scientific researches in this regard.", "D. Search: Search is found in almost every smart program in various shapes and formats, and its efficiency is often critical to the performance of the entire program. While meeting the requirements for a solution, additional information can be used to guide the research with this way search effectiveness can be significantly improved. Many search methods have been developed in AI and although they are used in many software, this is not generally seen as the use of AI. For instance, dynamic programming [25, 26] is used specifically to solve optimal security problems, but an embedded search does not appear to be an AI application. Andor trees (andor trees), \u03b1\u03b2-search, minimax search, and stochastic search are widely used in game applications and are especially useful for decision making for cyber defense. The \u03b1\u03b2-search algorithm, originally developed for computer chess games, is very successful in problem-solving and especially in evaluating and deciding the best possible actions of two attacks. Using the least winning and most losing predictions, this algorithm allows the search to be accelerated by ignoring a large number of options.", "E. Learning: Learning develops an information system by expanding or rearranging the knowledge base or by developing the inference engine [27]. Machine learning includes calculation methods to get new information, new skills and new ways to organize existing information. Learning problems differ greatly from the complexity of simple parametric learning (the complex values \u200b\u200bof symbolic learning, such as learning the values \u200b\u200bof some parameters and learning concepts, language structures, functions, and even behavior learning).", "Artificial Intelligence offers methods for both supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is particularly useful if large amounts of data are available, and this method is common in cyber defense where large logs can be collected. Data mining was originally out of unsupervised learning in Artificial Intelligence [6, 28).", "An outstanding learning class has been created by parallel learning algorithms that are suitable for execution on parallel hardware. These learning methods are represented by genetic algorithms and neural networks. Genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic methods have been used in cyber defense, for example, in threat detection systems [29].", "F. Constraint Solving: Constraint Solving is a technique developed using Artificial Intelligence (logical expressions, tables, equations, inequalities, etc.) in solving the problems presented by giving a series of constraints on the solution [30]. The solution to a problem is a collection (a series) of values \u200b\u200bthat meet all the restrictions. In fact, there are many different types of constraints, depending on the nature of constraints (for example, constraints on finite sets, functional constraints, rational trees). At a very abstract level, almost any problem can be presented as a problem of constraint satisfaction. The solution to these problems is often difficult due to the need for a large number of calls. It can be used in constraint, logic programming, and situation analysis and decision support [31, 32].", "In part III, we will talk about Early Warning Systems (EWS) and the use of artificial intelligence for cyber offense\u2026", "[3] F.
