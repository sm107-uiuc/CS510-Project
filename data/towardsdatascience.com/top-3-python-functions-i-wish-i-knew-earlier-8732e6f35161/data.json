The target reader is someone who knows at least the basics of Python and programming in general and aims to further improve his/her skills.", "The article is structured as follows:", "So, without much ado, let\u2019s get started!", "Now, we won\u2019t need to import anything since this article is purely Python-based, but we still need to declare something to work with.", "For most of the examples to come below, we\u2019ll use this simple class:", "Now there\u2019s nothing going on in it \u2014 and that\u2019s fine. We can still use it to demonstrate what these functions are all about.", "Okay, are you following me? Good, let\u2019s proceed.", "The official documentation[1] does a pretty good job at explaining what this function is all about:", "Return True if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof.", "If that was a bit too technical to you, here\u2019s a bit more clear explanation. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve declared a function and are not quite sure what it will return \u2014 for example, you want a float if everything went well and you want a string with the error message if something went wrong. isinstance() to the rescue.", "For the practical part, we\u2019ll use the class declared above and make an instance of it:", "Now we can use isinstance() to check if circle object is of type Circle:", "This can be useful information. Keep in mind, you can also check if something is of some in-built type, like string, list, tuple, etc.", "This one can also be quite useful. To state it\u2019s purpose in one sentence, I\u2019d say that hasattr() simply returns True if an object contains specified attribute, and False otherwise.", "Let\u2019s see this in action. We already declared a Circle class and gave it some attributes \u2014 radius. We can now use hasattr() to check whether the attribute exists in the instance or not.", "And that\u2019s pretty much all there is to it. The use-cases for this function will depend much on the type of programming you do. As a data scientist, I sometimes create attributes dynamically in my classes, so it\u2019s nice to somehow check if the attribute exists or not.", "If you are coming from a SQL background, then you\u2019re probably familiar with the concept of dynamic query building. We have a similar thing in Python \u2014 maybe not too useful to the majority of developers, but it\u2019s nice to know this functionality exists.", "Unlike the first two functions, here we won\u2019t need our Circle class. We\u2019ll be putting two lines of Python into a multi-line string and calling exec on those.", "Our statement got executed as Python code line by line, even though it is actually a string.", "Once again, you might not find this function as useful as the previous two, depending on the type of work you do.", "And there you have it \u2014 a couple of functions I didn\u2019t know for as a beginner but find them useful now. They would probably save me some time or at least make my code look more elegant if I knew them earlier, but it is as it is.", "Loved the article?
