While there is undoubtedly overlap, machine learning is but one of many tools in the data science toolkit, and its use does not actually factor in to all data science tasks. For example, if prediction will be part of a given data science task, machine learning will be a useful component; however, machine learning may not play in to a descriptive analytics task at all.", "Ok so, what is automated machine learning then? In simple words is a way of automating the tasks of (https://www.automl.org/automl/):", "Now that we are clear on what is AutoML now, what is Keras?", "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.", "This was created by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet and was the first serious step for making Deep Learning easy for the masses.", "TensorFlow has a Python API which is not that hard, but Keras made really easy to get into Deep Learning for lots of people. It should be noted that Keras is now officially a part of Tensorflow:", "Great. Now we know what is Keras and AutoML, let\u2019s combine them. Auto-Keras is an open source software library for automated machine learning. Auto-Keras provides functions to automatically search for architecture and hyperparameters of deep learning models.", "For the usage I\u2019m going to use an example they have on their web. But first let\u2019s compare how we can do the same with different tools. I\u2019ll use the famous and sometimes hated MNIST dataset.", "MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of images of handwritten digits like these:", "It also includes labels for each image, telling us which digit it is.", "Not so easy, but very well explained in the example. TensorFlow is not meant to be the easiest tool for deep learning, but a fast an reliable one. With eager execution the code is much more readable.", "You can see that until now the Keras is the simpler package for running this example. It\u2019s a great package with awesome features to got from zero to a model in just minutes.", "But now, the cherry on the cake.", "Yep, that is all. Pretty simple right? You just need an ImageClassifier, then fit the data and evaluate it. You have a final_fit there too, and it\u2019s running a final training after found the best architecture.", "For now you have the ImageClassifier, the BayesianSearcher, a Graph module, a PreProcessor, a LayerTransformer, a NetTransformer, a ClassifierGenerator and some utilities. This is an evolving package, please take a look at the creators disclaimer:", "Please note that this is a pre-release version of the Auto-Keras which is still undergoing final testing before its official release.
