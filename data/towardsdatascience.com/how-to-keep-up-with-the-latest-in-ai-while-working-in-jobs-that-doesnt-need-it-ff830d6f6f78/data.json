Much of the content is taken from the responses from the original thread, interlaced with my own experience.", "If you\u2019re working in data science, chances are you\u2019ll know someone who\u2019s asked this question before (or perhaps that person is in fact \u2014 yourself). Especially if you\u2019re working in a non-tech company (actually, even tech companies can be practical in solving their problems) \u2014 chances are your company will not be expecting you to spend much time to read up/research/study on start of the art (SOTA) techniques to solve your business problems.", "It\u2019s a dilemma really. One that can be quite frustrating at times.", "It\u2019s a dilemma since parts of being a good data scientist is having that drive to push the boundaries of what data science has to offer, but you\u2019re not encouraged to do so at your workplace.", "And it\u2019s frustrating since you always have that inkling of a suspicion that whatever that\u2019s being deployed in your current production system can easily be replaced by the latest SOTA techniques, but you haven\u2019t been given that green light to spend some working hours to read on some relevant research papers, experiment and A/B test your hypothesis.", "So what should a data scientist do to keep up with Hintons and Lecuns of the world?", "On the one hand, the drive to being a decent data scientist compels you to keep up to date with the latest AI/ML progress, but on the other side of the coin, there are just so many papers to be read, on so many domains being published each day. And working in a company that isn\u2019t interested in pushing the boundaries in AI is definitely not helping.", "From the tweet\u2019s thread, here are some strategies that I liked (and perhaps, useful for you too).", "What I like about the above is that it puts a damper on that need to always be on the lookout for the latest in SOTA algorithms and just forces you to focus on the end goal (ie. solving a business problem). Yes, you\u2019ll be a bit late to the party (the FOMO is real). But you\u2019ll also be able to preserve that little bit of sanity that you have left on other things (like helping out with your kid\u2019s homework and or going out shopping with your wife for example).", "I recall when the BERT paper was released a few years ago and every few weeks you\u2019d see a new Bert variant come up and claiming SOTA scores. I don\u2019t think testing out all of the different embeddings is an efficient use of your time \u2014 and they probably don\u2019t add much to your level of depth of knowledge (since things get stale pretty quick during the quick ramp up when everyone is eager to prove something).", "Thus having a gap year (or 6 months) to just let the dust settle before adopting a technique sounds like a good strategy to me. Not to mention within that 1 year period there\u2019ll already be tons of workshops, tutorials, articles, videos, example codes and what have you to quickly give you the gist of what you\u2019ll need to know about the algorithm and how to efficiently deploy it (in the framework that you\u2019re familiar with no less).", "Podcasts are the easiest way to consume the latest SOTA in my opinion. A day\u2019s commute to work (pre-Covid 19) takes around 3 hour of my time (back and forth), and a podcast episode usually ranges between 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the provider. That means that within a week, it\u2019d sum up to 15 hours of quality content that I can always go back to should I find the topic to be interesting.", "If there\u2019s any silver lining that has come out out of Covid-19, it\u2018s that it has served as a catalyst for virtual knowledge sharing in many companies. Some that I have recently on my radar are:", "4. Kaggle Reading Group. It\u2019s quite dated (last updated Dec\u201919, so perhaps it\u2019s not THAT old\u2026), but covers a lot of NLP research papers. Prepared by Rachael Tatman of Kaggle.", "5. Paper Reading & Discussion by dair.ai. Hosted by elvis of dair.ai, this is quite a new find and I still haven\u2019t had the time to dive into their materials just yet. Titles from past recordings does look interesting though.", "Circling back to reality though, I never made it a point to diligently watch or join each and every knowledge sharing sessions that goes live (typically around 12am ++ ) as and when they appear. What I\u2019d normally do (pre-Covid19) is to look up the recording, have it saved on my phone (which is easy for Youtube), and watch them during commute.", "Of course, now that I\u2019m mostly working from home, I can always watch them directly on Youtube whenever I\u2019m on a break or something. And most of the time I\u2019d usually focus on the stuff that relates to something that I can immediately use (going back to point #1 above) or are being applied in a business setting somewhere (as opposed to just being the latest SOTA).", "The earlier mentioned items point to things that you can do to learn things on your own. But notice that in most cases, there isn\u2019t a feedback loop that tells you whether what you\u2019ve picked up so far is right or not.", "That\u2019s the beauty of keeping in touch with the community. Some benefits that I can think of from the top of my head:", "Ultimately, one needs to be actively working on the codes and building something to truly appreciate the knowledge that\u2019s been gained. Studying source codes, working on your own projects, joining Kaggle competitions or even writing about you\u2019ve learned \u2014 will greatly help solidify your understanding and preserve it for a much longer period (ie. deliberate practice).", "Keeping in sync with the latest development and state of the art in AI/ML/NLP can be a daunting task \u2014 more so if your day job doesn\u2019t require you be in the forefront of AI research.", "In this post, we covered a few tips on how one can stay up to date with the latest developments in ML/NLP. To summarize, it\u2019s not easy. But more importantly, perhaps you don\u2019t really need to stay at the bleeding edge of progress.", "With progress being made in the NLP domain at a faster rate these days \u2014 it might not even be a good thing to want to keep track of every single thing that appears on a weekly basis. A better, simpler approach is to stagger the rate of input in order to both allow the best of the breed to stand out; while also filtering out bogus claims out of the hype circulation.", "The rest of the tips revolved around consuming knowledge during spare times, leveraging networks for information filtering and allocating some time for deliberate practice.", "Your home for data science.
