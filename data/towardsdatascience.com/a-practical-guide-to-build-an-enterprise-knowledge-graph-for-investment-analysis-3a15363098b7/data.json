However, the problem is tough for instance matching of persons. While there are personal ID numbers for every person, there are no such IDs in the patent data sources. The authors use a simple heuristic rule to match the person in the patent KG to that person in the basic KG. If the name of the patent inventor and the applicant equals the name of the person and company in the basic KG respectively, they say the patent inventor matches the person name in the basic KG.", "The authors use MongoDB as main storage for its large install bases, good query performance, mass data storage, and scalability with clustering support.", "This section talks about how to make the graph easy to use.
