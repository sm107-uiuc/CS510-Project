Hit a button, pull a lever, and get the task done. Decades later, with subsequent computing innovation, machines have transformed into their ultra-smart, self-learning, automated versions that are sweeping the human landscape.", "The underlying technology that\u2019s reinventing machines to personalize human experiences is Machine Learning (ML), a branch of Artificial Intelligence and a strong buzzword in today\u2019s digital-first world. In essence, it\u2019s about programming machines to infuse the ability of self-learning by leveraging Big Data. Information extracted from various touchpoints is analyzed and used to predict intentions for actionable intelligence.", "And, the good news is, Latest technology is advancing consistently and revolutionizing every facet of our routines. Humans had their first brush-up with Machine Learning when voice-controlled personal assistants \u2014 Amazon\u2019s Echo and Alexa \u2014 were launched. These devices are a new normal with the trend of smart homes picking up. Driverless cars, which were a quintessential sci-fi fantasy, aren\u2019t something of the far-off future now. These new-age vehicles, aimed at cutting down human labor, are tested across the world for their utility benefits.", "Initially, the idea of intelligent machines was preposterous. Machines that act on behalf of humans weren\u2019t a norm. However, with enablement and evolution of Machine Learning in our daily lives, the human landscape is radically changing and how.", "Below, we have mentioned 10 ways in which Machine Learning is revolutionizing our lives. Let\u2019s take a dive right in.", "Currently, Machine Learning is applied for swift patient diagnosis and accelerated healthcare delivery. Though these machines come under the scrutiny of not being \u2018human enough\u2019, the accuracy and precision offered by them are unparalleled.", "From administration, record-keeping to fully fledged diagnosis and treatments, ML has the capability to analyze the crisis at hand and compare it with numerous other scenarios for the right treatment and procedure. This comparison saves time and paves a strategic path for the decisive medical approach.", "Moreover, Machine Learning can empower surgical robots to help doctors in medical procedures while ensuring minimal invasion and high precision. This achievement can improve the success rates of surgical procedures and accelerate turnaround time with cost benefits. In the context of healthcare, ML can be a critical enabler to efficient diagnosis, research, and treatment, thereby underlining the holistic transformation of the sector.", "As per a McKinsey Report, the stagnation of the pharmaceutical industries will end, and the healthcare industry will embark on a transitional journey, mustering savings up to $100 billion in the U.S alone.", "Today\u2019s transportation industry is highly influenced by Machine Learning. The technology has been instrumental in eradicating the threat posed by reckless driving through the deployment of sensory management and automation. This has intelligized vehicles to understand the surrounding parameters and take precautionary action whenever required to ensure passenger safety.", "China is testing driverless buses for its city while Google and Rolls Royce have collaborated to design and launch the world\u2019s first self-driving ship by 2020. The ship will be leveraging Google\u2019s Cloud Machine Learning Engine to understand the sea and objects surrounding it. This will enable the remote controlling of the vessel and end up reducing the resources involved in the transportation.", "Beyond vehicles, Machine Learning can soon by deployed for traffic management and preventing traffic congestions on roads. China and Singapore, at the moment, are leading the innovation and creating algorithms that can help drivers choose routes cleared off traffic.", "Several banks and financial institutions are using ML-based complex algorithms to analyze and predict loan risks and assess the quality of the application, thereby reinforcing them to take informed decisions. It\u2019s also helping in the detection of frauds and scams via analytics.", "The otherwise traditional industry is favoring Machine Learning to mitigate its transformational bottlenecks and create better user engagement for the stakeholders, including the customers. Voice Recognition, Chatbots, and Predictive Analysis are helping bridge the gap between financial establishments and potential customers. Today, customers can contact a business anytime around the day and rest assured of instant, real-time replies from Chatbots. This saves time as well as improves the customer experience for the organizations.", "For instance, JP Morgan Chase has invested in technology and has recently undertaken an in-house element- a Contract Intelligence (COiN) platform which is leveraged to \u201canalyze legal documents and extract important data points and clauses\u201d. This is one of the many examples of how Machine Learning is influencing the way financial conglomerates are currently working.", "It\u2019s true that teachers cannot be replaced by bots, but they sure can be assisted by the diversity that Machine Learning can provide to their methods of teaching and education on a whole. ML capabilities are being used to assess the child\u2019s academic understanding, analyze the way he/she perceives knowledge, and create a customized academic plan that can help focus on the wholesome attribute of that specific student.", "The algorithms analyze test results and create a unique grading system that can free up the teachers\u2019 time and help refine the education modules for children. Not to mention, ML can be extremely helpful for students with disabilities and learning gaps.", "ML, in addition to teaching, is simplifying administrative duties and help educational institutions create an organized means of administering students and staff via its automated responses, customized software and more. It\u2019s all about breaking down the processes and making organizing an institution less of a burden.", "Lawyers remain busy. So, automating their day-to-day activities can free them from the redundant tasks and help them focus on creating liable solutions to the cases at hand.", "Machine Learning brings forth this automation and adds a new twist to the otherwise conventional industry. It augments documents, their processing and also analyzes them for proofs and research, which can help the lawyers extract the relevant information without having to expend time in pouring over books and legal documents. They can also help systemize the operational tasks, such as staying abreast with the hearings and keeping note of the impending dates.", "ML can strategize how lawyers review their cases and hopefully, can speed up the cases that otherwise take months and years to resolve.", "Machine Learning, in a nutshell, is addressing the complexities of all the sectors, and if we go as per the numerous statistics, it\u2019s highly plausible that almost all industries will embrace the algorithm-based working and streamline their processing. Machine Learning is the future and those who choose to skip this evolutionary element can be well assured of their impending decline.", "Your home for data science.
