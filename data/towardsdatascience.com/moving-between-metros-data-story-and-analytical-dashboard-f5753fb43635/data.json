However massive growth in these emerging cities is putting pressure on existing residents, forcing them to move elsewhere as well. This study utilizes the most-recent metro-to-metro migration flow data from the American Community Survey and will provide insight into the following questions:", "- Metropolitan areas with the most residents staying put and not moving", "- Metropolitan areas with the most residents that are moving within the same metro area", "- Metropolitan areas with the most residents moving in or out of the area and where they are coming from or leaving to", "- Metropolitan areas with the most international residents moving in", "While this report will provide some high-level insights, I\u2019ve built a free Tableau dashboard that enables you to look into specific migration metrics and filter by metropolitan area, population, and in-state vs out-of-state migration. Take a look at the free Migration Patterns Dashboard here.", "What percentage of a metropolitan area\u2019s population is made up of recent movers from outside of the United States?", "Silicon Valley (San Jose, Sunnyvale, and Santa Clara) is composed of the highest proportion of international movers, who make up 2% of all current residence. Silicon Valley is trailed by Miami (1.6% of the population) and Washington DC (1.3%). On the opposite end of the spectrum, only .1% of the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman metro area consists of residence moving from abroad. Chattanooga, Tennessee and Birmingham, Alabama follow behind with .2% of their population coming from international locations. With the exception of Provo, Utah and Colorado Springs, Colorado, the majority of the cities with the highest proportion are all in coastal states or near an international border.", "This chart takes a look at which areas have the highest percentage of current residents that moved homes during the last year but stayed within the same general metropolitan area.", "At 15%, Tuscon, Arizona has the most movers staying within Tuscon. Tuscon is followed by Las Vegas, Nevada (14%), and Oklahoma City (13%). In 4th, Phoenix (13%) is the second Arizona metro area on the list. Daytona Beach, Florida has the smallest proportion of residence that moved within the area (7%) and is followed by McAllen Texas (7.2%) and Stamford, Connecticut (7.2%). New York City has the 5th lowest rate of in-area movers at 7.3%.", "The Proportion of Nonmovers (View on Dashboard)", "What are the cities and metropolitan areas with the most residents staying put and not moving at all and are opting to stay in their same home?", "New York has 90.6% of all residents staying put in their place of residence. McAllen, Texas (90.2%) and Youngstown, Ohio (88.6%) follow behind. On the other side, Colorado Springs only had 77.7% of residence stay put over the last year. Tuscon (79%) and Provo (79%) also had a relatively low proportion of residents staying put.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at some major cities to understand where residents are coming from and heading to. As with everything seen today, you can view the full free dashboard on Tableau Public.", "Austin has essentially twice as many residents coming in from New York, New York and California metropolitan areas of San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose as there are former Austin residents moving to those respective areas.", "Austin is losing residents to Seattle (1.5 former Austinites moving out for every resident coming in), Denver (1.4) and Atlanta (1.2).", "Los Angeles is losing the battle to Idaho (7 former Los Angeleno residents moving to Boise City for every Boise City resident coming in). Similarly, Los Angeles is losing net movers to Eugene, OR (5.7). As far as raw numbers go, Los Angeles is losing large numbers of net residents to Las Vegas (-10,042), Phoenix (-6,642), and Dallas (-5,628). The city of Angeles is still gaining heavily from major cities on the east coast (+5,942 movers from New York, +2,157 from Chicago, +821 from Boston, and +792 from Washington DC).", "The Silicon Valley residents are flocking toward the growing tech hubs of Portland, Oregon (2.1 San Jose residents moving to Portland for every 1 Portland resident moving to San Jose), Austin (1.95 San Jose residents moving to Austin for every 1 Austin resident moving to San Jose), and Dallas, Texas (1.4 ratio). Silicon Valley remains to draw a positive net moving ratio from large cities in the midwest such as Chicago (3 Chicago residents moving to San Jose for every San Jose resident moving to Chicago) and the east coast like Washington DC, and New York, where more than two residents are moving to San Jose than there are San Jose residents moving to those respective areas.", "As mentioned earlier, the greater Phoenix area has become a destination for former residents of large cities like Los Angeles to relocate to, but where are Phoenicians choosing to move to? San Antonio leads the list, with twice as many Phoenix-to-San Antonio movers than visa versa. Provo, Utah is close behind with 1.9 Phoenix-to-Provo movers for every Provo-to-Phoenix mover.
