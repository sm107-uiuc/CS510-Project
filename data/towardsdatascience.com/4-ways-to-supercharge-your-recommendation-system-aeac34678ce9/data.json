They do so by producing a predicted likeliness score or a list of top recommended items for a given user. Recommendations can be based on a plethora of factors including user demographics, overall item popularity and historical user preference. Real-life examples are encountered regularly in places such as Amazon, Spotify and Tinder.", "However, many systems operate at a scale that stresses the challenges of successful academic and \u201csmall data\u201d applications. Furthermore, increased user awareness and choice has led to preference promiscuity meaning users are happier than ever to drop a service that isn\u2019t personally accurate.", "With this in mind, the following 4 points are implementable ideas that target scalability issues whilst improving the quality of your collaborative filtering recommendations.", "1 \u2014 Ditch Your User-Based Collaborative Filtering Model.", "A key challenge you will face with collaborative filtering algorithms in a business setting is tackling data sparsity and scalability. Modern systems demand the capability to process tens of millions of potential data points with a low tolerance for performance limitations. In these systems, users may have interacted with less than 1% of items available.", "Bottlenecks in user-based collaborative filtering models largely arise in the search for neighbours, which are other users who have historically shown similar preferences to a given user, among large user populations. Capability to search thousands of neighbours is good but systems have to scale with the business they fit into \u2014 real value arises for both you and your user by being able to search millions of neighbours in real-time.", "The switch to item-based collaborative filtering algorithm transposes the recommendation problem from user space to item space. It explores the relationship between items instead of the relationship between users. In most real-life applications, the number of items is dwarfed by the number of users and in many cases items are static. That is, the set of items changes much less frequently than the number of users. This allows for a decoupling of the fitting stage and prediction stage of an item based collaborative filtering model.", "Let\u2019s see the difference in practice.", "Using a training set of 994,168 ratings on a set of 3,704 movies from 6,040 users (MovieLens 1M dataset), the computational cost of evaluating the similarity matrix for a user-based algorithm is 77.6 seconds but just 28.4 seconds for an item-based algorithm, each using Pearson similarity.", "This switch addresses computational capability for large scale systems which at some stage becomes more important that minor differences in quality. Of course, the exception exists if your set of users is smaller than your set of items and is also expected to change relatively less frequently.", "2 \u2014 A Gold Standard Similarity Computation Technique.", "The concept of similarity is a critical element of the collaborative filtering framework. For user-based collaborative filtering algorithms, the user-similarity matrix consists of a metric that measures the distance between any pair of user preferences. Likewise, the item-similarity matrix measures the similarity between any pair of items in the item based framework. Three commonly discussed techniques are Pearson, Cosine and Mean Square Difference (MSD) but what similarity computation technique should you use?", "Enter User 56. User 56 rated 54 movies of which the 5 star rated movies from the same training set above are given below.", "I picked user 56 purely out of interest in what recommendation arise given the user enjoyed both American History X and Babe (arguably two movies about pigs). Producing appropriate recommendations is a function of other users in the dataset however the ability to pick out those users is down to the choice of similarity metric.", "Ignoring the difference in computation speed, all 3 top lists report a hit rate of 0 and I don\u2019t know about you but I do not recognise a single movie in any of the recommendation lists. More often than not, this what results look like. Ugly.", "This is more likely an artefact of the dataset than the similarity metric so stop searching for the gold standard similarity computation technique via offline evaluation metrics and start A/B testing. The truth lies in real-life responses.", "3 \u2014 Boost Your Algorithm Using Model Size.", "In the item-based collaborative filtering framework, the concept of model size revolves around the idea that enough information about a user\u2019s preference lies in a subset of items most similar to items they have already rated highly. Logically it makes sense that unseen items that have a high similarity to the highest-rated seen items contribute most towards a final recommendation list. The model size is a neighbourhood of most similar items for any given active item rated by the active user.", "With a large number of items, recommendations on the full candidate set quickly become too computationally intensive. Operating on a neighbourhood of items drastically reduces the time taken to make predictions but also reduces the information the model has to rank. The key trade-off then becomes what level of information ensures recommendations are both timely and appropriate?", "Using the aforementioned MovieLens dataset, the effect of model size can be examined on item-based models with cosine similarity. For user 56, the neighbourhood implementation immediately changes the top 8 list. It seems the model is no longer chucking out obscure recommendations judging by the fact that all 8 movies are recognisable (to me). It has reduced system noise. I make this statement not on the basis that I now recognise movies in the top 8 list but due to the increase in hit rate on the leave-one-out cross-validated test set (6,040 top 8 lists).", "Using a neighbourhood of just 10 items actually jacks up the hit rate of the system from 0% to 1.4% and more importantly 2.1% on 5-star predictions. While the headline hit rate improves as the neighbourhood grows to 50 items, 5-star items stabilise around 2.5% so the overall improvement stems from the 4-star category.", "Think hard whether rating categories other than the top matter for your system. How are recommendations presented on screen? How many items are presented in a top list? What is the consumption rate of your list?", "Model size enables a material computational reduction whilst sometimes also increasing the quality of your recommendations. Literature suggests a neighbourhood of 30 is optimal (Herlocker et al., 1999) but literature does not know your context. Gets your hands dirty and observe how it affects the top recommendations for customers you care about. A little time invested tuning model size could drastically improve the customer experience, increase consumption of your service and reduce average sales cycle metrics.", "4 \u2014 What Drives Your Users, Drives Your Success.", "Your score function should reflect the utility of your users.", "Starting from the final result and working backwards, the goal of Item-Based Collaborative Filtering is to create a list of top recommendation from the set of all the items not yet rated by a given user. To do this, a score is assigned to every item that has not yet been rated by that target user \u2014 the candidate generation step. A ranking can then be made based on score and the top items can be presented to the active user.", "We build the score for each candidate item to be a function of the active item\u2019s rating and the similarity between the active item and the candidate item. Literature often uses a similarity weighted sum of ratings (Sarwar et al., 2001) which is a na\u00efve attempt and can be enhanced in several ways including the following.", "Time weighting. The first major step is to evaluate how sensitive your users are in the context of your items. Long-term preferences coincide with learning i.e. as one\u2019s knowledge base expands, perspective on life changes, habits change and subsequently preferences change. Contrastingly, short-term preferences are often bullied by social virality, social pressure and influence. By weighting recent ratings higher than older ratings the system can respond more rapidly to changing user preferences. Deciding just how sensitive your system is to new data is the fine line between understanding long term preference shifts and viral behaviour. Either way the goal is to understand the user\u2019s response to the context and product into your score building process.", "Negative weighting. Since similarity scores are non-negative, candidates dissimilar to poorly rated seen items have little to no influence on the top recommendations. Effectively the model ignores these items. An alternative score methodology could penalise candidates that have a high similarity score to known disliked items and boost candidates with a low similarity score to known disliked items. One way to implement this would be to linearly shift both the scale of ratings and scale of similarities to centre 0. This concept steps away from confines basing recommendations solely off known items a user likes and goes a long way in improving the diversity of your model recommendations.", "Of course, these are just two possible modifications that should get you thinking about the practicality of the score function for your business. The geographic location of users and non-linear transformations should also be explored where appropriate.", "No article can prescribe a perfectly tuned, recommendation algorithm for you and I make no attempt to here. Instead I hope to raise awareness, via the four key points above, to certain tuning choices that have the potential to add material value with marginal additional effort.", "What value you optimise for, be it songs, clicks or articles, should align with and be evaluated against business needs, not academic metrics. Results don\u2019t care about accuracy, they only care about the order of what is presented in front of them. Embrace the simplicity of collaborative filtering for the power it can provide in personalised ordering & seek real feedback from users.", "P.s. For those looking for a \u2018how-to\u2019, I personally enjoyed James Kirk\u2019s article here.", "Your home for data science.
