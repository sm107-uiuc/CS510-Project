But one of the most southern states os Brazil has a peculiar capital on an island. Or most of the capital is on this island. I\u2019m talking about Florian\u00f3polis.", "Different from the idyllic idea of an island (rounded), the \u201cIsle of Saint Catherine\u201d is actually\u2026lengthy. The north shore and the south shore are 54 km distant (approximately 33 miles).", "The connection of this island with the main continent is near, with bridges in only one point and almost in the center of the island.", "The center of the island is a big city, with everything a city has: big buildings, stores, traffic. But some places are very calm, allowing an \u201ceasy-going\u201d life with beautiful beaches.", "In the summer, lots of tourists go to enjoy the beaches, transforming this calm place in a crowded happy summer space. But to establish a business in the north shore, this movement through the year means a nightmare. Sometimes, being open during summer doesn\u2019t mean being open during winter.", "People who live in north shore complain about poor options for basic needs as a supermarket or a bakery. Distant from the downtown in the center of the island, this is a big problem.", "So, I decided to analyze the Foursquare data to find what and where a new business could reach the population needs. The idea is to make a great data-driven analysis of new possibilities for business and people.", "Data and how I will solve the problem", "I\u2019ll collect the data of the venues from the neighbors of Jurer\u00ea, Canasvieiras, Cachoeira do Bom Jesus, and Ponta das Canas from Foursquare. I\u2019ll categorize from the type, plotting a map to understand the different needs.", "I\u2019ll cluster those venues based on the kind and proximity, to conclude what is the business that already covers a good proportion of the space in those neighbors.", "I\u2019ll also cluster the neighbors, to identify those who don\u2019t have a uniform number of different venues.", "In the end, I\u2019ll list the categories of venues and places that will be differential in each neighbor, as a way to help anyone who whats to start a new business.", "Who will be interested in this project?", "People who want to open a new business on the north shore of Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil.", "People who live on the north shore of Florian\u00f3polis and want to know more about the options of business in the neighborhood.", "The choice is the Quantitative Methods.", "Using some popular Python libraries, I started defining my neighborhoods to analyze: Jurer\u00ea Leste, Jurer\u00ea Oeste, Canasvieiras, Cachoeira do Bom Jesus, and Ponta das Canas.", "I got the geocodes with a function that could reach the ArcGIS services. With this information, I built a dataframe. To understand if my geocodes were right, I tested plotting a map.", "Taking sure all was alright, I move on to the collect Foursquare data, using the Foursquare API. I normalize the data in a JSON, used a Pandas function to get the category type os the venues presented, and make every adjustment needed to get a dataframe with the neighborhood, the name of the venue, the category, and also de the geo positions.", "The first analysis showed the need for adjustments. So I got the unique values of the columns categories, dropping some that weren\u2019t relevant for the purpose of the study, as \u201cbeach\u201d, \u201cresort\u201d and \u201cresidential building\u201d.", "Plotting a map, this was the new look:", "I wasn\u2019t happy with the categories. Even describing the business, some of them were clearly too detailed, which made it difficult to visualize the necessities of the neighborhoods. So I created \u201cclasses\u201d, a way to understand the kind of the categories, a \u201cmacro\u201d category. They were: \u201cBar/Restaurant\u201d, \u201cPharmacy\u201d, \u201cEntertainment\u201d, \u201cFitness\u201d, \u201cBakery\u201d, \u201cNightlife\u201d, \u201cStore\u201d, \u201cCaf\u00e9/Snacks\u201d, \u201cMarket\u201d, \u201cPet\u201d and \u201cLottery\u201d.", "I got those data in different kinds of dataframes to plot and understand the information. I decided to plot a horizontal bar chart to visualize what was the main kinds of business in each neighborhood.", "At this point, I noticed one important thing: not all the neighborhoods have a business in all the categories. I needed to add to the dataframe some rows that represented the categories with \u201c0\u201d businesses.", "I created a function that scanned all the categories each neighborhood had and gave me the information on what are the categories that were missing in each neighborhood.", "After adding all the \u201c0\u201d categories in each neighborhood dataframe, I moved to look close to the neighborhoods.", "I started to plot new charts for each neighborhood, comparing with the closest neighbor.", "Jurer\u00ea Leste is known as \u201cTraditional Jurer\u00ea\u201d \u2014 with lots of homes, this is a place to relax. The next neighborhood, Jurer\u00ea Oeste, is known as a \u201cchic place\u201d, full of rich homes and some nightclubs. But still being a tourist destination, the restaurants are the trend.", "Seems the same? But is not! Jurer\u00ea Oeste, the chic and rich neighbor, shows almost the same number of restaurants (again, tourist destination!), but you can see the rich nightlife and some stores. Almost the same, but with clear biases showed by the kinds of venues.", "Comparing Jurer\u00ea Leste and Jurer\u00ea Oeste", "Comparing the two neighborhoods side by side, you can understand the influence of each bias (glamour or housing), but also the influence of the idea of a tourist destination. With almost the same quantities of restaurants and caf\u00e9s, we can see also some of the services needed that can be verified in one, but not in the other. The prior completion of the analysis shows a special need for laundry and lottery. Even Jurer\u00ea Leste showing a lack of markets or pharmacies is natural that people who live in one neighborhood move a few kilometers to see their needs achieved.", "Canasvieiras is known as one of the most popular tourist destinations \u2014 especially for Argentinian and Uruguayan tourists. This place, with apparently more options, shows the same pattern: a lot of restaurants, but with some lack of other options. The proximity with Cachoeira do Bom Jesus can be, for both places, a good complement.", "Cachoeira do Bom Jesus is known by almost two avenues with business and lots of houses. This, as we could imagine, reflects in a lack of different businesses. Again, the restaurants are the \u201cstar\u201d of the neighborhood. A technological park (\u201cSapiens Park\u201d) with more than 2 thousand workers affects also the crowds of restaurants: as everyone needs a place for lunch, is natural that business people decide to open restaurants.", "Comparing Canasvieiras and Cachoeira do Bom Jesus", "Canasvieiras being a more \u201ccentral\u201d neighborhood shows more options. Cachoeira do Bom Jesus, the next neighborhood, have fewer options but, as the comparison with Jurer\u00ea Leste-Jurer\u00ea Oeste, can take some advantages of the proximity. By the way, the proximity is one of the factors that complement both neighborhoods: only three kinds of venues are shared between them.", "Ponta das Canas shows only one kind of venue: fitness. As a continuity of the neighborhood of Cachoeira do Bom Jesus, Ponta das Canas don\u2019t have a huge portion of territory, which could explain the lack of venues.", "Comparing Ponta das Canas with Cachoeira do Bom Jesus", "Both residential and small neighborhoods, Ponta das Canas and Cachoeira do Bom Jesus present a lack of businesses. It could show a dependency of Canasvieiras for some needs.", "Even with a clear tendency to restaurants in practically all neighbors, is right to say that some of the other services could be difficult to find in a short distance. Some of them seem even unique in all areas. This shows a decisive necessity of new business, especially for those who actually live in these neighborhoods.", "About the business opportunities and needs in Florian\u00f3polis \u2014 North Shore", "Based on the analyzed data, we can conclude:", "Ponta das Canas, even being a very small neighborhood, needs many more businesses. We could only find a gym. Basic needs as markets, grocery store, pharmacies, and bakeries can be a good option in this neighborhood.", "Enough with restaurants and bars! We know that restaurants in a place that are a tourist destination (and also have big technology companies nearby) is an obvious choice \u2014 but that is saturated already.", "Bakeries are in a good number in the neighborhoods. But since Cachoeira do Bom Jesus just have one and Ponta das Canas have none, could be a great opportunity to open a bakery in Ponta das Canas. It would be accessible also to people who live in Cachoeira do Bom Jesus.", "The category \u201cCaf\u00e9/Snacks\u201d is highly represented in Jurer\u00ea (both Leste and Oeste) and Canasvieiras. Even knowing that the distance from Canasvieiras to Cachoeira do Bom Jesus and Ponta das Canas are not so big, a coffee shop in those neighborhoods can represent an interesting business project.", "The options of entertainment are poor, especially if you are thinking about a family, but the beautiful beaches are the big stars of those neighborhoods, so can be risky to invest in this kind of venue.", "Gyms and fitness centers are accessible in Jurer\u00ea Leste and Oeste, as in Ponta das Canas. Canasvieiras and Cachoeira do Bom Jesus are served for their neighbors, but a fitness center in the \u201ccentral\u201d part of Canasvieiras can be a good match!", "As we already told, lotteries in Brazil represent more than just gamble. His meaning for the community, that can do easily some bank action in the lottery spaces, represents that they are very utile. Since we have just one lottery in Canasvieiras, this can be one of the best business opportunities.", "The region of Jurer\u00ea Leste and Jurer\u00ea Oeste just have two businesses in the \u201cmarket\u201d category. It\u2019s approximately 2,58 km\u00b2 (27.750.257,61 ft\u00b2) with just two markets. It\u2019s a good opportunity.", "Nightclubs and lounge spaces are closing in the wintertime. We have only two options: one in Canasvieiras and one in Jurer\u00ea Oeste. Since this can be a risky business to open all year, it would need more data to understand if it is a good opportunity.", "Pet shops are also scarce: with one in Cachoeira do Bom Jesus and another in Jurer\u00ea Leste, we can imagine that this \u201ccentral points\u201d could be a good place to meet the demand. But is still a good opportunity for more research and plan a new business.", "Pharmacies are one of those businesses that everyone someday will need to reach. In Brazil, only pharmacies can sell medicine. So, having just two (one in Canasvieiras and one in Jurer\u00ea Leste) show a lack. It can be a good business opportunity \u2014 even needing a pharmacist to open one.", "Stores can fill the necessities of everyone and make life easier for anyone who lives in the North Shore of Florian\u00f3polis. But we only could find three (two in Canasvieiras and one in Jurer\u00ea Oeste). Just this topic can be the origin of another big analysis, but shows a need for new stores and also a great business opportunity.", "The choice in the methodology field was right. The data could assist with ideas for new business, even the analysis was not profound. But Foursquare data does not seem trustworthy. Analyzing the data, was clear the uncertainty about the accuracy of the information. Living in one of those neighborhoods, I could remember more business than Foursquare could give me. It\u2019s not a bad idea to see the Foursquare data (since they are available for free). If I was hired for this analysis, I would try other APIs and resources to give me more information.", "Your home for data science.
