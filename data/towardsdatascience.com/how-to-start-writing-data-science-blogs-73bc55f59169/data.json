I was quite intrigued by the idea of putting your thoughts to the people. I initially began blogging on WordPress \u2014 stories about my days, feelings, hopes, achievements (that was easy). I had a pretty decent viewership (to my belief) for the first three months and reached 500 views. However, I wasn\u2019t quite enjoying the process and started exploring Blogger, Ghost.org, Tumblr, and such.", "In 2017, I was learning the concepts of User Experience Design and came across this platform called Medium where I could find a plethora of articles across any topic I could think of in technology and personal development \u2014 from cryptocurrency to leadership, math to psychedelics, Medium was my place!", "I started reading tons of articles and found Medium as one of the best platforms for writers and readers. With Medium\u2019s policies, basically, anyone who has something interesting to write about can become a writer. On July 13, 2017, I wrote my first article Sales Prediction by UX Usability on Medium.", "While I wrote this article mostly for experimental purposes, the feeling of satisfaction that I derived when I got my first clap, that encouraged to continue writing.", "It took me way more than a year to figure out how stories on Medium worked, what are publications, how to get more audience to engage with content, and thus began my journey as a full-time technology blogger from January 16, 2019, with no looking back. I had my first 1K+ views story \ud83d\ude00", "There are so many beginner, intermediate, and expert level enthusiasts out there who are sharing their knowledge and learnings with the community through blogs. What pulls them to write then?", "I have always believed in learn, explore, experience, share, repeat.", "I am constantly motivated to work on challenging data science projects or concepts, thereby improving my data skills. With data science blogs, you involve yourself in indirect mentoring. When someone reads your blog, they learn out of it, execute it, and feel satisfied with reading your content. You might never know that person personally but the idea of inspiring, teaching someone makes me excited to pay it forward!", "A blog is undoubtedly one of the smartest means for you to showcase your knowledge and skills in data science.", "Every article published on Medium can be considered intellectual property \u2014 inimitable, unique, and irreplaceable. You can definitely add the link to your medium profile on your resume (I have).", "When you write, you are established as someone who knows something in data science, maybe not an expert but people reading your blogs will associate you with what you write. When people read your content, they see you in that light; which is a great thing for building your brand as a data scientist.", "For me, writing about data science is a way to showcase my prowess to the world while it acts as a silent resume for me!", "Articles on Medium are read by a global community. You have an opportunity to share your expertise, knowledge, learnings, and experiences with readers across the entire globe. When you have comments, emails, Twitter or LinkedIn DMs from people around the world, the glee is unparalleled.", "If writing articles with ~1000 to 1500 words doesn\u2019t improve your communication skills, what will then?

Anyone searching you or Googling some keywords and coming across your profile looks at the work you\u2019ve done.", "In my initial days of blogging, I wrote majorly about User Experience Design. A UX Designer from Germany reached out to me on Twitter reading a blog of mine on and he wanted to know if I would be interested in writing paid articles for their blog. So many people want to write for paid blogs but they don\u2019t have a portfolio to show. Your articles will act as a resume for you when the opportunity presents itself.", "To now, I have had multiple opportunities to work on independent paid projects, attend conferences for free, guest blog for a publication across my journey.", "Did you know, you can make money from your articles (even about $1000 per month).

Not just Medium, but you need to take care that your content does not replicate any other article on the web, at least try to.", "The core of writing blogs is providing value. If you are not educating a person on something that hasn't been told before, a reader might just bounce off your blog and approach a point of no return.", "With Data Science especially, say you decide to write about Random Forest, there are about 611,000,000 results on Google (search for yourself). Your goal is to be unique, explain the concept in an easy-to-understand manner, cater to a wider audience, and rank high on Google search with good quality content.", "My advice would be to research all existing content peripheral to your topic of interest, make notes, sketch out an outline of what you want to write. The more you read, the more you become clear of your content.", "Before publishing a blog, a good tip would be to understand what kind of audience are you delivering to \u2014 beginner, intermediate, expert. It is very important to validate that what you write will be consumed.", "Initially, I used to submit to a publication, and even though I would consider it a work I can be proud of, it would not be read by many people. Problem: the writeup was too advanced and for some reason, irrelevant to the readers. Later, I had to stop submitting to that publication.", "Read other blogs published peripheral to your topic for a content check!", "Publications on Medium are shared spaces for stories written around a common theme or topic. Publications are looking for writers to propose up-to-date and relevant content focused on say data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, programming, and much more.", "There are guidelines for every publication to get accepted \u2014 that means if your content isn\u2019t of quality enough to be curated or doesn\u2019t follow the guidelines, it won\u2019t be published. Be sure to read the guidelines before submitting.", "Once you are accepted, a publication enables you to reach a broader audience, earn more money, get honest feedback.", "For Data Science, you can submit your articles to", "This I consider as the biggest learning tool \u2014 keeping a track of your views and reads. With every story you publish, there is a detailed statistics associated that tells you your readership across platforms.", "The best feedback you can ever get is from closely monitoring your stats. Some blogs might do exceptionally well as 200K+views while some might limit to 3K views. That\u2019s when you introspect, find what worked and what did not work. Read the responses on your stories very well: from showing typos to appreciating tons \u2014 responses reflect the user outlook.", "Then there is something called Read Ratio. You don\u2019t only want readers to see your blog but to READ it. Medium read ratio for a 5\u20137 minutes read time article or story is somewhere between 40% - 70% of read-ratio. The factors that influence the Medium read ratio are the source of traffic and the reading time of your Medium article.", "Fans of clickbait titles would much play around the Read Ratio. But again, it depends on the purpose of you writing the blog.", "Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet", "The key to increasing your blog traffic is: BE PATIENT. Success in blogging does not arrive at doorstep wrapped up in a pretty bow. It requires a lot of hard work and A LOT of patience.
