As a result, many in the fact-checking community dream of the day where automated fact-checking systems display live fact-checks throughout important events like presidential debates.", "But what is automated fact-checking? For the purposes of this post, automated fact-checking systems rely on computational methods to 1) decrease the lag time between a problematic statement (a claim) and a correction (a fact-check article) and to 2) increase the number of claims that are associated with fact-checks.", "The most commonly discussed (and funded) strategy to develop automated fact-checking relies on \u201cclaim matching.\u201d Claim matching systems extract text from political debates, speeches, tweets, etc. and identify statements that have already been fact-checked and link an already created fact-check article to that \u201cproblematic\u201d text snippet. This method theoretically helps fact-check more content because many untrue or misleading statements in speeches, debates, tweets, etc. are repeated claims that may have already been fact-checked (e.g. Obama was not born in the U.S., vaccines cause autism).", "One implementation of a claim matching system was Google\u2019s short-lived Reviewed Claims feature, which appeared on a subset of news publishers\u2019 Google search result pages. This feature matched claims from news publishers\u2019 articles to already existing fact-check articles.", "Two months after the feature was released, conservative news outlets complained that they were being unfairly targeted by the feature. Google removed the feature explaining to Poynter that they had \u201c\u2026encountered challenges in our systems that maps fact checks to publishers, and on further examination, it\u2019s clear that we are unable to deliver the quality we\u2019d like for users.\u201d", "While I don\u2019t definitively know how the Reviewed Claims system was designed, Google researchers published a 2018 paper outlining a system that addresses the \u201cclaim-relevance discovery problem\u201d i.e. identifying online articles that contain (and support) a fact-checked statement. If this sounds similar, it is basically the claim matching described earlier. The Google paper describes an approach that has an accuracy of ~82%.", "The Reviewed Claims case study has fascinated me for the past year and has prompted me to consider these two questions:", "1. What is the appropriate accuracy score (and related metrics) for a publicly released automated fact-checking tool?", "2. How should we define \u201crelevant\u201d claim matches?", "I\u2019m doubtful (as are many others in the fact-checking community) that we are close to reaching near-perfect accuracy levels in automated fact-checking systems, so we need to have frank discussions about satisfactory precision and recall scores of these systems as we plan on moving this research to the public domain. Such conversations are important for the fact-checking organizations building tools, for the users attempting to understand the credibility of sources based on the presence of fact-check articles, and for the news publishers whose revenue streams are altered by recommendation algorithms that take into account whether publisher content has been flagged by fact-checkers.", "However, the conversation about appropriate metrics is useless if we do not share an understanding of when a claim should be matched to a fact-check. Broadly, fact-checking literature has established a \u201cgood\u201d automated claim matching system will match a problematic claim to a relevant fact-check article.", "While this may seem simple enough, determining relevance is actually a lot more complicated than it appears at first glance. In other words, yes, there isn\u2019t a common definition of \u201cgood enough\u201d in automated fact-checking, but, more fundamentally, we do not have a shared definition of a \u201crelevant\u201d claim match.", "Here\u2019s a quick exercise to illustrate the difficulty of determining relevance in claim matches. Think about which of the following headlines below should be claim matched (i.e. relevant) to the fact-check \u201cVaccines Don\u2019t Cause Autism.\u201d", "Was determining whether \u201cVaccines Don\u2019t Cause Autism\u201d is a relevant claim match for each of these articles simple? My research indicates that for most people it isn\u2019t. I ran a small-scale qualitative study with a similar premise to the above thought experiment with undergraduate students and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. I found that undergraduate students had a challenging time with the task but eventually came to moderate levels of agreement with each other after a reconciliation process. However, the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers were much more liberal with their definition of relevant claim matches than undergraduate students. Further research is needed to say much more about this preliminary finding.", "What I find concerning about the definitional challenges around defining relevance is the lack of importance current publications and descriptions of automated fact-checking systems place on these foundational definitions. I have provided two examples below, but there are others.", "The idea of claim only having to \u201calign in spirit\u201d to be a relevant match is somewhat elucidating, as it probably means that the first bulleted hypothetical claim, \u201cVaccines May Cause Autism,\u201d I outlined above should be labeled as relevant to the fact-check \u201cVaccines Don\u2019t Cause Autism,\u201d but this definition still leaves questions about how to resolve several of the other claims.", "I also think that this explanation of determining relevance is insufficient. A description of the technical methods adopted in a system does not resolve any of the lingering questions of nuance around the definition of relevance. It also does not allow us to compare this system to the \u201calign in spirit\u201d guideline from the Google paper in a meaningful way.", "Others have called for caution when over promising about the power of automated fact-checking, and I think those concerns are warranted. However, I\u2019m proposing something different: I think the fact-checking community needs to make sure we are thinking critically about what \u201cgood enough\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d mean when it comes to automated fact-checking systems. I\u2019m interested in hearing other people\u2019s ideas about these issues, please feel free to reach out.", "Thank you to Eni Mustafaraj whose feedback greatly improved the trajectory of this blog post.", "Your home for data science.
