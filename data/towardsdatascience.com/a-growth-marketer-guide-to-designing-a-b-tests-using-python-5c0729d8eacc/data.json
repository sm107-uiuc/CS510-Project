It inspired me to dig deeper into the world of performance and growth. In the process I\u2019ve learned how to mine data to uncover meaningful insights, design experiments accordingly, as well as analyze and interpret experiments results.", "I am now on the Performance Marketing Team, where we are tasked with increasing user engagement throughout the product funnel by leveraging Waze\u2019s owned and operated channels and tools. We directly communicate with users, ultimately driving them towards the most effective actions to complete their user journey.", "In order to understand the efficacy of our campaigns we conduct experiments, primarily in the form of \u201cHypothesis testing\u201d, ie A/B testing. After conducting hundreds of experiments, I\u2019ve identified a series of best practices, as well as concrete steps to put them into practice, for effective A/B testing that you\u2019ll find in the post below.", "Note: The views shared in this post are my own and do not reflect any standard or specific protocols at Waze or Google.", "First and foremost, any A/B test you conduct should align with the company KPI(s) to ensure your work is focused on the business priorities that matter the most. To get started-", "Identifying KPIs requires a combination of domain knowledge and EDA, ie Exploratory Data Analysis. You need to deeply understand the business domain in order to assess what would be the most important drivers. You can then use EDA to uncover relationships that impact them, as EDA also allows you to identify related areas within the product funnel that have the biggest opportunity for growth.", "If you\u2019re exploring the data for the first time you\u2019ll want to follow these basic steps:", "I\u2019ve created a notebook with some basic functions to help get you started. You\u2019ll need to change/ remove some of the functions based on the nature of your dataset, but overall I find this structure useful to keep everything organized and clear.", "The metrics you select should be correlated with the product stickiness (engagement), and be a strong indicator for long term retention. Overall, KPI(s) should be measurable and actionable. That is, you should be able to take certain actions to drive a number up to support business goals. In addition, you need enough existing data on this metric, or to be easily able to collect data on it. Ultimately you\u2019ll want to avoid long timeframe iterations. For example: focus on daily or weekly active users, not monthly active users, as MAU\u2019s would require you to wait an entire month before you could analyze and action on the data.", "When it comes to KPIs you usually want to follow the \u2018Less is more\u2019 approach, so the company can focus on fewer metrics to drive greater impact across the board.", "You should also follow this approach when designing your A/B test. The more metrics you try to optimize the more complexity you\u2019ll add to your experiment, which may need to run longer, require more design & development resources & ultimately more money.", "Once you uncover the relationships in your data you want to dive deeper in your analysis to accurately frame your KPIs, which you will then use when designing your experiment and when defining your success metrics.", "Once you develop a better understanding of relationships in the data and have identified the relevant KPIs, you can begin to define the scope of your experiment. Any experiment design (and frankly any project) should start with answering these 4 questions:", "In many ways this is the most important question to ask, as you do not want to waste time, money and resources on an experiment where the results will not influence business, product or marketing decisions. Make sure to align with the relevant stakeholders in your org prior to starting to work on the experiment.", "Never say \u201clet\u2019s launch this experiment and see what happens\u201d (you\u2019d be surprised how many times I\u2019ve heard this before). The last thing you want is to realize you can\u2019t actually measure the metrics you wanted to influence. Identify the metrics (or KPIs) you want to influence, and then ensure that they are measurable and can in fact be applied to the experiment.", "To assess if the change you\u2019re trying to measure is meaningful you need to have a big enough sample size. How big? That will depend on multiple factors, including the confidence level, power and effect size. We\u2019ll dive into these in greater detail on the third step of designing an experiment, but in general it\u2019s important to remember that it will take a larger sample size to detect an effect that is deep in the product funnel. If a change is in top of funnel, performance such as clicks, opening a message, etc, you may not need as large of a sample size. Similarly, you\u2019ll need a larger sample size to detect a small effect size.", "When possible, identify benchmarks in conversion from similar efforts done for your product to develop a rough estimation of the number of users required to carry out the experiment.", "From a business perspective, you should also consider whether the impact of the experiment, if successful, will be meaningful. In other words, even if your experiment leads to statistically significant lift for the change made, if it only impacts a handful of users it may not be worth running.", "If you answered \u2018no\u2019 to any of the questions above, do not waste your time designing the experiment. Otherwise, keep reading -it\u2019s time to start working on your experiment design!", "After validating the need for the experiment and identifying your success metrics, you can then move on to designing the experiment. I recommend using a notebook that includes all parts of the experiment: definition, plan and report. Anyone reading your notebook should easily be able to understand the rationale, goal and scope of the experiment, as well as how it was executed and the insights you learned from it. The notebook consists of 3 parts: definition, design & launch.", "Provides the background of the experiment. It outlines the need, how decisions will be made and terminology used. Here, you\u2019ll use the analysis conducted on step 1, along with the rationale defined in step 2, to provide context and framing for the experiment.", "Specifically, in this section you\u2019ll want to answer the following questions:", "It is important to ensure that all stakeholders and readers of the experiment report refer to the same definition of all terms used in the experiment. This will impact every part of the experiment and can lead to completely different conclusions if you fail to define critical parts of the experiment. For example, if you\u2019re conducting an experiment aimed to resurrect dormant users, your definition of a dormant user or what constitutes a resurrection must be fully defined in the experiment plan. Other people may have a different perception of both your target audience, as well as on the outcome and success of the experiment overall (true story, btw).", "This is the core of the experiment plan. It includes a definition of the population of interest, opportunity size, sampling scheme, hypothesis definition & minimal sample size needed. Make sure to include the following:", "Population of interestDefine in great detail your targeting definition.", "Opportunity sizeShould be defined based on your population of interest and KPIs defined for the experiment. As mentioned in step 1, you\u2019ll want to focus your efforts on testing things that have the potential to \u2018move the needle\u2019.", "Sampling schemeThe way you\u2019re planning to sample your population of interest. I also recommend including any potential sampling biases to ensure you & your stakeholders are aware of them and their potential impact on the experiment results.", "Null & Alternative HypothesisThis gets to the \u2018heart\u2019 of the experiment definition. Describe shortly and clearly what your Null & Alternative hypotheses are. Your Null hypothesis should be your default action or existing state. Your Alternative hypothesis is the new theory or change you\u2019re testing. Your goal in the experiment is to see if there\u2019s enough evidence to reject the Null and accept the change (alternative hypothesis).", "A statistical error represents a critical part of hypothesis testing. Specifically, we look at 2 types of errors: False positive (Type I error) and False negative (Type II error). A common example for illustrating the difference between the two errors is to look at Type I error as the probability of convicting an innocent person, while type II error refers to the probability of acquitting a guilty person.", "In terms of your experiment, you\u2019ll want to reduce the chances of falsely rejecting the Null hypothesis, hence increasing the probability to find an effect (if such exists).Taking the example above, you can think of the Null hypothesis as the person being innocent and the alternative hypothesis as the person being guilty. You\u2019ll want to reduce the chances of convicting an innocent person (rejecting the Null) if the person is indeed innocent (Null is true).", "Significance level & Power statisticsDefining how comfortable you are with making a Type I error is defined through significance level (a) and commonly set to 0.05 or 5% (95% confidence level). Overcoming Type II error is done through the use of Power Statistic. A Power Statistic of an experiment is the experiment\u2019s ability to detect a difference between your experiment groups, if such difference exists. It is common to use a Power of 80%.", "It\u2019s important to understand the size of the effect, or what result could be expected in a given population. Hence you need an Effect Size. The larger the changes you\u2019d like to see in the test , the larger the effect size, the smaller the minimal sample size would be. The smaller the change we\u2019d like to see, the smaller the effect size and the larger minimal sample size we\u2019ll need. In other words, if you\u2019re looking to detect large differences you will be able to do so with less users in your test, but if you\u2019re looking to find refined, small differences you\u2019ll need to include more users in your test.", "Minimal sample sizeOnce you define the significance level, Power and Effect size you can run a Power Analysis to determine the minimal number of users you need in order to detect if the change you\u2019re testing is meaningful.", "The test is often interpreted using a p-value, which is the probability of observing the result given that the null hypothesis is true. In interpreting the p-value of a significance test, you must specify a significance level. A result of a significance test is claimed to be \u201cstatistically significant\u201d if the p-value is less than the significance level. This means that the null hypothesis (that there is no difference) is rejected.", "Using Python\u2019s statsmodels library you can easily calculate the min. sample size needed, knowing the desired significance level, effect size and power (notebook available here):", "Launch & monitorYou\u2019re now ready to launch your experiment! Do not forget to QA every part of the experiment to ensure that it behaves as you expect it to, and that the data is flowing properly. In addition, make sure to continue to monitor the experiment throughout. Most importantly, closely monitor it during the first hours after launching to identify any potential issues as soon as possible.", "After running the A/B test you\u2019ll need to analyze & clearly report on the experiment results. Don\u2019t be shy about reporting negative or no impact. Often you\u2019ll need to test multiple hypotheses before finding the most impactful one. However, communicating the results clearly and in an actionable way can help you and all relevant stakeholders align and continue to push the impact for your KPIs.", "The first step in analyzing your experiment result starts with validation to ensure that your test ran properly. Specifically, you\u2019ll want to confirm that:", "Once you have confirmed the validity of your experiment, you need to analyze the performance of each group based on the metrics & KPIs defined for the test. While one group may seem to have higher performance than the other, you must look to see if the results are statistically significant in order to be able to determine if the outcome was just a random chance or reproducible result (actual impact).", "How do you know if the results are statistically significant? If the likelihood that the relationship between your variables is not merely by chance! Significance is measured in the P-Value, ie Probability Value, which will reflect whether the probability that your results are as extreme as the results you observe in a statistical hypothesis test. The P-Value assumes that your null hypothesis was correct to begin with.", "Keep in mind that P-values are dependent on the sample size of your test groups. The P-value is represented from 0% to 100% but is usually written as a decimal. For example, a P- value of 5% is 0.05. Low P-values are good; They indicate the result did not occur by chance. You can think of high P-Values as having weak evidence against the Null and low P-values as having a strong evidence against the Null:", "I\u2019ve heard many times people try to soften their reports by saying things like \u2018results were almost statistically significant\u2019. Let\u2019s be clear:", "There is no such thing as \u2018almost significant\u2019. Your test result outcome can either be statistically significant or not.", "In addition to determining whether your test results are statistically significant you\u2019ll also want to define the size of the effect, or the size of the difference between your Null and Alternative hypothesis. To determine this, you\u2019ll need to conduct a Test-Statistic. Different hypothesis tests use different test statistics based on the probability model assumed in the Null hypothesis. A few commonly used tests include:", "When conducting your analysis, you\u2019ll need to select the T-statistic most suitable for your experiment, and calculate both the T & P values to evaluate the performance of your experiment. Statsmodels library includes some great functions to help you conduct some of the t-tests mentioned above.", "Use the code in this notebook for calculating T-tests for basic A/B tests consisting of 2 mutually exclusive groups that will provide you with P & T values.", "While \u201cA/B testing\u201d is often used as a buzzword for growth efforts, it\u2019s very important to take the time to plan them out properly to maximize their impact. Ultimately if you invest in the time to design, launch and measure your experiment correctly you\u2019ll drive massive impact for your organization.
