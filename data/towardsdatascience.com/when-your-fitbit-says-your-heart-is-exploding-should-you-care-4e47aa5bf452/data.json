There are different methods of HIIIT workouts. For me, what this means is going flat out, as hard as I can, for about a minute, followed by a rest period, and then repeating the whole sequence 3 or 4 times.", "The advantage of HIIT is that you burn calories without burning muscle, and you\u2019re all done with your workout in much less time than a traditional cardio workout. The disadvantage is that you feel like hell during the workout.", "After one of these workouts, I got a surprise when I looked at my Fitbit and saw that my heart rate peaked at 200 beats per minute.", "That\u2019s all well and good if I were a 20-year-old athlete, but since I\u2019m neither 20 nor an athlete, it made me wonder.", "The standard formula for calculating maximum heart rate is: 220-age.", "Should I be concerned with Fitbit throwing up a number that is about 20 beats per minute more than my theoretical maximum? Probably not.", "If your heart rate is above the formula maximum, then your true maximum is higher than the formula estimate. Your heart won\u2019t explode from overwork. Your body\u2019s natural self-preservation will quickly slow down your effort level. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t hold your maximum heart rate for very long.", "The problem with the heart rate formula is that apart from age, it treats all people the same. There is a large range in the maximum heart rates between people, influenced by our genetic differences.", "I\u2019ve worked out close enough to an all-out effort to know what my approximate maximum heart rate is. I know that is higher than the 220-age formula. I also know that my maximum heart rate is less than 200 beats per minute, so I thought I\u2019d investigate further.", "Fitbit allows you to download all of your account history. You can read about the process here.", "Once the exporting process is complete, you can download all your data. The download is placed in different folders under your name.", "You can find heart rate data under the Physical Activity. Each day\u2019s activity is in a separate file. This is helpful if you only want to look at one day, but maybe not so helpful if you want to review your entire history.", "The data is in JSON format. If you were to view the raw data, it would look like this.", "Fortunately, Pandas has a method for reading JSON files.", "There are a couple of adjustments to make. The dateTime column is in Universal Time (UTC). To make this more meaningful, we need to convert to the actual timezone. In my case, I\u2019m in the Pacific Time Zone (PST), so I add 8 hours. Also, note that the value column is in dictionary format. We need to drill down to get these values.", "Here\u2019s a view of my heart rate data over 24 hours. The Fitbit takes a snapshot approximately every 5 seconds. You can see the infamous 200 beats per minute peak.", "This chart and the confidence column gives me a couple more reasons not to worry.", "Here\u2019s more from the Fitbit community", "\u201cConfidence scores indicate confidence in the accuracy of the captured data with \u201c3\u201d being the highest and \u201c0\u201d being the lowest; a score of 0 indicates no Heart Rate is detected by the Fitbit tracker and no Heart Rate is displayed on the tracker device\u201d.", "To measure how long my heart rate was above the maximum, I went through several steps \u2014 using 180 bpm as the maximum heart rate.", "This method sums up the time between the minimum and maximum timestamp for each group. If there is only one timestamp for a group, there is no sum for that group.", "Only 1 minute 20 seconds above 180 bpm \u2026 another reason not to worry.", "Use the time column to create a new dataframe specific to the workout. Then create a column for heart rate zones. Here I use four choices: above max, 90% of max, 80% max, less than 80%. Finally, create a scatter plot using the heart rate zone as the color.", "In my case, there was no problem with my heart rate. It was possibly an inaccurate reading, and my heart rate was at the maximum level for only a brief period of time.", "Fitbit is very clear that it is not a medical device and should not be relied on as such. However, there have been several cases where a Fitbit has helped people identify a previously undiagnosed issue. These issues are often Atrial Fibrillation (an irregular, often rapid heartbeat) or an increased resting heart rate.", "I\u2019ll leave you with my all-time favorite personal heart rate chart and a rephased Lizzo lyric.", "I just took a heart rate test, turns out I\u2019m 100% \u201cRock On.\u201d", "I hope this helps with your own Fitbit experimentation.", "Your home for data science.
