So I embarked on a voyage through Bay Area Tech interview culture to figure out what the next step in my data science career should be.", "Prior to switching to data science, I was working as a civil engineer in the construction industry (read about my transition to data science here). I lucked out by obtaining my first data science job through my network and didn\u2019t spend much time interviewing. That meant most of my previous interview experience was in the construction industry. Needless to say, navigating Tech interviews took some trial and error before figuring out a process that worked.", "Here are six key lessons I learned that I\u2019ll explain in more depth below:", "Because data science positions are so competitive, there is almost a secret \u2018code\u2019 to getting through the interview process. It took me some time to truly grasp this concept even though I\u2019d attended a number of Meetups aimed at getting women hired in Tech that tried to explain this.", "The typical interview process looks like this:", "Here are a few secrets I uncovered to optimize that process:", "Resume formats that would make recruiters in the construction industry cringe are fair game in Tech. Add some color. Add some symbols. Make it stand out! Adding little stars on my resume to convey my level of experience with certain skills seemed to appeal to hiring managers. However, a friend pointed out that I was probably rating myself too critically compared to how a male would rate himself.", "As an aside, my advice for critically evaluating or rating yourself (or even for negotiating salary) is to think about a person in your life who always asks for what he or she wants. It might be a coworker, a friend, or a mentor. For me, I think about how I watched my ex negotiate a big salary bump year after year until he made significantly more than me even though we were in the same industry. I try to think about how he would rate himself or what he would ask for in my situation. I\u2019m sure at some point in your life you\u2019ve seen someone negotiate confidently and relentlessly. Try to mimic that, even if you don\u2019t feel it. If all else fails, I think about how I would be doing a disservice to women everywhere and playing into gender stereotypes if I don\u2019t negotiate. Yes, I need that much urgency to push myself to negotiate. There\u2019s already a ton of great articles on negotiating salary, so I won\u2019t dive into it here. I\u2019d recommend reading A (Beginner\u2019s) Guide to Negotiating Salary for Women in Tech as a starting point.", "I\u2019ve heard arguments for and against submitting a cover letter. If there\u2019s an option to submit one, do it. Take the time to write a good cover letter that specifically addresses why you want to work at that company. If there\u2019s a role for the cover letter in Tech, it\u2019s to explain why you are interested in this specific position for this specific company. It only needs to be a couple of paragraphs. Don\u2019t submit a long, generic cover letter that restates what\u2019s listed on your resume.", "If you want to ensure a recruiter or hiring manager looks at your resume, you need someone at the company to refer you. Or you better be phenomenal at resume SEO.", "You should be able to discuss your previous data science experience and the projects in your portfolio, but ultimately they are irrelevant. Although they will get your foot in the door, you have to be able to pass the technical interviews to convey that you are qualified for the position.", "Multiple times I was corrected by a recruiter for making an assumption when I should have clarified the question instead. This holds true for take-home assignments as well. It doesn\u2019t hurt to ask for clarification, even multiple times. I definitely failed one take-home exam because after I asked for clarification once I was too embarrassed to ask for clarification a second time.", "Technical interviews have become an industry; don\u2019t get tricked into spending money on getting interviews. People will reach out to you about adding your profile to their recruitment site, paying for technical interview help, paying for resume writing, paying for practice interview questions, etc. In my opinion, it\u2019s about discipline and trial and error, and you don\u2019t need to pay for most of these services.", "I struggled a bit with the salary expectation question that recruiters ask on the first call. I would typically give a range or median value, and that number would scare some recruiters off while other recruiters would hint that it was too low. The salary range for a position seemed to vary widely between companies. It\u2019s helpful to have a lower limit to your expected salary range in mind, and, if you think you may be overqualified for the position, try asking the recruiter the salary range for the position during the first call. Most resources say to avoid answering the salary expectation question entirely, but recruiters were pretty adamant about knowing if they were in the range of what you\u2019re expecting.", "Realize that getting an offer in the Bay Area is about luck and gaining interview experience. If you don\u2019t get an offer, it\u2019s not because you weren\u2019t skilled enough or smart enough for that company. Try to stay positive, take note of how you can improve, and move your attention to the next application. If you\u2019re having trouble staying positive or feel like technical interviews are burning you out, it may be time to take a break for a couple weeks.", "At one point while I was interviewing, I went to a Meetup in San Francisco and asked a few people how they decided which jobs to apply to because there were so many. They all said \u2018just apply to everything.\u2019 I thought this logic was flawed because tailoring a resume and cover letter to a position and finding a connection to give you a referral is incredibly time-consuming. Not to mention the technical interview process that can take 2\u20134 weeks and may involve a take-home assignment. I wanted to spend the majority of my time studying for technical interviews and only a limited amount of time applying for positions.", "I argue that it\u2019s necessary to narrow down specific types of data science jobs you\u2019re excited about (research vs. application, modeling vs. statistics vs. analytics, generalist vs. specialist) as well as the type of company you want to join (private vs. public, startup vs. established, B2C vs. B2B). In order to optimize my time, I developed the following process to decide which jobs to apply to.", "Using this process, I would get a call with the recruiter and at least make it to the first-round technical interview roughly 2/3 of the time. I like those odds.", "Live coding interviews were definitely my kryptonite. Not because I didn\u2019t know how to code, but because I lacked confidence in my coding abilities. I would panic knowing that someone was watching me type and judging my thought process. I would rush myself because I was worried I was going too slow. The combination of panicking and rushing caused me to overcomplicate simple questions and prevented me from effectively debugging my code. I have a theory that this may affect women more often than men.", "In order to gain confidence, I made sure I was coding every day and comparing my code to other people\u2019s code on Kaggle. I should have tried some of the following resources to get better at live coding interviews, but I ended up getting an offer before exploring these options:", "Once you solve enough practice technical interview questions, you start to see a pattern and gain confidence in your abilities. There are a couple services I found that will email you a question a few times a week and then send a separate email with the solution (for a subscription fee).", "However, be skeptical of online solutions to practice questions. The Facebook reading materials I was given for my technical interview included the following warning: \u201cWhile we recognize that candidates may utilize outside sites/resources with posted interview questions and answers, we encourage caution, as we\u2019ve found many of the proposed solutions to be incorrect.\u201d", "I bought The Hundred-page Machine Learning Book intending to use it as a resource for my job. The book was actually super helpful for passing technical interview questions. I recommend memorizing the key terms in the book and making sure you understand and can explain the key concepts.", "More specifically, I was repeatedly asked the following questions:", "On a lighter note, I was also asked these questions:", "Once you have about a year of data science experience, you will experience the four stages of dealing with 3rd party recruiters. At first (stage one), the attention is flattering. You\u2019ll think \u201cI\u2019ve made it! Companies are contacting me for interviews.\u201d Then (stage two), it becomes frustrating. You\u2019ll think \u201cDid this recruiter even read my LinkedIn profile? I\u2019m obviously not a good fit for the position.\u201d Stage three is feeling overwhelmed. You have to respond to recruiters to keep your LinkedIn job search status as \u201cactively applying\u201d, but there are so many irrelevant ones. Stage four is indifference. You actively ignore all 3rd party recruiters.", "The stacked bar chart below shows how far along in the process I got for the 20 positions I applied to. The positions I applied to myself or went through a company recruiter resulted in six interview processes where I made it to the 1st-round interview, one interview process where I made it to the final-round interview, and three interview processes where I received offers. The six positions I applied to by taking calls with third-party recruiters who were screening candidates before passing resumes along to a hiring manager ultimately resulted in zero interviews with the actual company. Even though they typically lasted only 15-minutes, I would have to plan my day around the calls. They took away from time I could have spent doing something more impactful. Sometimes, I felt that the recruiter had been given a requirement to find a certain number of \u2018diverse\u2019 candidates, and I was added to the mix to meet that threshold even though my skill set didn\u2019t necessarily match well with the job description. But that could just be in my head. Regardless, if you want to work with 3rd party recruiters, ask for the job description first and assess whether you\u2019d be a good fit for the position before scheduling a call.", "On the other hand, I thought the recruiter for my Facebook interview was really helpful in navigating the interview process. Facebook seemed to level the playing field by giving me time to update my resume prior to sending it to the hiring manager, explaining in detail how the technical interview would go, and giving me materials to read and links to practice questions before the technical interview. At other companies, I was just shooting in the dark about what skills should be highlighted on my resume and the types of questions I would face.", "To recap, the interview process is stressful, time-consuming, and, at times, a little humiliating. Make the best use of your time by finding the types of positions that more often than not will get you to the first-round technical interview. Practice makes perfect in conquering technical interviews. Failing a technical interview is just a part of practicing technical interviews, so don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. With a little luck and a lot of discipline, you will get that offer.", "Your home for data science.
