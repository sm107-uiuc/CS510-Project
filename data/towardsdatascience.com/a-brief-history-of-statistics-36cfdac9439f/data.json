It seemed like a matter of time\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["In the mid-nineteenth century, humanity was in a state of apotheosis with scientific discoveries, a great wave of optimism seized Europe with the new possibilities. It seemed like a matter of time before we learned all the laws that govern nature. We have made great progress in physics, biology, astronomy, etc. that justified this excess of optimism. It seemed that if we had good measurements we could describe and predict anything. Well, needless to say, the positivists were wrong, but let\u2019s pretend we don\u2019t know and continue our story.", "A little earlier, in the eighteenth century, when making some measurements of the position of the planets, there were some slight deviations. We expected the planet to be in a position and it was slightly in the \u201cwrong place.\u201d There were two possible explanations for this phenomenon. Either the model would be wrong or our equipment that collects this data is not good / sensitive enough. The model looked pretty good so it should be the fault of the instruments, and so they started producing ever more accurate equipment. In analyzing these small deviations, they noticed that he always followed a certain distribution. Laplace devoted an entire volume of his astronomical predictions just to dealing with errors. Today we know it as normal distribution.", "Galton box is a machine that tries to demonstrate that different distributions converge to the normal distribution. We call this curious fact the central limit theorem.", "So we started to improve the quality of the equipment and as expected, the errors decreased, and this encouraged to create better and better equipment, but as the equipment became more and more accurate, something bizarre started to happen, the errors instead. To decrease,started to increase! And the scientists of the time began to wonder why and the answer is that our world is not deterministic but stochastic, that is, events have an intrinsically random feature! Even if we had the best data collections and knew the perfect model of nature,Yet it would not guarantee a good prediction, as there are random factors that we do not control.", "We needed new techniques to deal with this new world, and so came statistics as we know it, a tool for understanding a stochastic world. In the case of measurements with random characteristics, for example, we should work with some measure of centrality, such as the average:", "The next step in our history of statistics is a member of Charles Darwin\u2019s family, not so famous, but very important to history, his cousin Francis Galton. Genius in many areas, Galton was first and foremost an exceptional observer and was one of the first to notice another important feature about distributions which is the form of their dispersion, that is, while the average passes on the idea of \u200b\u200bcentrality, the dispersion tells how much the data is distributed. Far from average, hence the idea of \u200b\u200bvariance and standard deviation:", "Another cousin, now Variance is the Standard Deviation, which is basically the square root of the first, with the advantage of the interpretation being in the same unit of data. Image we have a table with heights and the average is 180cm and variance 400cm\u00b2. This 400cm\u00b2 is hard to interpret, so we took the root and arrived at the standard deviation of 20cm (20cm * 20cm = 400cm\u00b2) which has the interpretation that on average people vary 20cm up and 20cm down.", "Galton went beyond, far beyond. He founded a laboratory to collect and chart various human characteristics and made great efforts in this. An interesting observation is that the same distribution of errors in astronomical measurements has been found several other times as in height or forearm size. But he is here mainly because he noticed a very curious and innovative feature at the time. First, when parents \u2018average height was too high, their children would be taller than average, and when parents\u2019 average height was too low, their children would also be slightly lower than average.", "So far nothing new, everyone had this distrust even without the data. But he realized that there was a second behavior, that these children, from tall or short parents, were hardly as tall or as short as their parents, there seemed to be a force pulling their children\u2019s height back to average, and this force we call regression the mean. Otherwise, in a few generations, we would have a population of giants on one side and dwarfs on the other, and we obviously didn\u2019t observe them.", "With that, Galton coined the term that was later refined by his intellectual heir, Pearson, who names both a type of correlation and the publisher of technical books. The formula we all know is:", "That has a fairly simple interpretation. When X and Y are above average we will add a large positive number (negative * negative), if both are below average we also add a positive number (positive * positive) if one is above and the other below average, we add a negative value. If this sum is a large number, We say that X and Y are closely associated, otherwise they are poorly associated. Names only make learning difficult, but today we call it Covariance.", "Like variance, covariance is difficult to interpret. And just as we normalize the variance to standard deviation which is much simpler to understand. Pearson did the same with covariance, in which case we take the original covariance and divide it by the standard deviation of X and Y, so that the result mathemagically falls between -1 and + 1:", "The interpretation now is that the stronger the correlation, the stronger would be that \u201cgravity\u201d that made the height of the children regress back to the expected average height. A weak correlation would indicate that these variables are not closely associated. This simple idea of \u200b\u200bthe turn of the nineteenth to the twentieth century revolutionized all modern science. It is difficult to find any area that has not been affected by these findings. From agriculture to medicine to the social sciences, every modern science speaks the same language: statistics.", "This text is not a reliable portrayal of the history of statistics, many of the findings portrayed here had previous co-authors that were omitted to simplify and facilitate understanding of the subject.", "Your home for data science.
