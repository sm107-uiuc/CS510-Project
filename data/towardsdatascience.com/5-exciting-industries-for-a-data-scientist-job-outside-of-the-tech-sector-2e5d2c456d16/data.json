In my former position, I worked on projects in the chemical industry. I did not know that industry before, and I was surprised how advanced they are, and the many insights I could gain, especially the integration with IoT technology.", "So, what are the reasons to look for a job in another industry?", "In the following, I give you five sectors to find exciting job positions outside of the tech industry. I will provide you with a brief overview of the industry, the salary level compared to the tech industry, how recession-proof this sector is, examples of projects, and what skills the industry is looking for in data scientists.", "COVID-19 forces us to hear all the time about the development of vaccines. That shapes our view of this industry. But this is only one part of the whole sector.", "The fact is that the industry is big and very heterogeneous, with many subsectors like agricultural bioscience, diagnostics, therapeutics, pharmaceuticals, genomics and proteomics, veterinary life sciences, cosmetics, drug manufacturing, medical technology, distribution, and many other services.", "In the pharmaceutical sector alone, we have, besides vaccine development, other areas like antibodies therapeutics, cell therapies, generic medicines, immunotherapy, proteins, or stem cells.", "The costs for developing new treatments start today from around one billion U.S. dollars and go up to two-digits billion U.S. dollars. The industry makes all efforts to decrease the costs and make treatments faster available. That pushes for a data-driven sector comparable to the technology industry. All global players are building data ecosystems to link the patients, the service providers like hospitals and doctors, and their own data together.", "I advise you to perform some research about the different subsectors. When you see a job offer, always find out the subsector first.", "The industry typically has a low staff turnover and offers excellent benefits, with high salaries in the same range as the tech companies.", "Yes, the industry is very recession-proof. Health care is always needed, for humans as well as for pets and animals. And in times like today, the industry gets even a boost.", "You can imagine that the range of possible areas and projects is as wide as the number of subsectors. A comprehensive list of projects would fill pages. So, I limit it on three examples.", "Precision medicine: Medical treatments are more and more based on individual, personalized characteristics of a patient. These characteristics are disease subtypes, personal patient risks, health prognosis, and molecular and behavioral biomarkers. A biomarker is any measurable data point such that the patients can be stratified, e.g., disease severity score, lifestyle characteristics, or genomic properties. Based on all these data, the best treatment of a single patient is determined.", "A real example is a patient with ovarian cancer where chemotherapy was not effective. So, one performed a genome sequencing for finding the misplaced nucleotide bases that cause that cancer. With big data analytics, one found amongst the 3 billion base pairs of a human the modification (this corresponds to the number of words of 7798 books of Harry Potter\u2019s The Philosopher\u2019s Stone). This modification was known from lung cancer, where a drug exists. This drug was applied, and the patient recovered.", "Supply chain optimization: The production of drugs needs time, especially today\u2019s high-tech cures, based on particular substances and production methods. Also, a drug can be stored only for a limited time, and some need special storage, e.g., in a cold storage room. The whole planning from having the right input substances available at the right time, having the adequate production capacity, and finally, the proper amount of drugs stored for serving the demand, is a very complex system. And there is not only one drug where this must be managed. No, there are hundreds and thousands of them, each with their specific conditions. So, life sciences companies are starting to manage their whole supply chain with data science methods.", "Research publication scanning for biomarkers: Daily, there are many hundreds of scientific publications about the detection of biomarkers for all the different diseases by the multiple research teams around the globe. It is vital for life sciences companies to know the newly detected biomarkers to implement them into their particular research fields to find new cures. Research is enormously expensive and time-critical. By understanding the current relevant research, they can avoid duplication in research, and they can speed up the time to market. The amount of information is so enormous that this cannot be done manually. So, very sophisticated NLP algorithms are developed that find the relevant publications. Besides the understanding of the content where such biomarkers are relevant, a judgment of the quality of the published results and how it fits into the company\u2019s research must be given \u2014 a very complex task.", "The job typically requires a science background in addition to data science knowledge. For senior positions, the proven experience in working with health records data is needed. For specialized topics, the companies can be very picky with the matching skills. All expertise from working in a complex scientific or engineering environment is highly welcomed. Knowledge in bioinformatics is a plus. Especially for people with a science background that want to enter the data science field, this industry gives plenty of opportunities.", "The utilities industry is providing basic public amenities like water, electricity, or natural gas. They build, own, and maintain the corresponding infrastructure like hydroelectric generators, nuclear plants, energy grids, control stations, water distribution systems, etc. That defines the supply. On the other side of the equation is the demand of consumers, i.e., single persons and corporates, which has to be served.", "The interaction of supply and demand and infrastructure maintenance is quite complex, and today heavily technological and real-time data-driven. The industry is moving fast into IoT devices and so-called smart metering, which records real-time any consumption of energy or water and provides detailed information to the utilities and the consumer. It is considered as the first step into smart grids.", "This industry operates in two extremes: on the one hand, they have to maintain assets with a lifetime from 35 years, like generating plants up to 100 years for drinking water distribution systems. On the other side, electricity cannot be stored, and real-time management is required.", "Utilities are one of the industries with the highest volume of data, and thus, they face all related challenges to get usage of them. The industry is currently also in a technological transformation and adds more and more sensors and IoT devices, resulting in even more available real-time data.", "Based on my experience, the salary is about 5\u201310% lower on average than in the tech industry.", "Many utilities have outsourced their data science capabilities. So, check for specialized small and middle-sized consulting firms that serve purely the utilities market.", "Yes, the industry is very recession-resistant. Water, electricity, and power are always needed, independent of the economic state.", "There are many areas in the utilities space where data science is used, from asset performance management, outage, and failure prediction, to the energy supply management and customer analytics.", "Water leakage detection: In Europe and the U.S., trillions of liters of drinking water leak out of the water supply system. The installation of water sensors to detect leakage is still at the beginning. Manual measurement and tapping of pipes are standard but neither efficient nor region-wide applicable. So, based on the flow measurements at specific locations and the end consumers\u2019 water consumption data, prediction models are set up to localize areas of potential water loss.", "Preventive power grid management with drones: Power grids have alone in the U.S. a length of 160,000 miles for high-voltage power lines and millions of miles for the low-voltage local distribution lines. Monitoring all lines for potential risks like, e.g., trees that could damage a line, is a nearly impossible undertaking. So, commercial drones are used to patrol along the lines and record videos of the adjacent environment. Computer vision algorithms are developed or improved for the automated detection of potential risks.", "Consumption forecasts and dynamic pricing: The prediction of electricity consumption is one of the most important figures to ensure the supply. Remember, energy cannot be stored. So, in real-time, the supply must be guaranteed. That is a very complex system, from managing hydroelectric generators\u2019 production capacity to the distribution through the power lines, purchasing and selling electricity, and setting incentives to use less or more power during specific time frames with the corresponding pricing. You must manage overlapping long-term and short-term effects, several seasonalities, weather forecasts, and short-term fluctuations. It is a very delicate issue and not easy to solve with all the data volume and a short time to react to the predicted outcome.", "The utilities industry is working with a lot of mathematical models, mainly from Operations Research. The data scientist should therefore have a good foundation in mathematics and mathematical models. You should have at least basic knowledge of how the industry works and how to proceed a large amount of data, even in real-time.", "The food and beverage industry contains a wide range of companies from restaurants, coffee shop and fast-food chains, food, and beverage transportation services, food manufacturer, to the giant multinationals like Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch InBev, JBS, and so on.", "My recommendation deals primarily with the many opportunities in the multinationals. They have several brands, functional food and drinks, and sometimes pet food. Their business does not only depend on consumer behavior but also all the actions of sellers of their products.", "The salary level of the multinationals is comparable to the tech industry. Local companies pay considerably lower salaries.", "The industry is partially recession-proof. Both, soft drinks and alcoholic beverages like wines and spirituous beverages, see declines during recessions. In contrast, large brewers face only a minor fall. Restaurant spendings drop heavily during recessions, whereas grocery store spendings remain stable, and discount retailers can increase their sales.", "Sentiment analysis and critical commentary detection: Today, complaints about a product are first public on social media platforms. Severe cases like, e.g., contamination of food products, are swiftly in the headlines. For large corporates, it essential to monitor real-time 24/7 all their product comments around the globe. When an impactful comment is identified, the brand needs to act quickly. The background of the potential incident needs to be analyzed and corresponding actions initiated.", "Many negative sentiments need no intervention. On the other side of the scale are incidents that require immediate executive committee attention. Finding the right balance in the machine learning algorithms is tricky. It is a highly exciting field where misclassification matters.", "On-time production and delivery: Soft drinks beverage companies need to plan the demand for drinks, calculate back their production schedule and capacities, and their ingredients demand from their suppliers. Besides seasonalities, factors like the weather, bigger and smaller events, consumer trends, price wars, economic situations, seller purchase power, production time and capacities, shelf life, etc., must be considered. The logistics need to be arranged in advance to ensure the delivery on-time of the drinks to sellers or event catering. It is again a non-trivial task and demands for highly-skilled data science teams.", "Quality assurance: The consumer expects that the taste, consistency, quality, and shelf life of a product are consistent all over the year and independent of the consumption location. Many factors influence the production outcome, starting from the proper amount of ingredients, their quality, the season, the production country and transportation conditions, storage, and production conditions like temperature, pressure, variances in the production time, and so on. To find the right pattern of ingredients and production parameters per produced batch such that the product is always the same is a highly non-trivial data science task.", "They expect in-depth data science method knowledge from regression to neural networks. When working on production problems, time series knowledge is needed, as well as NLP experience in the customer analytics field.", "In general, one can say that this industry contains all the production, manufacturing, equipment, and sales of them that are not sold directly to a consumer. Examples of the subsectors are construction, manufactured houses, industrial machines and tools, cement and metal fabrication, and industrial components. Examples of well-known global companies are GE, Siemens, Hitachi, 3M, Honeywell International, Bosch, Lockheed Martin, or ABB. Over the last years, these companies not only went through their own full digital transformation and have fully automated manufacturing, but they have their own platforms as a service for their customers and extensive data and technology teams.", "The industry has a particularity, the so-called \u201chidden champions.\u201d A hidden champion is a company that is at the top in the global market but has revenues below $5 billion, and it is nearly unknown in public. These companies are typically high-tech firms, thought leaders in digitalization and technology, and usually located in nowhere. Data and AI is their driver. It is a paradise for a data scientist. However, to find such a hidden champion and get hired is not an easy task.", "The salary level is close to the level of the tech industry. Especially at hidden champions are the benefits and working culture above average, and the employee is still a valuable human and not a number.", "The simple answer is: it depends. There is no general statement possible, and it depends on the subsector and the type of recession. To give you an example: in the current COVID-19 crisis, fashion production collapsed, and with it, the demand for industrial machines in that industry. But one hidden champion that is producing sewing machines cannot meet the global demand. The companies\u2019 high precision machines are flexible in the application and are now used for masks production. My observation is that hidden champions are less likely to be hit by a recession.", "The industry and the projects are driven by the sensors, connected devices, and automation that make up intelligence machines, which produces an enormous amount of real-time data.", "Workers\u2019 safety: Worker\u2019s accidents are costly, not only of the accident itself but also because of the absence of the worker and reputational damage. Today, the workers in the heavy equipment environment are more and more equipped with sensors, vibrators, or integrated cameras. So, the data of all these devices are analyzed. One example is the analytics of real-time data on patterns that detect a risky situation for the employee and leads to an alert, e.g., a high-pitched sound. Another example is the pattern detection for unhealthy work behavior like ergonomic wrong lifting and subsequent instructions for the worker to improve.", "Productivity optimization: We all have heard of predictive maintenance. With machine learning methods, the time points of machine failure are predicted, and the anticipated maintenance. The leading companies today can detect small anomalies already a few weeks in advance before a failure happens. That gives not only time for a scheduled maintenance but also to optimize the whole production over that period, including how eventually, by adjusting production parameters can avoid the predicted failure. These are high-dimensional problems to solve that require methods on the frontier of machine learning.", "Research and Development (R&D): The intelligent machines need intelligent and robust algorithms to perform their tasks. An example is diagnostics machines where a camera is installed to monitor the control panel, i.e., how it is used by the workers and their hand movements. These data are coupled with machine performance and failure data. Based on the patterns, self-adjusting processes are integrated into the machine to ensure consistent work performance.", "They are looking for well-skilled data scientists with knowledge in advanced methods as well as in engineering. The experience in handling high volume and real-time data is critical. The personality for working in a team and a smaller company is equally important.", "The industry covers the science, art, and business of livestock, aquaculture, i.e., fisheries, crops and plants, and forestry. We are typically most familiar with farming. Farming transforms into a technology-driven business, too. With fewer resources, agriculture has to produce more and more products and food. The technological development covers autonomous tractors and machinery, digitalized disease detection and pest management, better weather predictions, automated irrigation, and harvesting systems, and livestock health, to mention a few. That only can happen with large amounts of data and many smart algorithms.", "Quick analytics on Glassdoor gives an average salary range of about 10% less than a similar position in a tech company to a nearly equal level. But one has to consider the location differences, as many agricultural data science jobs are not in the big centers where tech companies are located.", "This industry is a mixed blessing. Agriculture is mostly a low margin business, and any cut in the spendings for food during a recession has a direct cut impact on the farmers\u2019 income. On the other hand, the same leads to more digitalization to become more efficient and effective. So, on the innovation side there, we typically do not see a lot of change, and it can be considered as quite recession-resistant.", "Precision farming is the keyword. Based on real-time data about crops, plants, soil, hyper-local weather conditions, temperature, moisture, collected by sensors in the fields, satellite and drone images, individual plants\u2019 needs can be analyzed and the corresponding care determined.", "The health of cows: Earmarks that measure temperatures, fitness trackers for cows, GPS-neckbands, and even sensors in the stomach are today\u2019s available accessory for cows. These real-time data are then analyzed by machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in the individual cow\u2019s health, and a corresponding alert is then sent either to the farmer or directly to the veterinary. Such algorithms\u2019 development is tricky because too many alerts or the wrong alerts would lead to incorrect treatments, and no warning in a severe health case would lead to no treatment.", "Disease detection and management: Either with images or infrared pictures of the fields, microscopic diseases can be detected with computer vision. Combined with further local data like weather, or soil parameters, the spread of a disease can be predicted. Based on all these data, the right treatment for precisely the contaminated area is determined. And it should ensure that neither too much nor too few pesticides are used. Here, you are working on the frontier of image recognition techniques.", "Harvesting and grading: Today, automated harvesting machines exist that also automatically grade fruits or vegetables. One example is tomatoes. They are often cultivated in greenhouses with robots. These robots not only manage data-driven cultivation but also harvest the ripe fruits and grade them into the different classes. Again, this is very machine learning intense work where you can use all the advanced neural network models.", "The good message is that the agricultural industry does not expect that you have a corresponding education. They are looking for data scientists open and curious to expand the applications of data science and AI into less considered sectors. But do not underestimate the maturity of methods used. Be prepared for very advanced applications.", "Many exciting sectors outside of the tech industry give unique opportunities to acquire skills and expertise that you otherwise could not experience. Technology is penetrating all industries and sectors, and with that comes the generation of huge volumes of data. All sectors have to become data-driven.", "My advice for you is that when you are looking for a data science job, be open-minded and think outside of the box. It will give you a competitive advantage for your data science career.", "Do you like my story? Here you can find more.", "Your home for data science.
