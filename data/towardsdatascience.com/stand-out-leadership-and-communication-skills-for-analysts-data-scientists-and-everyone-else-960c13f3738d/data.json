Within each point are my tips and tricks for accomplishing it.", "Understand Leadership Know your AudienceTake Extreme OwnershipCriticize Yourself FirstBuild Relationships", "You do not need to be in a management position to be a leader! Leadership is somewhat hard to define, but to me, leadership is the method by which inspiration turns to action in pursuit of a common goal. By definition, it is simply the act of leading a person, group or organization. Reviewing the literature, common themes appear as to what makes up a good leader. Often cited are traits such as honest, charismatic, visionary, compassionate, and decisive. Historically, good/strong leaders have brought people together, championed innovation, and acted in the interests of their communities over personal gain.", "Transformational-leadership is sought after and an effective leadership strategy. Leadership expert, Dr. Ronald E Riggio, has written extensively on the four distinct traits that make up transformational-leaders. He says the best leaders serves as an ideal role model, motivate followers, show genuine concern for others, and stimulate innovation and creativity.", "Focus on the big pictureIt is easy to lose sight of what is happening around you if you\u2019re hyper-focused on one thing.", "Get involvedShow people you\u2019re a team player. Show up to team building activities, learn about the business and its competition.", "Be strategicAlways be on the lookout for new and efficient ways to do things.", "Know your audience is communication 101. If you want to be persuasive with your communication, you have to know your audience so you can deliver the information they care about! When I\u2019m presenting our new tools or features to trainers, I get into details about how the features work. When I\u2019m explaining our project progress to stakeholders and C-level executives, I don\u2019t include all the nitty-gritty technical details. There is a high probability their eyes will glaze over and they will become uninterested if I did! Approach different audiences with different levels of detail.", "Communicating with management, it is my duty to keep them excited about the work my team is completing so they continue to give us resources and trust that we\u2019re moving the business forward. I know they want to hear the big picture updates, not the minutia. They want the high-level overview and info about whether or not we\u2019re getting the job done.", "Research your stakeholders/audienceIf you\u2019re brand new to the organization or the team, don\u2019t be afraid to do a bit of research! Go through the employee directory if possible and put a name to the face of all the stakeholders around your projects. Look them up on LinkedIn or find a way to make small-talk (small-talk might be more difficult during remote work).", "Watch recorded meetingsIf your company records them, look up past stakeholder meetings and see how your peers perform. Take note of the level of detail they provide and the overall tone of the presentation. Is it serious? Is it lighthearted?", "Ask for feedbackHearing criticism can be tough, but it can go a long way! Talk to your boss and peers about your performance and get the feedback you need to improve your presentation skills.", "Do not complain about anything unless you already have a solution in mind. The idea of \u201cextreme ownership\u201d was popularized by Jocko Willink, decorated retired Navy SEAL officer. He has written several books on leadership and extreme ownership, and runs his own podcast too. To summarize his points, good leaders and good teams don\u2019t make excuses or blame external factors when problems occur. They own the problem, find solutions and implement the one that gets the job done.", "When you start taking extreme ownership of things, you realize it is a lot easier to have the \u201ctough conversations\u201d with your team because you begin to take pride in your work. My team helped develop a data analysis tool for our customers to use in our software platform. Although I was new in the position and added to the project at its tail-end, I took as much ownership as my role would allow. By taking as much ownership as I could and working closely with the team, when I found bugs in testing, the problems were easy to bring up to the developers. I felt less anxious about being critical because I made it my responsibility to ensure our customers were going to get a tool that works.", "Lastly, taking ownership and responsibility builds trust between your managers and your teammates, and it makes you look reliable. When I think back to previous jobs, the people who never got ahead were always the ones who had excuses for their under-performance instead of taking responsibility for their short-comings and stepping up to improve.", "Embrace the project/missionBuild enthusiasm with your team by discussing and understanding the purpose of the project and the ideal outcome.", "Always ask \u201cWhat more can I do?\u201dAlthough it is never good to over-promise and under-deliver, you should always be asking yourself and your team, \u201cwhat more can I do?\u201d", "Stay positiveStuff will always come up. Hardware fails, people get sick, things come in over budget. Whenever a hurdle presents itself, stay positive, and try to jump it instead of using it as an excuse to stop trying.", "Any one who has worked with me knows I\u2019m not afraid to be critical. I try to take it as well as I can dish it. At some point in your career, whether you\u2019re a leader or not, it is likely that you will be involved in a \u201ctough conversation\u201d in which you need to be critical of a teammate or manager. When these situations arise, it is important to step up with humility. Remember, pobody is nerfect.", "According to the self-help classic, How to Win Friends & Influence People, if you want people to be receptive to your criticism, talk about your own mistakes first! For example, I once had a meeting with an executive who asked me to rate my weekly 1:1 meetings with my direct boss on a scale of 1\u20135, 1 being no value and 5 being exceptional value. Before I said anything critical, I prefaced the conversation with a anecdote about me being a \u201ctough grader\u201d and gave him my definition of \u201cexceptional value.\u201d I explained how meeting that definition on a weekly basis would be a real challenge for anyone so I can only give 4/5! After all that, when I did change the tone of the conversation to be more critical, the executive understood my frame of mind. He knows my criticisms come from a desire to grow within the company and make things better, not a desire to complain about my team. Ultimately, I think it made him more receptive to what I had to say.", "Clarify intentionsMake sure the participants understand the intention behind the critical conversation.", "Give praise before criticismIf you have to be critical, start by telling the person/team what they did right.", "Ask yourself what you stand to gainDo not start arguments for the sake of your ego. You being right isn\u2019t as important as getting the job done. If you stand to gain little or nothing from the critical conversation, consider avoiding it or delaying it until your objectives are clear.", "Building relationships has never come easy for me since I\u2019ve always been pretty shy. Although it takes mental and emotional effort, I do my best to step up and build a relationship with my team and managers. Good leaders and communicators focus on building relationships to establish trust. Of course, individuals can accomplish a lot in their own right, but most people agree working with a good team will get you farther faster.", "By establishing relationships and opening up, you\u2019re making it easier for your teammates and boss to trust you. For example, when I worked at an electronics retailer, a part of the job was pitching protection plans to customers who wanted to buy our expensive gear like computers and televisions. One day I approached my boss with a new technique for pitching the plans. Because I had a positive relationship with my boss, he let me give it a try. He knew me well enough to trust that I was going to do the right thing. He trusted that if my new pitch was failing, I\u2019d go back to the old one instead of letting my ego take over. Because of our relationship, I was given opportunity that my teammates were not, and that allowed me to climb the ladder faster.", "Give compliments oftenI constantly thank my teammates and tell them they are doing good work.", "Respect people\u2019s opinionsUnless it is going to affect the outcome of the project or assignment, it is best to avoid arguing with people over their opinions.", "Apologize quicklyWhen you are wrong or out of line, be quick to self correct and apologize.", "Being a leader goes far beyond having the words \u201cManager\u201d in your title. Just like you might work on your technical skills, it is important to work on leadership and communication skills if you want to have an easier time getting ahead or climbing the corporate ladder. Focus on mastering these techniques and you will excel at leadership and communication:", "Understand Leadership Know your AudienceTake Extreme OwnershipCriticize Yourself FirstBuild Relationships", "If you\u2019re interested in learning more about business and data science, check out my other articles too!", "Your home for data science.
