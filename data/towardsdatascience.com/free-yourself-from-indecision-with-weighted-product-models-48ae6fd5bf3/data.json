People ask me to create a model, a formula, a chart, something\u2026to solve a quantitative problem.", "In the past six months, a recurring problem appeared for different people: how to decide on the best project/campaign/item/apartment, among many alternatives, if you have to evaluate a lot of criteria?", "People may think I pick, without hesitation, some amazing Artificial Intelligence algorithm, a Deep Learning classifier, or even a Hill-climbing Ensemble Selection with Bootstrap Sampling. However, as Robert Browning said, \u201cWell, less is more, Lucrezia\u201d.", "A Weighted Product Model (WPM) is a simple and popular technique to solve Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) problems. It basically consists of multiply all attributes values to get a score. The higher, the better.", "As an example, look at the following table:", "The WPM score for the first line is:", "Thus, using the score provided by the WPM, the preferences are ranked like this", "if the weights are the same for each feature (wi = 1).", "Weight Product Model is a very easy technique. You may use any programming language or even a spreadsheet (get the code on Github).", "To show how to do it in Python, let\u2019s take another example:", "The table above corresponds to apartments for sale in Chicago, IL, and the data was based on a popular real state web site and adapted for educational purposes. The features are the number of bedrooms (beds), number of bathrooms (baths), total area, homeowners association fee (hoa), number of parking spaces, year of the building, apartment\u2019s floor, exposure to the sun, the existence of elevator, and price.", "Despite its simplicity, there are some pitfalls. First I\u2019ll show you how to do it right, then I\u2019ll show you what you shouldn\u2019t do.", "Then, I create a pandas DataFrame:", "WPM uses only numerical features. So, I convert exposure and elevator to numeric:", "Now, the table looks like this:", "Next, I scale all features to the same range:", "It\u2019s time to define the weights:", "The idea here is to make negative the features aren\u2019t benefits. As an instance, if the price goes up, the WPM Score should go down.", "Then, we apply the function over the rows:", "The WPM Score ranked the apartments in a way all features are equally important. However, if an affordable HOA is more relevant than the number of bathrooms? Different features importances can be achieved by changes in their weights:", "These weight values were purely arbitrary \u2014 and they usually depend on the judgment of the decision-maker. Also, it\u2019s possible to define a different scale. Here I used a Likert Scale because it is very straightforward.", "Parking space, elevator, cheap HOA, and low floor are now essential; area and price are considerable, and the rest is of little importance.", "The WPM score now has an entirely different scale, but that doesn\u2019t matter, because only the ranking is relevant.", "As I said before, you need to take some precautions to use the WPM correctly.", "First of all, you MUST scale the data. All features. Ever. People might say you don\u2019t need to do that because the data is already prepared or WPM itself doesn\u2019t need it. Don\u2019t believe them: otherwise, you will mess up the weights. As an example, let\u2019s take only two features: beds and area and assume the weights are equal to 2 and 1, respectively:", "As you can see, the number of bedrooms is more relevant than the total area, but the higher scale in the latter spoiled the weights. The story is different if you scale the features for a [10, 100] range:", "Second: don\u2019t scale the values to [0, 1] range. Prefer values bigger than that. Why? Because of the following power properties:", "0 is almost always 0, 1 is always 1, and a fraction will become smaller if you apply a power greater than 1. So, choose another range.", "Related to the weights, you can use any value. But again, keep it simple: use integers, negatives only when a feature is an onus, and beware with zero.", "The third caution is a bit more complicated: the features should be reasonably independent. If there is a cause-and-effect relationship between two or more of them, you should keep only one. For example, just imagine you have a feature named property tax, which its calculation strongly depends on the apartment\u2019s price:", "If you calculate the Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient between these two features:", "You will find a perfect correlation:", "If you add these two features, it\u2019s like you add the column price twice. Its weight will be doubled, making it two times more relevant. In other words, it will mess up the weights.", "However, a high value for Pearson\u2019s Correlation may be a clue, but not a guarantee the two features are dependent. As an example of that, let\u2019s test two other features, elevator and parking:", "These two features are highly correlated, but the existence of an elevator in the building does not imply the apartment will have a parking space!", "So, you need to analyze the features to decide which of them you should discard.", "Decision analysis has many techniques and solves a lot of problems.
