Additionally, there are some alternative ways to learn, like from peers, YouTube videos, or articles like this one. My goal is to shed some light on some of the expectations and ways to improve yourself as a Data Scientist. These points include production training, GitHub examples, creative thinking, Kaggle examples, and recent technology.", "Keep on reading if you would like to learn more about some advice from a Data Scientist in the field.", "This first tip is more-so for beginner Data Scientists. This point is to become not only aware of production environments, but also to train and practice your code as production-ready. A lot of times, as Data Scientists, we learn how to implement Machine Learning algorithms within the safety and ease of our Jupyter Notebook environments. In most programs, you will practice just like that over and over again. However, it is important to be able to ship your code so that it is production-ready. While there are Software Engineers who can certainly help you, sometimes it is better or more efficient if you can translate your code to be in an object-oriented programming (OOP) format, rather than a messy hodgepodge of one-off Data Science code. Production-ready code means your model can become scalable and act as it would in production.", "My advice to you is that training or practicing how code would work in production rather than a local notebook, is incredibly important. Essentially, you should create code that can be utilized by MLOps Engineers.", "If you are a beginning Data Scientist, this site will seem overwhelming at first. However, it can provide arguably more useful information than educational courses where you have to pay a fee. You will need to have a great sense of certifying that what you see is valid when viewing other accounts on GitHub. Ultimately, you can view pretty much any example of any Data Science process to learn from. There are countless examples here from a diverse group of Data Scientists. There is a sense of community there as well that can lend to new relationships like mentors in Data Science as well.", "On GitHub, you can benefit from learning from a variety of formats:", "I know this tip is considerably general sounding, but I still believe it is important to note and expound upon the methodology and approach a Data Scientist should take. For example, imagine you just graduated and landed your first professional Data Scientist position. You have learned so much from your school and are ready to tackle your day-to-day work. However, you quickly realize that you are unaware of 8 out of the 10 tools you are supposed to be utilizing. You then realize you have to meet with stakeholders across the company as well as nontechnical or non Data Scientist coworkers. This feeling is certainly overwhelming, but it is very normal indeed. What is not taught in schools (for the most part), is that you will have to not only critically think on the fly, but also come up with creative solutions that might not even have to do with strictly Data Science. As an example, you may be required to make a weekly dashboard with Tableau, but it was something you have never come across in your studies. Then, you realize you need to communicate with a Software Engineer to call upon some new data so you can run your first Data Science model. The list goes on and on, and the best way to learn is to not be afraid to not know something.", "You will need to get used to learning new tools, perhaps even new languages, to be a truly cross functional Data Scientist within your company.", "It is not enough to just code in your Jupyter Notebook. What is useful is coming up with features-not feature engineering in the sense of eliminating non-important features, but actually coming up with them in the first place when they are not even in your company database.", "In situations like these you will need to get used to the following:", "Being a Data Scientist means being a scientist of data, as obvious as it sounds, as well as a solutions person. Ultimately, you need to sometimes raise important questions and come up with a solution that incorporates a Machine Learning algorithm.", "Similar to GitHub, Kaggle is a site that has created a community for Data Scientists to share, compete, and learn from one another. A typical project that is shared includes a notebook file that displays code, comments, and plots. There are plentiful examples, and what makes it even better is that some of the competitions are from common products we use every day \u2014 like Netflix. These provide for Data Scientists who have not had the professional experience to learn from people who do. It also allows professional Data Scientists to learn from sharing their code and experiences with use cases from real-world applications. Another unique feature other than the competition feature is the option of the online course. There is plenty to take that includes easy-to-understand code with examples. Kaggle encourages a community through forums as well. You can comment on notebooks, too, in order to dive deeper on the subject as well as collaborate or interact with the author. Lastly, there is the use of data in general. Kaggle actually provides common datasets that will be useful to practice with.", "To sum, here are the beneficial ways of utilizing this site:", "As a Data Scientist, you will become all too familiar with common algorithms like Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. But what happens when you work for a company professionally, and one that is competitive with similar companies. You cannot expect the same Machine Learning algorithm to be the most accurate for the current date. With a professional duty, you need to also see your role as a competitive one. This point means that you should be constantly searching for new Machine Learning algorithms in general, as well as new technologies, methods, packages, and libraries.", "For example, a few years ago, you may have been just using Decision Trees, but the realized Random Forest was even better. You get some great results, but learn that XGBoost is the best at the current time. Being aware of new technologies is important as a Data Scientist. It is not likely that every week someone will just tell you a new improvement or algorithm that just came out. It is up to you to provide the best methods and results for your company.", "As you can see, there are several tips and tricks to employ when working as a Data Scientist. While some are specific, mine were broader to include sub-examples, covering more conceptual tips and tricks. It can be beneficial to know both, but I want to provide a unique group of tips and tricks that can apply to more situations as they are more scalable.", "Here are all of the conceptual tips and tricks to employ as a Data Scientist:", "I hope you found my article both interesting and useful. Please feel to comment and discuss any tips and tricks for Data Science down below, whether that be something specific like tqdm to display your \u2018for loop\u2019 time, or something more broad like reaching out to a mentor. Thank you for reading!", "I am not affiliated with any of these companies.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Sr/MS Data Scientist.
