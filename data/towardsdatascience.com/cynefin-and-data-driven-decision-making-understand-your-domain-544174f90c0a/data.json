I think one important component of failed analytics projects is that companies fail to understand when to use analytical data-driven decision making, and when to use experimental data-driven decision making.", "I claim, companies like Netflix, Airbnb and Zynga are so successful, because they understand these two approaches to \u201cdata-driven\u201d decision making, and excel in the experimental approach, whereas usually, companies focus only on the analytical side. So let\u2019s define them:", "Companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Zynga choose the experimental approach more often\u2026", "Companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Zynga choose the experimental approach more often than other companies as far as I can see. In doing so, they effectively navigate the cynefin framework and decide whether they are on the \u201ccomplex\u201d or \u201ccomplicated\u201d side of things.", "So let\u2019s figure out how you can excel at both approaches as well!", "Let\u2019s consider an architect who builds bridges. He\u2019s 40 and has built 50 bridges in his career so far. Now he decides to think about how to better build bridges in order to make them more sustainable.", "He gathers together his historical (past) data, checks all the bridges he built, checks the weather data, the traffic data and figures out a few things. Using an analytical process, he is able to decompose the deterioration into its main drivers which are:", "Based on his observation, and the knowledge that those underlying causes will probably not change for the foreseeable future, this architect can now make a perfectly data-based decision and build lots of bridges with certain strongholds again either weather (in regions with lots of heavy storms) or against the traffic load where he suspects it.", "That\u2019s an analytical data-driven decision. And it perfectly fits into this domain, one where we do need an expert architect and lots of data to properly analyze & build better bridges, but one where we have \u201cknown unknowns\u201d. We have clear constraints like the typical weather on earth for the next 50 years, everything within those constraints is physics and thus relatively \u201cstable & forecastable\u201d.", "So what kinds of decisions fall into this category? Turns out, while companies like Airbnb are known for an experimental mindset, they do have entire data scientist tracks turned to analytical data-driven decision making.", "Everything that falls into the category of \u201coptimization\u201d is very much in this sector. Operational workflows, Search Engine Optimization, Anything that fits into a 5 sigma mindset. All of those things have clear constraints that we know and are very forecastable.", "The usual day-to-day business of a product owner fits here as well. An example from my experience: My team experienced quite a bit of stress and complained about too much \u201cnoise in the sprint\u201d. We decided to take an analytical approach to this, got a bunch of benchmarks of \u201cnoise\u201d, which in our company apparently is somewhere around 10\u201320%, and got a bunch of data from our sprints. Based on the observations, we were able to reduce the \u201cnoise in the sprint\u201d to under 5\u201310%, a figure that holds pretty well to this date. This is a classical analytical approach.", "The FX (foreign exchange) trader is working in a totally different domain. Imagine a day trader. He takes a bunch of positions, then closes them, analyses the data, the wins and the losses. He then identifies the perfect trade, deduces analytically the main drivers, forecasts them and then makes his next trade.", "Only to see his position turn south\u2026.", "What\u2019s the difference to the architect? The key difference between the architect and the trader is, that the architect can actually deduce cause & effect relations, where the trader can only deduce patterns, and thus has to probe constantly, very much unlike the architect who, once deduced, can build great bridges for the next 20 years, exactly in the same way.", "The architect deduced the cause & effect relation:", "Heavy storms => cause lots of humidity & spray damage => which deteriorates the steel parts of the bridge => which deteriorates the overall state of the bridge.", "The trader cannot. He can, of course, deduce the cause & effect relationship afterward, but he cannot use it to forecast, because things will not be in the same relation in the future, not even the next day. Far from that even.", "So what can the trader do? After all, there are quite a few traders who make money in the markets and even large hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates and Renaissance Technologies who even trade automatically/algorithmically. What the trader can do is deduce patterns. He can continually probe to adjust and refine the patterns which become his trading strategy. Indeed this is somewhat the way Ray Dalio describes the founding story of Bridgewater capital.", "But for that, the trader has not to act, but to probe all the time and act based on the probes. His process is more like this:", "And this is really, what you see in lots of current tech companies.", "The key to experimental data-driven work is to \u201cbuild data into the product\u201d or \u201cbuild feedback into the decision\u201d, and start out with a hypothesis-driven mindset to problem-solving.", "A good example is the NetFlix personalization engine, or really most of today's machine learning products. A machine learning product that has a CD4ML attached to it does exactly this: it experiments, without assuming anything. It deduces patterns and then acts, deploys a new model. No one at NetFlix tries to guess what to recommend to whom, instead they rely on lots of experiments to figure it out.", "Another great example is most of the work the company Zynga does. They \u201cbuild data into every decision\u201d, they even invented a new kind of tracking for their games (ZTrack) to get feedback from their games. In an experiment, they started to let users pay for progress in buildables in their \u201c*Ville\u201d games. They then evaluated the data and realized users weren\u2019t paying for everything, but they would pay for the last part of the progress (that\u2019s a pattern). Based on that insight Zynga optimized the game for buildables that encourage exactly that behavior.", "Of course, prototyping and the very nature of SCRUM or agile are based on this kind of work. Failing to incorporate this into the product will hinder the success of such frameworks at your company. A great example from my work is, that I was missing data about the products we were developing. We started to include a \u201ctrack the users\u201d story into all of our releases. After getting more & more feedback, we through a couple of \u201cprobes\u201d to see how shifting the direction would go, and it turned out pretty well. The new direction of the product is now a totally different one.", "Cynefin is a framework developed by Snowden & Kurz, published in an article in 2003. Cynefin is roughly a framework for determining your \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d. It can be used in a variety of contexts, but we care about the decision making part here.", "The four key takeaways from the Cynefin framework are (for more details, read the paper!):", "Neither the chaotic nor the simple domain are in the realms of data-driven decision making, the complex and complicated however are the two that are of interest to us.", "Parts of your business will fall into the unknown domain, parts will fall into the complex. Snowden & Kurz described a \u201ccontext exercise\u201d in their 2003 paper which will roughly produce something like a map with which you can determine which decisions should be rather analytically data-driven and which one should be experimental data-driven.", "The process for a session is:", "Once you\u2019re here, you know which parts to handle with an experimental approach, and which ones with an analytical one. But wait, you\u2019re doing OKRs? Let\u2019s see how this fits perfectly into this framework.", "So how does this work together with data-based controlling mechanisms? I think it works together great. OKRs as a framework focused on larger objectives for instance, when applied correctly actually leave just the right amount of space for both, analytical and experimental decision making. In the process of formulating an OKR, you simply have to be aware of in which domain you act. Here\u2019s an example:", "A typical sales objective could be:", "Objective analytical: Increase sales revenue for product X by 20%", "KR1: Sales revenue increase by 5% in large company segment", "KR2: 30% increase in small-medium sized company segment", "KR3: Every sales rep contacted 100 customers in Q1 about product X", "KR4: Customer survey reports satisfaction scores of 7,5+ on product X", "If you\u2019ve been running the company for a few years, know the markets, and have a decent sales team, the problem of getting more revenue out of a particular product will probably fall into the complicated domain. You might deduce that to sell such a product you usually have a closing rate of X%, so you can break things down into numbers of customers to be contacted, per segment, and possibly a quality metric in the end.", "On the other hand, if your product is new, you don\u2019t know the markets well, the customers are new, or you\u2019ve made some major changes to it, then this problem will probably fall into the complex domain. The objective changes a bit to incorporate probing & sensing, but the really important change is in the OKR check-in you should do regularly!", "Objective experimental: Increase sales revenue for product X by 20%", "KR1: Every sales rep contacted 10 customers in Week1\u20132 of Q1 about product X", "KR2: Customer survey reports recommendation scores of 7,5+ on product X beta.", "KR3: Every contact is surveyed on pros/cons of the product.", "KR4: We get 500 new customers to use product X", "KR5: Every sales rep contacted 500 customers in Q1", "See the difference? Experimental means we don\u2019t know which segment to focus on, so we simply estimate the new customer numbers (KR4 replaces KR1, KR2). But it means we have to probe, to get tight feedback fast, that\u2019s why we now have KR1 & KR5. For a new product, we want recommendations, not just quality so we changed KR2. KR3 focusses on getting more feedback.", "But the OKR process is not done with this objective! Unlike the \u201cObjective analytical\u201d, in \u201cObjective experimental\u201d we have no idea where to go, which customers to focus on, we don\u2019t even know whether we might need further development efforts for product X. So here we will have bi-weekly check-ins and go & change the KRs, to hopefully at the end of the quarter reach something like the \u201cObjective analytical\u201d, a target group we know, segments that are tight, and reliable numbers. But that needs constant probing & sensing throughout the quarter.", "Now it\u2019s your turn. Do you know which of your problems & decisions fit into the complex or complicated domain? Go ahead and map them out! Do your OKRs cover that difference? Does your approach to data-driven decision making reflect the reality of your domain?", "Your home for data science.
