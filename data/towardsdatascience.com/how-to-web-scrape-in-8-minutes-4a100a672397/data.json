This is what a Web Scraper is and I\u2019m going to show you how you can become one in just 8 minutes.", "Wordometers is a website that provides data on live world statistics, and is the website we are going to scrape. Specifically we are going to scrape world population data that is in a table (seen below). Scraping data from a table is one of the most used forms of web scraping because most often then not the data we need in tables are not downloadable. So instead of getting the data manually we let a computer do it in mere seconds.", "I know it\u2019s a weird name but Beautiful Soup is one of the most powerful web scraping libraries and in my opinion the easiest to learn which is why were going to use it. But first we have to install it.", "To install Beautiful Soup on your computer go to your Anaconda Console (just search up in task bar) and type each of these lines of code separately.", "If something does end up going wrong here\u2019s a link to the documentation that will tell you what is the problem and how to solve it: Beautiful Soup Documentation", "Now that we have the setting up done we can finally start to write the code to scrape the table.", "We start by importing the libraries that we just installed and some others that are needed.", "We then want to get the website that we are scraping the data off of, and to do this we use a function called requests.get() that when inputted a url, we will then have access to the data on the site.", "To see if the request was successful, after running the code with the appropriate url this should pop up.", "If instead it says Response [404] this means it could not give you access to the website and there go you can not scrape the data.", "Now that we have access to the data for the site, we actually have to go get the data. To do this we use a parser that will go through the HTML code of the site and give us all the data on the site.", "The parser will grab all the data on the backend that corresponds to all the data seen on the website", "This is where we will use Beautiful Soup for we will use its \u2018lxml\u2019 parser.", "That soup variable now has all the data from the website. You can see this if you type print(soup) for lines like these will pop up.", "Currently we have all the data on the site, their just in HTML format. So now we must pick apart the HTML to get the data we want which is the data in the table.", "To understand the next part of the code you have to have a brief understanding of the HTML format.", "HTML uses tags to save information and to determine it\u2019s location on a site.", "For example, the purple text at the top that says table is a tag, and everything underneath it is other tags that have data that is inside the table.", "A trick to actually see what piece of HTML code corresponds to a specific piece of data on the page is by clicking right anywhere on the site and pressing inspect.", "This will bring up the HTML of the site which is seen on the right hand side.", "This feature only works in Google Chrome but on the top left hand corner of the HTML box that popped up there is an icon that looks like this.", "When the icon is pressed, you can then click on any piece of information on the site and the HTML that corresponds to that piece of data will be highlighted in blue like seen below.", "Now that we have a brief understanding of the HTML format, were going to use it to get only the tags in the table. We do this by using a function called find(). Find will go through the HTML and only return the HTML that you want to find. Pretty self explanatory.", "Looking at the photo above we see that the table we want corresponds to that table tag and that unique class name (every table has a unique class name to differentiate it from other tables). To get the HTML and data in the table we write\u2026", "We use soup.find because if you remember all the HTML we took from the site we have in the soup variable.", "Now that we only have the HTML and data that we want, we can start to obtain the data and put it in a nice clean dataframe similar to the one on the website.", "Firstly we are going to write a piece of code to get the column headers of the table. These headers have a tag of \u2018th\u2019 and you can see this by pressing the little icon on the top left hand corner just like I showed above, and pressing on any of the headers.", "Since all headers have the same tag, we will loop through each header and just add it to a list. To do this were going to use the find_all() function. Just like the find() function it\u2019s going to find what you\u2019re looking for but now it will return all cases of it.", "The piece of code looks like this \u2026", "The headers variable will be an empty list at first which we will add to. Next line is a for loop that will loop through all the data that has a \u2018th\u2019 tag. In this case only headers have the \u2018th\u2019 tag. That piece of data will be stored in the i variable, and we use i.text to transform the header into a string in python. Finally we add the header into the header list.", "In the end we have a list of all the headers, and we will start to create our dataframe by writing", "This creates an empty dataframe with our list of headers as column names.", "The last step is to get the body of the table. The code used for this is similar to that of getting the headers. Each row in the table corresponds to a \u2018tr\u2019 tag. We will again use the find_all() function to get all the \u2018tr\u2019 tags and rows in the table. The difference here is that were going to use the find_all() function again. This is because we can\u2019t just grab the entire row at once. Inside the \u2018tr\u2019 tags are \u2018td\u2019 tags that actually correspond to the specific data in the row. This is what we need to get.", "Therefore were going to use the find_all() function on the \u2018td\u2019 tags to get all the data in a row.", "Now that we have the data from the row we just need to put it into a list and the line below will do that for us.", "Finally we just add the rows to the dataframe and we are done.", "In the end we created a table that is identical to the one on the site.", "If you find this article useful and are interested in learning Web Scraping, I have a course that teaches you how to go from Complete Beginner to Advanced Web Scraper, and the course teaches you step-by-step how to make money with it.", "Check it out by clicking the link below!", "Your home for data science.
