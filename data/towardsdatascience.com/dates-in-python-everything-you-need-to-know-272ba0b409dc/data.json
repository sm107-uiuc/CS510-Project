The course of time never changed by a single second since the dawn of the universe and we still cannot seem to agree on a global date and time representation. There are ISO, UTC, GMT, EST, BST, ISTs for time that are just so damn confusing for people who just want to know the time in London whenever they want. And, don\u2019t even get me started on Daylight Saving Time which now EU wants to vote against in 2021.", "The same goes for dates. There are so many international \u2018standards\u2019 of date formats, you can almost assign each format to an individual country. This gigantic confusion around dates and times often creeps its way into programming languages too. However, the programming world is a little more organized than the rest of the world. Investing some time and practice into learning about DateTime will prepare you for any time-series related tasks.", "Today, we will talk about date objects in Python through the built-in package datetime.", "Python has built-in data types for different types of data. It offers an individual data type for date objects through the datetime package. Having a special type for dates offers many features such as performing math on dates, converting them to different formats easily which would not be available if you were to work on them as strings.", "We can import functions and methods individually or you can import the package as a whole with dt alias:", "Datetime objects can be created using .date() function. It accepts arguments in the standard YYYY-MM-DD format. After you have a date object, it has many useful properties. You can easily access individual components with attributes of date objects.", "You can also find out the day of the week with a special function:", "The weekdays are numbered from 0 like all things are in Python. So 3 means Thursday. There is also an alternative function for normal weekdays:", "You can also construct date objects from strings which are formatted in ISO standard:", "ISO 8601 standard is the global date format where dates are represented YYYY-MM-DD format. (Always 4-digit years, adding zero to the left for single digit months and days in the \u201cstrings\u201d).", "You can also get today\u2019s date through .date.today():", "Performing math on dates is never easy, not everyone knows which months have 30 or 31 days. But with Python, it is all straightforward with datetime:", "The result of subtracting two dates returns dt.timedelta object which brings us to timedelta sub-module. timedelta deals with all the math under the hood to return correct dates taking into account leap years, days of the months, etc. Suppose, you want to find the weekday after 60 days. How would you do it? Doing this will give an error:", "This is where timedelta objects come in. They can represent a duration of time up to milliseconds by providing necessary arguments. For example, to find the weekday after 60 days, we should create a duration of time of 60 days using timedelta:", "Now, we can use .isoweekday() function to find the weekday:", "So, the weekday will be Monday after 60 days. Here are all the parameters of timedelta:", "Even though you can add minutes, milliseconds, and microseconds, timedelta rounds everything up to a duration representing only days, seconds, and microseconds. So, what will be the date after 2017 years, 311 days, 23 hours, 53 minutes (all prime):", "After you have a timedelta object, you can only access it as days or seconds:", "Even though date objects are easy to work with, when saving dates or use dates as filenames, or do similar operations, you have to convert them to strings. There are a number of methods depending on your needs. The first one is converting dates to ISO 8601 standard:", "Having dates as ISO 8601 strings are very useful. For example, if you have dates in YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601) format, they will be sorted alphabetically. They can also be interpreted easily by many programming languages and softwares. Saving dates in ISO 8601 formatted strings will reduce the time it takes to clean data and help interpret ambiguous dates like \u201c04\u201311\u201307\u201d.", "You can also get the literal representations of dates:", "The above two methods are all standards. What if you want dates in completely different or custom formats? We can use .strftime to convert dates to basically any format. strftime takes a format string with special code letters to represent date components in different ways. Here are the most common ones:", "You can choose an arbitrary text:", "This article was only about dates and their representations. Do not confuse date objects with time objects. Hopefully, I will cover how to work with them in future articles, too. Stay tuned!", "Loved this article and, let\u2019s face it, its bizarre writing style?
