However, when it comes to production deployments many factors play a role: costs, performance, explainability, bias, speed. Here we examine practical tradeoffs in machine learning deployments as applied to cybersecurity.", "One of the biggest opportunities in cybersecurity right now is a comprehensive mapping of vulnerabilities (CVEs) to the MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae framework. Below, we explain what is MITRE ATT&CK/CVE, the size of the business opportunity and benchmark the current competitors mapping CVEs to MITRE ATT&CK. We will use a simple analogy of house robbery to make the article more accessible.", "Analogy: To use an example, it turns out that most house robberies start by entering not through the house door but the side window. Armed with that information and the awareness that I\u2019ve left 3 open windows in my house helps me to prioritize my defense strategy. First off, I should close the windows.", "\u201cMITRE ATT&CK\u00ae is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.\u201d\u2014 attack.mitre.org", "Analogy: In other words, MITRE ATT&CK would be the playbook of steps that robbers would take in order to rob a house. (Identify unoccupied houses. Determine the access route to a window. Find the valuables etc.)", "\u201cA CVE is a dictionary that provides definitions for publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures. The goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, databases, and services) with these definitions. CVE Entries are comprised of an identification number, a description, and at least one public reference.\u201d \u2014 cve.mitre.org", "Analogy: In the case of our house robbery analogy, vulnerabilities are the weaknesses in your house security: unlocked door, broken cameras, your birthday as the safe password", "Why would you map CVEs to MITRE ATT&CK?", "When you have multiple vulnerabilities, how should you allocate your time and resources? By combining knowledge of your situation (CVE) and understanding of most commonly followed criminal practices (MITRE), you can assign a risk factor and act accordingly. However, currently, only 4% of CVEs are manually mapped to MITRE ATT&CKs thus leaving the security professionals unable to prioritize CVE\u2019s based on their role in the attack chain. As various APT (hackers) used different paths in the ATT&CK framework some controls can have a disproportionate impact given current vulnerabilities (CVEs) in your system.", "Analogy: Knowing that your house has a broken camera and open windows, allows you to prioritize closing the windows since most attackers would use them to break in. However, if the relationship between your situation (CVE) and attacker protocol (MITRE) is off by 5%, you might prioritize a safety action less likely to prevent robbery.", "Here are 6 competitive approaches based on price, speed, and quality.", "Summary: There is no one good vendor. Manual mapping of attacks seen in the wild gives a small list of roughly 4000 CVEs with high accuracy. Heuristics are scalable to all 100k CVEs with strong model interpretability. An advantage of machine learning techniques is that they perform well for newly emerging CVEs not previously seen by heuristics.", "Conclusion: Choosing the best depends on 1) your specific circumstance and 2) evolves over time as new CVE\u2019s are released. Our meta-APIs meet both of these needs. We find your best fit the first time and continue to reassess as new APIs are released (all without your concerted effort).", "If you have your own solution to map CVE/MITRE ATT&CK, please contact us to be included in the continuous benchmarking, or share your own model API with hi@kindlyanswer.me. You will receive 90% of the revenue we make from it and you keep your intellectual property as we don\u2019t require code submission. If you are a vendor that displays CVEs in their product, review these APIs to improve your product and mapping accuracy and contact hi@kindlyanswer.me to unlock more details. (purchase the model code from one of the vendors, buy a data dump, receive your API keys or login credentials for unlimited requests)Appendix", "To promote the transparency of our work, we share a subset of our validation data in our GitHub. You can always contribute to it with a push request. To avoid fraud by the vendors we use a carefully curated holdout data set for the actual benchmarking.", "Your home for data science.
