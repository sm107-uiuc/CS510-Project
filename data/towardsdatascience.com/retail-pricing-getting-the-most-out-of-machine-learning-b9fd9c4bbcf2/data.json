Simply put, traditional methods are not good enough anymore. It is true that they are still working well enough to let you survive, but they are insufficient to put you ahead of tech-savvy competition. In this article, I\u2019d like to cover two things as Competera\u2019s price optimization expert: the tremendous potential of machine learning in retail dynamic pricing, and how you can get ready for the adoption of the technology to take advantage of every opportunity it provides.", "Big names have been using machine learning in dynamic pricing for years. Among the brightest examples is Amazon, which was among one of the earliest adopters of the technology. This was, for sure, one of the factors which contributed to the company\u2019s stellar growth in the market value: from 30 billion in 2008 to almost 1 trillion in 2019. Other players using machine learning include Walmart, Jet, and Newegg.", "What makes the algorithms so efficient and popular? It is their ability to process massive amounts of data and enable humans to make real-time precise decisions. Today the retail market is getting increasingly dynamic, which means retailers need to change prices more frequently than ever before. At the same time, every business wants to craft optimal prices for every one of its products. Two major issues make price optimization difficult without ML:", "Tackling these two obstacles seems unyielding for humans \u2014 and is increasingly outsourced to self-learning algorithms. The algorithms process the infinite number of pricing scenarios (which equals the number of atoms in the universe) to choose the most relevant one in real time. They take into account thousands of latent relationships inside a product portfolio in order to recommend individual prices that altogether maximize sales and revenue of the entire portfolio.", "I\u2019ve gathered several examples of the machine learning-based price optimization case studies to better understand how retailers use it to grow.", "Goal: To boost revenue and sales across over 100 price zone", "Goal: To maximize revenue without losing profit margin", "Results: A 16% revenue growth, a 14% sales uplift", "Goal: To boost all sales KPIs", "So, self-learning algorithms in pricing can be extremely beneficial for your KPIs. What steps do you need to take to be ready for them?", "There are four stages which you have to go through to deploy algorithm-based pricing solutions and make the most of them: to prepare all the necessary data, choose a provider or build an internal pricing system, teach your team, and improve the system every step of the way.", "Surprisingly, preparing and collecting data can be a big challenge since the data is often unstructured, stored in different sources and has many errors. Getting it ready can take several weeks or even months. In some cases, it would be even better to hire a contractor that is good at data management. But the good news is: you need to do it only once. Even if you are planning to use machine learning to automate all business processes, like logistics, inventory management, or dynamic pricing and bring them together into a single ecosystem, you need to prepare your data just at the beginning, as it will have a more or less similar structure regardless of whether you use it to adopt ML in pricing or logistics.", "Imagine that you have your core competence \u2014 something which differentiates you from competitors and increases profit/revenue. But in addition to that, you need to be good at dozens of other things which are at the periphery of your core competence. For example, you manage to offer customers low prices and are a virtuoso of beneficial purchase prices, however, your profits depend not only on low purchase prices but also on optimal shelf prices. Therefore you need to learn to craft prices which are neither too low, nor too high. Being able to do this is a whole new skill which requires a heavy investment of several million dollars in R&D.", "There are two options you can choose from in this scenario:", "When it comes to pricing, retailers need to know exactly which products are better to use machine learning algorithms or rule-based pricing for. How can you know that? It is essential to analyze your portfolio and indicate three groups of items:", "Once your pricing system is ready, it\u2019s high time to train your pricing or category managers. They need to understand what they are working with and accept that the logic behind every price recommendation provided by algorithms is not always clear. Basically, they need to learn to trust algorithms bearing in mind that there is always a way to put limitations to algorithms or test their suggestions before using them. At the same time, managers need to be aware that algorithms mostly come up with the right decisions: the system would perform even better if it knew everything your managers know. So, when coupled with the managers\u2019 expertise, algorithms show much better results.", "You need to come up with a strategy and provide the pricing system with a set of goals it needs to hit within this strategy. You should monitor how the system proceeds and make corrections along the way. If your goals and strategy have changed, you need to adjust your pricing system accordingly.", "On a separate note, the pricing system you use always has to be as cutting-edge as possible. Again you can either hire a technological provider that is responsible for its solution to be up-to-date or create a dedicated team to monitor all the technological advancements in machine learning and incorporate them into your system.", "All-in-all, what I wanted to emphasize in this long-read is that machine learning can be a truly advantageous option for retailers which seek not only to survive, but thrive. To benefit from it, you need to do four things:", "Your home for data science.
