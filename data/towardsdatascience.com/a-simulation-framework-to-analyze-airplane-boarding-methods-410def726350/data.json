Lower academic grades are denoted by C. Complicated, lower-level programming languages are named C. However, the C that scared me most on a fine winter morning was on my boarding pass \u2014 Southwest boarding group C.", "For those unfamiliar with Southwest Airlines\u2019 boarding process, you are assigned one of three groups (A, B or C) when you check-in. Group A boards first, then B and finally C. Every person is given a number in the queue (for example, A-10 or B-25) and enters the airplane according to the number in the respective group. You can fathom my frustration when I was assigned the number C-10 for my flight.", "I was thus one of the last few to board the flight. The time that I had on hand while boarding groups A and B were being let in I spent in sad and quiet contemplation. I had never really given much thought to how airlines chose to board their airplanes but that day I did. I wondered about the possibility of analyzing the boarding procedure and comparing the performance of various methods.", "If you were given an airplane and a few hundred volunteers and were asked to test the performance of a boarding method, what would you do? Simple! Assign them seats, line them up, fill the airplane and measure the time it takes for the process to complete.", "But I don\u2019t own an airplane and I don\u2019t think I can convince a few hundred people to waste their precious time just to satisfy my ebullient curiosity. So I considered doing the exact same thing but on a computer (which can\u2019t complain).", "The main idea can be broken down into the following five points:", "Now that we have defined the raw idea, let us try to translate this to an algorithm and implement it in code.", "Before we start writing the code, we need to define a few things based on heursitics like passenger speeds and movement rules.", "Let us assume that the time required for the average person to move from one seat to the other in the aisle is 1. Be aware that we are not defining any units here (like s or min). You can consider this to be non-dimensional time.", "If we assign a time of 1 to all passengers, the model will be less applicable to real-life since everyone has their own different speeds. To make it realistic, we can sample the time of aisle movement from a Gaussian distribution (or bell-curve) with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.2 (this is arbitrary, can be changed). Therefore, we can account for variability in speeds of passengers.", "When a passenger arrives at their designated row, they will first stow their luggage in the overhead bin and then move on to their seat. This takes up some time and causes the passengers behind to come to a stop. Let us assume that this time is equal to 2 (twice the time it takes to move).", "Regarding rules of movement from aisle to seat, there are 6 possible scenarios:", "The time it takes to move from the aisle to the respective seat depends on which of these scenarios is applicable. For a window seat, it is faster to move in if the adjoining seats are vacant. Otherwise the people in the adjoining seats have to first come out in the aisle, let the passenger in and then go back to their own positions. All this can take up a significant chunk of time in the boarding process.", "Thus, counting how many steps it would take for each passenger involved in each of these scenarios, we can define a set of multipliers that when multiplied with a passenger\u2019s movement time, gives the time it takes to move to a particular seat.", "We define the multipliers as follows (adding 2 to every multiplier to account for stowing luggage):", "We are now ready to begin with the algorithm and code.", "We will go through the implementation of the above ideas in a Jupyter notebook. Snippets of code are posted below and the link to the whole Jupyter notebook is given at the end.", "We will only need the scipy module for the simulation so we start by importing that.", "Note: Additional features like visualization will require plotting tools like matplotlib but that is not covered in this demonstration. For visualization, refer to \u2018Note on visualization\u2019 at the end of the article.", "First, we need to initialize a lot of parameters and arrays/matrices to store all the passenger data. Since Southwest Airlines usually uses a Boeing 737, we shall include the specifications of that in our model. It has 23 rows and 6 columns.", "We will be using a lot of dictionaries to keep track of things. All the passengers will be allotted a unique identification number (say UIN) from 0 to 137 and that will act as a key for our dictionaries. The variables defined below perform the following functions:", "The moveto arrays and dictionaries will be explained in a later section.", "Before the passengers enter the aisle, they need to have seats allotted. The order of seat allotment depends on the boarding method. For example, a Back-To-Front board order will have different seat assignments as compared to a Random order.", "We\u2019ll take a look at two different seat assignments here (for more, refer to Jupyter Notebook at the end of article). We will define a function here that takes in the row and column arrays (empty), a string specifying the allotment type, number of passengers and number of rows (the last two pre-defined). The first order defined here is Super Ideal Not Practical (SINP) and the second is a random order.", "We\u2019ll take a look at various different boarding methods and their results at the end but for now, SINP involves filling of all windows first, then all middles and then all aisles such that there is absolutely no time wasted in seat shuffling. It is (almost) as ideal as boarding methods could be. Random is quite self-explanatory \u2014 seat allotment is random.", "Things to understand in the code:", "It can be quite difficult to define a seating order since it essentially involves encoding of a 2D seat map to a 1D passenger queue. There are multiple ways of doing it and the code below represents one of the possible methods. You are free to try out your own orders and methods to define them.", "Now that we have defined the function to assign seats, it is time to use it to create our passenger queue. For the purposes of this demonstration, we shall go with random.", "Furthermore, we need to assign movement times for each passenger (based on a Gaussian distribution) and also define our multipliers.", "We also need to encode all this information into dictionaries so that the time and seat allocation for each passenger is easily available based on their UIN.", "Finally, we need to define what is termed here as sum_time. Each passenger has to move from the passenger queue outside to the aisle when their time comes. That will essentially be when the sum of times of the passengers ahead of them has elapsed. You will see then that we need to define an array in which every element is equal to the sum of the current passenger\u2019s time as well as the times of those ahead of him/her.", "Our passenger queue is ready outside the airplane. Before we start boarding, we need to define their movement from the queue outside to the aisle inside. This can be done by defining a simple function to carry out this task. This function checks whether the sum_time for a passenger has elapsed. If it has (and the first position in the aisle is empty), then it copies the passenger\u2019s UIN into the aisle and deletes the same from the passenger queue. Thus, the passenger queue will get shorter as time progresses and eventually be vacant.", "This is the most complex part of the code because it involves nesting a lot of if-conditions and playing with dictionaries.", "The basic idea is to assign moves to passengers, either to a position ahead of them in their aisle or to their seat (if they have reached that row) and when the time comes, \u2018play the move\u2019 by moving the passenger like a chess piece. Every passenger will move forward in the aisle after a time equal to their movement time and will move into a seat after a time equal to their movement time multiplied by the appropriate multiplier.", "The algorithm exit condition is as follows: the sum of the UINs of all the passengers in the seat map must match the sum of the UINs of all the passengers in the initial passenger queue outside the airplane.", "The code wall below might look very long daunting but there are comments after almost every step for explanation.", "The code given in the article can only run the boarding procedure once for one boarding method. If this process is repeated many times, an average time (and an error equal to standard deviation) can be calculated for each boarding method. This was done for six different methods and their times were compared. Each boarding method simulation was run 20 times.", "Method: Board all windows first, then the middles and finally the aisles. However, this must be done such that the first passenger goes to the last row, the second to the second-last row and so on to ensure that there is no time wasted standing in the aisle.", "Method: This is similar to SINP, but the windows, middles and aisles are boarded randomly such that some time is wasted in the aisle. This method is used by some airlines like United\u00b9.", "Method: Board randomly with no specific scheme or order.", "Method: Well, there is no \u2018Southwest method\u2019 because open seating means you can take whatever seat you want. However, I did observe a specific pattern on my flight(s) with Southwest that arises due to passenger preferences. Usually, the window and aisle seats in the front of the airplane are filled, then those at the back. Following that, all the middle seats are filled from front to back (the hate for airplane middle seats seems to be universal and thus lends a certain pattern to the Southwest boarding process).", "Method: Board in three groups with the first group occupying the last third of the airplane and the last group occupying the first third. This is the method that most airlines use to board the economy class\u00b9.", "Method: Did you understand BTF? Just reverse it. It sounds like a terrible idea right? This is how the first-class, business-class and very-special-super-premium-executive-class seating is done.", "A few observations and relevant conclusions:", "The SINP method seems to be the epitome of perfection (although not at all practical). However, there is actually an even faster theoretical method defined in a research article by Jason Steffen\u00b3 that is called the Steffen method. You can read more about it from the link at the end of the article.", "The visuals in this article have been produced by capturing the seat map matrix after every few iterations and making an imshow plot using matplotlib. However, I have not included the code in the article since it does not involve any algorithmic complexity, rather just a few plotting tricks.", "I\u2019ve written a generalized program that solves for any method (multiple times if need be) and plots an animation which can be saved. You can view it on GitHub and download it.", "If you want to view the Jupyter Notebook of the simulation, click here.", "An interesting video on the topic: \u201cThe Better Boarding Method Airlines Won\u2019t Use\u201d (CGP Grey on YouTube), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHbLRjF0vo&vl=en", "Disclaimer: The motivation behind this article and analysis is pure curiosity and not an attempt to prove the superiority of any one method over another.", "If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, you can email me or contact me on Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
