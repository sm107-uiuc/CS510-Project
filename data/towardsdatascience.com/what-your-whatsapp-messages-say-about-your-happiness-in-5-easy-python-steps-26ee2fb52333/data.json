Whilst I\u2019ve been running sentiment analysis and other text analytics across other platforms for a number of years, I wanted to expand my learning and explore running it in Python, which is a language I\u2019m newer to.", "Hopefully, this can be used as a guide for anyone who is also relatively new to sentiment analysis.", "It\u2019s sometimes pointed out to me that I\u2019m quite a negative person. Not to sound negative, but I strongly disagree.", "So I thought I\u2019d put this to the test and run sentiment analysis on my WhatsApp group conversations, to see how I compare with friends/family when it comes to happiness. Here are the steps I took if you\u2019re following along to \u201cfind your own happiness\u201d:", "This is surprisingly easy. Click on the group name and hit export (shown below). It will download a Zip, which when extracted gives you a .txt file.", "Flair is a natural language processing (NLP) library developed and open-sourced by Zalando Research. I won\u2019t go into full detail here, other than say the reason I chose to use it is that it\u2019s simple to use, and includes ready to use sentiment analysis. There are plenty of other blogs out there as to why it\u2019s a good one to use.", "The .txt file will need a quick bit of parsing into separate columns. I\u2019m just extracting \u2018date\u2019, \u2018person\u2019, and \u2018message\u2019 here:", "Before doing any sentiment analysis, we want to get rid of any rows that we don\u2019t want to pass downstream for sentiment. This might include any NULLS but also any short response messages (e.g. \u201cOk\u201d, \u201cLol\u201d, or \u201cThanks\u201d). Also, in order to do any time series analysis down the line, it would make sense to turn our date field into an actual date data type:", "I\u2019m using flair_sentiment.predict() to provide labels that will tell us whether values are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE, as well as a score 0 to 1 how confident the prediction is.", "Time to quickly see the results. You can now start running visualisations directly here in Python, or move into Tableau like I have below.", "Clearly I\u2019m not the most negative. I\u2019m thrilled.", "I\u2019ve \u2018anonymised\u2019 names here for the sake of any screenshots, but my personal favourite here is the person on the bottom left of the scatter: someone who hardly speaks up, but when they do, it\u2019s some of the most negative stuff the group receives. Thanks for the input.", "Also apparent is that actually none of us are particularly positive, which came as no surprise. The only real exception to this was in May, likely because this was the time it was announced that sport was starting again (which is the topic mostly discussed in this group).", "I\u2019ve chosen to share this because I couldn\u2019t find very many simple sentiment analysis examples to work from in Python. Hopefully it\u2019s of use to anyone else that\u2019s new to Python too.", "Equally, I definitely welcome any feedback or tips to improve anything outlined here.", "Your home for data science.
