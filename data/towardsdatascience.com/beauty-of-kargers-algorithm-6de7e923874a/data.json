Let\u2019s start with networks. We like dense networks, otherwise even if a very single edge or wire is disconnected, a large portion of the network can be down \u2014 a situation definetely not desired ! There are generally clusters, unevenly distributed segments, within networks. While dealing with separation of these segments or \u201cclusters\u201d efficiently, we look for edges between them such that the number of edges are minimum.", "We can apply the same argument to other fields, such as \u2018Image Segmentation\u2019. If you want to break an image into segments, easiest way is to break links with low affinity, i.e. minimum number of cuts. Think of A polygon mesh. A polygon mesh is the collection of vertices, edges, and faces that make up a 3D object. Breaking images links with low affinity can give you separate distinct images.", "Also think of underground lines! So many nodes (stations) and edges (railways)! If you wanna split the tube system into two, what will be the minimum number of lines to be disconnected?", "As you see, there are many real-life min-cut issues. How do we deal with them? A traditional algorithm is \u2018max-flow min-cut\u2019. It is deterministic, which means when we apply this algo, we get the right min-cut 100% of the time! No failure probability! Downside is that 100% guarantee comes with a cost: it is very slow. The runtime at best is O(number of vertices * number of edges squared, so roughly an order of n\u00b3 time complexity.", "There are many clever algos, which are very fast with a runtime of O(n\u00b2), but none of them, even superior ones, in my opinion, is as elegantly designed as Karger\u2019s algorithm, which use \u2018random sampling\u2019 in a graph problem!!", "If you are familiar with the Quick Sort algorithm, you already know the effectiveness of random sampling in sorting and searching. A PhD student in early 90\u2019s, David Karger, devised the Random Contraction Algorithm for min-cut case by using randomness in graph problems. As being a Monte Carlo algorithm, Krager\u2019s Algorithm offers a solution with a certain (albeit small) probability with a lot faster approach than max-flow min-cut algorithm.", "So, say we have an undirected graph G = (V, E). In order to cut a connected graph G into two connected subgraphs in as few cuts as possible, the algo basically uses contraction of an edge. To implement it, one should pull together two vertices on two sides of the edge.", "We implement the algo in pseudo code as follows:", "Now comes the question: What is the probability of success?", "In a graph with n vertices, a single run of Karger\u2019s algorithm gives the result with a success probability of 1 / (n choose 2) and a runtime of O(n\u00b2). Not bad, but one needs to be lucky to find the min cut edge in the first run.", "The probability of success can be increased by doing multiple runs. If we run Karger\u2019s algorithm n\u00b2 times, the probability of failure that we don\u2019t get a minimum cut is 1/e. A constant! It doesn\u2019t depend on the number of vertices!", "However, if we run Karger\u2019s algorithm n\u00b2 ln (n) times, which is regarded as the optimal value, then P(fail) <= 1/n, and P(success) >= 1\u20131/n, which means as you get bigger bigger graph , the probability of success of Karger\u2019s algorithm gets better! So, in a graph with 50 nodes, if we run the algorithm around 10,000 times, the probability of success is 98% !!", "Such a good success rate of 98% comes with a cost though. The running time is polynomial in n (the number of vertices) and m (the number of edges), which is pretty slow: O(n\u00b2m).", "A slightly altered version, Karger-Stein algorithm, has twice the success probability as the original algorithm!!", "Python code for Karger\u2019s algo is as follows:", "By the way, if you want to learn a bit more, I recommend you watch the youtube video of Stanford Algorithms.", "Your home for data science.
