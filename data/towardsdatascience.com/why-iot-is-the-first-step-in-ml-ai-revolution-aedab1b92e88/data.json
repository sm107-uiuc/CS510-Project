And that is Internet-of-Things or simply IoT.", "Let\u2019s understand the fundamentals of ML and how it transforms any process. Take the example of an online streaming service like Netflix. Based on your watching history, it will recommend the shows & movies you should watch next.", "Before such a recommendation engine, we were used to deciding based on the ratings. Ratings though do a good job in differentiating absurd cinema from good ones, it doesn\u2019t really help much on whether you would enjoy a movie or not. You might love a 6-star rated movie but wouldn\u2019t enjoy an 8-star rated.", "Since Netflix has millions of users watching content over its platform, they have humongous data where users explicitly (thumbs up and down) and implicitly (watching the complete series, clicking on a particular poster of the same movie or another) tell whether they like some movie or not, Netflix based on that data it personalizes the recommendations for you (Not for some critics).", "Netflix also predicts based on your watching history and millions of others, what each user would be watching, and then caches (loads in advance) to the nearest data center to those users. Netflix also needs to process lots of Media processing (Video conversions in different formats & resolutions for different devices), which is a costly process. So it optimizes that cost by predicting the future server loads again based on the historical data of the server loads available and allocates these tasks to the underutilized resources.", "So you would see Machine Learning has introduced personalization to each user (which wasn\u2019t possible before) and also optimized all the processes for a much superior efficiency and better utilization of resources available.", "The data they had accumulated of customer's behavior and their resource usages accumulated over a period of time.", "Only with the sufficiently large and relevant data, they were able to achieve all this.", "But Netflix and all other platforms have a very unique advantage. Since there complete ecosystem is digital, all their data is collected continuously and any personalization/recommendations can be served. All its resources are digital and are monitored and controlled in real-time. But that is not the case with most of the processes around you.", "Your life is not limited to the digital devices that you use. In fact, most of your activities are outside that screen.", "For ML and AI to be truly revolutionary, it has to transform the processes around you. It has to create value in each aspect of your life, not just the digital life.", "To understand it further let\u2019s consider one of the most important aspects of your life: Transportation.", "For decades humans are driving cars on their own and then came a company that wanted to change it. If you have been living under the rock, that company is Tesla. They had a vision of creating self-driving cars without any need for human intervention using AI and ML.", "But unlike Netflix, driving isn\u2019t something confined in the digital world only. In fact, most cars didn\u2019t even come anywhere near to the digital ecosystem. The most important ingredient i.e. data was missing.", "That\u2019s where Internet-of-Things comes into play. The very first step towards self-driving cars was building a car that collects the various driving data and can be controlled digitally. This new digital car will collect surroundings data using radar, activities of a human driver, operational data of various parts of the car. This data will be used to develop an autonomous driving system and then to continuously improving the system.", "This digitalization of cars was enabled by IoT. The additional hardware (sensors, processors, and digital controllers) put in the car to bridge the gap between the digital world and the physical world is the core of IoT.", "Just like the dream of a self-driving car could not be achieved without the first IoT enabling the car, the same way a dream of transforming most of the industries with AI can\u2019t be achieved without IoT enabling the processes and products of the industries first.", "IoT enabling itself provides lots of value without the need for AI and ML, but it does take things a step further.", "If this interests you and you want to start an IoT project, this will help you get started", "Your home for data science.
