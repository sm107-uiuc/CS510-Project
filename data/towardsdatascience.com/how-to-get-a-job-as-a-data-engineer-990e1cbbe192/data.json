You get to work with a variety of interesting data, cutting-edge technologies, as well as with diverse teams of data professionals and domain experts. The entire field of data engineering is relatively new. As a data engineer, your role is crucial to the company\u2019s success \u2014 many data professionals, including data analysts and data scientists, rely on you in order to do their work. You are responsible to equip them with data that is always available, reliable, and in a proper structure.", "The companies need you to make informed decisions based on real data and KPIs generated from it. And they are willing to pay you well if you are good at it! Let\u2019s look at what skills are in high demand, what factors play a large role in future career prospects, and how to approach the technical interview.", "Overall, it\u2019s usually hard to give any truly general advice but I summarize the skills that seem to be the most relevant, from what I saw being mentioned numerous times in job ads and from my experience in the field.", "It\u2019s considered best to aim for being a generalist (the horizontal bar in T) in the sense that you understand the general concepts of databases, cloud computing, data warehousing, big data, and that you know at least some basics of SQL, Python, Docker, and creating ETL.", "At the same time, you should have stronger skills in at least one particular area (the vertical bar in T). For instance, you might be really good at writing Spark or Dask data manipulations or you may have some particular domain knowledge required by the company you apply for, which sets you apart from other applicants.", "In many cases, knowing SQL well + basics of Python, Linux and AWS can already get you to a fairly-paid junior position.", "Cloud computing revolutionized and changed many industries. As a data engineer, you need to know the most important services for storage, compute, networking, and databases. If you don\u2019t know much about those, I highly recommend learning Amazon Web Services \u2014 even if you would end up using Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure, the concepts learned from AWS can be easily applied when switching to a different cloud vendor since many services across cloud vendors are analogous and their concepts are virtually the same (ex. block storage vs object storage vs NFS).", "If you are new to AWS, following this link, you can find great free courses on AWS \u2014 they are all offered directly from AWS. You don\u2019t need to pay for the extra certificate \u2014 from my experience, recruiters and engineering managers don\u2019t really care that much about certifications. They want people with hands-on experience who know a lot and can apply it to business problems.", "The most important AWS services for a data engineering position are:", "Additionally, it\u2019s good to know AWS Lambda (serverless Function as a Service), ECS & EKS (running containers at scale), Amazon Redshift (cloud data warehouse), Athena (serverless query engine to query S3 data lake), and AWS Kinesis or Amazon MSK (both are used for real-time streaming data). But you can focus on the ones presented in the bulleted list first. The courses from Edx explain most of them. Plus, remember to practice: with AWS free tier you get (limited) access to those basic services so that you can play around and learn by doing.", "Being a data engineer is a lot about integrating data from various sources, bringing it to a form appropriate for analysis, and then loading to some data lake or data warehouse. You should have some experience in creating ETL. It doesn\u2019t mean that you must have worked at Big Data project for some large companies \u2014 even your self-driven projects shared on Github or in a blog post can get you far in the application process and make you stand out from the crowd.", "One of the main responsibilities of data engineers is to ensure that the data is always available, reliable, and in a proper structure. To achieve this, you need to schedule and monitor your data pipelines. Many companies use workflow management systems such as Apache Airflow or Prefect for this purpose, so knowing one of them may significantly improve your chances of getting a great data engineering job. If you want to learn more about those, read my previous stories, such as this one \u2014 in that article, I\u2019m demonstrating how to easily set up a workflow management system with a serverless Kubernetes cluster on AWS.", "If you work with Python, you know that your code may suddenly no longer work because you upgraded to a new pandas version. Containerization is key, being able to work with containerized workloads is one of the most crucial and most in-demand skills in (any) engineering jobs, as it makes your code self-contained, dependency-free and let you deploy your code to virtually any environment.", "This goes together with being a T-shaped professional: you should know the basics of data warehousing, data lakes, Big Data, REST APIs, and databases. It would be rather disappointing to fail at explaining the 3Vs of Big Data or data warehouse characteristics during your job interview. Additionally, it\u2019s worth knowing the architectural components. For instance, in this post, I discuss data warehouse architectures and key considerations when migrating to the cloud.", "This goes without saying: with technologies evolving so fast, it\u2019s crucial that you are a self-directed learner and that you are willing to continuously learn and experiment with new tools. It doesn\u2019t mean that you need to follow every hype, but rather that you stay open-minded.", "Programming doesn\u2019t mean that you must be a \u201chacker\u201d and you need to spend all days doing nothing else but writing code. It\u2019s rather about being able to learn quickly and to know how to write good abstractions. In the field of data engineering, this means that you know how to create code that is DRY (Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself), meaning: you don\u2019t copy-and-paste the same code from one script to another, but you know how to write functions or classes in a modular and reusable way. Clean code that can be reused, extended and parametrized, is easy to maintain and will save you and others time.", "To give you an example: I once worked for a company, where there has been almost no modularity in place. In almost every Python project, people were copying over the same code to establish logging, connect to a data warehouse and load some data to and from it, or to establish an S3 client and download a CSV file from some S3 bucket. To improve this, I created a Python package:", "This package saved us all a lot of time in the long run and made the codebase much cleaner.", "If you are a Python-beginner, you don\u2019t need to learn how to create packages. At first, it may be enough if you can write good Python functions and if you know how to work with basic packages for data manipulation such as Pandas.", "Many companies also look for data engineers who know Scala, Java, R, or C (or any other language you can think of) \u2014 regardless of the programming language, you can get a much better job if you understand the basic data types for working with data, as well as the principles of functional programming and modularity.", "Being able to work with the Linux operating system and interacting with it by using bash commands is one of the most crucial skills that will make you much more efficient.", "Many frameworks and cloud services work in such a way that we define our resources and services via a declarative language (such as Dockerfile or Kubernetes YAML files), which can then be deployed via Command Line Interface (CLI). This paradigm is often known as Infrastructure as Code. For instance, AWS CLI allows you to provision an entire cluster of resources simply by submitting bash commands to the AWS API. Other cloud providers (such as GCP or Azure) offer similar command-line interfaces.", "Some may expect a data engineer to be a person who is doing nothing but writing ETL and crunching numbers. But in every job, it pays off to have skills that complement your profile. Imagine that you have two candidates:", "Which one would you hire? Many companies would pick the latter. Employers look for well-rounded individuals who also have important soft skills such as project management, public speaking, documenting, or great at moderating and organizing events.", "Salaries in data engineering jobs vary depending on the location, industry, required skills, and level of experience. Below, I list the 7 most important factors that determine salary and future growth. Some of them are obvious, but others may surprise you:", "I heard about cases when an applicant couldn\u2019t answer in a phone interview the question about what the company he or she applied at is doing. Also, questions like: tell me about yourself and why do you want to switch to a new company are so common that it\u2019s good to think about it in advance.", "Additionally, if you plan to apply, you should be prepared for some (basic) technical questions. Many data engineering managers ask to design a star schema based on some situation or give you some coding questions like what are SQL window functions, generators, broadcasting, or list comprehensions in Python, what is the difference between Docker image and Docker container, or how would you go about creating a Docker image and running a Docker container.", "And lastly, believe in yourself and stay confident.", "In this article, we discussed what data engineering skills are currently in high demand and what do you need to know if you look for an entry-level position in this field. We also listed factors that play a large role in data engineering career prospects and how to prepare for the interview. I hope you might find some of this helpful.
