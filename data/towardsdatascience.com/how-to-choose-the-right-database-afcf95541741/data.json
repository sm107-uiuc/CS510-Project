Otherwise, choosing the wrong DB might come as an obstacle when the project grows and is sometimes painful to fix. Even if you are working on a mature project, that uses specific DB for a while, it\u2019s important to know its limitations and identify when you should add another type of DB to your stack (it is very common to combine several DBs).", "A bonus reason for understanding the different DBs and their properties is that it\u2019s quite a common question in job interviews!", "In this post we will review the 2 main types of databases:\u2022 Relational Databases (SQL based).\u2022 NoSQL Databases.We will go over the different types of NoSQL DBs and when to use each one.And finally, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Relational vs. NoSQL DBs.This post will not include a comparison between the different products offered for each type of database (e.g. MySQL vs. MS SQL Server).", "TL;DR: if you are looking for a quick cheat sheet, skip to the end of the post.", "This DB consists of a collection of tables (like CSV tables), that are connected. Each row in a table represents a record.", "Why is it called relational? What are the \u2018relations\u2019 that exist in this DB?Let \u2019s say you have a table of students information, and a table of the course grades (course, grade, student id), every grade row relates to a student record.See diagram below, where the value in the \u2018Student ID\u2019 column points to rows in the \u2018Students\u2019 table by the value of their \u2018ID\u2019 column.", "All relational DBs are queried with SQL-like languages, which are commonly used and inherently support join operations.They allow the indexing of columns for faster queries based on those columns.", "Because of its structured nature, the relational DB\u2019s schema is decided before inserting data.", "Common relational databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server", "While in relational DBs everything is structured to rows and columns, in NoSQL DBs there is no common structured schema for all records. Most of the NoSQL databases contain JSON records, and different records can include different fields.", "This family of databases should actually be called \u201cNot mainly SQL\u201d \u2014 since many NoSQL DBs support querying using SQL, but using it is not the best practice for them.", "The atomic unit of this DB is a document.Each document is a JSON, the schema can vary between different documents and contain different fields.Document DBs allow indexing of some fields in the document to allow faster queries based on those fields (this forces all the documents to have the field).", "When should I use it?Data analysis \u2014 Since different records are not dependent on one another (logic and structure-wise) this DB supports parallel computations.This allows you to perform big data analytics on our data easily.", "Common document-based databases: MongoDB, CouchDB, DocumentDB.", "The atomic unit of this DB is a column in the table, meaning the data is stored column by column. It makes column-based queries very efficient, and since the data on each column is quite homogeneous, this allows better compression of the data.", "When should I use it?When you tend to query on a subset of columns in your data (doesn\u2019t need to be the same subset each time!).Columnar DB performs such queries very fast since it only needs to read these specific columns (while row-based DB would have to read the entire data).", "The querying is only key-based \u2014 You ask for a key and get its value.Doesn\u2019t support queries across different record values like \u2018select all records where city == New York\u2019A useful feature in this DB is the TTL field (time to live), this field can be set differently for each record and state when it should be deleted from the DB.", "Advantages \u2014 It is very fast.First because of the use of unique keys, and second because most of the key-values databases store the data in memory (RAM) which allows quick access.Disadvantages \u2014 You need to define unique keys that are good identifiers and built of the data you know in the time of the query.Often more expensive than other kinds of databases (since runs on memory).", "When should I use it?Mainly used for cache since it is very fast and doesn\u2019t require complex querying, also the TTL feature comes very useful for caching.It can also be used for any other kind of data that requires fast querying and meets the key-value format.", "Graph DBs contain nodes that represent entities and edges that represent relationships between entities.", "When should I use it?When your data is a graph like, like knowledge graphs and social networks.", "As you probably figured out by now, there is no right answer, no \u2018One DB to rule them all\u2019.The most common DBs for \u2018regular\u2019 use are Relational and Document DBs so we\u2019ll compare them.", "Your home for data science.
