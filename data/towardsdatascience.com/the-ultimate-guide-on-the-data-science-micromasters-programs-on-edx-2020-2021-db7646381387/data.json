These are mostly students from other disciplines that are moving into that area, and for them, it is a fast and flexible way to fill the gap in basics while attending lectures on the master\u2019s level.", "So, they often ask me for advice which MOOCs would be best suited for their individual situation.", "There are pros and cons to each MOOC. The fact is that with MOOCs alone, you cannot become a data scientist. You need practical experience and exchange with and mentorship from veterans. But it is a convenient way to get access to high-quality education and a fast path to fill gaps.", "My observation is that the MOOCs\u2019 quality is increasing steadily, and you have a growing choice of online programs. So, it becomes essential to find the individually right program.", "Another question is if you should get a certificate or not. My personal opinion is that when you anyway will get a degree on a graduate level, and it only serves as a possibility to fill gaps, it is not necessary to take a certificate. If it shows additional knowledge that you would otherwise not have, go for a certificate. Benjamin Obi Tayo, Ph.D. has an excellent summary of the consideration for certifications.", "Comparing the many different platforms is not a simple task; even the comparison of the many various programs on one platform is tricky for a data science beginner.", "Our university is part of the edX platform, so it is the choice of many of our students. For that reason, I am most familiar with the course offered there.", "In this guide, I focus on the so-called MicroMasters programs on the edX platform.", "A MicroMasters program consists of a series of graduate-level courses, including corresponding assignments, exams, and practical projects. The average length is about one year, with an effort of about 10 hours per week. It corresponds to around 25% of a full master\u2019s program, and the earned credits can be transferred to designated online or on-campus master\u2019s programs.", "So, MicroMasters programs are not only a convenient way of gaining relevant and high-quality education but also a way of testing your delight in full graduate education.", "The following six MicroMasters on edX programs have been assessed:", "The programs are listed in alphabetical order.", "1.

Artificial Intelligence \u2014 Columbia University", "Remark: the program is no longer available and no further program runs are planned [updated 2021\u201303\u201314]", "What you will learn: You learn AI applications of machine learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, regression, classification, boosting, unsupervised learning, Hidden Markov Models and State-space Models, principle component analysis, robotic movements and kinematics, robots motion planning, all aspects of computer-generated imagery programming and creation.", "Lengths and effort: 1 year, 8\u201310 hours per week", "Assessments and certification: Grade of 60% or higher required to pass, of quizzes, (programming) projects, homework, and the final proctored exams per course.", "Tools and programming language(s): Python, C/C++", "Pros: One of the very few graduate-level MOOCs that also provides a more in-depth introduction to robots and computer-generated imagery.", "Cons: Even though the course descriptions note a weekly effort of 8\u201310 hours, that only applies to people fulfilling the prerequisites on a proficient level. All others should consider 10\u201320 hours a week to complete the courses successfully.", "Credits: It will count 25% or 7.5 credits toward the 30 credits of the Master of Computer Science program at Columbia University.", "Who should take that program: People proficient in programming in Python and C/C++, and with an advanced knowledge in data science who want to deepen the AI skills on a graduate level.", "3. Big Data \u2014 The University of Adelaide", "What you will learn: You learn algorithm design, and fundamental programming concepts, manipulation, and transformation of data, as well as dimension reduction, directed and undirected graphs, hashing, big data fundamentals, stream processing, MapReduce, Google\u2019s web search, and AdWords system, regression and classification, and deep learning algorithms.", "Lengths and effort: 1 year, 8\u201310 hours per week", "Assessments and certification: Grade of 60% or higher required to pass, based on all quizzes, assignments, and worked problems.", "Tools and programming language(s): Processing.js, R/RStudio, Java/Eclipse IDE, Apache Spark, sparklyr, and H20.", "Pros: It gives a broad and comprehensive introduction into the Big Data thinking and design, the various tools and programming languages, and integrates real-world examples from web search and web advertising.", "Cons: It is less suited for a data science beginner; otherwise, the effort will be considerably higher.", "Credits: The Big Data MicroMasters program certificate represents 25% or 12 units of the Master of Data Science program, which requires a total of 48 units of coursework to complete.", "Who should take that program: People who already have a sound understanding of data science and are familiar with at least one programming language on an intermediate level and want to have an introduction into the Big Data area.", "4. Data Science \u2014 UC San Diego", "What you will learn: You will learn the necessary process of data science, Python and Jupyter notebooks, processing uncurated datasets, fundamental statistical analysis, basic machine learning methods, visualization, an overview of sets, counting principles, combinatorics, discrete probability, conditional probability, and Bayes\u2019 Rule, random variables, expectation, variance, and correlation, joint distribution families, continuous distributions, probabilistic inequalities, concentration, and limit theorems, linear and logistic regression, sampling, parameter estimation, and confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, decision trees, and an introduction to deep learning, neural networks, and TensorFlow.", "Lengths and effort: 10 months, 9\u201311 hours per week", "Assessments and certification: Grade of 70% or higher required to pass, from quizzes, projects, final exams in the first course, and 65% or higher in the second, third and fourth course.", "Tools and programming language(s): Python, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, git, scikit-learn, NLTK, Spark, and PySpark", "Pros: A fundamental introduction for all data science beginners covering many different topics, including a sound introduction into statistical concepts. Letter grading is offered.", "Cons: The program gives a broad but not necessarily in-depth knowledge. Technical deepness must be studied by yourself and can take a lot of effort.", "Credits: The MicroMaster will count as 30% of the full Master of Science degree in Data Science of the Rochester Institute of Technology. It also counts 25% (or 100 credits of the 400 credits) towards the Master of Predictive Analytics at Curtin University. Finally, completers will receive a favorable review of their application if you choose to apply to the Online Master\u2019s Degree program in Data Science from UT Austin on edX.", "Who should take that program: This course is designed for beginners in data science to get an overview from statistical concepts to the most used models and gives a flavor on deep learning and big data.", "5.
