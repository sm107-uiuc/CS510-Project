I wake up, pour myself a bowl of cornflakes (milk first, cereal second \u2014 obviously) and check the news. Then I go out into the garden and lock myself in the shed with a note on the door saying to come and get me when it\u2019s all over. Who am I?", "If you answered \u201cliterally anyone\u201d then you would probably be correct. However, if you answered \u201can actuary in charge of modelling and projecting into the future improvements in mortality\u201d then you get extra brownie points. Because this year, longevity specialists have had the rather unenviable task of trying to work out how to quantify the long-term effects of a pandemic on human life expectancy.", "After quite a lot of thinking, these specialists working for the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) have published a working paper setting out their intentions for the 2020 version of their annual model for projecting how life expectancies will change over the coming decades.", "For those that may not be familiar:", "Earlier this month, the CMI set out a new feature for their new model due to be published in early 2021. The model will allow users to place more or less weight on the data collected in individual years for the calculation of future mortality projections. In particular, the question of how much weight to place on data collected in 2020 was raised, and the default \u201ccore\u201d model will place a 0% weighting on 2020 data \u2014 ignoring any possible long-term effects of the pandemic, in effect.", "Observing this, we might raise two major questions. The first is perhaps the most obvious one, and that is: how will future mortality be affected by Covid-19? The second arises after taking a step back and realising that there is a growing number of extra knobs and dials that can have a material impact on the results of this model. Is the fact of having more model parameters, more control and customisability, unquestionably a good thing?", "This is a complex question to which there isn\u2019t really an answer yet.", "Clearly, there have been more deaths than normal in 2020, so we might expect this to dampen any future improvements in life expectancies. On the other hand, it could also be argued that future mortality improvements might be amplified since the pandemic has differentially killed a larger number of older and possibly more frail members of the population, leaving a higher proportion of younger and healthier people behind.", "But let\u2019s not be short-sighted. It\u2019s possible that the longer-term effects such as further emergences of the virus, strained healthcare services, and a weakened global economy could contribute the largest impact on what to expect from future mortality rates.", "The optimist says that more parameters means greater flexibility and an enhanced ability to tailor the CMI model to specific purposes. The pessimist says that more parameters means more opportunities\u2026 to get it wrong.", "Trust in the relevant experts certainly becomes more important as the problem of setting assumptions for the future mortality of a certain group of interest grows in complexity. No one profession is equipped to come up with a good answer. There are innumerable factors that feed into a phenomenon as complex as how long people live and each one may seem like an impossible task in its own right. Public health experts will be needed to analyse healthcare trends. Statisticians will be needed to uncover and decode patterns in mortality data. Economists will be needed to predict the future of the economy and how this will feed into our daily lives. Actuaries will be needed to liaise with the different experts and deliver actionable advice to their clients. interdisciplinary communication will be important.", "And so, it seems like we are back at the conclusion which we have arrived at before \u2014 we need to effect large-scale collaboration between different professions and different viewpoints to find the best answers. In the same way the this virus has greatly accelerated our society\u2019s capacity to develop, test, and roll out vaccines, perhaps we will also see our experts\u2019 ability to work together improve, driven by necessity rather than an abstract idealism", "Plenty of food for thought going into 2021. No-one has been able to completely avoid the difficulties posed by an emergent disease, but opportunities abound and progress has been made. The future looks hopeful, but we\u2019re not out of the garden shed yet.", "Andrew Hetherington is an actuary-in-training based in London, UK.", "Photo by Immo Wegmann on Unsplash.", "Your home for data science.
