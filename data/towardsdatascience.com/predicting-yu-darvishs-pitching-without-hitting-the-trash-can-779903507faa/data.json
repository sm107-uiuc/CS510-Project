Yu Darvish was one of the victims. He had a solid regular season and he was pitching really well early in the postseason games for the Doggers. However, things changed during the World Series against the Astros. He gave up nine runs in 3.1 innings in two games, including Game 7, when he threw 47 pitches in 1.2 innings, losing 5 runs, leading to a final win for the Astros. Fans blamed him and he was traded to the Cubs after the season.", "It turned out 2 years later, that the Astros stole his pitching signs using camera and hinted the batters by knocking the trash can during the games. So basically the batters knew what Darvish was going to pitch, this might be the reason why he performed so badly in the World Series compared to his games with other teams. (background story: https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2020/3/9/21170990/astros-sign-stealing-dodgers-world-series-yu-darvish-clayton-kershaw)", "I am curious if it is necessary to steal the signs illegally by camera, is it possible to deduce his pitch based on his pitching history?", "In this investigation I wanted to answer the following questions: 1. What kind of pitch_type he throws most?  2. What pitch type does he throw when he needs a strike? (2-strike and 3-ball condition)  3. Does he have different pitching strategy under different situation (0 strike 0 ball, 2 strikes 3 balls\u2026, outs, inning, etc).  4. Is it possible to train a machine learning model based on his pitching history to predict his pitching?", "The dataset used for analysis contains 8221 pitches from Yu Darvish. The data was download from https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/ and wrangled for investigation. The other dataset contains his 2017 playoff data, which is used to test the model.", "He has many weapons in his pocket, 9 kinds of pitch type in total. He throws 33.3% 4-seam and 15.8% 2-seam fastball, 21.1% cutter and 20% slider. He uses his curveball, split finger, changeup, knuckle curve and eephus below 10%.", "Let\u2019s now breakdown his pitches under different game conditions.", "He increases his 4-seam fast ball precent when there is no strike, and increases his slider when there are two. He also seems to increase his breaking ball precent at 2-strike", "There is no very obvious difference at different ball conditions except 3-ball. He he tends to use 4-seam fastball and avoid the pitch type like curveball, split finger and changeup.", "How about outs? Does he pitch differently?", "Hmmm, it not quite clear if there is significant difference.", "Let\u2019s combine strike, ball and out.", "This figure digs a little deeper into the different conditions. For example, when he is facing 2-strike and 0 ball, he still tends to throw 4-seam fastball, but when the ball increases, he increases his slider percentage.", "This figure might be useful as a reference, however, it only considers three features, strike, ball and out. Let\u2019s try to build a machine model to include other features for prediction.", "After feature engineering, I included the results of previous pitch, and pitch count per game. Combining some of the original features in the dataset, I used the following features for the model and one-hot encode the categorical variables.", "The 2017 playoff pitch result will be used to test the model, therefore I establish a baseline using a naive guess. I choose 4-seam fastball, which he throws the most in the training dataset, as the prediction for the test dataset and compared with the real pitch. I got a 27.16% accuracy.", "I built a random forest model to predict the result, without too much tuning, I got an accuracy of 36.20 +/- 5% by cross validation, and 37.31% accuracy on the test dataset.", "Based on the confusion matrix, the model mis-predicts a lot of slider to 4-seam fastball. Even through the number seems low, it is still 30% better than a naive guess.", "The random forest model provides a better prediction (37%) than a naive guess(27%), but still is not able to predict his pitch perfectly. I think there is still room for improvement, for example, better feature engineering, or to include the pitching history with the specific batter. But I think the unpredictable pitch is one of the reason that he is a great player. And the unpredictability of baseball is really the fun of baseball games.", "Your home for data science.
