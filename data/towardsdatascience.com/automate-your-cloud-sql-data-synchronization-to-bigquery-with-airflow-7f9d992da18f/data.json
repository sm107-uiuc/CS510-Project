In many cases, especially when migrating from on-premises to GCP, Cloud SQL is a natural choice for transactional data as it offers managed MySQL and PosgreSQL.", "There are many ways you can go about synchronizing your Cloud SQL data to BigQuery. One solution is to use the federated queries with Cloud SQL BigQuery feature. Though that solution has the advantage of being fast and cheap, it comes with at least one constraint: it\u2019s not possible (yet) to use Cloud SQL federated query with a private Cloud SQL instance, which means you are left with less secure public instances. This article introduces a highly secure, automated and production ready way of getting your Cloud SQL data into BigQuery.", "By the end of this article, you will get", "This writing is most valuable for readers with at least basic knowledge of GCP. If instead you are wondering what those three letters stand for, I would recommend you spend some time here to have a good introduction to GCP. I also assume that you have some exposure to Apache Airflow and Kubernetes. If that\u2019s not true, for you, feel free to check this excellent introduction to Airflow on Udemy. You\u2019ll also find a quick start to Kubernetes here.", "To follow up, all you need is a GCP project. If you don\u2019t have a project available or if you just want to give a try without incurring any expenses in your existing projects, you can create a new google account and use that account to create a free GCP account and project.", "In the next few minutes you will be:", "Remember Airflow is a tool which purpose is to orchestrate, automate and monitor batch jobs. In our context, the actual synchronization jobs are done by invoking GCP APIs as we will see when we get to Writing and deploying the data synchronization tasks.", "There are many options for installing Airflow on GCP, including custom installation on Google Compute Engine or Google Kubernetes Engine. Here, we deploy a Google Cloud Composer environment resource which provisions a GKE cluster (along with other GCP resources) and installs Airflow on that cluster.", "After 30 minutes or so, your cloud composer environment should be up and running inside the default VPC network of your GCP project.", "One of the key benefits of our Cloud SQL to BigQuery synchronization architecture is that it enforces security best practices. Actually, instead of using a public instance for our cloud SQL database, we\u2019ll use a private instance.", "Before we can create a private cloud SQL instance, we need to create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) peering connection between a VPC network in the GCP project (here we choose the \u2018default\u2019 VPC network) and the VPC network in which the cloud SQL instance resides. Instances on the \u2018default\u2019 network will then be able to connect to the private Cloud SQL instance using that VPC peering connection. To learn more about creating a Cloud SQL private instance, check this.", "The following four commands create a Cloud SQL MySQL private instance:", "To be able to connect to the SQL instance, let\u2019s create a cloud SQL user. I\u2019ll also create a database which we will be synchronizing to BigQuery later in this article.", "Recall our Airflow installation is running on a private VPC native GKE cluster. On the one hand, a private cluster, as the name suggests, is a cluster where the worker nodes aren\u2019t assigned a public IP. Actually, we do not need our GKE workers to be publicly accessible through the internet. Firstly, assigning a public IP to the worker nodes could result in a security breach. Secondly, a public IP would be useless here as the cloud SQL instance is not accessible through public IP connectivity.", "On the other hand, VPC native means that the GKE cluster uses alias IP address ranges to route traffic from one pod to the other. In fact, VPC native GKE clusters have many useful benefits as far as IP routing is concerned. For instance, when VPC native mode is enabled, there is native routing between the cluster VPC network and any network connected to it through VPC Network peering. More on VPC native clusters can be found here.", "If you followed so far, the GKE cluster created for Airflow is running inside the default VPC called \u2018default\u2019. As for the cloud SQL instance, it\u2019s running inside a VPC network located in a project that is managed on our behalf by GCP. How then can the GKE workers possibly communicate with the SQL instance since they belong to two different networks and don\u2019t have public IPs?", "Remember we established earlier a VPC peering connection between our project \u2018default\u2019 VPC network and the VPC network in which the cloud SQL instance resides. That means our GKE workers and our Cloud SQL instance can natively communicate through private IP connectivity thanks to enabling VPC native mode. You can find details about this peering on the cloud console.", "Open the cloud console, click on the menu (the hamburger icon at the top left corner), scroll down until you find \u2018VPC network\u2019. Hover over \u2018VPC network\u2019. In the dropdown list, click on \u2018VPC network peering\u2019.", "At this point, we already have a good setup for our cloud SQL to BigQuery synchronization jobs since the GKE workers who will be performing the jobs are not accessible from the internet. However, one can go one step further and encrypt the connections between GKE (or Airflow) and cloud SQL.", "This is traditionally done using SSL certificates, which implies the overhead of configuring and managing SSL certificates.", "An easier way to encrypt connections to an cloud SQL instance is by using cloud SQL proxy. Cloud SQL proxy works by having a local process (called the proxy client) running on the environment where the connection will originate and a \u2018remote\u2019 process (called the proxy server) running on the same environment as the cloud SQL instance. Please, visit this documentation for a thorough explanation of cloud SQL Proxy.", "We install the SQL proxy on GKE by creating a pod running the SQL proxy process and then creating a service to expose that pod internally to the cluster.", "But before getting there, we need to setup the kubectl binary to communicate with the cluster. To achieve that :", "We are now ready to install the SQL proxy on the GKE cluster. First, create a namespace in the cluster for the proxy related resources. To do that create an empty file and name it \u2018namespace.yaml\u2019. Then copy the following content inside the file:", "Then create a file named \u2018pod.yaml\u2019.

Finally, create a file named \u2018service.yaml\u2019 and add the following content to it.", "Apply that manifest to the GKE cluster to actually create the service that exposes the proxy process to the rest of the pods running inside the cluster.", "That\u2019s it! We have configured a private, encrypted connection between the GKE workers (and also Airflow workers) and the cloud SQL instance. The architecture now looks like this:", "Create a bigquery dataset inside your GCP project to hold all the tables that are going to be synchronized from cloud SQL.", "The actual data synchronization from cloud SQL to BigQuery is handled by an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

You have successfully deployed your data synchronization DAG and implemented all the pieces of the target architecture:", "To make the synchronization job fetch new data each time it runs, I created a CRON job on GKE that runs every 2 minutes to add new data to the table \u2018employees\u2019 of the \u2018classicmodels\u2019 database.", "I\u2019m not getting too long here about the new data insertion process as it departs a bit from our main topic. If you are interested in knowing more about how I implemented that process, bear with me till the end and you will get access to a Gitlab repository with all the material discussed so far and more.", "Airflow modern user interface (UI) provides many useful features for tasks monitoring, including workflows and tasks statuses, custom charts, adhoc querying using standard SQL. In addition Cloud Composer also offers native metrics and dashboards to monitor the Airflow jobs and the GKE cluster.", "The synchronization job is scheduled to run every 2 minutes (In real life scenario, you won\u2019t have such a high run velocity). The following graph shows the result of the last job run.", "In this article, I showcased a secure way to synchronize data from cloud SQL to BigQuery, using full synchronization as opposed to incremental synchronization.
