After learning about regression, I immediately felt using sports data would be perfect for my project on the topic. Since my partner, Raphael, was also an NBA fan, we decided to go that route for our analysis and build a multiple regression model. Our goal was to be able to predict the final regular season win percentage for a team based on the stats the team was averaging per game.", "This is how we did it:", "Because of the importance of statistics in sports today, we were able to find official NBA stats on stats.nba.com. Using Selenium we scraped per game statistics from each season between 1996 and 2019 for every team. After some data cleaning, we had created the dataframe below:", "Ultimately, we ended up running logarithmic (log) transformations using NumPy on some of the variables due to the shapes of their distributions or their OLS p-value (which I\u2019ll explain further down). All of the variables, including those that were log transformed, were then normalized so that they would all be on the same scale given how the stats differ from each other.", "Features: Win Percentage (Win_Percent), Points (PTS), Field Goals Made (FGM), Field Goals Attempted (FGA), Field Goal Percentage (FG_Percent), Three-Pointers Made (Three_PM), Three-Pointers Attempted (Three_PA), Three-Point Percentage (Three_P_Percent), Free Throws Made (FTM), Free Throws Attempted (FTA), Free Throw Percentage (FT_Percent), Offensive Rebounds (OREB), Defensive Rebounds (DREB), Total Rebounds (REB), Assists (AST), Turnovers (TOV), Steals (STL), Blocks (BLK), Blocked Field Goal Attempts (BLKA), and Personal Fouls (PF)*", "*We ended up not using these features: Wins (W), Losses (L), Minutes (MIN), Personal Fouls Drawn (PFD), and +/\u2013 (Plus_Minus)", "1. Correlation heatmap of all the features that we scraped:", "2. Scatter matrix with histograms of the distribution shapes of the variables \u2014 normal vs. skewed (small snippet of the diagram):", "As we can see from the diagram above, some features have skewed distributions. This can possibly be explained by more recent trends in basketball, i.e. the dramatic increase in three-point shots since 2014, and therefore a log transformation might be necessary.", "1. Began by creating an OLS regression table on all of the variables prior to any transformations", "2. Followed that up by creating an OLS table with every variable log transformed", "3. Finally, made an OLS table only logarithmically transforming the variables that had lower p-values when log transformed", "2. Checked for homoscedasticity with a scatter plot of the error terms:", "After performing Scikit-Learn\u2019s train-test split on the model, we determined that there was no need for regularization since the unpenalized linear regression was good \u2014 very low difference between the error of the trained model and the error of the test model.", "From the final model above, we can see which basketball statistics potentially play a large role in ultimately deciding how many games a team will win vs. lose. Undoubtedly, the categories not included in the final model, however, are still very much important. Also, it might seem odd that some of the variables in the equation are negative when you would think you\u2019d want them to be positive. These instances are likely combatted by the strength of the positive variables.", "While we may not be getting our fix of NBA basketball with the events that are currently transpiring across the world, I hope this provides you with a small dose of the sport that you\u2019ve dearly missed. And if you consider yourself a betting man or woman, maybe even take a shot now and see how accurate our model ends up being at the end of the regular season.", "Your home for data science.
