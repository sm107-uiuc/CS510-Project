Let's have a look at some examples in Python."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method", "anchor_text": "Monte Carlo simulation", "paragraph_index": 35}], "all_paragraphs": ["It\u2019s that time of the week! You decide to dive deeper into a subject and today we are looking at Binary Search.", "As always, there are many ways to solve the same problem. When you want to check if an element is in a list, you can do this with a linear search as well as a binary search, but guess which is faster.", "If you have watched programming job interviews on Youtube lately, you know that binary search is a favorite.", "Why should you spend time learning about binary search? Your C++ programming friends probably told you this already. Python is slow. You want to make sure you don\u2019t make your program slower than it needs to be.", "When you learn Python, you learn to do a linear search to check if an element is in a list. That\u2019s fine when you learn to code, but what happens when you have 60.000.000 elements in a list?", "If you do a linear search in a list with 11 elements you have to go through all 11 elements. If you use binary search you might end up with as few as 2 iterations depending on what you\u2019re looking for. See the graphics below.", "It should be obvious which approach is faster.", "You have most likely worked with lists a hundred times already when you started learning Python. Checking if a value is in the list is a normal task and you have seen this before:", "Let\u2019s start looking at how you can implement binary search.", "Let\u2019s visualize how binary search works.", "First, we need to make sure the list is sorted. You can sort your list with either .sort() or sorted() I use .sort() to alter the list in place. If you for some reason need a new list or don\u2019t want to tamper with the original, use sorted()", "We are going to look for the value 15.", "How do you think the algorithm would behave if we were looking for 2, and our first middle value was 9? You\u2019re right. The max index would move instead.", "Ok, I know you came here to code. Let\u2019s get crackin\u2019.", "Psuedo code will look like this:", "We have created a function with two parameters. A list and a target value. The target value is the number we are looking for. The list is the list we iterate through, looking for the number.", "If we find the target value, we will return True. If not, we will return False.", "The first thing we do is sort the list and define the minimum index of the list and the maximum index of the list.", "The reason we use len(list)-1 is that Python starts indexing at 0. The length of the test list is 11 , but the last index is [10] .", "Now, let\u2019s go to the brain of the function, the loop:", "As long as the max index is not higher than the min index, we keep going. If the loop stops, that means we have collapsed the list so max is less than min. At this point, there is no point in searching for the value as there is no more list.", "If you find it hard to follow along, you can add a print() to the code to get a visual representation of the jumping of indexes.", "Add this right after the mid_index =(max_index+min_index)//2 in the while loop:", "Our main procedure contains the test data and a few asserts to check if everything is working as expected.", "Notice that I added another way to build the list if you want to see an example where the search fails.", "The time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the length of the list. To check which search is faster, we can time the calculation of a binary search against a linear search.", "First, we need to write a linear search function:", "Then, we need to write performance tests, one for binary and one for linear:", "If you run the code above (merged with the original), you will see that the linear search is faster. What is this sorcery?", "There are several issues giving binary a hard time.", "All of the factors above, give linear a head start. Let\u2019s keep sorting in there, for now, and alter the list length first:", "The linear search still has the upper hand. Let\u2019s take sorting out of the function and sort the list before passing it to the function. (This is not fair to the linear search as linear does not rely on sorted lists). All we have to do is comment it out as our lists are sorted anyways.", "What if we move the target value to 7.500? Now our bias is shining as we really want binary to be faster.", "This time the difference is extreme. The last example below will even the odds and make everything fair.", "Let\u2019s create a random list at random lengths with random targets. then we will run this 100.000 times for both functions.", "As they can not share the list, we will trust the Monte Carlo simulation (while praying the Macbook doesn\u2019t catch fire\u2026)", "Now let\u2019s run it 60 million times! Just kidding, I trust these results. MacBooks are expensive.", "Is binary faster than linear, then? Yes, but it depends.", "When someone tells you binary search is faster, it is because it generally is.", "As always, you have to look at the setting and don\u2019t go for a single solution every time because it \u201cis the best\u201d.", "What we saw from our experiments, was that it depends on what you are doing. If you have a short list, or if you are looking for an element in the lower part of a list, you might be better off performing a linear search.", "This is also the beauty of programming. You aren\u2019t supposed to use one way of doing something without knowing why you are doing it. If you didn\u2019t know binary search already, now you have yet another tool to do a search. Use it whenever you find a good use for it.", "I hope we can agree on one thing though. Binary Search is pretty darn cool!", "Your home for data science.
