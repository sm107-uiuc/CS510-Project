It is represented as a collection of data points in square brackets. Lists can be used to store any data type or a mixture of different data types.", "Lists are mutable which is one of the reasons why they are so commonly used. However, mutability needs extra caution in some cases.", "In this post, we will cover 11 very important operations that cover almost all you need to know about Python lists.", "The first way is the del function. We just past the index of the element to be removed.", "We can use the remove function which looks for the value to be removed.", "The third way is the pop function which removes the last element of a list by default. Unlike the other two functions, pop returns the value that is removed. Thus, we have the option to assign it to a different variable.", "Edit: Pop is commonly used to pop out (or remove) the last element of a list. However, it can also be used to remove any element by providing the index. Thanks Keethesh for the heads up in the comments.", "Note: There are two ways to index a list:", "Append is used to add an item to a list.", "Whatever you append to a list, it will become an item of the list.", "List b became the third item of list a. If you wanted to create a list that is the combination of the items in a and b ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), you need to use the extend function or \u201c+\u201d operator.", "The insert function is also used to add an element to a list. However, it allows specifying the index of the new element. For instance, we can add a new element at the beginning of the list (index=0).", "The first parameter is the index and the second one is the value.", "We can copy a list and create a new variable.", "However, the new variable \u201cb\u201d is just a pointer to the values of \u201ca\u201d. Thus, any change in a also changes b. Let\u2019s confirm by adding a value to a.", "We can copy a list by selecting its all indices.", "The new list b contains the same values as a but at a different memory location. If we make a change in a, b won\u2019t be affected.", "Copying a list by using the copy function works the same as copying with indices.", "Both sort and sorted functions can be used to sort a list:", "Let\u2019s do the same example with the sorted function.", "When creating a nested list of lists by copying, we need to be careful about modifications. Any change in the original list will change the copied one.", "The list c consists of the lists a and b. We have updated the lists a and b by adding and removing an element. As a result, the list c has been updated as well.", "Lists are iterable objects so it is common to use them in loops. The iteration is based on index so we need to be careful if we update the lists when iterating.", "Consider the following code. It removes the items from list a if the item is also in list b.", "When the code is executed, we expect that list a becomes [\u2018z\u2019, \u2018t\u2019]. Let\u2019s see what actually happened.", "Although \u2018y\u2019 exists in list b, it is still in list a. The reason is that when the first item (\u2018x\u2019) is removed from list a, the index is also updated. The next item a[1] becomes \u2018z\u2019 but it is supposed to be \u2018y\u2019. Thus, the for loop compares every second item.", "Here is the step where the first item is removed from list a:", "Here is the next item that is compared. As you can see, it is \u2018z\u2019 so \u2018y\u2019 never gets compared.", "List comprehension is basically creating lists based on existing iterables. It achieves what can be done with for loops in a faster way. The syntax of a list comprehension is also simpler and more appealing than that of for loops.", "List b only contains the even elements of list a. The same operation can be done using a for loop as below:", "As you can see, the list comprehension is simpler.", "Note: List comprehension loads the entire output list into memory which makes it faster than a for loop. It is desirable to use list comprehensions when working with small or medium-sized lists. However, when we are working with large lists (e.g. 1 billion elements), list comprehension should be avoided. It may cause your computer to crash due to the extreme amount of memory requirement.", "We can also do operations on each item in a list comprehension. Consider the following list a:", "We want to create a list b that consists of the names that start with the letter \u2018j\u2019. We also want to capitalize the names.", "We can iterate over nested lists in a list comprehension. Consider the following list of lists:", "We want to take out each element from the nested lists so the desired output is:", "Here is the list comprehension to do this task:", "If the syntax is not clear to you, try to do it with for loops first. You can then move the blocs of for loops into the list comprehension. The following figure will help you understand what I mean:", "These are very simple yet quite useful operations.", "There is an easier way to do the task in example 10. It involves the explode function of Pandas.", "We need to convert the nested list (vals) to a Pandas series and then apply the explode function. In order to convert it back to a list, we can use the list function.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
