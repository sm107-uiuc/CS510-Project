The efficiency of its organization and its operation is a major concern for any company. At the time of Big Data, the business expertise and understanding the existing technical solutions is very essential. The technological landscape is evolving very quickly and companies must at the same time continue to assess and choose the databases that will meet their future needs and support their growth.", "Relational databases have been used for decades to store data, and they still represent a viable solution for many use cases. NoSQL databases were created in response to the limitations of relational database technology. Compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and offer higher performance, and their data model corrects several weaknesses of the relational model. In this article, I will try to throw light on the challenges, benefits and process of migrating from a RDBMS to NoSQL.", "In general, NoSQL databases were designed to solve the problems of data processing in volume, multi-sources and multi-formats, in Big Data environments. They offer a new approach to meet volume requirementsand new types of data.", "Nowadays, the number of NoSQL databases has become more and more important. It is imperative to know their differences to adopt the right technology for the right application.", "SQL is the acronym for Structured Query Language. It has been known for a long time to all IT engineers who have had to quickly search for information in large relational databases (DBMS). SQL is widely used today because it is one of the most structured and fastest database organization and querying devices; it comes in different names which show that there are various adaptations, such as Oracle\u2019s MySQL and Microsoft\u2019s SQL Server. In addition, SQL is the most recommended option by many companies due to its predefined structure and schemas.", "The acronym \u201cNoSQL\u201d has two interpretations which are not clear-cut today:", "So the term relates as much to technical characteristics as to a historic generation of DBMS that emerged around the 2010s. The main problem that led to inventing NoSQL was to solve the fact that the same database on a website could be used at the same time worldwide by millions of users; the typical problem of a company like Amazon\u2026", "What we are therefore trying to achieve with NoSQL is to reduce the complexity of the query language and to simplify the architecture of the database. These databases consist of column-oriented, document-oriented, graph-oriented and key / value-oriented data. The NoSQL family is made up of various products, each product has a unique set of functionalities.", "The large web companies had to process very large volumes of data, that is why they were the first to face the intrinsic limitations of traditional relational DBMS. These systems, based on a strict application of ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) and generally designed to run on single computers, quickly posed problems of scalability.", "In order to meet these limits, these companies have started to develop their own database management systems which can operate on distributed hardware architectures and which can process a large volume of data :", "Performance remains good with the ramp-up by simply multiplying the number of servers, a reasonable solution with the drop in costs, in particular, if revenues grow with the development of the activity.", "There are several popular databases systems available; both paid and free. In order to choose the right management system for you or your organization, it is important to have an idea about what exists in the market. Check out the list below of 5 popular SQL & NoSQL databases.", "It\u2019s available for free and it offers a lot of functionality even for a free database engine.", "Oracle database management tools are incredibly robust with the latest innovations and features.", "This database management engine is scalable and can handle terabytes of data, with a variety of predefined functions.", "It is very fast and stable. It works very well with other Microsoft products.", "A SQLite database is very light and quick to set up, it can also be used to store data in a real database on a smartphone application (iPhone or Android).", "MongoDB is a flexible/reliable database that will draw you to the NoSQL world. Its management and maintenance are very easy and fast.", "It is incredibly simple and straightforward to use. You can download Redis and start using it during the next five minutes.", "The linear scalability provided by Cassandra, allowing to easily scale up/down the cluster by simply adding/removing the servers.", "It is a column oriented database that helps improve the query performance and aggregations.", "Thanks to its ability to store serialized (JSON formatted) unstructured data and its Restful HTTP API, CouchDB is highly desirable for Web and Mobile Applications.", "The main characteristics of NoSQL DBMS are to allow the manipulation of large volumes of data and to allow horizontal scalability. However, the difficulty, which most of the companies face today, is to target the most adequate technology in order to respond to their problems and their application.", "Addressing this difficulty begins with a good understanding of the different types of NoSQL databases. There is a common myth that all NoSQL databases are created equal \u2014 this is not true! In fact, these databases can be classified into four categories: document-oriented databases, key/value databases, column databases and graph-oriented databases. They all have one thing in common: the support of more flexible and dynamic models than those produced with traditional relational databases.", "In fact, each of these categories has its own attributes and limitations. There is no preferable database for solving all problems. You must select a database according to the needs of your project.", "You have to wonder what kind of data will be manipulated and how the applications will ultimately use it.", "A document-oriented NoSQL database stores and extracts data as a key/value pair, but the value part is stored as a document. The document is stored in JSON or XML formats.", "MongoDB, Apache CouchDB, MarkLogic are document-oriented databases.", "A key-value oriented database has a large hash of keys and values. It represents the simplest form of NoSQL databases. They associate unique keys with values \u200b\u200bin data, with the objective of greatly enhancing the performance of applications based on relatively simple datasets.", "Redis, Riak, Memcached and Aerospike are examples of key-value databases.", "Column databases hold data in tables that have a very large number of columns. Each storage block contains data from a single column and each column is treated separately. They provide high performance on aggregate queries such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, etc., because the data is readily available in a column.", "HBase, Cassandra and Accumulo are examples of column-based databases.", "A graph-based database is a network database that stores data elements in \u201cgraph\u201d structures and make it possible to create associations between the nodes, ultimately serving as a basis for recommendation engines or social networks.", "We can get a lot of information from a graph database. For example, graph technology can be used to identify relationships between different people through their interests.", "Neo4J, Infinite Graph and FlockDB are examples of graph-oriented databases.", "How do we decide which type of Database is the best fit for a project ? Here is a checklist that you can use :", "No matter which NoSQL database design you choose, migrating your data into it can present some serious challenges. The design of a data model in NoSQL has additional complexity because it requires knowing the end use of the data. Knowing that your application will handle Bills and Customers is no longer sufficient. You must now know how this data will be displayed to the end user. Therefore, data modeling in a NoSQL database requires real technical expertise in addition to in-depth knowledge of the end-customer use.", "In my opinion, this is a hard question! Because in most cases, it\u2019s not about replacing SQL with a NoSQL solution, but rather, making a transition from one to the other, if the application and the use case reveal the need for change. In general, this transition will be driven by the need for flexibility and scalability when it comes to building modern web and mobile applications.", "Typically, many companies try to support the load in their web applications, so they choose to simply add web servers behind a load balancer to support more users. Undoubtedly, the ability to scale up is a fundamental competitive advantage in the increasingly important world of cloud computing, in which instances of virtual machines can be easily added or removed so as to meet the fluctuating demands.", "Relational databases (RDBMS) do not allow simple scaling and do not provide a flexible data model. Managing more users means adding a larger server and large servers are very complex and expensive, unlike low-cost hardware, \u201ccommodity hardware\u201d and cloud architectures. Organizations are starting to see performance issues with their relational databases for existing or new applications. Especially as the number of users increases daily, they realize that the need for a faster and more flexible database has become very important. It\u2019s time to move to NoSQL!", "Applications / Projects can vary greatly depending on each organization, so the transition will depend on your use case. Here are some general guidelines for the transition:", "1- Understand the key requirements for your application:", "Here are some requirements corresponding to the need to have a NoSQL database:", "2- Understand the different types of NoSQL offers:", "As I\u2019ve said above, there are different types of NoSQL database management systems.", "For instance, the document-oriented NoSQL databases \u2014 with Couchbase and MongoDB which are the two best known and most widely adopted examples.", "Also, Cassandra, for example, may be a solution that you can use for data analysis given its columnar model. Neo4j, a graph database, can be the perfect database for applications that need to store relationships between entities.", "Once you have narrowed down the possible choices for the type of database, try to develop a prototype integrating the main characteristics of your application. This prototype will help you evaluate the response times, the performance in terms of throughput and the capacity to scale up easily.", "For document-oriented databases, spend a few days on modeling your data starting from fixed tabular diagrams to arrive at flexible document models.", "Operational stability is a very important aspect for interactive web applications. Test and re-test your deployment as you would for applications that normally use traditional RDBMS systems.", "6- Keep up with the latest trends:", "Today, there is a plethora of quality training that offers hands-on courses for training on NoSQL. The best way to ensure a successful implementation of NoSQL is to be up to date on the latest versions.", "Don\u2019t worry, you will find it easy to adopt certain NoSQL technologies, especially if you are familiar with JSON for document format. Developers who use SQL extensively may need to adapt and learn document modeling approaches. Rethinking how data can be structured logically using documents rather than normalizing data into a fixed database schema becomes an important aspect.", "Here are links to some interesting courses:", "The objective of this article was therefore to present the main differences that exist to help you make the right decision and shape the future of your information system (or your simple application).", "We have seen that SQL and NoSQL databases ultimately do almost the same thing (store data) but in different ways. The choice of a database management system (DBMS) is therefore an important and structuring moment for any data project. Of course, it is always possible to choose an option and then switch to another later. But a little bit of conceptual analysis and thinking at the start of a project will make you save time and money.", "The market today is full of NoSQL databases \u2014 I think we are faced with two or three of them every day, because there are a lot of advantages for a developer to switch to NoSQL. A more flexible data model and freedom from rigid schemas is a big advantage. You can also see significantly improved performance and the ability to scale horizontally.", "But most NoSQL products are still in the early stages of the product cycle. For features such as complex joins, developers may prefer using a traditional RDBMS. And for some projects, a hybrid approach might be the best choice.", "To conclude, each company will have its own preferences depending on the requirements of the project. So determine your needs and the database that judiciously provides integrated support for the development of your project.", "Congratulations if you managed to get here.
