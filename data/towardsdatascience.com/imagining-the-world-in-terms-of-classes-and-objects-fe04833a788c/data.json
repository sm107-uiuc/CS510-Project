Categorization helps us in breaking down a complex thing into smaller parts. It shapes our thinking and gives us direction. e.g let us think about \u201ceverything\u201d out there in the world. Its very complex to comprehend this idea. But we can break it down into sample categories as follows:", "Classification gives us some control to better manage the complexity. It enables us to recognize, differentiate, and understand. The things or \u201cobjects\u201d belonging to each class may share common properties or \u201cattributes\u201d and may behave in a common way. We can say that objects belonging to a particular class may \u201cfunction\u201d in a similar way. e.g let us say, we have \u201cAnimals\u201d as a class. We can imagine that Elephant, Rabbit, Cow, Monkey, etc belong to this class and these animals perform some common functions like Eating, Sleeping, Running, etc. In fact, you can imagine almost any concept in the world in terms of classes and functions. Let\u2019s look at the below sentence", "Identify the nouns in this sentence \u2014 Rohan and New York. You can imagine \u201cRohan\u201d as an object which belongs to a class \u201cTourist\u201d. Similarly \u201cNew York\u201d is an object belonging to a class \u201cTourist Destination\u201d.", "Now identify the verb in the sentence. \u201cVisiting\u201d which is an action of Rohan. So, you can imagine that \u201cVisiting\u201d is the function of \u201cRohan\u201d.", "The intuition behind it is \u2014 when you are writing software for the Tourism industry, you can structure your code in the form of \u201cClasses\u201d(Tourist and Tourist Destination). \u201cVisiting\u201d is a function of \u201cTourist\u201d Class (All tourists will visit someplace). \u201cRohan\u201d is an instance of \u201cTourist\u201d Class while \u201cNew York\u201d is an instance of a \u201cTourist Destination\u201d class. These are called \u201cobjects\u201d. Every tourist and every destination can be expressed as objects of these generic classes. Also, note that every object will have common attributes. In our example, the objects from Tourist class can have attributes like Name, Age, Address while objects from Tourist Destination class can have attributes like Location address.", "The difference between a class and object is \u2014 Class is a definition or a template while Object is an instance of that definition.", "Almost every real world concept can be expressed in terms of Classes, Objects and Functions. Things are classes, actions performed by things are functions and the actual value of a thing is an object.", "Animal is a class. Monkey is an object. Jumping is the function.", "Vehicle is a class. Mercedes Benz is an object. Acceleration is the function.", "Let\u2019s look how a class is defined in Python 3", "2. Objects: The class will be realized by its \u201cobjects\u201d. These are known as \u201cinstances\u201d of this class.", "3. Instance Attributes: The objects of a class have certain attributes. In our example, an animal will have an age and a name. __init__() method is used to initialize an object\u2019s attributes by assigning their default values (or state). This method will have at least one parameter along with \u201cself\u201d.", "The \u201cSelf\u201d implies that the attributes are part of the object itself. The variables \u201cname\u201d and \u201cage\u201d belong to this object only and are independent of any other object or general variables in the program.", "__init__() method is not specifically called. As soon as an object is declared, it gets called automatically.", "4. Class Attributes: There can be some attributes that are common to a class i.e all objects of that class. In our example, category is such an attribute", "So all objects (cat and dog) are \u201cPets\u201d in this example.", "5. Instance Methods: These functions define the behavior of the objects. Like the __init__() method, the first parameter for instance methods is also Self. In our example, \u201cprintname\u201d, \u201cprintage\u201d and move are instance methods", "Let\u2019s declare two variables in Python and look at their types:", "The above output shows that \u2018a\u2019 belongs to a class called \u201cint\u201d. This also implies that \u2018a\u2019 is an object (instance) of \u201cint\u201d class. Similarly, \u2018name\u2019 belongs to a class called \u201cstr\u201d. Name is, in fact, an instance of this String class.", "It\u2019s interesting to note that the built-in data types of python are actually Classes. The variables of this data type(e.g integer or string)are actually instances of that class. In fact, everything in Python is an object of some class. (yes\u2026even the functions). You can check the definition of these classes by using the help() function", "This interesting fact about Python\u2019s built-in data types gives us a clue about the true use of Classes and Objects.", "Classes are used to create new user defined data types.", "Using your own data types enhances the Re-usability and Maintainability of your software programs.", "Our world consists of entities and these entities interact with each other. Classes and objects model the real-world entities and the relationship between them. Hence, structuring your software around them, adds a human aspect to it. It makes the program easier to read and understand.", "Steve Jobs was once asked to describe what object-oriented software is? His reply was:", "Objects are like people. They\u2019re living, breathing things that have knowledge inside them about how to do things and have memory inside them so they can remember things. And rather than interacting with them at a very low level, you interact with them at a very high level of abstraction, like we\u2019re doing right here. Here\u2019s an example: If I\u2019m your laundry object, you can give me your dirty clothes and send me a message that says, \u201cCan you get my clothes laundered, please.\u201d I happen to know where the best laundry place in San Francisco is. And I speak English, and I have dollars in my pockets. So I go out and hail a taxicab and tell the driver to take me to this place in San Francisco. I go get your clothes laundered, I jump back in the cab, I get back here. I give you your clean clothes and say, \u201cHere are your clean clothes.\u201d You have no idea how I did that. You have no knowledge of the laundry place. Maybe you speak French, and you can\u2019t even hail a taxi. You can\u2019t pay for one, you don\u2019t have dollars in your pocket. Yet I knew how to do all of that. And you didn\u2019t have to know any of it. All that complexity was hidden inside of me, and we were able to interact at a very high level of abstraction. That\u2019s what objects are. They encapsulate complexity, and the interfaces to that complexity are high level.", "Your home for data science.
