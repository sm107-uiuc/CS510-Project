The goal of this great package paletteer is to be a comprehensive collection of color palettes in R using a common interface. Think of it as the \u201ccaret of palettes\u201d.", "The package is not yet on CRAN but ff you want the development version then install directly from GitHub:", "The palettes are divided into 2 groups; discrete and continuous. For discrete palette you have the choice between the fixed width palettes and dynamic palettes. Most common of the two are the fixed width palettes which have a set amount of colors which doesn\u2019t change when the number of colors requisted vary like the following palettes:", "on the other hand we have the dynamic palettes where the colors of the palette depend on the number of colors you need like the green.pal palette from the cartography package:", "Lastly we have the continuous palettes which provides as many colors as you need for a smooth transition of color:", "This package includes 958 from 28 different packages and information about these can be found in the following data.frames: palettes_c_names, palettes_d_names and palettes_dynamic_names.", "The package also includes scales for ggplot2 using the same standard interface", "Very easy and useful. Remember to visit the GitHub repo:", "Explaining machine learning models is not always easy, yet so important for some business applications. There are great libraries that help us in this task, for example:", "BTW, sometimes a simple visualization with ggplot can help you explain a model. For more on this check this awesome article by Matthew Mayo:", "In many applications we need to know, understand or prove how input variables are used in the model and what impact do they have on final model prediction. DALEX is a set of tools that help to understand how complex models are working.", "To install from CRAN just run:", "They have amazing documentation on how to use DALEX with different ML packages:", "An interactive notebook where you can know more about the package:", "And finally a book style documentation where they talk about DALEX, machine learning and explainability:", "Check it out in the original repository:", "and remember to star it :).", "modelDown generates a website with HTML summaries for predictive models. Is uses DALEX (see above) explainers to compute and plot summaries of how given models behave. We can see how exactly scores for predictions were calculated (Prediction BreakDown), how much each variable contributes to predictions (Variable Response), which variables are the most important for a given model (Variable Importance) and how well out models behave (Model Performance).", "You can install it right now from GitHub:", "When you have the package successfully installed, you need to create DALEX explainers for you models. Here is a simple example (from the authors):", "Next, just pass all created explainers to function modelDown. For example:", "That\u2019s it! Now you should have your html page generated with default options.", "Index page presents basic information about data provided in explainers.
