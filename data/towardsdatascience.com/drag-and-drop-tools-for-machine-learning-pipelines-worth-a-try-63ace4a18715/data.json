Thinking about it, I considered that if I could find a Drag-and-Drop Machine Learning tool that is free, that has all important models and that can easily export fitted models to other languages, then it would be at least worth the try.", "I spent some time listing the existing tools for this job and verifying whether they meet those basic requirements. I share my benchmark in this article.", "The usage that I would have of such a tool is model comparison.", "Other than that, I will test the products on the following points:", "Browsing the internet, I found a number of tools. Some of those propose a free version, while others don\u2019t. I am really looking for a free tool at the moment, so I did not go further into the paid ones.", "According to the support page on their website, RapidMiner seems to support PMML for a number of their models, but not all.", "The RapidMiner model zoo seems quite good. There is support for deep learning using H2O.", "RapidMiner\u2019s free version supports only 10000 data rows and 1 logical processor. This is so limited that \u2014 for me \u2014 it\u2019s not worth testing their solution.", "The Free Edition of Dataiku has two possibilities:", "This free version seems acceptable to me, so let\u2019s go to the next point.", "There are several options to export models:", "Dataiku can use Python\u2019s scikitlearn as a modeling engine. The number of models is relatively good. There is also support for Deep Learning.", "Dataiku seems a good tool to check out. Dataiku\u2019s interoperability would be the first thing to test if I go on with it, but it is not a stopper for now.", "Weka\u2019s GUI is less smooth than RapidMiner and Dataik. It seems to be between a GUI tool and a GUI wrapper for code, so I am not sure whether it has much advantage compared to using Python notebooks for example.", "But Weka is free and open source: that is awesome, and that is why I keep it in the list.", "I did not find whether Weka proposes a button-click option to export models. Weka uses models from (amongst others) Scikit Learn, so it would be easy to use Weka for model building and then re-fit the model using scikit learn.", "As stated in the previous point, Weka uses Scikit Learn\u2019s models, which is good for me. It also supports deap learning with deaplearning4j.", "Weka seems an acceptable tool: the big question is whether it has added value compared to using Jupyter Notebooks. I would need to test it to check that out.", "MLjar has a free version that has a dataset limit of 0.25 GB, 30 days of project history and 5 credits to start with. 1 credit is 1 computational hour, so only 5 hours of usage are totally free. This is far from enough to do something serious with it.", "I did not find a way to export models from MLjar. They seem to have an API, but it is not clear whether that is for model building only or also for prediction.", "The classification models of the MLjar model zoo are only binary classification. This is too limited for me.", "MLjar seems to be starting something interesting, but for now, their solution does not seem good enough for the price and the very limited free version.", "Knime has a free and open-source version that seems quite powerful: great!", "Knime has the possibility to export models with PMML. Building an API is possible in the paid version.", "The Knime model zoo seems relatively good and also includes deep learning.", "Knime gives me a very positive impression since they have a very elaborate free version, good interoperability, and a good list of models. The GUI also looks quite smooth. And open source! This is worth checking out.", "Orange is totally free and open source: awesome!", "It is possible to save a model as a pickle. Then this pickle can be imported in Python by using orange. Using Pickle seems not the best solution for my need: I want to store the model and be able to open it with another framework.", "The Orange model zoo seems acceptable, but there is no support for deep learning.", "Orange has quite some good features. It is open source and it seems quite smooth. Unfortunately, the interoperability part is a real bummer on Orange.", "There are 2 tools that I will consider testing in more detail:", "The other tools each have their specific disadvantage:", "Thanks for reading my article, I hope it was useful for you. Don\u2019t hesitate to stay tuned for more!", "Your home for data science.
