If there is a new version released, simply change this to the name of the .jar file that you previously downloaded.", "The -Xmx and -Xms flags are allocating the memory used for the server. If you want to increase these values, you can (in muliples of 1024).", "If you are on Windows, save this file as run.bat. If you are on Linux, save this file as run.sh.

In this case, we will be opening up the default Minecraft port, 25565.", "In order to port forward, you must have admin access to your local network. Many home routers can be accessed by typing 192.168.1.1 in a web browser. Enter the admin credentials, and look for the \u201cport forwarding\u201d settings.

Give the service name anything recognizable, like \u201cMinecraft Server\u201d. Under the service type, make sure TCP/UDP is selected. For the internal and external port ranges, enter the default Minecraft port \u201c25565\u201d. Finally, for the interal IP address, enter the private IP that you found in step #7. Click apply, and then your changes will be saved.", "Open the server.properties file with your text editor of choice, and scroll down to where server-port and server-ip are. Make sure the server-port is set to the port that you just opened for port forwarding, and server-ip is your internal (private) IP address.", "These two fields should look like:", "You can also change other Minecraft settings in this file, such as difficultly, game mode, PvP, etc. Once you make all your changes, save and close this file.", "Now that the port is open for communication and the settings are properly configured, run the server again by either clicking the run.bat file (Windows) or running the command ./run.sh (Linux). Once the server is finished loading, you can test to see if your server works via your public IP address that you found in step #7. Voil\u00e0! You and your friends can now play on the server by entering this same public IP address into their Minecraft clients!", "Minecraft has been a huge part of my gaming history, and I get so much nostalgia every time I create a new world. I put this guide together to help everyone be able to share this same experience. There are so many ways to create a Minecraft server, but I wanted to write a guide to provide the simplest and quickest way to help you get started.
