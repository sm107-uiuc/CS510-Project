My partner in crime for this project has been Andrew Sproul, who just like me has lots of passion for Data Science, ML / AI and the Fantasy EPL.", "Not a great week for the Top100 players in the world, averaging 53pts, compared to the GW average score of 38 for the common folk! There were a few top100 players with scores in the 30\u201340 range (including the Chess World Champion \u2014 Magnus Carlsen \u2014 with only 26pts), so if you scored near or above that you can still feel pretty good about yourself.", "While we\u2019re on the topic of the Top 100 players in the world let\u2019s look at who the most selected players on their teams by position and the most preferred team formations for GW18.", "We used this data and the current player prices to create the team below which is a blend of the most selected players by Top100:", "Pretty good looking team, and lots of wiggle room to try some different picks on key positions, while still keeping a solid core of players.", "Looks like we\u2019re back to a more attacking 3\u20134\u20133 formation taking over as the top choice, so people are back to trying to optimize points gained from offensive players \u2014 MD and ST.", "Overall this was solid week for us with 53pts, above the average of 38. Most of our points came from our cheaper players, with Rashford and Kane disappointing once again, turning into a VERY pour investment so far :( And again we didn\u2019t pick the right captain \u2014 only 4pts from Kane.", "Let\u2019s start with the Adjusted Opponent Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "This is going to be another strange week of picks for our Algo with Wolves, Liverpool and Leicester having a relatively difficult program, so our Algo will not be making any picks from these teams. Teams with relatively easy schedules are Villa, Crystal Palace, Burnley, Man Utd, Spurs and Chelsea.", "The data below comes from an independent site that updates latest injuries much more frequently than the Fantasy Website:", "As per a reader\u2019s request last week I will now be posting the top and bottom 50 players in terms of ROI, so our readers can have a look at a broader pool of high-ROI players to pick from and overpriced and under-performing players to stay away from.", "Reminder that our algorithm takes in adjusted budget per team formation and tries to maximize spend per position for the main 11 players, and then get you subs which are good ROI value. Based on current ROI scores, filtering out any team with AVG opponent difficulty (FDR \u2265 75th %) over next three games and removing injured players from the list of available picks, our algorithm picked the team below as currently optimal for spending the full $100MM budget:", "Lots of money left in the bank with this team due to our Algorithm not picking players from Liverpool, Leicester, Sheffield, or Wolves except for Lundstram picked as top defender by total points.", "As far as our own team is concerned, we decided to not make any changes to save free transfers for the next gameweek, where we will try to get back KDB and maybe a few other key players, if possible. We picked Kane as captain before, hoping he will finally return some points on our investment.", "Looking at Best / Worst defense and offense can be used in a few different ways \u2014 for example, if a best offense team is playing a worst defense team, you might want to captain your attacking mid or striker. Also, you might want to give preference to DF and GK from the best defensive teams when looking at the algorithmic recommendations for these positions.", "Below you can see the teams, sorted by cumulative player ROI. Note that an active player is any player that has played at least 33.33% of the total possible game time. So, we are counting any player that has played a total of at least 490 minutes as active on that team.", "Man City and Wolves pulling ahead of Liverpool, as they had strong performances last week and Liverpool didn\u2019t play.", "We\u2019re just excited for the next couple of weeks of non-stop EPL action and we hope our Blog helps you make some good transfer choices that bring some extra joy to your holiday season. If there was an EPL Santa and they were reading our blog, we would like to ask them for a hat-trick by Harry Kane and at least one goal by Rashford as my early Holiday gift.", "As always, thank you for reading and we hope you enjoy the holiday season and the exciting EPL action ahead!", "Your home for data science.
