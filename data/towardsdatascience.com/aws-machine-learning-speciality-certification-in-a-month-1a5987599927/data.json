I thought this will be something worth learning and useful in my day to day job. I booked the date one month ahead and planned accordingly to achieve it. I can\u2019t recommend enough if you are in this domain and your work is related to AWS. In this post, I will share my experience of exam preparation and exam experience in itself.", "I had worked in Data Science Field before and during my Masters studies in Data Science. In my current job, I wanted to focus on Data Engineering related work where I worked on creating data pipelines in AWS for the data platform. I had worked in Data Science projects, projects involving machine learning deployment in production and projects using AWS services before taking the exam. I personally wanted to learn more about machine learning in production with AWS. Thought this will help me in delivering end-to-end machine learning products in AWS. Nowadays, most of the companies are looking for these skills, knowing only data science might not be sufficient.", "There are different levels of certifications available on AWS website. I did not start with Associate level certificates as I had relevant experience to showcase that already but one can take those to know about most of the services provided by AWS. I was looking for machine learning specific and this Speciality certificate hit that spot very well. That is why I aimed directly for Machine Learning Speciality exam. That\u2019s when I decided to book the date. I knew that I can postpone the test 24 hours before the exam if I feel like I am not prepared. But giving myself less time pushed me to stay on the plan.", "First thing I did to check if I can pull this off or not was to check the sample questions from their Machine Learning Speciality Certification Page. I did not know the answers right away but I knew which parts I can handle after some studying and which parts I already knew. Machine Learning related stuff like NLP, optimization and models I was comfortable with. AWS specific solutions and built-in algorithms I thought needed some work on my side. This just gave me an idea if it was possible to pass the exam or not with some effort in one month.", "On the same page, AWS has given the exam guide which covers the main domains that will be covered in exam. This also gives a better idea of how much is already known to you and what needs more preparation. For me I had touched those domains in one or the other way during some of my projects so it was a good indicator that I can understand those topics and use cases.", "Following are the main resources I used for preparation:", "I can totally recommend the first two resources for preparation as I felt the practice test gave a better idea of how the exam questions are designed and it also covers most of the type and content of the exam domains. First course covers the necessary material for the exam and all the domains mentioned. It is nicely structured and to the point material for the exam. They haven\u2019t covered the basics of ML and the details of ML models because it is assumed that if you are appearing for this exam you should have experience of using data science in practice.", "For example, as an experienced machine learning practitioner you should know how to optimize the model, what all parameters needs to be tuned and how to clean the data in order to improve the model. It includes deep learning built-in algorithms when and where to use it. Based on use cases whether you should choose custom models or transfer learning on top of built-in models itself etc. But the course won\u2019t go into details. That makes sense as per the exam prerequisites.", "For me the course and exam tests were really helpful in tackling the actual problems in the exam. AWS itself gives lot of digital courses and classroom courses as well. I found some courses mentioned in points 3 & 4 above which were useful. Course 3 went into bit of depth of solutions provided and various use cases which were not in the Udemy course. I liked that it had few labs which was good to get some hands-on become comfortable with the tools used. Course 4 was something I watched out of interest, if you are interested and you have time you can go through that as well.", "AWS SageMaker Developer guide is very well documented resource for SageMaker and I found it useful to go through it apart from these courses. It is hard to cover everything in a course, so if time permits it is useful to go through the documentation. Especially I went into details of built-in algorithms.", "In the first one and half weeks I went through the Udemy course and some readings related to those topics. I gave the first practice test exam and I had pretty good idea about what type of questions are there and what I need to pay attention to in the course.", "After in the next 2 weeks I went through the course while making notes for points which I had discovered I need to remember explicitly. Along with that I went through some AWS courses mentioned above and as well as their documentation.", "In the last 5 days I gave the test exam multiple times. I also went through AWS sample questions. That\u2019s when I knew I can totally appear for this exam and no need to postpone.", "Actual exam to be honest I felt was difficult than what I expected or prepared for. I was really satisfied with the difficulty level as they considered that you have knowledge about practical implementation and machine learning knowledge in general as well. I was able to complete the exam in one and half hours without going back to questions for reviewing. Many prefer to mark few questions for review and you can go back to those questions at the end where you were unsure.", "Some of my previous knowledge from projects and my mathematical background in machine learning was useful in tackling those problems. It was not part of something I prepared in this previous one month. One should know based on underlying data which models to choose and what is the reasoning behind that. Similarly you should be able choose the right built-in models or services for a given use case and resource restrictions etc. I felt like this test exam I practiced before the exam prepared me for thinking in that direction but be prepared to find some questions related to ML topics that might not be covered in the courses mentioned above.", "I hope this material and planning experience will help you if you are aiming for it :)", "As always \u2014 Happy experimenting and exploring!", "Your home for data science.
