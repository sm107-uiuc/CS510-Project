The head of the department during my first job couldn\u2019t trust another team to build the data pipeline and ended up writing a big portion of the ETL code himself and had the data team reporting to him directly.", "Why do these senior executives put so much emphasis on data?", "Because without a good grasp of data, you won\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) have much confidence in the insights and recommendations that you derive from the data.", "For data to move from its raw form all the way to being ready for analysis, it\u2019s gone through a lot of processes. A good data scientist must question every step of the process relentlessly, and ask questions like:", "The purpose of this article is to go through some data architecture related topics using real-world examples so that you have some basic context and know what questions to ask your data team.", "As mentioned before, I started my career working for a major insurance company, in a team where all data processes are done by ourselves.", "Every month, we take a copy of a long list of tables from the production database and put it onto our SQL server which we call the staging database.", "Production database: this is the transaction database used by various departments to administer insurance policies and claims in real time.", "Staging database: this is a snapshot of the production database for all sorts of analysis work. Typically a snapshot is taken once a month, but sometimes it is taken more frequently upon ad-adhoc requests.", "The purpose of the staging database is so that we don\u2019t interfere with the normal business operation.", "This should never happen, but it did happen once due to a data connection setting problem. We received phone calls from the IT department every 5 minutes, as everyone has been complaining the system is frozen\u2026", "The staging environment is safe for the analytics team to work in. Moreover, you are guaranteed to have the same result as long as you run your code against the staging database.", "Once all the tables have been copied onto the staging database, we perform a series of data processing steps to turn these into a handful of denormalized tables.", "The raw tables in the production system are called normalized tables which is a core concept behind relational databases. Each table contains data about different things and can be linked together via primary and foreign keys.", "For analytics purposes, a large number of table joins are required before you can have something useful.", "For example, say you want to predict the probability of having a building insurance claim given the characteristics of the building. Ideally, you need a flat table where", "To create the flat table you need to join the claim table (which tells you whether or not there is a claim), the policy table (which has the policy information) and the risk table (which has the building information) together.", "This process is called denormalization. The result is a denormalized or flat table where the data is well organized and ready to be analyzed.", "You may think that this is no big deal. We just perform a few joins and it\u2019s done, isn\u2019t it? What could go wrong?", "A lot can go wrong. You may have duplicated records. You may unintentionally gain or lose records.", "This is what I was told to do when I started my first job, and I believe I still benefit from these good habits today.", "If we skip these steps, we could end up wasting more time down the track. This is a lesson I learned again and again in many different projects.", "After a lot of efforts, we end up a few core tables that satisfy the needs of the entire team, which include:", "These are all flat tables and are produced monthly and put onto a common server. Whoever needs to do any analysis just makes a copy of these flat tables, knowing that the data can be trusted.", "ETL stands for Extraction, Transform and Load. It may sound fancy, but you\u2019ve seen the process already. \u201cExtract\u201d is when we copy the data from the production database to the staging database. \u201cLoad\u201d is when we deliver the final core datasets. \u201cTransform\u201d is all the work in between.", "Throughout the entire process, we had robust data checks every step along the way:", "At that time, most of the data integrity checks, as well as the original ETL process was written in SAS programs. Typically after adding these checks, the size of SAS programs increases by a factor of 3.", "Indeed, checking takes more effort than doing!", "Everyone in the team can pick up the dataset and immediately work with it confidently knowing it\u2019s been checked every step along the way.", "In addition to robust data checks, we also spent a lot of time learning how data is generated in the first place.", "This was done by sitting with the people who input the data every day. In our case, it was the sales department for policy data and claims department for claims data.", "We sat alongside the frontline staff, listening to them answer customer\u2019s questions, typing data into the system. We tried our best to understand how they did their job and built a good deal of domain expertise. Check out this article I wrote on the importance of building up domain expertise.", "While the above process might be good for detecting data quality problems, it doesn\u2019t fix them going forward. That\u2019s why a feedback loop is needed.", "Every month, we publish a set of data quality reports and shared them with the management team. Some of the things we look for are", "The data quality performance is tied to the KPI of staff and forms part of the metrics that drive their remuneration. This provides a powerful incentive for everyone to care about data quality.", "This would never be possible without the support from the senior management of the company. I believe a data-driven decision-making culture can never be driven from bottom up. It needs to come from the top down.", "So far, I have explained the traditional approach. We were using SAS back then. The word data engineer or data scientist wasn\u2019t used by people. Nowadays, a lot has changed, but these concepts are still relevant.", "Next, I will discuss a few topics that became increasingly relevant in recent years.", "The data extracted from the IT system is called internal data because it is internally generated.", "External data is really powerful and can significantly enrich and complement internal data. The type of external data varies significantly by context.", "In the case of building insurance, here are some examples of the external data that can be used:", "In the case of motor insurance, here are some examples of additional external data that can be used:", "Most of the data discussed above is structured data. Examples of unstructured data include:", "As you can see, unstructured data typically require some additional processing to become useful for our tasks, e.g. insurance risk modeling.", "So far I have only discussed batch processing. The ETL process takes at least 2\u20133 days. Adding another few days for analysis, you won\u2019t have any output until at least a week after the data becomes available.", "Real-time analytics is different. The moment data comes in, it gets processed and analyzed.", "Can you imagine that the moment you buy a product, Amazon says to you:", "\u201cDear customer, thanks for your purchase. Please wait for a week and we\u2019ll recommend some products that interest you.\u201d", "That never happens. They provide a recommendation instantly. This allows them to generate 35% of their revenue on Amazon.com from recommendations.", "Real-time analytics is often within the realms of data engineers. Take the COVID-19 as an example, these are batch processing based static dashboard results that I created. It was a pain to update the results. By the time I publish these articles, the numbers were already out of date.", "Status Update of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak \u2014 published Mar 17", "Status Update of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak \u2014 published Feb 29", "Coronavirus outbreak \u2014 5 questions to ask big data \u2014 published Feb 1", "Compare the above to this interactive dashboard which shows the spread of the COVID-19 virus around the world and in particular in Singapore since late January. The entire process happens automatically as new data comes in.", "Real-world analytics delivers the result just when it is most needed \u2014 who cares about what COVID-19 figures were a week ago?", "Let\u2019s apply the same logic to the insurance sector. Why should the CEO of an insurance company care about the sales volume or loss ratios from 3 months ago? Yet, today most insurance companies still consume monthly or quarterly reports.", "With some exceptions such as real-time fraud analysis, the insurance industry tends to be slow to adopt these new technologies. As tools like R-Shiny and Dash make it much easier and more affordable to deploy real-time analytics I expect it to gain momentum in the near future.", "Within the data science world, there are a lot of sexy topics \u2014 AI, deep learning, big data\u2026", "Data architecture is not one of these sexy topics. The company executives won\u2019t ever attract any media attention by saying \u201cwe have built a world-class data integrity check\u201d. It\u2019s hard work. It takes a lot of discipline to get it right. However, if you do manage to get it right, it will probably deliver more value than any of those sexy topics.", "As a data scientist, it pays to spend some time learning about these concepts so that you can communicate effectively with your data team and ensure you have a robust data process that lays down a solid foundation for all your analytics work.", "Your home for data science.
