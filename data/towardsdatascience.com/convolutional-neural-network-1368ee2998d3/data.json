Despite having breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence, even today machines are incapable of being regarded as intelligent. Neural Network is a domain of Artificial Intelligence which aims at mimicking the brain structure of the human body. One of the basic types of Neural Network called Artificial Neural Network(ANN) is efficient in finding the hidden patterns in the provided data and give out the result.", "NOTE: This article assumes the reader to have a basic understanding of Neural Networks", "A question still persists that even though machines can process and understand the data given to them but do they have the capability to see things like humans?", "YES! Providing vision to the machine seems an absurd thing to say but one such Neural Network called Convolutional Neural Network imparts the partial sense of vision to the Machines.", "Since an image is just a collection of numerical pixel values, can\u2019t ANN\u2019s process it? The answer to this is NO! Though ANN classifies well on the numerical data, it lacks the consideration of spatial relationships while processing the image. Let me simplify it. While processing the list of images, if ANN finds that a cat occurs in the top right corner of one image then it will assume that it will always appear there. Hence no matter where your cat is in the image, if it cannot find it in the top right corner then it will give out a negative result.", "On the other side, Convolutional Neural Network, also known as ConvNet performs exceptionally well in finding an object anywhere in the image. Also, don\u2019t worry if your cat is grumpy, it will still identify it.", "The above image represents the basic architecture of the ConvNet which contains terms such as Pooling, FC Layer, Convolution that may seem overwhelming at first glance. This article aims at demystifying such terms and getting intuition behind using it.", "Getting started, let\u2019s understand what are we feeding to the network!", "The image that we see looks mesmerizing to us. But that\u2019s not how the machine looks at it. It sees it as a collection of numerical pixel values representing the intensity values of color channels. The dimension of this image is 5999 x 4000 x 3; where 3 depicts the number of color channels i.e. RGB. Other color channels can be HSV, GrayScale, and many more.", "In mathematics, a concept called Convolution takes two functions into account and produces a third function expressing how the shape of one function is affected by the other. Imagine applying a filter to your photo. What happens here is, it takes your photo and applies the function of the filter which may be to highlight the shadows. Filter activates certain features of your image and produces an output image.", "So the question arises, what are these filters? Filters are nothing but 3D matrices having specific values that get excited when they see a desired pattern in the neighborhood. They are considerably smaller than the input image which slides over the width and height of the image.", "When the filter slides over the image it focuses on a certain neighborhood of the image. It performs an arithmetic operation of the filter and the portion of the image and stores the result in a single cell. In technical terminology, cells are regarded as Neurons. Multiple such neurons, when combined, form a 2D matrix called Activation Map/ Feature Map, or rather I would say the collection of the likings of the filter from the image. The neighborhood which is pointed by a single neuron is called a Local Receptive Field.", "Now, this feature map is a result of feature extraction done by one filter. In the case of the Convolution layer, multiple features are used which in turn produces multiple feature maps. The feature maps are stacked together to be passed on as input to the next layer.", "Higher the number of filters, higher is the number of feature maps and deeper is the extraction of the features.", "The size of the output image is bound to reduce after the convolution operation. The parameters which control the size of the output volume are stride, filter size, and padding.", "3. Padding: As the name suggests it adds an insignificant cover around the original image to keep the size of the output image intact. Calculation of the number of layers to be added is done using the formula P=(((O-1)*S)+F-W)/2 where O is the size of the output image, W is the size of an input image, F is the filter size, P is the number of layers pixels to be added as padding, and S is the stride. For example, if the size of the input image is 5x 5, the filter size is 3 x 3, the stride is 1 and we want the same size of the output image as the input image, the valid padding would be 1.", "Now that we have done the heavy lifting on the image, its time to think of the next step in the process.", "We aspire to make our neural network to be flexible i.e. no matter what the data is, it should be efficient enough to identify from the data. Since the feature maps we have can be represented using some linear function, the uncertainty factor seems to be missing. We need functions to introduce uncertainty, or rather I should say non-linearity, into our neural network.", "There are many functions capable of performing this task but, these two functions are widely used.", "Sigmoid: It introduces non-linearity using the function g(z)=1/1+e\u207b\u1dbb which transforms the numbers to range between 0\u20131. One of the major problems with the Sigmoid function is the Vanishing Gradient Problem. Don\u2019t worry if you are unfamiliar with the term. This post by Chi-Feng Wang explains the phenomenon of the Vanishing gradient.", "ReLU: ReLU stands for the Rectified Linear Unit. It thresholds the input at 0 using the function g(w)=max(0,w). Performance of the ReLU is better than Sigmoid function also, it partly tackles with the vanishing gradient problem. Though one problem that ReLU suffers from is the dying ReLU problem which is resolved by its variant called Leaky ReLU.", "Now that we have made our network strong enough to adapt to changes, we can focus on the other problem of computation time. If you remember, the dimension of our image was 5999 x 4000 x 3 which counts to 71,988,000 pixel values for a single image and we have many such. Though machines are exceptionally fast, it will take quite some time to process these humongous number of pixel values.", "One basic instinct would be to select a dominant value among the group. This is achieved by the machines using an operation called Pooling.", "We define a pooling window, let\u2019s say 2 x 2. Similar to filters this window slides over the image and selects a dominant value from the window. Definition of the dominant changes with the approach.", "One of the approaches is Max Pooling which is widely popular where the maximum value from the image within the window is selected. This reduces the size to 25%. Other pooling approaches include Average Pooling, L2 norm of the rectangular neighborhood which differs in the approach of selecting the dominant value.", "Hence, the main motive for having the Pooling layer is for dimensionality reduction. Although, there have been talks about removing the pooling layers and substituting it with the Convolution Layer instead. Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net proposes one such architecture where they suggest using larger stride once a while to reduce the dimensionality of the initial representation.", "The key difference between the ANN and CNN is the ability of CNN to process the spatial relationships in the image and apart from that, the computation power is the same for both. Since we have provided a platform to process the spatial relationships using Convolution, Activation, and Pooling, we can now leverage the power of ANN.", "Fully Connected Layers are the representation of the regular neural network or Multi LayerPerceptron (MLP).", "The main idea behind using these layers is to learn through the non-linear combinations of the high-level features extracted by the convolution and pooling layers. While training the network, the weights between the neurons act as a parameter that is tweaked while training. As this layer accepts the input in the 1D vector form, we need to flatten the output from the previous layers to feed to the FC layer.", "The output of this layer, in case of classification of multiple classes, are real values for each class. To gain some insight from these values, the Softmax function is used. More about the Softmax function can be found here. It converts these real values into class probabilities. The class with the highest probability is then extracted as the predicted class.", "While these are not the only layers used in building the CNN, they are the basic building blocks of it. Depending on the nature of the problem, multiple other types of layers such as DropOut Layer and Normalization Layer can be added.", "There are numerous architectures of CNN that have proven to perform exceptionally well on the classification of images. Few of them are:", "While these architectures are ready to use, I urge you to play around with the architecture and build one of your own.", "Thanks for reading! Hope this article helps in getting a basic intuition about the Convolutional Neural Network. You can reach out to me on my Email, LinkedIn in case of any feedback or suggestions. I would love to hear them!", "Next article will be focused on an end to end example for CNN!", "Your home for data science.
