It\u2019s usually not an algorithm or a code base to decipher \u30fc it\u2019s everything else. This is more or less true regardless of the path taken in becoming a data scientist: whether graduate school or a boot camp, self-study or otherwise. In fact, the parts of being a data scientist unrelated to data may well present both challenges and opportunities throughout the course of a career.", "Within many organizations, the data science team is kept separate, at times left to its own devices, considered an engineering or technology function. The separation reinforces the natural tendency of data scientists to keep to themselves. Whether socializing or at work, we may opt to do so together, creating an echo chamber in which we hear ourselves most loudly.", "The downside to all of this is that many people really don\u2019t fully understand what we do (it could be said that they may not want to, either). In fairness, we don\u2019t help matters. Communication is not necessarily a strong suit for most data scientists, and the field itself can be jargon-laden, rife with difficult-to-explain technical concepts for the uninitiated. There is the potential for us to become our own worst enemies.", "The point is that there are many other skills data scientists need to cultivate in order to be successful at work, beyond the technical skills that excite us and lead us to data science in the first place.", "What follows is a set of suggestions for those in the field looking to manage their career, grow personally and professionally, and become more effective in what they do as data scientists. These suggestions are based largely on my experience over the course of a 20-year career in data science, much of it spent in finance (with the last several more specifically in fintech).", "The discipline of data science includes a set of technical skills with broad applications that have grown in demand with the advent of \u201cBig Data\u201d. Data science now has too many use cases to count: epidemiology, pharmaceuticals, finance and banking, media and advertising. Even \u2018Money Ball\u2019. We are needed most everywhere.", "The number of applications is both a blessing and a curse, however.", "As data scientists, we may understand the challenges at work in technical terms but lack an understanding of the broader context important to comprehending and solving problems in a meaningful, practical way.", "In establishing and building a career as a data scientist, domain matters. Unless you\u2019re an industry expert who becomes a data scientist along the way, it takes time to be of use. We learn as we go, off and on, and not just when it comes to the stack, finding our way around the data.", "At some point, you\u2019ll have to figure out whether the industry you\u2019re in is something of interest to you beyond data science (unless, that is, it picks you). That\u2019s the big, fundamental question.", "For me, that industry was finance, though I didn\u2019t know it at first, and wasn\u2019t really ready for it to begin with. I\u2019d been both interested in and intimidated by it. It would be several years after my first job as a data scientist before I found my way into a bank.", "After graduate school in statistics, I spent a handful of years as a data analyst in marketing and advertising, first at an ad agency on Madison Avenue, followed by stints at a travel company, and a large magazine and book publisher. I began by analyzing survey data used by planners to inform advertising, which then evolved into direct marketing and the development of response models. While I found the technical challenges of the work intriguing and the impact of my role visible, the industries in which I worked were less than compelling.", "Towards the end of that time, I talked my way into a role with the new business development group at the publisher, which I did by identifying an opportunity for the publisher to sell the tours from the travel company where I had worked previously to the readership of its magazines. When I mentioned the idea to my boss, she suggested I reach out to the head of marketing at the travel company to see if he was interested \u2014 of course, he was! My boss then introduced me to the head of business development at the publisher, and I then set up a meeting between him and the head of marketing at the travel company. Within weeks I transferred into the group.", "My job was to build statistical models using our data in order to market financial services provided by other companies, everything from insurance policies to retirement plans. I realized just how much I enjoyed business development and the capacity of the models to identify an opportunity. I also learned a bit about finance, which in turn led ultimately to my first job in banking, an industry in which I have now worked for the last 15 or so years.", "Finance can appear daunting from the outside looking in. It has its own lingo and with it, a reputation, often deserved, for taking no prisoners. While I had sufficient technical skills to begin with, I had to learn about the industry, how it functioned, what the problems and challenges were and how to approach and solve them.", "Quantitative Finance (often referred to as \u2018Financial Engineering\u2019) is likely to be attractive for many data scientists with some background in mathematics. Working in finance, though, requires an understanding of financial instruments and markets that goes well beyond data science. In my case, this meant understanding and learning to apply credit spread and default models, such as those of Hull-White and Vasicek, among other things. For others, this will also include option pricing models (i.e., Black-Scholes).", "Work in finance also requires a degree of intestinal fortitude. It is a high stakes, hard to predict world where things can go wrong fast. The industry is run by a self-assured, often cocky bunch of people who can appear intimidating from the outside looking in. You have to be ready to work hard, move at a faster pace, in an environment that is often demanding \u2500 something I liked and was ready for by the time I joined a bank, but is not for everyone. Ultimately I found my niche within credit, an area of finance with greater predictability. Bonds pay a fixed coupon, for example. Mortgage rates generally remain constant over a set period. Risk can be diversified and pooled, and cash flows become more dependable.", "Understanding and appreciating context matters. What follows are a few thoughts on getting up to speed in the industry which you find yourself working:", "There are other, less time-consuming ways to gain an understanding of the industry or field in which you find yourself, some of which include the following:", "Sometimes things break your way. The stars align and your career takes off.", "At some point, this happened for me. I was hired as a data scientist for a consulting group within a large financial services company. The company had software it sold out into the market, which the team I belonged to customized. Over time I graduated from doing the work to managing the team.", "Things did not begin that way, though.", "Back to that job at the large financial services company. The project I inherited was woefully behind schedule and in jeopardy of becoming a real problem. The project manager was relocating to Europe and would have limited availability. At the time he was based in the Midwest and much closer to the client than I was in New York. I flew out, spent a week with him, after which I was introduced to the client and was given the reins.", "The codebase was a mess, the team a demoralized, ragtag bunch in search of direction.", "We finished the project on time, despite all sorts of challenges, and on budget. Nine months in I asked for and got a promotion, taking over for my boss who had just gotten promoted himself.", "My clients called me a \u201cplayer-coach\u201d, and that gave me an idea. When the project was over I found myself wondering what to do next. I summoned up the courage to schedule a meeting with my boss to discuss just that, and found myself with a promotion to manage the team. I graduated into the role, earned it.", "It turned out to be much harder than I had anticipated. There\u2019s really no handbook for managing other people. You learn by doing, which can mean fumbling. I thought about my own mentors, followed the golden rule, gave it my all.", "A friend of mine is a software engineer for a large financial technology company in New York similar to the firm where I landed my first management job. He\u2019s now in his late 20\u2019s and has come a long way in his career from when we first met at a Meetup where I was giving a talk. He is now contemplating a move to manage people. I think it\u2019s a good idea. As a step in that direction, he\u2019s started to manage a project with a dedicated team. He\u2019s picked up project management skills, is mastering the Agile process, and effectively owns the development of a piece of a much bigger project. I\u2019d say he\u2019s well on his way towards managing people on a more permanent basis.", "It\u2019s not for everyone. People skills are important and may not come naturally for those of us who work in technical fields. Thinking back on my own experience, the advice I now follow and look to give others includes the following:", "Along the way I have ended up doing many things that I had not expected to do, nor had any inkling I was capable of. With time one thing you learn not to say is \u201cI wasn\u2019t hired to do that\u201d. Yes, it\u2019s important to stay in your lane (there\u2019s something to \u2018comparative advantage\u2019). And yet if no one else can do the work, jump in.", "Over the course of my career, I have been fortunate enough to have worked with many intelligent people, often as a boss, though just as often as a colleague or peer. Working with smart people can be daunting: they push us, show us how to do things we might not have otherwise known we could do, and make us better in the process.", "On a few occasions, these people have helped me in profound ways.", "One of my early mentors was a PhD economist from the University of Pennsylvania, an immigrant who worked his way into the program when the professor who would ultimately become his thesis advisor visited India on sabbatical. He was among the most self-effacing and humble people I\u2019ve ever met. Which isn\u2019t to say that he would not grow frustrated \u3161 not by lack of intelligence, but by ignorance posing as intellect. Understandable.", "Sarma helped me to pick up coding. And when I started the graduate degree in economics we would derive formulas together (he also put me up on 9/11, when I couldn\u2019t get back into Manhattan from the Westchester offices outside of the city where we both worked).", "My experience with Sarma stands in stark contrast to those I\u2019ve had working with others. As the role of data scientist became a \u2018thing\u2019, some data scientists grew arrogant and began to act like demi-gods.", "At the end of the day, no one likes a know-it-all, the kind of person who graces us with their presence. I had one data scientist tell me that a client was interested to work with us in order to be \u2018nerd adjacent\u2019. Hmm. Ok, fine. The impulse to dazzle, do pirouettes and yell \u201clook at me, I can use scikit!\u201d needs to be watched. In an effort to impress we may lose sight of how intimidating and off-putting this becomes. Check yourself.", "Don\u2019t show off too much. You may have a degree or two from a prestigious university, have written software or a book, spoken at large conferences, or be \u2018someone\u2019. Whatever. A little humility goes a long way.", "In the end, there is more to data science than coding or modeling. Much more. And not just data engineering, either, but the other, often non-technical, aspects to the job that aren\u2019t taught in graduate schools or bootcamps \u30fcor often anywhere else, really, except on the job. Focus on these skills, too, and you\u2019ll succeed in ways you may never have imagined.", "Your home for data science.
