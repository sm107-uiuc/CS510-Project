(thanks to Koki Yoshimoto).", "Since they started leveraging the technology, tech companies have received numerous accusations regarding the unethical use of artificial intelligence.", "One example comes from Alphabet\u02bcs Google, which created a hate speech- detection algorithm that assigned higher \u201ctoxicity scores\u201d to the speech of African Americans than their white counterparts.", "Researchers at the University of Washington analyzed databases of thousands of tweets deemed \u201coffensive\u201d or \u201chateful\u201d by the algorithm and found that black-aligned English was more likely to be labeled as hate speech.", "This is one of countless instances of bias emerging from AI algorithms. Understandably, these issues have generated a lot of attention. Conversations on ethics and bias have been one of the top themes in AI in the recent past.", "Organizations and actors across industries are engaging in research to eliminate bias through fairness, accountability transparency and ethics (FATE). Yet, research that is solely focused on model architecture and engineering is bound to yield limited results. So, how can you address this?", "Fixing the model is insufficient, as that\u02bcs not where the root cause lies. To find out which measures can yield better results, we must first understand the real reasons. We can then look at potential solutions by studying what we do in the real world to tackle such biases.", "AI models learn by studying patterns and identifying insights from historical data. But human history (and our present) is far from perfect. So, it\u02bcs no surprise that these models end up mimicking and amplifying the biases that lie in the data used to train them.", "This is fairly clear to all of us. But, how do we handle such inherent bias in our world?", "In the real world, we must inject bias to fight bias.", "When we feel that a community or segment of the population could be disadvantaged, we avoid basing our conclusion solely on past instances. At times, we go a step further and make inclusions to provide opportunity to such segments. This is a small step to reversing the trend.", "This is the very step that we must take while teaching models. So, how do we inject human bias to fight the inherent \u201clearned\u201d bias of models? Here are some steps to achieve that.", "You need your team to look beyond technology when it comes to building responsible AI models. While it\u02bcs important to educate data science professionals on data privacy, this will have limited benefits. By bringing in people from the social sciences and humanities, you can gain access to skill sets and expertise that will help you mitigate potential biases within AI models.", "People from these kinds of backgrounds will better understand users and ethical considerations and provide a human perspective on the insights generated. Anthropologists and sociologists can spot stereotypes in the models that might have slipped past the data scientist who created them and can correct the data for underlying bias.", "Behavioral psychologists in data science teams can help bridge the gap between users and technology and ensure fairness in the model outcomes.", "You must look beyond technology when it comes to building responsible AI models.", "As well as valuing diverse skill sets, it\u02bcs also vital for data science teams to bring in more members of a different gender, race or nationality than the norm. A diverse team offers fresh perspectives, questions age-old norms which may be outdated and prevents the team from slipping into the trap of group-think.", "For example, the Google team that built the iOS YouTube app didn\u02bct consider left-handed users when it added in mobile uploads, as all of the people on the team were right-handed.", "This meant that videos that were recorded in a left- handed person\u02bcs view appeared upside-down. All it would have taken was a few left-handed people to make the app significantly more user-friendly for 10% of the global population.", "No matter how sophisticated your model may be, it needs to be designed with human intervention. Humans can be part of a fail-safe mechanism, or better yet, data science teams can incorporate human judgment on a continuous basis and enrich the model progressively.", "With AI being used in critical areas that involve human health or lives, it should be considered mission-critical with zero tolerance \u2014 not just for downtime or errors, but also for bias. The only way to achieve this is by keeping humans in charge to ensure that AI bias is avoided.", "Plan for zero tolerance of models, not just for downtime or errors, but also for bias.", "Doctors at a hospital in Jupiter, Fla. exemplified the necessity to never blindly trust AI algorithms: they dismissed IBM Watson\u02bcs suggestions for cancer treatments that could have had fatal consequences. Data science teams are constantly challenged to build better models and foolproof systems.", "However, this doesn\u02bct mean that humans can be removed from the systems. Things do go wrong, even if it is in a minority of cases. We must design humans into the decision-making process to take control in every such instance.", "Most business data science teams\u02bc primary targets are centered around delivering more revenue, engineering the most accurate models and automating processes for maximum efficiency. However, these goals ignore that someone (or multiple people) must ensure that the \u201cright\u201d thing is being done.", "Data science teams must be held accountable for outcomes and must ensure that the business problem they are solving is not achieved at the expense of an ethical code. Ask yourself: Is your data science team incentivized by revenue and timeline alone? Or do they consider responsible product use and fair outcomes as an integral success criteria for the project?", "If the former is true, you need to rethink the goals that drive your team.", "To ensure responsible AI use, you must elevate the moral fiber of your data science team.", "In order to ensure responsible AI use, you must elevate the moral fiber of your data science team. This needs active conservation and continuous education. Additionally, you also must plan for senior roles such as chief ethics officer or an ethics committee that will become the moral watchdog of your product.", "However, this doesn\u02bct remove the need to place the responsibility on everyone else involved: you need accountability at all levels. For example, Paula Goldman became Salesforce\u02bcs first-ever chief ethical and humane use officer.", "By having continuous conversations about the quality of AI solutions and their impact on society at large, you can instill a sense of responsibility from the top and ensure a trickle-down effect onto the rest of your team. There also are best practices and guidelines available, like these from Google.", "While Big Tech has generally had its fair share of AI ethics blunders, we have also seen some right steps being taken forward. Both Microsoft and IBM have been vocal in their commitment to tackling bias in both their own programs and third-party ones.", "Many individuals within companies and in the wider consumer community place too much trust in AI without understanding its capabilities and flaws. And while business leaders often overlook this, we can\u02bct expect all consumers to understand the promise of today\u02bcs AI.", "People assume that AI can work wonders, but without data, talent or the right processes, it will be doomed to fail. Educating team members and consumers that AI is still in its initial stages \u2014 and should be treated as such \u2014 is vital to avoid blind trust that results in disastrous outcomes and bigger disappointments.", "Users must understand that AI solutions are there to inform, not dictate.", "Expectations on the capabilities of AI algorithms must remain realistic. Just as you might be reluctant to let your car run in autopilot mode in a crowded street, we must understand the limitations today. People need to understand that AI solutions should be seen in the same way \u2014 they are there to inform, not dictate.", "Ultimately, in order to achieve responsible use of AI, you need to embed certain attributes in your organization\u02bcs core. Culture takes shape over years and is extremely difficult to change. Organizations that aspire to be data-driven must have certain attributes in the core of its culture. Sow these seeds when your startup is in its early stages, rather than years later.", "So, what are these crucial attributes that are so essential to responsible and ethical use of AI?", "Curiosity. Ask yourself: Are all team members willing to experiment with the necessary steps to find the answers they need? Or are they comfortable executing the laid-out steps and processes? A curious team will find ways to make AI work to meet the outcomes.", "The next is willingness to question beliefs: Does your company have a healthy environment for teams to question established practices? Do higher-ups listen and encourage challenging feedback? Teams must have an open culture to speak up when they see that AI is being implemented in a way that is not in line with the organization\u02bcs ideals.", "Finally, company culture must promote flexibility to change. Working with technologies and data science naturally involves a lot of change \u2014 both in creating solutions and adopting them. Are teams willing to adapt based on what they have discovered through curiosity and by questioning set processes?", "Having the right company culture lays the foundation for ethical AI use. Facebook is known to promote a culture of \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d Given the countless scandals over user privacy and abuse of data the tech giant has faced, this mantra has clearly not resulted in sound AI use.", "Responsible use of AI doesn\u2019t happen just by making some adjustments to the model.", "Responsible use of AI is not something that happens overnight, nor is it something that can be assured simply by making a single adjustment to the model and expecting miraculous results.", "As we have seen in the wave of accusations of \u201cethics washing\u201d that is currently sweeping the tech industry, simply stating that you\u02bcre going to combat AI bias with little action to back up the claim just won\u02bct cut it.", "Avoiding AI bias can only come by adding human input at various stages, and in a number of ways. By diversifying data science teams, building humans into the process, holding the team accountable, setting realistic expectations of AI\u02bcs capabilities and, finally \u2014 and perhaps most crucially \u2014 building the right company culture, you can pave the way for the ethical use of AI in your organization.", "This article was first published on ExtraCrunch, TechCrunch\u2019s membership edition.
