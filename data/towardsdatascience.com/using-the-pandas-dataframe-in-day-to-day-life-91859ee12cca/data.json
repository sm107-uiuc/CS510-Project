It is worth reading it.", "There are two important necessary steps that you need to take care to perform smooth functioning:", "Note \u2192 If you are using Google Colab or any Jupyter notebook environment, then you can skip the Python installation step.", "Let\u2019s understand a scenario here and come up with a solution using Pandas DataFrame.", "\u201cEverybody does and loves to do shopping (grocery). Not all the time you grocery shop at the same store, you shop based on discounts and offers (I do). Now obviously it\u2019s a good practice to keep track of shopping details like the store name, location, amount, date, etc.\u201d", "To store and manipulate date I know you will use \u201cMicrosoft Excel\u201d but the catch point here is we will use \u201cPandas DataFrame\u201d which is by far easier and fun to use. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll show you how.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, \u201cMicrosoft Excel\u201d is where it\u2019s at. But to all those Python enthusiasts this is the best example to understand and take Pandas to next level.", "Let\u2019s solve the above scenario using Pandas DataFrame. Now in order to that, you need to follow certain steps to not commit mistakes. I will provide a systematic way of using Pandas so that you can use it mechanically in your upcoming projects or whatever.", "Let\u2019s use the concept of aliasing and use the pandas as pd. So in the later steps, rather than using pandas every time, we can just tell pd.", "Thanks to whoever introduced the concept of aliasing.", "For those of you who don\u2019t about Python list. Please look it up here. Since I\u2019m currently living in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. So most of the grocery stores would be similar or different when compared to yours. Please bear that in mind. It really does not matter, you can feed the data as per your choice.", "Now, what do I mean by \u201cfor the first time\u201d, is that later say suppose if you keep on doing grocery shopping in the future, rather than storing the values manually in the list. The list would be grown as long as a train. Also, this is not recommended. So I have written a way to handle this situation in the lower sections.", "Here, since we have all the values store in a list, let\u2019s put them in a DataFrame. We can use pd.DataFrame() and pass the value, which is all the list in this case.", "On executing this you will get a beautiful DataFrame as seen below", "As I said, it\u2019s not a very good practice to store all the values in a list. In this way, we automatically make the list grow. There is a neat and cute way to handle this kind of situation. First, let\u2019s take the input from the input and store them in temporary variables as shown below:", "So on the next day, I mean 10\u20139\u201320 I went to the grocery store to shop for some spices with Gordon Ramsay, just kidding I went alone. Below are the details of the new store.", "This is an obvious step because we need to append the new data (shopping details) to the existing DataFrame. We can do this with the help of append() Python.", "This step is trivial because all we are doing is just displaying all the updated results from the above step as a DataFrame. Similar to the \u201cCreating a Pandas DataFrame to store all the list values\u201d step shown above.", "After executing this piece of code, you will be prompted with the updated result of the new grocery store added in the previous step", "There you go, you have successfully handled the scenario like a piece of cake. You can keep on adding more data (shopping details) and maintain monthly or yearly wise.", "Shown below are some tips and tricks that you can perform or do in your free time. Because they are that easy to understand. Let me get into it.", "It\u2019s always a good practice to plot the data for better readability. Now for plotting let us use the column Amount so that we know how much we have spent till now with the help of a plot. This can be done by using df.plot.bar() as shown below", "Note: Always remember only numeric data can be plotted in Pandas", "On writing this one line of code you can see a beautiful plot as shown below:", "Say suppose we need to delete the last row because there is a mistake in the entry so this can be performed as follows. Now to delete an entire row we need to use drop() in Pandas as shown below:", "Here the value 5 is the index value of the last row. By executing this we get", "Deleting the column is like that of a row all you have to do is pass the column names to delete in this case like df.drop([column_name, axis = 1]) the axis = 1 is important here.
