Welcome to this article. This time, I want to write about something different from what I\u2019ve written so far. My articles that has been published are about implementing an Artificial Intelligence, especially about Deep Learning. In this article, I want to write about different topic. I think this topic is also important if we want to develop a model. This step should be done before doing modelling. Which is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).", "Sorry, I\u2019ve been busy on preparing my new job \ud83d\ude2b. Even I am busy, I still want to write medium and share my knowledge to all of you \ud83d\ude18. Whenever I have a free time, I write this article little by little.", "In this article, I also want to write by not only telling how to code it, but also implement it to a real study case. The data that I used is from twitter which I scraped with library. The case is about \u201cAnalysis on each presidential candidate\u2019s supporter in Indonesia on 2018\u201d. Even the text is in Indonesian Language, I will try to make you understand what is the meaning of the text and word.", "The data that is used in this article is based on the tweet that I crawled. Maybe there are some tweets that the crawler has skipped. Even so, you can say that the data sample of the population which should be representative. The data that I\u2019ve crawled is around 700.000 tweets.", "If you are here to have fun on reading the statistic, go on and feel free to skip the technical detail on this article. Oh, I also will not include any conclusion on the insight that we\u2019ve found in the data. I will only write the analysis and the explanation of the visualization. You can create your conclusion on your mind and If you want more, why don\u2019t you also do the EDA ? And of course write it \ud83d\ude03 .", "Taken from KDNuggets, the step on doing a Data Science before creating a model are Gather Data, Process the Data, Clean Data, and finally EDA. Actually, doing EDA can help us better on making the model\u2019s quality improves. By knowing the data, we can feel how our learning algorithm learns our data. And well, if you feel that you think it\u2019s impossible that some instance can be predicted, neither do our learner.", "The process EDA should be done before modelling in every tasks of Data Science and Machine Learning (except Pure Reinforcement Learning which doesn\u2019t have any data to train). For example, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), when doing Sentiment Analysis, maybe we can make a better model by removing some words which can be found when doing EDA. Another example, in Computer Vision (CV), maybe we can found that the model can\u2019t learn because of the inability of our model to predict some instances because our data have an unique noise or some anomalies, which hasn\u2019t been cleaned previously in the data cleaning step.", "There are many others benefit when doing EDA before modelling. Maybe you can get an intuition that can make your model better. which is why we should do this step. If you read my previous article on generating Deep Learning Lyric, I skipped this part. Sometimes in generating the lyric, there are some text that I don\u2019t want it to appear (\u2018REFF\u2019 for example). And well, I didn\u2019t notice and should have noticed it if I did the EDA first.", "Before we do it, we need to know what are the steps. Here we go!", "First, we must define what are the Research Questions ? That means to define what we want to search. These Questions will be the guide on what we will do on the next step. They will also need to be answered in the next step.", "There are some examples for a Research Question:", "List anything you need to search in question form. Typically, you can start to pin down to 5W 1H (What, When, Where, Why, Who, How). In my opinion, since we can gain new insights later, we can increase the number of the questions depending on our finding while focusing on our main Research Question.", "Second, We need to collect the data. Make sure that we search the dataset according to the research question that we have already defined. There are several ways to do this steps. We can search any structured data set in a data set repository such as Kaggle and UCL Repository. Or we can also search any unstructured data by scrapping some social media such as Facebook and Twitter using their API if possible. It depends on your research question. Often, you will not find the data that you need in a structured format out there .", "Third, Preprocess, Clean the Data, and Data Wrangling ! This will be the painful and annoying steps to do . Do not let your head explode on doing this step. Why this step is painful? You need to know your data. Find if there are any \u2018pests \u2019out there need to be cleaned. Example of \u2018pests \u2019 in NLP are Typo, Informal Word, Emoticon, Elongated Word, any Many Hidden Bomb There that usually if we remove it, it will make our visualization and model better !", "Before doing any of that, if the data is not the structured format, we need to convert it to the structured format for the sake of making cleaning data easier. Let me tell you, we will often go back to this steps many times since we often find the \u2018pests\u2019 in the next step.", "Finally , we do EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) . This is where we will answer some of the Research Question defined in the First Steps. Usually we will do some Visualization here to communicate our result. Why we visualize or plot our data when we can see the data by printing the result ? Remember that the result of the analysis will not be seen only for you. The result will be seen by others. For the sake of UX (User Experience) , We need to present the data by visualizing it to make sure the readers become comfortable to see the results. I do not think my article will be seen by many people if I present the result here by cropping the screenshot of the printed result in CLI (Command Line Interface). In this article, we will do EDA in Jupyter Notebook since it has beautiful UX and also can be used to present our data.", "Okay, before we formulate the questions, let me tell you that in 2019, there will be a presidential election in Indonesia. There are 2 candidates. They are Joko Widodo (Jokowi)\u2014 Maaruf Amin (NO 01) and Prabowo Subianto \u2014 Sandiaga Uno (Sandi) (NO 02).", "What we will focus on in this article is how are the supporter of each candidates in social media. In this article, we will focus on Twitter Social Media.", "By researching and googling, I\u2019ve found some hashtags used by Jokowi\u2019s and Prabowo\u2019s Supporter to declare their support. For the simplicity, I\u2019ve narrowed down their hashtags by:", "We will limit the year of the tweet only on 2018.", "That\u2019s it, Let\u2019s create the research question. Here are my research questions :", "We\u2019re done ! Actually there are too many questions that we can ask. For the sake not to make this article become 1 hour read time, we will cut the question we want to ask to twelve.", "For this steps, we will use Twint as our library.", "For this article, we will scope our data as follow:", "Okay, since this article will focus for EDA, we will make this step as short as possible.", "First, we will read the csv with pandas", "To make it simple, we will only formalize word and remove the stopwords", "We will formalize in two ways, first is with regex and then substitute known slang words to formal words. The later will need a dictionary of slang word and its formal word.", "This is how I formalized the word:", "There should be a better way to do the cleaning on the formalize_rule function such as use nltk TweetTokenizer. Well, I want to try regex and that\u2019s it.", "I also implement on removing stopword on the formalize_word .", "We apply it into our DataFrame:", "Note that in this step, in reality, we will come back to this step after doing several EDAs. Sometimes, we will find the \u2018pests\u2019 in EDA step.", "We are done, move onto last step!", "Since all of the Research Questions that we want to answer can be answered here, we will end the Data Science process in this step. Without further ado, let\u2019s answer all of the questions!", "Wait, before we do that. We should define some functions that will be used multiple times.", "We have defined the DataFrame filter that we will use often later on. We also create some functions which output the statistic in the DataFrame. The statistic will be plotted with Plotly.", "We take the attribute shape of each supporter\u2019s tweets.", "We need to do this to show the plot in Jupyter:", "There are many ways to visualize this data. Since each of them is comparable, we can use Pie chart to visualize the data.", "There are two minimal components needed to plot on plotly.", "First is the \u2018data\u2019. The \u2018data\u2019 is a set of data with the type of chart that we want to visualize. We can combine multi kinds type of chart here. For example, you can visualize a Bar chart with a Pie Chart in the visualization.", "Second is the layout. The layout is the container of the visualization. This is where we can customize the title, legend, axis, and many more.", "Then we combine the container and the charts by putting it into go.Figure (a figure). The figure is ready to be plotted.", "Prabowo\u2019s supporter tweets frequency is higher than Jokowi\u2019s supporter tweets", "Since the data that we want to plot is sequential. We can plot in line chart.", "First, we filter and loop for each months", "Reverse the list (from Dec \u2014 Jan to Jan \u2014 Dec)", "The Prabowo\u2019s supporter tweets usually have more frequency than Jokowi\u2019s supporter tweets. Their tweets are at its peak in September.", "First, we will set that the largest frequency tweet is in September.", "Then, we find the highest frequency word by using above functions.", "We will take only tweets posted in September and plot it. We will limit it into TOP 30 highest frequency.", "Since the data is not sequential, Bar chart is the right choice here. Word cloud also good in how we visualize the word frequency if we don\u2019t want to know the frequency of each words.", "\u201cjokowi\u2019 has the highest frequency in September. It has around 35k \u2014 40k frequency. It is followed by Indonesia, Orang (Person), Presiden (President), Rakyat (Citizen), Dukung (Support), Allah (God), Prabowo, and the others.", "It\u2019s similar on how we do it on RQ (Research Question) 3. The difference is that we need to filter the Jokowi\u2019s supporter tweet.", "The \u2018jokowi\u2019 word is also the highest here and the difference with other words is big. It has positive words such as \u2018berbagi\u2019 (sharing), \u2018tulus\u2019 (sincere) and \u2018bergerak\u2019 (move\u2019). It also has \u2018Allah\u2019 word there.", "Again, it is similar on doing RQ 4. We will filter to Prabowo supporter\u2019s tweet.", "It\u2019s unexpected that the \u2018jokowi\u2019 frequency is higher than \u2018prabowo\u2019. The highest one is \u2018indonesia\u2019. The difference of each word\u2019s frequency is not too big. The words that we should notice are \u2018ulama\u2019 (Muslim\u2019s Scholar or Cleric), \u2018rezim\u2019 (regime), \u2018cebong\u2019 (tadpole, the \u2018bad\u2019 alias for jokowi\u2019s supporter by prabowo\u2019s supporter) , \u2018emak\u2019 (group of mothers) and \u2018bangsa\u2019 (nation). It also has \u2018Allah\u2019 word there.", "Before we do it, since we often plot by writing the code many times, we should create a function that is reusable.", "After that, we will filter the dataframe according to what we need.", "Jokowi is the highest frequency here. We will notice some words that is interesting, which is \u2018uang\u2019 (money), \u2018thecebongers\u2019 (the tadpole), \u2018prestasinya\u2019 (the achievment), \u2018survei\u2019 (survey), and \u2018asing\u2019 (foreign countries)", "We will filter the dataframe according to what we need.", "Prabowo is the highest frequency here. We will notice some words that is interesting, which is \u2018gerakan\u2019 (movement), \u2018ulama\u2019, \u2018mahasiswa\u2019 (college student), \u2018rupiah\u2019 (Indonesia currency), and \u2018rezim\u2019 (regime).", "We will filter the dataframe according to what we need.", "\u2018sandi\u2019 has the highest frequency here. It has big gap to other words. the words that got my attention are \u2018ulama\u2019, \u2018allah\u2019, \u2018emak\u2019, \u2018gerakan\u2019, and \u2018ijtima\u2019 (ulama\u2019s/muslim schoolars\u2019s decision). \u2018jokowi\u2019 is also the second highest frequency here.", "We will filter the dataframe according to what we need:", "\u2018prabowo\u2019 is not in the 20 highest frequency here. It\u2019s different from the above. Anyway, word that got my attention are \u2018blokir\u2019 (blocked), \u2018pembangunan\u2019 (construction), \u2018kepemimpinan\u2019 (leadership), \u2018allah\u2019, \u2018hebat\u2019 (great), and \u2018bergerak\u2019 (move)", "Since the hashtag\u2019s column is in string format, we need to cast the type into \u2018list\u2019 by using eval . After that, we join the content of the list by \u2018 \u2018 and call our previous function. We will see the statistic of the data not limited on September.", "Hashtags that my eyes are set on are \u20182019tetapantipki\u201d (2019 Will Stay Anti-communism) , \u201cmahasiswabergerak\u201d (College student move), \u201crupiahlongsor jokowilengser\u201d (Rupiah Fall Jokowi stepped down), and \u201cjokowi2periode\u201d (Jokowi two Periods). The last hashtags should be the hashtags for Jokowi\u2019s supporter. The hashtags mostly talks about changing the president and negative things about Jokowi.", "It\u2019s really similar to RQ 10.", "Hashtags that my eyes are set on are \u2018indonesiamaju\u2019 (Advanced Indonesia), \u2018jokowimembangunindonesia\u2019 (Jokowi Build Indonesia), \u2018kerjanyata\u2019 (Visible Work), \u2018diasibukkerja\u2019 (He\u2019s busy working). Mostly, the hashtags are about keeping Jokowi as the president and positive things about Jokowi. And again, there is a \u20182019gantipresiden\u201d that should be the hashtags for Prabowo\u2019s supporter.", "We will do it in Line chart. Since these data are comparable, we will visualize them in one figure. We will make our default line chart", "And we also need a new functions:", "We are done, let\u2019s plot them:", "We will make a list that contains 2 line charts and show it in one figure. The [::-1] Means that we will reverse the month. The default will start from December to January.", "AnalysisJokowi\u2019s mean of char\u2019s length is tend to rise and it\u2019s at its peak at November. Wheras Prabowo\u2019s mean of char\u2019s length tend to rise until August and keep tend to fall after that month", "Our last RQ. It\u2019s the same as above but we need new function:", "As expected, it has almost got the similar result with the answer of RQ 12.", "We have answered all the Research Question that we have defined. There are many interesting points from the answers. Such as the kinds of word in the top-30 frequency word of each president\u2019s supporter tweets and how each supporter talk about their president candidate or their president candidate\u2019s opponent. I won\u2019t dive deeper on the statistic here as it will make this article longer.", "After we do EDA, we should notice that there are some thing that should be cleaned to make the data better. For example, there are some tweets that contains the hashtag of Jokowi\u2019s support and Prabowo\u2019s supporter in one tweet. These tweets should be removed from the dataset. We should move back to the cleaning step and do EDA again.", "That\u2019s it folks for my article mostly about EDA. Actually, I have more RQs that I\u2019ve answered. But for the sake of shorting this article, I select a few of them. You must be wondering about some of the result of our finding. For that, you need to dive deeper on exploring the data. I will share the dataset if there are many readers who want it.", "There are many tasks that can be done for that dataset such as Topic Modelling, Sentiment Analysis, Detecting Anomaly (Such as detecting buzzer), And many interesting tasks.
