This boost in ML and DL gave rise to various programming languages and libraries that came up and enabled programmers, researchers and data scientists to achieve the unthinkable. Some of the strongest contenders for the best Deep Leaning library are TensorFlow and PyTorch. As for now, we\u2019ll be focussing more on PyTorch.", "Facebook released PyTorch for the programming scene in 2016, which is based on Lua\u2019s Torch library.", "PyTorch is a free and open-source machine learning library and is currently at v1.4. PyTorch has been out for almost three years now and has gone through loads of improvements to be in a better position. PyTorch was created to feel fast and more Pythonic than the rest of the competition. It also includes support for C, C++ and Tensor computing.", "Google Trends \u2014 PyTorch Interest Over Time", "Before jumping onto the reasons why should not give PyTorch a try, below are a few of the unique and exciting Deep Learning projects and libraries PyTorch has helped give birth to:", "\u25cf CheXNet: Radiologist-level pneumonia detection on chest X-rays with deep learning.", "\u25cf Horizon: A platform for applied reinforcement learning (Applied RL)", "\u25cf PYRO: Pyro is a universal probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and supported by PyTorch on the backend.", "\u25cf Kaolin by NVIDIA as a PyTorch library for accelerating 3D Deep Learning", "\u25cf TorchCV for implementing computer vision to your projects", "\u25cf PyDLT as a set of tools for deep learning", "\u25cf fastai library optimizes your neural net training process", "These are a few frameworks and projects that are built on top of TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Below are some of the highlights explaining why PyTorch would be a suitable fit for your Deep Learning Projects:", "PyTorch is a go to framework that lets us write code in a more pythonic way. Moreover, the kind of dynamism that it supports using naive python code is remarkable.", "PyTorch tends to incline more towards Python when compared with any other library. It is because PyTorch is relatively easy to understand and, it feels more natural, native and in line with Python code. For anyone who has worked with Python, they\u2019ll feel at home with everything with PyTorch, such as loss functions, optimizers, transformations, data loaders and many more classes.", "The code for each PyTorch example (Vision and NLP) shares a common structure:", "When compared with PyTorch, TensorFlow has a relatively steeper learning curve. Python programmers will need less time adjusting to PyTorch as to them it will most likely feel like an extension of Python\u2019s framework. Easy debugging and a great set of simple APIs play a pivotal role in making PyTorch easier for programmers to pick up.", "With great community support comes great enthusiasm and contributions towards the community. Using PyTorch, programmers have gone ahead and created some projects that are available for anyone interested to take a peek.

When all the tasks over the pool of GPUs are finished, the result is collected, merged and sent back to you by Data-Parallel.", "PyTorch is a godsent for Researchers as it proved to be used by at least 70% of researchers working on frameworks. Despite being the industry-leading choice for developing applications, TensorFlow hasn\u2019t caught up with PyTorch in this aspect, yet. One reason behind this might be the simplicity and ease of use that PyTorch has to offer with better performance.", "Starting v1.3, PyTorch has added support for deployment on Android and iOS devices. The feature brings all the benefits of PyTorch to edge devices to cater to applications that demand lower latencies. The goal behind PyTorch mobile is to reduce the development cycle by supporting the base APIs for mobile platforms, eliminating the need to export to mobile frameworks such as Caffe2. This allows for a significant reduction in on-device footprint. Support for precise fine-tuning of build scripts has also been added for greater control.", "PyTorch is silly easy to debug when you have the option to access each line and the usual way of printing after each line. The icing on the cake is that the objects and operation in PyTorch contain the actual data and not the symbolic references, making life easier for programmers. Some of the standard debuggers for PyTorch are:", "Say, for example, you can use pdb\u2019s \u201cpdb.set_trace()\u201d function to place breakpoints in your code to drill down to the root of the error. Also, PyTorch\u2019s dynamic computational graphs allow for dynamic modification and snappy debugging while your code executes.", "Open Neural Network Exchange acts as an open-source ecosystem for Artificial Intelligence by providing a common ground for AI programmers to interchangeably work on a variety of frameworks, tools and libraries. ONNX does this by providing a standard file format that works across multiple frameworks and hardware.", "When it comes to PyTorch, ONNX comes with built-in support for PyTorch and a broad range of other frameworks such as Caffe2, MXNet, TensorFlow and more. ONNX makes it easier for AI programmers to export and migrate their PyTorch models to an open format that other frameworks can integrate.", "By viewing every model as a Directed Acyclic Graph, PyTorch offers a dynamic approach to defining computation graphs. While other frameworks allow a static graph definition, PyTorch supports the creation of a dynamic computation graph where you are free to manipulate it on-the-go. One such element that benefits the most from this dynamic aspect of PyTorch is Recurrent Neural Networks among many others.", "PyTorch also offers excellent community support. The home of PyTorch has detailed documentation about each of its features. All the latest updates to the library are well explained. With each new addition, supportive tutorials and related resources can also be found to get that valuable hands-on feel.", "PyTorch Forum is an excellent and highly recommended place for newbies to post their questions and veterans to share their ideas with fellow programmers.
