In particular, deep learning techniques have produced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that are state of the art image classifiers.", "This article will show you how to develop a CNN-based person classifier using TensorFlow that can outperform standard face recognition techniques in certain situations. The standard methods typically include the use of shallow learners like SVM to classify patterns generated by facial embedding (see for example the superb face_recognition program.) The standard techniques are extremely good at recognition when most of the face is visible. However, my application needed a way to accurately classify people with only partial views of a face and ideally from behind. This provided the motivation to develop a person classifier using deep learning and my goal was to achieve the same recognition accuracy as a human when looking at an image of a person they know with or without a face.", "The following steps are required to build an accurate CNN-based person classifier that identifies which of a set of known and unknown people a new observation belongs. These steps are also applicable to training other types of CNN-based classifiers.", "Please note that I used an Intel i5 + Nvidia 1080Ti machine with 64GB of main memory to train my models. You will need at least a similar machine to feasibly train a deep learning model.", "Also, note that much of this work was done for the smart-zoneminder project and you can leverage that work. If you just want to quickly fine-tune a TensorFlow CNN without diving into the details, install the machine learning platform on a suitable machine, prepare your data set as described below and run the Python program train.py with options that suit your configuration. The rest of this article will breakdown train.py section by section to help you understand how it works to use it better and to perhaps modify it for your own use.", "Create a sub-directory for each person\u2019s images that you want recognized, named for the person, in a directory called \u201cdataset\u201d (I used my Google photos to seed this directory). Also, create a sub-directory called \u2018Unknown\u2019 that will hold faces of random strangers. In each sub-directory, you can optionally place another sub-directory that can hold images of the person without a full or partial view of their face. You can decide to include such images as a member of their class or as the Unknown class. The dataset directory will look like the following.", "The function below to creates a Python dataframe from the contents of dataset.", "The dataframe is input to the flow_from_dataframe method of the tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator class. The ImageDataGenerator generates batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation and creates training and validation sets. The flow_from_dataframe methods create a Python generator for each set. This code is shown below.", "Although it is possible to use train_generator and validation_generator directly to fit the CNN model, using instead a Dataset object from tf.data.Dataset will give you better fitting performance. In train.py, this is done as follows.", "Since its likely you will have more sample images in some classes than others, you will need to convey the class weighting to the model fitting process. The code to do that is shown below along with the number of steps the fitting process should use for training and validation.", "The data is now ready to be used to fit a model.", "The function below creates a CNN model from an ImageNet pre-trained tf.keras.applications model. Although the function will create a model based on VGG16 ,InceptionResNetV2 ,MobileNetV2 and ResNet50, only InceptionResNetV2 is shown. The final softmax layer from the base model is removed, new dense classifier and softmax layers are added and then its complied. Pay particular attention to the hyperparameter constants since they will likely need to be adjusted to suit your data set but the default values give me good results. The function includes various over-fitting mitigation techniques including L2 Regularization, Label Smoothing and Dropout. It also selects an appropriate tf.keras preprocessor that formats the data samples correctly.", "The model is now ready to be fine-tuned.", "Fine-tuning is done in two passes. The first pass uses a high learning rate and trains just the newly added dense and softmax layers since they were initialized with random data. The second pass uses a much smaller learning rate and trains the final layers along with much of the base model. The two pass scheme along with regularization is designed to preserve as much as possible the original weights from the base model while still learning the patterns from the new data set. Both passes use early stopping based on validation loss which is another way to mitigate overfitting.", "The first pass fine-tuning code is shown below. Again, note that only the new layers are being fitted.", "The second pass of the fine-tuning is shown below. Note that some of the bottom base model\u2019s layers are frozen and won\u2019t be trained in this step, but\u00a0all\u00a0others\u00a0will\u00a0be. The number of layers frozen is a hyperparameter and is a balance between preserving the layers that were trained on high-level features from ImageNet while allowing the top layers to learn the new features in your data set. The more layers you unfreeze the more data you will need to prevent overfitting, despite all the mitigations employed.", "The model is now fine-tuned and will be evaluated for accuracy and saved for inference in the next steps.", "Your model should be evaluated to determine if its accuracy meets your application\u2019s requirement. Generating a sklearn classification report from its predictions is a way to do this as shown in the code below.", "An example classification report for one of my runs is shown below. Although I\u2019m pleased that the model is biased toward its creator ;), more work is required to raise the accuracy on the other classes through additional observations in the data set and hyperparameter optimization.", "Currently, my best results are with the InceptionResNetV2 base model which achieves an overall accuracy of about 92% My goal is greater then 95% which is my subjective estimate of what a normal person could achieve on images with and without faces. For comparison, using the standard approach mentioned above yields an accuracy of about 90% for those images with a full or mostly full view of the face and the accuracy on the same data set, with full, partial and no faces is less than 70%.", "train.py includes options for saving the model in various ways \u2014 a frozen TensorFlow program (deprecated starting in TensorFlow 2), an eight-bit quantized TensorFlow Lite program optimized for inference on IoT devices, a compiled TensorFlow Lite program for Google\u2019s Edge TPU and the TensorFlow SavedModel format (the canonical method starting in TensorFlow 2). The code below shows how train.py saves to the SavedModel format.", "The final model is now ready for inference via its SavedModel or one of the other representations. For additional details on saving and using a model at the edge, see Using Keras On Google\u2019s Edge TPU.", "You can leverage TensorFlow to quickly fine-tune a CNN classifier with modest sized data sets as compared to the original data set that was used to train the base model, as shown in the example above for the person classifier. The Python program train.py from the smart-zoneminder project can be used to build your own classifier as is or as a reference for you to develop your own program.", "Fitting deep learning models to limited data can be tricky since they can quickly memorize the data set and won\u2019t generalize well to new observations, this is known as overfitting. To mitigate this you can use the following techniques.", "You will also most likely have to deal with an unequal number of samples for each class in your data set (e.g., an unbalanced set) which will bias the model\u2019s accuracy.
