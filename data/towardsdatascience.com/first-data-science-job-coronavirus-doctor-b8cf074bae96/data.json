So in this article I\u2019m going to share my experiences and advice for making a (perhaps) unconventional career transition into a technical role. I can break these down into five main learnings:", "Coming from a medical background, I didn\u2019t have the first clue about how to develop coding skills or data science understanding. And neither did anybody around me.", "This made it really important for me to branch out and find people who did. I quickly saw the benefits of doing so.", "When I initially started out, I\u2019d have to resort to Google or StackOverflow to try and solve my problems. These are great resources, but it\u2019s hard to find what you want when you don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re looking for.", "One of the top skills a developer needs to know is what to search to find the solution to your current problem. Without that skill, I would spend ages stuck at a relatively simple hurdle \u2014 like trying to manipulate a pandas dataframe in a particular way, or how to install and import the package I needed.", "I\u2019d heard that it\u2019s best to think of your own projects as a means to learn. However, without insight into what it takes to build a project, and what\u2019s possible, I would typically come up with over-ambitious projects with too many moving parts. I remember an early project idea was to build a chatbot patient for doctors to practice with, and I even started collecting transcripts from real conversations to help make this. In hindsight, this type of task was way too ambitious for someone of my technical level at that time (having just completed an Intro to Python course).", "Having technical friends is great for overcoming both of these sources of inefficiency.", "If you have a relatively simple technical issue, but don\u2019t know where to go to solve it, a technical friend can point you in the right direction pretty quickly. This saves a lot of time and frustration.", "Likewise, if you come up with a project idea, you can run it by a technical friend. They\u2019ll be able to break it down into stages and ultimately advise you whether it makes sense to do and how best to go about it. This can save you a lot of time from barking up the wrong tree.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a \u201cright\u201d way to find technical friends and establish a relationship where you can ask them for advice. Here are a few principles that I find helpful.", "Firstly, being open and honest about my intentions (\u201cI\u2019m learning to code and would love someone I could ping a message to when I get stuck\u201d).", "Secondly, being respectful of their time. I pushed myself to only ask for help if I\u2019d truly searched for the solution and spent time trying to solve it myself. (To be honest, I think you also learn better this way.)", "This wasn\u2019t always easy. Sometimes I\u2019d hit the initial wall of frustration and feel an urge to send off multiple messages, hoping for a quick solution. I tried to have a good crack myself first, but I\u2019ll admit I sometimes caved in.", "It was also helpful to have multiple people I could go to. I didn\u2019t have to keep bugging the same person, reducing the risk of annoying them.", "I personally met these friends from multiple places; from attending events that interested me (such as data science and machine learning meet-ups), from working on projects together (more on that in Section 2 and 3) and from a smattering of formal \u2018networking\u2019, friends-of-friends and random LinkedIn messages.", "At some point, when it felt comfortable, I\u2019d reach out for advice on a specific problem or project I was working on. Sometimes the problems were simple or the project ideas were bad, so I had to put my pride to the side and seek out the constructive criticism.", "If you\u2019re starting out, and looking for a technical friend to help you get started, feel free to reach out (email at hi@chrislovejoy.me, Twitter @ChrisLovejoy_).", "One of the first pieces of advice I received from a mentor is one that has stuck with me since:", "Have a portfolio of three great projects.", "Initially, for me, this just meant striving to get three projects under my belt. I went to hackathons, interned at companies and designed my own.", "Once I achieved that, I kept looking at how I could build on them or replace them with new and cooler projects.", "It\u2019s so simple, but I\u2019ve found it a useful way to frame it. You\u2019re only as good as your top three projects.", "To this day, the lower right-hand side of my CV is dedicated to my top three projects at that moment in time.", "If a round of job applications comes up, or if somebody asks me about work I\u2019ve done, I know what to talk about. These three projects are always in mind.", "I\u2019m a big advocate of designing our own projects, both for learning and for potentially contributing to community. But it\u2019s not always easy, particularly when starting out.", "A good source of \u2018ready-made\u2019 projects to work on is Kaggle. They provide a dataset and often specific challenges. You can also see other people\u2019s solutions, which is a great source of learning.", "A great way to devise a project within a team is to attend hackathons. These are typically weekend sprints to develop a solution to a problem and are held in most major cities around the world.", "One thing I found really helpful was attending a project-based course. So much so, that I\u2019ll devote the next section to it.", "Even with all the motivation in the world and a great team of technical mentors, it can still be challenging to build great projects and learn new skills off your own back. There\u2019s a lot to be said for being in the right environment, and having good projects being defined for you.", "The best place for this would be to get a full-time job in a technical role. However, it\u2019s not always possible to jump straight into this.", "A really great intermediate step can be to go on a project-based course.", "These typically range between around 5 weeks to few months and are centred around a group project that produces a tangible output. There\u2019s typically a partnership with a commercial client who has a genuine interest in what you are building.", "I went on the \u201cScience to Data Science\u201d (S2DS) virtual course. I found it really helpful having a defined project and having responsive technical mentors to go to for any problems that I arose.", "I learnt a huge amount during the project; in particular I learnt how to structure source code, became more familiar with github, gained better understanding of regression performance metrics and learnt PEP-8 Python coding guidelines. (I\u2019ll be sharing a full post on this in future.)", "Another course I\u2019ve heard good things about is the \u2018ASI Data Science\u2019 course (who I think have now re-branded as \u2018faculty.ai\u2019).", "Note: I\u2019m based in the UK. S2DS is international. I\u2019m not sure about ASI. I\u2019m sure there are programs abroad that I\u2019m not familiar with.", "One word of warning is that there are a lot of courses which, in my opinion, over-charge. This is a reflection of the area having become popular, but it isn\u2019t necessarily a reflection of the value that courses offer. The S2DS course I attended cost \u00a3800, which felt like fantastic value after attending, but I\u2019ve seen many courses in the \u00a35,000+ range.", "Data science is a really big (and expanding) field. There\u2019s a huge amount that you could learn and it\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed when starting out.", "My approach has been to work towards a solid understanding of (i) core concepts and (ii) my specific areas of interest.", "So I guess the question is: what constitutes a \u2018core concept?", "I can\u2019t claim to be an authority on what you should know, but these pages appear useful:", "If I were to suggest core concepts and skills, it would be something like:", "I\u2019d suggest using online courses to build up your understanding in each of these key areas. Ones I found helpful were Brilliant.org and Khan academy for principles and maths, plus various courses on Coursera and Udemy for the more technical aspects.", "As for the skills on top of this, I\u2019d argue it depends on the industry of interest and type of work you\u2019ll be doing. If working with Big Data, Apache Spark will be helpful. If working with time series, familiarity with ARIMA models will be helpful.", "There are a lot of data science roles that don\u2019t specify a master\u2019s degree as a formal requirement, and I think it\u2019s possible to get a job without one.", "However, for me, and coming from an unconventional background, I found it hard to get taken seriously until I started working towards one.", "I think if my bachelor\u2019s degree was more directly relevant to data science (rather than Medicine), I may not have needed to. A good bachelor\u2019s + proof of practical experience is sufficient in many cases.", "I ended up choosing a master\u2019s degree in Data Science and Machine Learning at UCL in London. Even before starting it, I was pretty confident that I had a good grasp of key concepts from my own self-study.", "But a lot of job applications led to straight-out rejection, so I never had the chance to prove myself. And I can completely understand why. If you have a lot of applications for a role, the one that says \u201cI\u2019m a full-time doctor, but have done loads of data science self-study\u201d is a pretty easy one to remove from the pile.", "The master\u2019s didn\u2019t guarantee I\u2019d progress to an interview, but I definitely felt it helped me get a foot in the door.", "(Whether or not I\u2019m fully behind paying X thousand for a master\u2019s degree in our current climate of remote courses is a matter for another day, however\u2026)", "I\u2019m absolutely loving work as a data scientist. It\u2019s really satisfying to see the hard work pay off, even if the journey was tough at times. It feels great to have two skillsets in my portfolio (as both a doctor and as a data scientist) and one step towards a more \u2018portfolio\u2019 future approach to work. I hope that the experiences and suggestions I\u2019ve shared here help you with your transition, too.", "Many thanks to Abdel Mahmoud and Luke Harries for reviewing this article.", "Data Scientist +
