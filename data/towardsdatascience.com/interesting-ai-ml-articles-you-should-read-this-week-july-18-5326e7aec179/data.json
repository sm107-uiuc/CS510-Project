And yet, people still aren\u2019t satisfied with the level of AI we have currently.", "Find out why AI hasn\u2019t met our expectations and also how identity theft has evolved to leverage deepfakes and facial recognition data.", "If you are reading this article, then you are no stranger to Medium, you are also very likely, someone who is interested in AI or has a job related to AI. Probably at some point, you have wanted to write articles on Medium.", "Well, Rebecca Vickery has written an article that breaks down the process by which she uses to write her articles.", "Why should you even take the advice and tips the Rebecca shares within her article? Rebecca has been writing on Medium for two years and has consistently published one to two articles a week. And if that\u2019s not enough, she\u2019s also currently considered a top writer on Medium on the topics Education, Technology and Artificial Intelligence.", "So how does Rebecca write data science articles?", "According to Rebecca, she tends to associate her writing career with a goal and purpose. Namely, the purpose for Rebecca is to teach others about data science and at the same time, reinforce her knowledge. This is a purpose that anyone can adopt as machine learning is an ever-growing field with new techniques and tools emerging daily.", "Writing data science articles can be tedious and requires a sturdy process, so how does Rebecca stay motivated?", "She points out in her article that she\u2019s not motivated by monetary incentives or social acknowledge. According to Rebecca, by not suing financial or social validation as a source of motivation, you can have a successful and long writing career.", "Monetary and social verifications do not come quickly during the writing journey. Therefore you need something that can motivate you to keep writing for years.", "The best advice I got from Rebecca\u2019s article is her article refinement technique and process. Rebecca doesn\u2019t sit down and churn out curation worthy article. She takes several iterations at an article. Each iteration takes the writing piece from a list of ideas to explanations around the ideas\u2026to a full article.", "The key thing here to the iteration technique is that Rebecca writes anywhere and at anytime.", "Give this article a read if you want to be inspired to start writing on Medium. Perhaps shortly, I might be reading one of your articles.", "I seem to be reading an article or two from Dave Gershgorn every week, and I think everyone within the AI Industry should too. Dave covers relevant and current topics that are AI and Technology related; this is a healthy dose of contemporary information to balance out all the research and technical Meidum articles you probably read weekly.", "What could identity theft look like in the next ten years?", "Well, Dave\u2019s article covers a recent development in one of the many misuses of advanced AI-based technology in China. Dave writes on the emerging sales in China\u2019s black market of digital packages that contain images of faces and accompanying personal data.", "These sold packages are all the requirements to bypass a lot of facial authentication systems in many widely used financial, business and lifestyle applications in China.", "From the title of Dave\u2019s article, you can see how ridiculously cheap obtaining the data is.", "Dave writes about an advanced package that makes this whole story more bizarre. With an up-payment by a few dollars, you can get a \u2018deepfake like\u2019 software that can mobilize the content of still images to mimic subtle head movements.", "A couple of years ago all that Dave covers in his article would be in the script of a movie set in the year 2079 covering an advance criminal group. But we see this unfold in real-time in 2020.", "Dave also mentions how this method of identity theft might not be so easily applicable to the systems within the US. He also includes that IPhones have an advanced process of facial recognition that measures the depth of facial features.", "But is it only a matter of time before someone becomes a digital version of you for less than $1.", "We wanted flying cars and they gave us DeepFakes.", "Tobia Tudino latest article is based on the non-realization of how revolutionary that the current state of AI is. This lack of appreciation is a result of high expectations due to the presentation of AI in science fiction.", "Tobia states that the futuristic depiction of the several forms that AI can take in which we observe in sci-fi films and moves has occluded our view from recognizing that the AI revolution we\u2019ve long awaited is here, in front of us.", "But I see no flying cars; no teleportation\u2026we do have some pretty cool spacecraft.", "Tobia starts to explain the reason why AI doesn\u2019t meet our cinematic driven expectation with an expanded statement made by Micheal I. Jordan(Artificial Intelligence \u2014 The Revolution Hasn\u2019t Happened Yet\u201d). The statement relays the message that AI is a wildcard term. The term \u201cAI\u201d is used to describe any advancement in technology that eliminates or emulates human intervention or involvement.", "And based on that description of AI, it is safe to say we have AI all around us, everywhere.", "I get the impression that Tobia wants us, the reader, to appreciate the level of AI we have now. Tobia mentions advances in decision making and data gathering within the healthcare, business, consultancy, fashion industries.", "Maybe people are fearful that the appreciation of current AI might lead to content. Or perhaps it might not be such a bad thing that people have yet to accept the fact that we\u2019ve achieved \u201cAI\u201d that we can proud of, as this can push researchers, engineers and innovators to invent and create better AI systems and tech.", "I\u2019ve never come across the topic of \u2018Extreme Learning Machine(ELM)\u2019, so Andre Ye\u2019s article for me was both informative and educational.", "Some of you might also not have heard of ELM, and Andre provides a reason for this in his article. The main reason is along the lines that the machine learning community not adopting it and deep learning experts criticizing and questioning its performance.", "Andre\u2019s article is very educative as it introduces ELM at an elementary level, so anyone with an essential background in Machine Learning can understand what the description and benefits of ELM.", "Andre provides an introduction to ELM by stating its internal components; how the neural network architecture is trained and other more specific characteristics and properties.", "The general idea I got from the article is that ELMs are effective as a result of its random nature. As stated by Andre, ELMs are composed of two lawyers where the first layer is randomly initialized, and the weights parameters are fixed.", "Incorporating elements of randomness in neural network architecture is something we see in a variety of deep learning neural network architecture; weights can be randomly initialized, and dropout later also provide randomness characteristics to an architecture.", "Andre also covers the main reasons why ELMs are dismissed by reputable individuals within the machine learning communities. Andre also includes some information on the limitation faced by ELMs and reasons as to why they are not widely adopted or utilized.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
