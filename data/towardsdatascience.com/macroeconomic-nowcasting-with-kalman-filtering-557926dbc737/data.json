Their methodology largely involved computing data in January and February 2020 to serve as an early indication of GDP growth in the quarter. It is also subjected to revision when more comprehensive data becomes available. The GDP is a lagging indicator because it is only officially released a month after the quarter, making it difficult to use in assessing the economy now. Singapore Government Agencies periodically release macroeconomic data, and research analysts have been constantly trying to interpret them instead to assess the current state of the economy. They attempt to separate meaningful signals from noise, identify common patterns in the data, detect fluctuations in business cycles, form an expectation on the direction of markets and readjust them when new economic releases come out as surprises.", "I was inspired by the New York Fed Staff Nowcast to model this behaviour of analysts in producing estimates of real GDP growth in the local context. Nowcasting relies on State-space Representation in Systems Theory to represent the evolution of a variable through time in a way that depends on its past values and the evolution of other variables. It is a natural representation for handling mixed frequencies (monthly/quarterly/yearly) and nonsynchronicity of data releases. The Kalman Filter and Smoothing algorithm is then used to make the nowcast. It extracts co-movements in the timeseries data as a latent factor, use it to estimate past and present values of the observed data, make corrections when new data comes in, and nowcast the current state and values of the variables.", "I selected key macroeconomic indicators from the Department of Statistics Singapore with reference to the New York Fed paper. The indicators were transformed by taking the diff/diff of logs/2nd-order diff of logs to make them stationary (where statistical properties of the time series do not change over time) to produce more reliable results.", "The python \u2018statsmodels.tsa.statespace.dynamic_factor\u2019 module implemented the representation and algorithm according to Section 18 of New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis.", "The general idea is that the observed y (economic factors) depend upon an unobserved state z (latent factor), where v and w are errors assumed to be noise. H is the noiseless connection between the current state and the current observed variables. B is the noiseless connection between the current and the past state. G / F represents the connection of exogenous variables x to the observed / state. However, we assume there are no exogenous variables in the table above and that their changes in their values depend on each other.", "The following describes the form of the observation & transition equations in terms of conditional expectation & variance of the observed & underlying factors under normality conditions. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is then used to get the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of all the parameters.", "The intuition behind each step is as follows:", "Based on my model, Singapore\u2019s Real GDP Growth in Q1 2020 is nowcasted to be -5.55% (QoQ, annualised & non-seasonally-adjusted) vs MTI\u2019s -10.6% (QoQ, annualised & seasonally-adjusted) vs Bloomberg survey of economists\u2019 median forecast of -8.2%. The Q1 & March 2020 updates reflect a strong decrease in foreign reserves, treasury yields, price levels, and business expectations. The updates probably presented a slightly more optimistic scenario due to the recent increase in industrial production and trade. Even these indicators may not be sufficiently \u2018realtime\u2019 and reflective of the current market as well. The model is limited to the economic data we feed it to and can only at best estimate the underlying forces that drive our economy. This model presents a systematic approach which is \u2018free\u2019 from human bias and could possibly provide a more consistent alternative to assess our economy.", "Your home for data science.
