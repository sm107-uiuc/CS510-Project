All these tasks can be such a hassle if you have to do them by hand. Sometimes you will need to handle multiple windows on your computer and have to move between them to accomplish different tasks.", "Well, luckily for us, there are chrome extensions that you can use to do each of those tasks quickly and smoothly.", "Here are my top 5 chrome extensions that make your workflow go fast, with no troubles or added workload.", "When we write code to collect data, analyze it, or clean up, we often find ourselves repeating the same code snippets over and over again. The scripts used for data processing for machine learning models and data pipelines are usually fixed.", "Code Snippets Manager is a chrome extension that was designed with the security and the productivity of the data scientist in mind. The DECS team developed this extension to provide maximum safety for the developer. CSM gives full protection of your sensitive data, such as API keys and database credentials, with a default encryption scheme.", "When we start a new data science project, we need to go through the data collection stage. We do that \u2014 most often \u2014 using some web scraping technique.", "Web Scraper is a Chrome extension that is built to do that tedious data collection for you. Using this extension, you can make a sitemap, that will help you decide how to traverse the website.

It allows you to type or handwrite virtually any mathematical expression directly on your keyboard or touchscreen. Once you do, you\u2019ll be able to export your equation in multiple formats without the need to interact with or write any complicated code or programming languages.", "Using EquatIO makes math digital, helping teachers and students at all levels create math expressions quickly and easily.", "We live in an era of information. The data around us, the one we often build our data science on, changes rapidly. We always need to keep up with this change.", "When we scrap a specific webpage for information, we often rite automation for data extraction. However, if the page owners decided to reshape or reform their data, out models will break. We will need to inspect the new webpages and change our models accordingly.", "Doesn\u2019t sound great, does it? Especially that you have to keep track when a webpage has been updated or changed.", "Distill Web Monitor saves us all this trouble by keeping track of specific webpages for us. This extension will run in your browser to check monitored pages for changes. Get instant alerts as soon as a change is detected.", "As a data scientist and a researcher, I hate keeping track of citations, but not as much as formating them. Putting citation is any format is not always an easy task; we don\u2019t all memorize the different styling guides.", "MyBib collects, stores, and styles your citations in various types of styling, such as MLA, APA, Harvard, Chicago, and so on. You can copy your generated citations directly into your paper, or save them to your bibliography for later.", "You can also export them into other citation managers like Zotero or Mendeley, print them, or save them as BibTeX.", "Having tools that can help users make our workload less demanding is always a good thing.
