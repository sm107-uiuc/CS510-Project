Let\u2019s look at how.", "In our experiment, let\u2019s say we are looking to get our listener excited, which according to science and research says the average heart rate reading should be elevated. It should not be elevated too much, so let\u2019s say we are aiming for somewhere between 150% and 250% the resting heart rate of our listener (let\u2019s say the RHR is 60 bpm, so an excited state would be 90\u2013150bpm).", "By running a few scenarios, we should also be able to compare which audio track resulted in a higher average heart rate.", "Data needs context. In this example we\u2019ll be using the \u201cHeart Rate Average\u201d attribute for the time stamped duration of the audio experience itself. We will then be comparing this \u201cHeart Rate Average\u201d to the individual\u2019s \u201cHeart Rate Resting\u201d attribute, resulting in a relative measure in percentages. This should allow for individual variation and context to not affect the experiment.", "You\u2019ve got your audio piece you want to test out on Spotify and you\u2019ve got your willing participants. Ahead of time, all you need to confirm is that they are wearing their Oura ring and that they will indeed listen to your selected song. It\u2019s only after we run the magic.", "3:16 or so later, you\u2019ll have subjects that have listened to your song. Maybe they liked it, maybe they didn\u2019t. But what does their heart say, or specifically, their heart rate?", "It\u2019s also interesting to note that this experiment is based on historical data (even if it just happened a few minutes ago), but that means you do not need to do anything in advance, but you can invite your subjects into the experiment after, if you want.", "Added benefit is that we don\u2019t need special equipment. Wearables seem to be increasingly present, so one can almost assume they would have their Oura ring on.", "In this conceptual experiment, the subject is going to bring their data from their Oura ring (using the Oura Cloud API) and their Spotify listening history (using the Spotify for Developers API) to their own personal cloud using Prifina. This means that the data itself will remain in the users\u2019 own personal cloud, under their full ownership and control, and future use.", "Now, the user has the data, using the Prifina data model in GraphQl, we can set up the app for the local application.", "What we are looking for is the average relative increase (%), lowest increase (%) and highest increase (%) relative readings during the song\u2019s duration.", "We can experiment with this in the developer data sandbox and test out a Query on dummy data such as this one;", "NB: This Person object is slightly different in the developer sandbox, given its an actual API where the local applications only use the schema in the users cloud. In the personal cloud, all objects relate to only that one person, i.e. the owner of the personal cloud.", "The combined data GraphQl data model is under development, while the primary emphasis is on applications that run in the Prifina platform. The benefits of the application are that they can access raw data from the user, while never retaining that raw data and the data staying with the user.", "In this specific example, if you wanted to get some results from the user in question, you could design your app to suggest passing on the highlights on a more general level, like the %% rise in heart rate fields at different periods in time, rather than the absolute heart rate itself.", "Or you could even make it so that the results answer the question: \u201cdid this increase your heart rate by over 20%?\u201d and the response is a Boolean yes or no.", "At the end of the day, individual control means that unless the individual wants to share the results with you, they won\u2019t. It\u2019s their call. However, we\u2019re sure you\u2019d design a pretty awesome app and experience to make it worthwhile for both you and your users.", "And you can always display all the insights and value to your user directly. Imagine how popular an app showing what songs your heart prefers could be?", "Not everyone wants to plot their heart rate for songs. Maybe some want to explore them for commercials. Maybe some for movies. How about podcasts, audiobooks, or magazines? Voice actors for audiobooks? How about something completely different, like heart rate at different locations. Where do you typically have the highest heart rate in your city, outside of exercise? Your mother-in-laws?", "The point of combined data is that we can build varying and novel experiences on top of it. The future of personalization is personal applications, with users in control.", "Want to test out with some dummy data and some data objects, like location, music, heartRate?
