Because it\u2019s so new there are only a handful of books on the market right now. If you want to understand what awaits us, here\u2019s the list of both non-mathematical general introductions and more hands-on coding approach to quantum computing.", "In Computing with Quantum Cats: From Colossus to Qubits John Gribbin argues for a universe of many parallel worlds where \u2018everything is real\u2019. Looking back to Alan Turing\u2019s work on the Enigma machine and the first electronic computer, Gribbin explains how quantum theory developed to make quantum computers work in practice as well as in principle. He takes us beyond the arena of theoretical physics to explore their practical applications \u2014 from machines which learn through \u2018intuition\u2019 and trial and error to unhackable laptops and smartphones. And he investigates the potential for this extraordinary science to create a world where communication occurs faster than light and teleportation is possible.", "Quantum Computing for Everyone is an accessible introduction to an exciting new area in computation, explaining such topics as qubits, entanglement, and quantum teleportation for the general reader.", "In this book, Chris Bernhardt offers an introduction to quantum computing that is accessible to anyone who is comfortable with high school mathematics. He explains:", "and other quantum-related topics as clearly as possible for the general reader.", "By the end of the book, readers understand that quantum computing and classical computing are not two distinct disciplines, and that quantum computing is the fundamental form of computing. The basic unit of computation is the qubit, not the bit.", "Talking about a book for everyone, Quantum Computing for Babies is a place to go. This book is a colorfully simple introduction to the magical world of quantum computers. Babies (and grownups!) will discover the difference between bits and qubits and how quantum computers will change our future.", "Dancing with Qubits: How quantum computing works and how it can change the world is a quantum computing textbook that starts with an overview of why quantum computing is so different from classical computing and describes several industry use cases where it can have a major impact. From there it moves on to a fuller description of classical computing and the mathematical underpinnings necessary to understand such concepts as superposition, entanglement, and interference. Next up is circuits and algorithms, both basic and more sophisticated. It then nicely moves on to provide a survey of the physics and engineering ideas behind how quantum computing hardware is built. Finally, the book looks to the future and gives you guidance on understanding how further developments will affect you.", "Really understanding quantum computing requires a lot of math, and this book doesn\u2019t shy away from the necessary math concepts you\u2019ll need. Each topic is introduced and explained thoroughly, in clear English with helpful examples.", "Dancing with Qubits is a quantum computing textbook for those who want to deeply explore the inner workings of quantum computing. This entails some sophisticated mathematical exposition and is therefore best suited for those with a healthy interest in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.", "Quantum Computing since Democritus takes readers on a tour through some of the deepest ideas of maths, computer science and physics. Full of insights, arguments and philosophical perspectives, the book covers an amazing array of topics. Beginning in antiquity with Democritus, it progresses through logic and set theory, computability and complexity theory, quantum computing, cryptography, the information content of quantum states and the interpretation of quantum mechanics. There are also extended discussions about time travel, Newcomb\u2019s Paradox, the anthropic principle and the views of Roger Penrose.", "Aaronson\u2019s informal style makes this fascinating book accessible to readers with scientific backgrounds, as well as students and researchers working in physics, computer science, mathematics and philosophy.", "Programming Quantum Computers: Essential Algorithms and Code Samples provides a hands-on programmer\u2019s guide to understanding quantum computing. Rather than labor through math and theory, you\u2019ll work directly with examples that demonstrate this technology\u2019s unique capabilities.", "Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach integrates the foundations of quantum computing with a hands-on coding approach.", "Additional resources include a table of operators and circuit elements and a companion GitHub site providing code and updates.", "That\u2019s all folks, this list will be updated with new quantum computing books on the market.", "*disclaimer: the above links are affiliate, thank you for your support*", "Your home for data science.
