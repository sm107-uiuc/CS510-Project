In this article, I\u2019ll share the answers and provide a suggested learning path for aspiring data analysts.\ud83d\ude80", "This is my third article looking at technology skills in data-intensive positions. See the previous articles on data scientists here and data engineers here. \ud83d\ude00", "Without further ado, here are the top 10 technologies from data analyst job listings as of January 2020.", "Data analysts turn data into information. They play a vital role by making data actionable for decision makers. \ud83d\udc4d", "Data analysts often take data provided by data engineers, analyze it, and make recommendations. They create visualizations to display their findings in dashboards and presentation. \ud83d\udcc8", "Unlike data scientists, data analysts don\u2019t usually create predictive models based on machine learning algorithms.", "I scraped information from SimplyHired, Indeed, and Monster, to see which keywords appeared with \u201cData Analyst\u201d in job listings in the United States. I used the Requests and Beautiful Soup Python libraries.", "I used the same keywords gleaned from my analysis of data scientist and data engineer job listings. LinkedIn was not searched because it previously locked me out of my account after scraping its site. \u2639\ufe0f", "For each job search website, I calculated the percentage of total data analyst job listings for that site that each keyword appeared in. Then I averaged those percentages across the three sites for each keyword.", "Here is an expanded chart showing the 30 most common technologies.", "Here\u2019s the same data in tabular form.", "Many other technology keywords were searched; these were the 30 highest scoring. Let\u2019s look at the most common technologies.", "SQL is short for Structured Query Language. It shows up in over half of all listings. SQL is used for working with relational databases. SQL comes in many flavors, including MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Each version shares most of the same core API. There are quality free offerings.", "Excel is almost as common as SQL. It\u2019s the dominant spreadsheet program. It\u2019s part of the Microsoft Office 365 suite of software tools. Although it can\u2019t handle huge quantities of data like SQL databases, Excel is great for doing analysis quickly. Google Sheets is a competitor with a free version and similar core functionality.", "Tableau shows up in about a quarter of listings. It\u2019s drag-and-drop business intelligence software that makes it easy to create visualizations and dashboards. Tableau\u2019s visualization capabilities are far better than Excel\u2019s. Tableau has a free public version, but if you want to keep data private you need to shell out some money.", "Python shows up in about a quarter of listings. It\u2019s a very popular free open source programming language for working with data, websites, and scripting. It\u2019s the primary language for machine learning. \ud83d\udc0d", "R is also in over 20% of listings. It\u2019s a popular free open source language for statistics, especially in academia.", "In previous articles I looked at the most in-demand tech skills for data scientists and data engineers. How do the data analyst results compare?", "The overall number of listings were 16,325 for Data Analyst, for 12,013 for Data Engineer, and 9,396 for Data Scientist. So data analyst jobs are relatively common. \ud83d\ude00", "The chart below shows the 10 most common technologies for data analyst listings. The scores for data scientist and data engineer listings are shown for each keyword, too.", "In terms of trends, my analysis of data scientist job listings showed that both R and SAS had large drops in popularity from 2018 to 2019.", "It\u2019s worth noting that many more technologies were mentioned in data engineer job listings than were mentioned in data analyst job listings.", "If you want to become a data analyst or make yourself more marketable, I suggest you learn the following technologies, in order of priority.", "Learn Excel. It\u2019s quicker to pick up than SQL. I knew Excel from school and work, but I learned it better by studying for a Microsoft Excel certification exam. If you are a self-directed learner, the official certification or a MOOC course could be worth your time.", "Learn SQL. If you don\u2019t know a programming language, it\u2019s a good first one to learn. My Memorable SQL book is available in pre-release here.", "Learn Tableau. Tableau allows you to make great visualizations quickly with a drag and drop interface. Check out my article to learn the basics here.", "Show you can make a PowerPoint presentation. There are many MOOCs that teach Microsoft PowerPoint.", "If you have demonstrated you can use the above technologies to analyze and communicate you should be a decent candidate for many entry level positions. \ud83d\udc4d", "If you know the above skills and want to learn new skills or qualify for more positions, I suggest you learn Python. Python is great if you want to move into data engineering and data science. \ud83d\ude00", "My Memorable Python book is designed for beginners. It\u2019s available for Kindle and hard copy from Amazon and in .epub and .pdf form here.", "Once you know basic Python, learn pandas. Pandas is a Python library for working with data. If you are looking for a data job that requires Python, you will probably be expected to have pandas skills, too.", "I\u2019m finishing up an introductory pandas book, so join my Data Awesome newsletter to make sure you don\u2019t miss it. \ud83d\ude80", "That might sound like a long list, but just take it one step at a time. \ud83e\uddb6 Recognize that it will take time and there will be ups and downs. You can do it \u2014 just persist! \ud83d\ude00", "I suggest you learn and demonstrate your skills by working on projects you can include in a personal portfolio. Then you can learn by doing things you like! You\u2019ll also have a body of work that shows potential employers your skills. For a quick guide to setting up a portfolio site, see this article.", "I hope you found this guide to the most in-demand technologies for data analysts useful. If you did, please share it on your favorite social media so other folks can find it, too. \ud83d\udc4d", "I write about Python, data science, and other tech topics.
