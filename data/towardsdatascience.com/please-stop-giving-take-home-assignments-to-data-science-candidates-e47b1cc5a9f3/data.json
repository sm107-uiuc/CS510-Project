You will likely receive hundreds of applications of candidates who all list the same keywords. Screening them is not easy and, to this purpose, (too) many companies assign a take-home data science tasks to some of their top candidates in order to emulate a work situation and evaluate a candidate\u2019s worth.", "Candidates are generally sent a data set similar to the ones the company usually works on (or an actual one) and should send back a report or notebook showing how they analysed it and what did they find.", "If you are doing this, please stop. \ud83d\ude4f", "Candidates are already putting a lot of effort when applying to your company. They browsed job boards, researched your company, modified their CV for the role, ideally wrote a personalized cover letter and repeatedly checked their inbox for some answers. Plus, they might also be interviewing for other companies.", "They will likely go through a phone screening process, a potential tech test or screening before spending their week end working on your assignment. If they\u2019re lucky enough, they\u2019ll also get to talk to your CTO, CEO or Department Head.", "I am sure you mean well and want to screen for candidates who are really motivated but, from a candidate perspective, putting 10+ hours of work on a single application can be seen as abusive and they might start to question how is it to work for a company asking for so much effort even before starting working with them \u2014 for free. You might put a time limit of only few hours but this will not work as it can not be enforced and putting more hours in can be seen as a competitive advantage for candidates.", "Let\u2019s be real. Top data science candidates can easily get interviews and job offers at multiple companies. And if they can have the luxury to enter 5 or 6 interview processes in a few weeks, why would they bother to spend part of their week end working on your assignment. Passing a potential opportunity would rarely be an issue for them.", "Thus, unless your company offers something extremely attractive or has a strong positive image, it is likely some high profile candidates will just refuse to take take-home assignments when they can engage in less time-consuming selection processes.", "Of note, the process won\u2019t necessarily be less time consuming on your side.", "You can choose to only scan very quickly their work but this is a waste of resources: the candidates time and the material they produced for you to evaluate them. If you only spend few minutes reading their work, you might as well have asked them something simpler, like talking about one of their projects.", "Another approach is to go thoroughly through each report. Although this is way more respectful of their work, you will end up using much more time to evaluate candidates but will still miss some important aspects of their personality and work process.", "A written report is indeed an important deliverable for data analyses but it only shows the final result and you will miss all the process leading to it. And this process matters.", "There are so many routes to get to a same final destination and candidates will have different approaches to your assignment. Some will be super efficient, some will use over-complicated methods and others will have used algorithms they barely understand. This information is as valuable as what they can deliver. And you just missed it.", "Thankfully, there are some alternative methods to assess more thoroughly a candidate skills while being respectful of their time. Here are some examples.", "The best way to know someone is to work with them. Choose your top candidate, offer them the opportunity to work on a short term (e.g. one or two weeks) project together while being paid (generally at a lower but decent rate). You have a unique opportunity to see how this person is working, e.g. how they define a project, how they collaborate in a team, what they deliver and how they communicate their results.", "At the end of the process, you will likely have a fairly good understanding of whether you would like to keep working with this person. You will also have produced something useful to the company while compensating the candidates for their time.", "The candidates will also have a good overview of how it is working with you and will be more confident to join you if they liked what they saw. They will also appreciate being judged on their actual skills and will increase their appreciation of the whole skill assessment process. Altogether, your employee retention will be positively affected.", "Automattic is for example doing this.", "If you are not set up for paid trials, there are still better methods than assignments to understand how a candidate works and live coding session is one of them.", "During live coding sessions, you send the candidate a data set and a given problem to solve and they will have a set amount of time (typically one hour) to solve it while sharing their screen and explaining their thought process. They can use their local environment or a hosted Jupyter notebook system like Colab.", "Live coding sessions is a powerful way to assess:", "From a candidate perspective, this can appear as a more fair way to be assessed as it covers more than a final report and it does not take longer than a normal interview. But, let\u2019s be honest, it is also more stressful and you might unconsciously select against specific group of candidates who can\u2019t perform well under those conditions.", "For some positions, writing clean and optimized code is not the priority as the focus will be more on using the most relevant methods under the right assumptions and deliver quickly an actionable result. This is the case for roles more linked to operations, strategy or research. Or, more generally, roles leaning more towards the business side than engineering.", "As the coding abilities are less of an issue, you can use the opportunity to discuss more deeply about the methodology, project framing and interpretation of results.", "To this purpose, a good approach is to get the candidate to talk about one of their recent projects (with some potential criteria on how to select one). Ask them:", "Such approach is generally less stressful for the candidate as they mostly have to discuss about things they already did. You can push them a bit out of their comfort zone asking more technical details as they advance.", "Take-home assignments ask candidates to commit an unfair number of hours and can eventually end up damaging your image as an employer. They do not provide an optimal way to assess a candidate skills. They sure allow to screen out unmotivated candidates but top candidates with many open opportunities will also avoid those demanding processes.", "But, good news! There are some interviewing alternatives which are at least as efficient and provide a better candidate experience. If you are still using take-home assignments, you now have no excuses not to opt for better methods such as paid trials, live coding sessions or project-driven interviews.", "Your home for data science.
