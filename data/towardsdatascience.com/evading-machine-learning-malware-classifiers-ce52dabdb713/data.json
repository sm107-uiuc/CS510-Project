The goal of the competition was to get 50 malicious Windows Portable Executable (PE) files to evade detection by three machine learning malware classifiers. Not only did the files need to evade detection, but they also had to maintain their exact original functionality and behavior.", "This competition was sponsored by Endgame, MRG-Effitas, and VM-Ray. The competition was a ton of fun, and winning comes with an awesome prize!", "This was a white box competition; meaning I had full access to all model parameters and source code. Therefore, the first thing to do was crack open the models and see what was going on under the hood.", "The first model is a neural network trained on the raw bytes of Windows executables. MalConv is implemented in PyTorch, and if you\u2019re already familiar with neural networks the code is relatively simple and straight forward:", "Files are passed to MalConv as a sequence of integers representing the bytes of the file (0\u2013255). An embedding layer inside MalConv maps each byte to a vector of numbers. The sequence of vectors can then be processed by additional neural network layers. The model outputs two numbers representing the probabilities of an input being benign and malicious.", "There\u2019s already a decent amount of literature out there on evading MalConv. The easiest attack is to just append a bunch of good looking stuff to the end of the executable. This is a particularly nice trick because the added data (also called the overlay) doesn\u2019t get loaded into memory when the malware is executed. Therefore, we can put whatever we want in the overlay without changing the functionality of the file. MalConv looks for both benign and malicious byte patterns in order to make a decision. The purpose of the overlay attack is to overwhelm it with patterns associated with benign files.", "The second model is actually the same as the first but with different weights assigned to the layers. As the name suggests, Non-Negative MalConv was constrained during training to have non-negative weight matrices. The point of doing this is to prevent trivial attacks like those created against MalConv. When done properly, the non-negative weights make binary classifiers monotonic; meaning that the addition of new content can only increase the malicious score. This would make evading the model very difficult, because most evasion attacks do require adding content to the file. Fortunately for me, this implementation of Non-Negative MalConv has a subtle but critical flaw.", "The non-negative defense only works for binary classifiers with a single output score representing the maliciousness of the sample. This version breaks the output into two scores: one for malicious and one for benign. Then, a softmax function converts the scores to probabilities for each class. This construction makes training with non-negative weights meaningless. Additional content can still push the benign score arbitrarily high. As the benign score goes higher, the softmax function will push the malicious score lower, even though the same amount of malicious content is present. So all of the same attacks against MalConv will work here as well.", "If you\u2019re interested in a bit more mathematical detail, check out Appendix A of this paper. The authors prove that a softmax network with non-negative weights is essentially equivalent to an unconstrained network in regards to what it can learn. This is why for a proper defense it\u2019s necessary to use a single output; we don\u2019t want the network to learn to look for benign content.", "Ember is actually a data set maintained by Endgame. Along with the data set comes a trained benchmark model (which I\u2019ll also call Ember). Ember is a lightgbm model (an ensemble of boosted decision trees) trained on several features parsed from Windows PE files.", "The source code for Ember\u2019s feature parsing is located here. Seeing how all of the features are parsed was quite useful for crafting attacks. The extracted features include:", "The numerical features are used as is, while the hashing trick is used to convert the rest of the features (like section names) to numerical vectors. At first glance, Ember looks more difficult to fool. Many of the features are related to the structure of the file or to characteristics which we won\u2019t be able to change. Remember, we have to evade detection while maintaining the original functionality!", "Ember\u2019s vulnerability is that some of the features can be arbitrarily controlled by an attacker. The lightgbm model uses these features in multiple locations throughout the ensemble of trees. We can take advantage of the complexity of the model by manipulating the features in order to drive the decision down paths which result in evasion.", "The competition code came with a script for running all three models against a single file. I changed the script to evaluate the entire directory of malware and used altair to add a fun visual scoreboard:", "The skull emoji represents that a model detected the malware, while the happy face represents an evasion. Interestingly, file 49 already evaded MalConv, so we get 1 point for free!", "After sinking a few minutes into figuring out how to plot with emojis, I decided it was time to think through how to go about tackling this competition. The tricky part would be finding valid manipulations that impacted all three models simultaneously, or at least impacted one but didn\u2019t throw red flags for the others. I decided to focus on attacks that would hopefully impact all three models at once.", "As mentioned, PE files can have arbitrary content appended to them. These additional bytes are called the overlay, and they\u2019re not loaded into memory when Windows executes the file. Therefore, adding bytes here won\u2019t alter the functionality of the malware.", "Besides the overlay, there is also room at the end of each section to add additional bytes. PE sections are required to be aligned to a power of 2 amount of memory. The section is padded out when the actual content does not fill this entire space. This portion of memory will not get accessed by the executable, so we can alter this space freely as well.", "In addition to adding bytes to existing sections, we can also create new sections. New sections won\u2019t break the file\u2019s functionality because there will be no references to them in the existing code. This gives us plenty of room to add whatever kind of content we want.", "Because the MalConv models treat everything as bytes (without structural context), for them we just have to focus on overwhelming their decision with patterns they attribute to benign files. However, the structure of Ember\u2019s features require us to actually think through the specifics about what might hinder it.", "The most obvious features we can manipulate are Byte Histogram and Byte Entropy. The Byte Histogram just calculates the normalized frequency of each byte value in the file. Because we can add sections containing anything, it is trivial to force the byte distribution to any target distribution we want.", "We also have decent control over the Section Info features. We can change the entropy of the section by using the slack space. We could also change the section names which could take us down different branches in Ember\u2019s decision trees.", "Finally, the Strings feature is also highly vulnerable to manipulation. Again, because we can add new sections containing anything, we can skew the string statistics to our heart\u2019s desire.", "All of the above modifications can be done using the same library that Ember uses to parse features: lief. The LIEF project is pretty awesome, and I definitely recommend checking it out. I used it for parsing the malware, making the modifications, and rebuilding the PE files; it\u2019s pretty amazing!", "Here\u2019s a short demo showing how easy it is to modify PEs:", "The general workflow is: parse the PE, make any modifications, build a new PE, save to disk.", "I also had a Windows Virtual Machine setup for doing reverse engineering. It was important to observe the altered files to ensure they were behaving identically to the original malware. Anytime I need a throw away Windows VM, I grab one from here.", "My plan was to start simple and add complexity as needed. New sections seem to be the most promising attack avenue, since it provides us with the ability to make major changes to both Ember\u2019s features as well as the raw bytes of the file. I wrote the following function in order to add a section and fill it with a constant value:", "I rebuilt the PE after every section addition so that lief would handle all the addressing for me. It would have also been possible to assign the addresses by hand.", "As an experiment, I appended a new section with 100,000 constant bytes to each file and monitored the evasion rate as I iterated over the constants (0\u2013255). Several different values had success, but the value 169 (0xA9) caused the most evasions:", "This simple attack devastated both of the neural network models. If we hadn\u2019t figured out the bug in the non-negative model, this result should have tipped us off. A monotonic classifier shouldn\u2019t be affected by this simple addition.", "Ember stood up well against this naive attack. I would have to come up with a more clever way to alter its scores.", "Next, I went over to Microsoft\u2019s download page and grabbed a copy of a random benign executable (download link). I ran the models on the file in order to confirm that it scored very low across the board. My plan was to mimic known good features from this file in hopes of causing evasions against Ember.", "I ran the command line utility strings on the file. This utility parses out all printable strings from the binary. I found a large chunk of strings which appeared to contain Microsoft\u2019s End User License Agreement (EULA). I grabbed this portion and saved it to a text file.", "Obviously, some of the most common Windows PE files happen to have been made by Microsoft. Therefore, when training malware classifiers it\u2019s likely that the training set has a bunch of Microsoft files labeled as benign. My idea was to exploit this possibility by adding stuff from my downloaded file to our malware. Things like the Microsoft EULA probably show up across many benign files. This should make the string statistics, byte distributions, and entropy more like benign files in general.", "I wrote the following function to read in the strings from the saved file and put them in a new section of our malicious PEs:", "I used this attack to add 75 new sections to each file (the competition had a file size constraint I had to stay under). I also included the previous attack to maintain our MalConv evasions. The new results were quite promising:", "I was down to only a handful of files left to evade. Upon further analysis, several of these files were packed. My manipulations were messing up their unpacking procedures and therefore breaking functionality.", "To make matters worse, at least one of the files also appeared to have code to detect if it had been manipulated:", "My first thought was to crack open the file in a debugger and patch out the assembly instructions checking for tampering. Unfortunately, the file also had anti-debugging code that basic anti-anti-debugging procedures weren\u2019t able to bypass.", "It felt like I was quickly going down a dangerous rabbit hole, so I took a step back and thought things over.", "Thankfully, the anti-tampering mechanism was only checking the portion of the PE that gets loaded into memory. So although I couldn\u2019t add new sections, I should still be able to manipulate the overlay!", "I had already seen that my string attack wasn\u2019t strong enough to fool ember on these files. I needed a different way to figure out what content should be added to the overlay in order to cause an evasion. I turned to my simple first motto and wrote the following code to systematically try swaths of each byte value and add them to the file if they lowered Ember\u2019s score. This continued in a greedy fashion until the file either evaded or got too large.", "I swapped out Ember for the other two models and used the same method for adding the required bytes to evade those models as well. Again, because I\u2019m adding bytes to the overlay, none of the packing, functionality, or anti-tampering checks were affected! I went back and ran this attack against all of the files, discovering it was able to universally result in evasion.", "It took relatively simple modifications to get all 50 files to evade detection by this ensemble of malware classifiers. Luckily, all of the models had vulnerabilities which could be exploited. If the Non-Negative MalConv model was implemented correctly, a perfect score may not have even been possible.", "Readers may already be familiar with the recent discovery of a simple method for evading a well known machine learning based AV product. While none of the competition classifiers were production systems, these results should serve as a caution to designers of machine learning based malware detectors in general. It can be very challenging to find a set of features that can discriminate between benign and malicious files while also being relatively safe under an adversarial threat model. As seen here, the small details can really matter!", "Thanks again to Endgame, MRG-Effitas, and VM-Ray for putting on an interesting and quite enjoyable competition. Hopefully we see more InfoSec companies step up to this level of scrutiny and involvement with the broader machine learning/security community."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
