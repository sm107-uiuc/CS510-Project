It can be done by investigating the possible colors of the objects in the photos, for example, the color of cloths, building, trees, cars, etc., and colorized them manually using some software such as Photoshop.", "The other approach is to train the computer to understand the colors of different objects by providing a large of amount color photos, then ask the computer to colorize by identifying plausible color for the detected objection. Thanks to the development of deep learning, it can be done by using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).", "The idea of Generative Adversarial Networks is quite straightforward, it contains two neural networks, generator, and discriminator. The generator\u2019s job is to predict the color based on the black and white photo and then generate colorized photos. The discriminator\u2019s job is then to judge if the generated photo is real enough compared to the real photo.", "If the discriminator can easily tell the photo is generated, which means the generator is not good enough, the generator needs more training. When the generator is improving and the discriminator cannot tell the difference anymore, the discriminator will be trained more in order to tell the difference.", "In this work, I took Jason Antic\u2019s DeOldify as reference (https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify) and trained a GAN using fastai.", "I used ImageNet as my training dataset. However, due to the computation limit (12 hours runtime limit on Colab), it was not easy to use all the images, so I ended up using only 5000 images from it.", "First I need to make the color image black and white for training. I also added a little bit of noise to give the images some kind of old photo feeling.", "Now I have the dataset ready, I can start training. I created U-Net learner for the generator and pre-trained it before the GAN. It can be done easily by fastai library.", "I started with a small size (64 pixel), so I can train it faster with a larger batch size.", "Then I increased the size to 128 and 256. I started to see some good results with more epochs.", "After the generator pre-training, I used the generator to generate color photos from the black&white dataset. Then I used these generated photos and the original photos to train the discriminator.", "After 10 epochs, the discriminator was able to tell if the image is generated with 85% accuracy.", "Now it is time to put them together. Fastai provides a very useful tool for creating GAN, combining the pre-trained generator and discriminator. After 50 epoch training, I got my preliminary results.", "I downloaded some black and white photos which the model has not seen before for testing. Here are some of the results.", "The model is able to colorize the tree and grass. It also did a good job of colorizing human\u2019s skin.", "Some colors are not really realistic but still quite convincing.", "Please be noted that this was trained by only 5000 images and not a lot of epoch, it might be improved further by doing more intensive training.", "A web app prototype can be quickly created using Streamlit. It does not require a lot of HTML and Java skills, so it is really helpful for web dummy like me.", "Thanks for reading, suggestion, and feedback are welcome.", "Your home for data science.
