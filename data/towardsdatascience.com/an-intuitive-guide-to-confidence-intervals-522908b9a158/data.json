The underlying data generation process is assumed to be random and one of the goals of statistical modeling is to understand this data generation process. As the data itself is random, any numbers we estimate based on this observed data has some inherent uncertainty linked to it. One way to think about this is that if we collected the data again and tried to estimate the number again, the result can probably change. In other words, the estimate is variable (think: variance). Due to this, we are usually not interested in single values (or point estimates), rather a range of values, which is a natural way to talk about an estimate that we are uncertain of. In statistical parlance, this is called a confidence interval. In simple words, confidence intervals let us quantify our uncertainty about an estimate in the form of a range of values.", "I have studied confidence intervals in the past and never felt satisfied with my understanding. Every time, I was left with a fuzzy feeling that I understood what confidence intervals meant, but never feeling sure. Recently, I found some enlightenment and in this article, I will be talking about confidence intervals using theory and simulations.", "Before diving deep into the details, let\u2019s check our understanding of confidence intervals. Take a look at this article and the plot on whether Americans were wearing masks or not in public in response to coronavirus spread. As per the data, 84% of Americans wore a mask in public with a margin of error (or confidence interval) of +/- 2.6% points. Let\u2019s assume, for the sake of this discussion, that they are talking about a 95% confidence interval, as that is a fairly common choice. Here\u2019s a question for you,", "Q: Does this mean that the interval [81.4%, 86.6%] contains the actual percentage of people who wore a mask in public 95% of the time?", "If you answered yes to the above question, then you are making a common interpretation mistake around confidence intervals just like the old me.", "Let\u2019s start by refreshing our memory about what exactly are confidence intervals.", "In the mask example above, \u03b1 = 0.05 (95% confidence), the parameter \u03b8 = percent of Americans who wore a mask in public in response to the virus spread, and a = 81.4%, b = 86.6%, which were both calculated using the collected data. In other words, the above equation states that the probability that the (true) parameter is contained (/trapped) in the interval C is at least 1-\u03b1. Notice, how I silently added the word true in front of the word parameter in the above sentence. This is the crux of confidence intervals, i.e. \u03b8 represents the true parameter value, which is unknown (otherwise the survey is useless), but is deterministic. More explicitly, the percentage of total Americans who wore a mask in public as coronavirus spread is not known, but it\u2019s not a random number. If we had the willpower and means to survey all Americans, we could find this unknown (deterministic) number.", "Surveying the entire population of Americans is not realistic and we want to make some reasonable guesses with the data we collected. Basically, with confidence intervals, we are trying to come up with a range of values that would contain the true proportion of Americans wearing masks 95% of the time. Notice, the uncertainty in the confidence interval creeps in through the endpoints of the interval \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019, which are a function of data (which is assumed to be random!).", "Takeaway: confidence intervals talk about the probability of a random interval containing (unknown) deterministic true parameter.", "A natural interpretation of confidence intervals can be as follows: imagine repeating the experiment over and over (in this context, this would mean doing several independent surveys). For each experiment, we can compute the confidence interval containing the true (unknown) parameter. By the law of large numbers, 95% of the time the (random) interval will contain the true parameter. This happens because we can represent the event that an interval contains the true parameter by an indicator function, and then the proportion of 0.95 follows from LLN.", "Now, let\u2019s look at an example from the book All of Statistics to gather these concepts.", "Let \u03b8 be a fixed, unknown real no. and let X\u2081, X\u2082 be independent random variables such that P(X\u1d62=1)=P(X\u1d62=-1) = 0.5. Let Y\u1d62 = \u03b8 + X\u1d62, and suppose we only observe Y\u2081, Y\u2082. Define the following \u201cconfidence interval\u201d, which contains only one point,", "Let\u2019s look at a realization of this experiment. Suppose we observe Y\u2081 = 15 and Y\u2082 = 17. Based on this data, our 75% confidence interval is C={16}.", "This computed confidence interval does not say that the probability of \u2018C\u2019 containing \u03b8 is 75%. Rather, as \u03b8 is fixed (see the question), it is either contained in the confidence interval or not. We are given that \u03b8 is unknown. If (magically) we came to know the value of \u03b8, we could have explicitly observed whether it is contained in the interval (P(\u03b8 \u2208 C) = 1), or not (P(\u03b8 \u2208 C) = 0). In other words, there is nothing uncertain about a fixed (or deterministic) value: it is either in the interval or not (eg. P(2 < 3) = 1).", "A Common Pitfall: after observing the data and computing the confidence interval with level \u20181-\u03b1\u2019, it is no longer the case that the probability of true parameter being contained (/trapped) in this interval is at least 1-\u03b1. The interval either contains the true parameter or not. As confidence interval is a random variable, it\u2019s value based on data is a realization, which represents a 1-\u03b1 confidence level, and is no longer probabilistic. When we call an interval an x% confidence interval, the \u201cx%\u201d is associated with the reliability of the estimation procedure (the process of calculating \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019).", "This seems a bit weird because we never get to see the true parameter \u03b8 (feels like it would be random), but remember that it is assumed to be deterministic. This notion follows from the frequentist interpretation which says that as \u03b8 is a deterministic unknown number, it can\u2019t be random.", "The graphic summarizes what we talked about in the previous sections: we observe some data (which is random), based on which we calculate a confidence interval for a given level (\u03b1), and this results in a 1-\u03b1 confidence interval, which is a realization and hence is not probabilistic. Moreover, there is an unknown deterministic true value of the parameter, which either lies in \u2018C\u2019 or not (just like the number 2 either lies in the interval [3,4] or not). Finally, when we say [a,b] is a 1-\u03b1 confidence level, \u201c1-\u03b1\u201d a label from the estimation procedure and doesn\u2019t aim at any probabilistic statements around containing the true parameter \u03b8. In essence, the above machinery consumes the data (and \u03b1) and spits out an interval \u2018C\u2019, which we like to call 1-\u03b1 confidence level that is completely deterministic.", "One big question that might be lingering in your mind can be how would we ensure that the true parameter is trapped in an interval \u2018C\u2019 without ever knowing its actual value? It might seem like magic (at least it did to me), but it\u2019s based on the idea of a very powerful theorem central to all of the statistics: Central Limit Theorem (more on this in the next section). I have left out the estimation of confidence intervals as it deserves a separate discussion.", "In this section, let\u2019s look at a simulation using an example similar to the mask data. Suppose we surveyed a group of Americans (whether they wore a mask or not) and observed the following responses: X\u2081, X\u2082, \u2026, Xn, where", "This is an indicator variable indicating whether a person wearing a mask (1) or not (0), with a probability p. Further, assume that these are i.i.d. which means that X\u1d62~ Bern(p) are Bernoulli random variables. Similar to the earlier discussion, the true proportion p is unknown. One idea to estimate p can be to take the average of our data, i.e.,", "This seems like a natural estimator: we compute the proportion of people in our sample that wore a mask. As explained earlier, this estimate is variable in the sense that if the data changes, p_hat can change. Quantitatively, the law of large numbers and central limit theorem tells us the following,", "Provided certain assumptions are satisfied, both these laws together talk about convergence to the true parameter value and the distribution in the process of converging to the true parameter (provided n is large enough). So, we can be sure that our estimate converges to the true value. Now, let\u2019s focus on the confidence interval. As an aside, we can observe that the variability associated with our estimate is p(1-p)/n, which goes to zero as we collect responses from more and more people.", "For this exercise, let\u2019s focus on a 95% confidence interval. Using the above equation, we can write this,", "This gives us a way to contain the true parameter p,", "Here, \u201cq\u2093\u201d is the quantile function and equal to ~ 1.96. The last step follows from the fact that we want the probability that \u2018C\u2019 contains the true parameter to be at least 1-\u03b1. Using this value, we get,", "There\u2019s still a small problem: the whole point of this exercise was to estimate p which is unknown, but our expression for \u2018C\u2019 contains p. There are several ways to proceed, but to keep this article concise, let\u2019s proceed with a simple conservative bound, i.e. the maximum width of the interval. This occurs for p = 0.5. So, we obtain", "We will now use this final expression for the simulations. For the simulations below, I assumed that n = 1000, which is reasonable in the context of surveying people.", "We can observe that as the number of experiments (which is another way of saying that we are doing the experiment over and over again) increases, the proportion of confidence intervals that contain the true parameter converges to the level 1-\u03b1 (here \u03b1=0.05). We can also see that for a small number of experiments only one confidence interval didn\u2019t contain the true parameter, which might seem contrary to the level 0.95 we used for this analysis. But, we need to remember that the 30 confidence intervals that we see in the left-most plot are 30 realizations, which were drawn from the underlying distribution of confidence intervals that has some variability. If you try re-running the simulations for the same number of experiments, this is why it spits out different results each time. This is also exactly why we say that once we estimate the confidence interval using the observed data, it is no longer probabilistic. Now, there might be a possibility that our estimated confidence interval doesn\u2019t contain the true parameter (for example, if we had selected the 1 red confidence interval from the left-most plot), but that is exactly what we capped with the analysis at the start of this section. Although we haven\u2019t removed the possibility completely, we made is highly unlikely like any probabilistic analysis.", "You can find the script used for these simulations here.", "Your home for data science.
