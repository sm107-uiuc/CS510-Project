The FDA estimates that in America, bee pollination adds $15 billion to the value of crops.", "Bees are also crucial in native ecosystems, cross-pollinating plants that can not reproduce themselves, indirectly creating food and shelter for countless other species.", "Given the huge amounts of value honeybees have in industry, as well as the environment, there is an increasing amount of scientific research being performed to understand their bee-haviour.", "I had the opportunity of working with the Cooperative Research Centre for Honey Bee Products, an initiative created to boost the Australian honeybee industry. One of the main ways the CRCHBP collects research data is by recording high-definition videos of bees in their natural habitat. A 20 second snippet of one such video:", "Did you see the bee in the bottom right?", "To turn these videos into useful statistics, like what flowers the bees visit and for how long, researchers need to manually watch hundreds of hours of these videos. This process can take weeks! Can machine learning help us?", "I was tasked with developing a system that could help identify bees in videos to speed up the analysis process. I was given several hours of previously annotated videos, so I could start training a neural network straight away!", "YOLOv4 is a super fast and accurate object detection framework that I used to create a model that can detect bees. Currently, it is regarded as state-of-the-art, and is accessible to developers of all skill levels. All you need to provide is your own data to train a custom object detection network.", "I uploaded the training data to a Google Colab notebook, which provides free GPUs \u2014 perfect for training neural networks. Compiling YOLO is as simple as pasting this into a Colab instance (all my code for this project is here):", "The network was trained on over 400 thousand images of bees, taking about 2 weeks to train in total.", "After the training process, the network could identify a bee in a still image with about a 90% accuracy.", "To detect bees in a video, we can run the network on every frame, then stitch all the frames back together \u2014 the Python OpenCV library made this super quick and easy. All the code for this project can be found at this Google Colab link. You can clone it into your own Drive and use it for your own data sets!", "Here\u2019s the output from the previous video:", "We can write some custom code to keep track of when there is a bee on the screen or not. Researchers will get a copy of this graph with every processed video. They can skip to the areas of the video where bees were seen. By my approximations, bees are only seen in the videos for about 20% of the time.", "With a graph like this, anyone analysing the video can skip to the most interesting bits! With videos often being hours in length, this adds up to a significant amount of time being saved.", "This was such an interesting problem to solve, and it will be rewarding to see this system deployed on terabytes of data the CRCHBP has collected. My one takeaway from this is the importance of having mentors \u2014 Dr. Mark Reynolds and Dr. Du Huynh from the University of Western Australia helped massively throughout the completion of this project.", "You made it to the bottom!
