I will be taking a look at Singapore which has enabled normal homeowners to rent out part or the entire of their house for a minimum of 3 months. Out of the popular hotel sites, Airbnb was chosen as it serves as a source of reliable data provider. It has collected all the listings and reviews from their own websites, up to around 90,000 rows of data. This would increase the reliability of the results even after data cleaning. In addition, data on the reviews made by customers have also been collected.", "The Airbnb data can be found here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html feel free to try an analysis on your own country\u2019s Airbnb as well!", "When people shop online or look for a hotel to stay at, they will turn to the reviews and recommendation section for reference. Reviews made by past customers are usually deemed to be reliable, and a reflection of their satisfaction level with a firm\u2019s goods and services. As such, this guides their decision of whether they should patronise a firm or not. With the ease of access to reviews, it is important to look deeper into how reviews might influence business\u2019 revenue. In the case of Airbnb, they have also divided hosts into either normal host or super host, based on the review scores. We will also explore what were the key differences that makes a host a normal host compared to a super host.", "Ultimately, we will look at how potential new hosts can determine the price, location, periods for servicing, and type of host to maximise revenue in Singapore.", "Recall that there are 2 different types of data provided by Airbnb, the listings (with prices, bedrooms, location, etc.) as well as the reviews.", "1) Drop all NaN values (missing data)", "4) Renamed \u2018id\u2019 to \u2018listing_id\u2019 to match the column header in reviews.csv", "1) Split the date into years, months and day columns, keeping only years and months for further data selection and to examine peak period", "1) Keep only those in 2019, minimum nights <=365, property type either apartment or condominium. This is to fix variables to minimise confounders.", "2) Calculated revenue based on minimum nights * price and then summing the rows with the same listing id (i.e est_rev=minimum_ nights * price * number of reviews)", "3) Removed all listings with only 1 review (i.e price*min nights=revenue, which might be pulling down the average)", "4) Removed year, day, date columns since they are already fixed or are not useful variables", "The final dataframe looks like this", "Price & revenue based on location", "Let\u2019s start with the location of the Airbnb. This would be useful for hosts who are intending to purchase a property to be leased and would need to know which location would generate the highest revenue.", "Most of the Airbnb are found near major roads, or in the south/business district area. This is likely because Singapore\u2019s Airbnb has a minimum stay time of 3 months, and Airbnb customers would be expected to be expatriates who come to Singapore to work and would prefer to stay near to their work location.", "Let\u2019s look at the revenue based on the location of the Airbnb. Due to the large spread in prices and revenue, the median value is taken for each district to be evaluated.", "Using the above median price and revenue for each district, as well as the listing in Singapore, we can see that those within the cluster around the business districts were priced the highest. In fact, the further they are from the business district, the lower the median prices. This trend follows to the median revenue earned in the districts as well, reflecting the effectiveness of the pricing strategy based on distance to the business district. However, one would expect the prices of properties in the business district to be higher as well. This cost is not reflected in the model but should still be considered.", "To circumvent the issue of cost, that is unknown to us, the alternative is to note districts where the median price was lower compared to the others but earned relatively higher median revenue. This would imply that there were likely more frequent bookings, making the location more attractive while possibly having a lower property cost.", "Based on the ranking values, positive changes in rank reflects that the district\u2019s median price was lower compared to their counterparts but saw a higher median revenue. In this graph, Holland Village showed the highest change in terms of price and revenue. This would make it a district that should be noted.", "Bookings and revenue based on season/month", "Next, we can look at the peak period for bookings. This would enable hosts to better schedule their time to perform maintenance for the house, actively source of customers, or to change their prices accordingly. However, as the data available is on the month when the review is made (i.e customer has stayed at the Airbnb and is now leaving), the analysis will be grounded around the periods when customers are ending their stay.", "Across 2019, the peak periods were from July to September. A possible rationale is that July was cited as a prime period for people to seek new jobs and is also a common period for the end of companies\u2019 fiscal year. This could lead to more expatriates ending their stay in Singapore to seek new jobs or are being relocated to another country because of their job. As such, this would be a good period for hosts to service the house and could possibly begin their search for a new customer prior to July.", "Lastly, an examination on the significance of host type is crucial before determining how a host can become a super host.", "In particular, the median revenue for super hosts was $11,180 per year, compared to $3,135.50 per year for normal hosts. The ratio of revenue earned by super host to normal host is 3.57 (2dp), which appears to be a huge difference. This would thus provide valid reasons for host to strive towards being a super host, due to potential higher earnings.", "Key difference between normal and super host", "Since the significance of super host has been established, the goal is to find out what is the factor that would allow a host to become a super host. This is done through a sentiment analysis of the reviews made by the customers. After removing words that carry little or no significance, the resulting word clouds for normal and super hosts are as such:", "Both word clouds look similar, and common words should be interpreted as basic requirements for hosts. The main idea, however, is that the super host would have certain key words that differentiate it from a normal host. This is done by selecting the top 10 keywords in each word cloud and finding the differentiating factor. This factor turns out to be the word \u2018helpful\u2019. An interpretation would be that the host has a greater engagement with the customer, possibly providing aid at no cost even though it is not stated in the lease/contract.", "One assumption is in the calculation of estimated revenue. The equation is est_rev=price * minimum_night*number of reviews. The period of stay for each customer may not be exactly the minimum nights required, nor will every customer write a review after their stay. This means that the revenue calculated is a gross underestimation of the actual revenue. Furthermore, the main goal for hosts is to maximise profits, but there is no information on cost of property, which makes it difficult to determine the best district to get a property at.", "After analysing the location, period and host types, the best location to be a host would be either at the business district (revenue maximisation) or Holland Village (bookings maximisation). They could choose to use the median price of Airbnb in the district to ensure more consistent bookings. The peak period for maintenance and servicing would be in July to September, and hosts could be on the lookout for new customers prior to July. Lastly, the host status is a significant variable with regards to revenue and should be the goal for hosts. In order to achieve that, hosts should go beyond the basic provision of amenities and attempt to be more \u2018helpful\u2019 in the eyes of the customers.", "Your home for data science.
