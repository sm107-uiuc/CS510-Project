Analyzing historical data (all classifications from 1963 until 2020), we will be able to answer many questions about the German league. What teams won the German league? What teams nearly won the Bundesliga? When did Bayern\u2019s hegemony start? What teams receive more penalties? \u2026 and many more! Continue reading \u25b6\ufe0f", "Let\u2019s make a brief introduction for those that have never heard about the German league. \ud83d\ude4c", "The German football league commonly known as the Bundesliga is the first national football league in Germany, being one of the most popular professional sports leagues across the world. It was founded in 1963 after the unification of five regional leagues from West Germany and consisted initially of 16 teams.", "At the end of a match, the winning team is rewarded with three points (before the season 1995\u201396 with 2 points) and the losing team with zero. In case of a tie, both teams are rewarded with 1 point.", "In many European leagues, the bottom three teams are automatically relegated to the second division. On the contrary, in the Bundesliga, only the bottom two are directly relegated to the 2 Bundesliga. The 16th team in the Bundesliga and the 3th in the 2 Bundesliga contest a two-legged play-off for a place in the first division.", "The introduction is made! Now, we are ready to analyze the data \u2764\ufe0f", "The historical data of the Bundesliga (from 1963 until 2020) was scraped from Bdfutbol.com. This website contains football rankings of the best European leagues.", "To scrape the data, we have used BeautifulSoup which is a popular Python library for extracting information from an HTML page. After obtaining all the data, we have stored it in a Pandas data frame for further processing.", "The programming code used in this analysis is available here. You can take a look at it as you read the article.", "Data Cleaning is the process of transforming raw data into a standardized form that can easily be analyzed with data analytics tools. In this particular case, before analyzing the data using Pandas, we perform a few cleaning operations. First, we remove unnecessary columns and rename the remaining ones using English terms (remember that the data was scraped from a Spanish website). Then, we modify the wrong data types. The column points (points obtained by a team during a particular season) is of data type object instead of integer due to the presence of asterisks. These asterisks are used to refer to explanations at the bottom of the web page and they are not relevant for this analysis. In fact, the data type is not imported correctly because of the existence of these asterisks in some entries of the column. Therefore, we have to remove them, before converting the column points to an integer data type.", "After cleaning the data, we obtain a Pandas data frame that can be easily processed to extract conclusions. As shown below, the data frame contains information such as the number of games won, drawn, and lost, the number of yellow and red cards, the number of points, and the position in the ranking of all teams that took part in the Bundesliga from 1963 until 2020.", "The Bundesliga has been played by 57 different clubs during its 57 years of existence (up to the season 2019\u201320); however, only twelve of them got their hands on the trophy. The following plot shows the German league winners from season 1963\u201364 until 2019\u201320.", "As shown above, Bayern M\u00fcnchen is the most successful club in the history of the Bundesliga with 29 titles, which represents more than 50% of the leagues. The next most successful teams are Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund which has won the Bundesliga five times. Apart from them, other teams such as Werder Bremen, Hamburger, Stuttgart, K\u00f6ln, and Kaiserslautern also had the honor of lifting the Bundesliga trophy multiple times.", "There are 6 football teams that have never won the league but they were on one or more occasions runner-ups: Alemannia Aachen, Bayer Leverkusen, Hertha Berliner, Meidericher, RB Leipzig, and Schalke 04. As shown below, Schalke 04 and Bayer Leverkusen have been particularly unlucky being runner-ups of the Bundesliga 7 and 5 times respectively. Additionally, we can also observe that Bayern Munich is the club that has been on more occasions runner-up of the Bundesliga (10 times).", "In the season 2016\u201317, RB Leipzig finished second in the Bundesliga. The club was just founded in 2009 and is currently one of the leading teams in Germany mainly because of the significant investments made by the company Red Bull.", "Werder Bremen holds the record for having played the most seasons in the German league. They have played the Bundesliga in 56 of its 57 seasons, being relegated to the second division only on one occasion. Bayern M\u00fcnchen has played in the Bundesliga uninterrupted since 1965, and Hamburger from 1963 until 2018, both of them 55 seasons in total. Apart from the aforementioned clubs, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Schalke 04, and Eintracht Frankfurt have also participated in the German league more than 50 seasons.", "In the last season (2019\u201320), all the teams from the image above played in the Bundesliga with the exception of Hamburger, Stuttgart, and Kaiserslautern.", "The Bundesliga began with 16 teams in 1963 and it was enlarged to 18 teams in 1965. Since then, the number of clubs in the Bundesliga has remained unchanged with the exception of the season 1991\u201392. In that season, the league was temporarily expanded (20 teams) to accommodate the clubs from former East Germany.", "Currently, 18 teams play in the German league. The same number of teams participate in the Primeira Liga (Portugal), and the Eredivisie (Holand). On the contrary, 20 teams take part in the Serie A (Italy), the Liga (Spain), the Ligue 1 (France), and the Premier League (England). Nowadays, there is still a debate over whether two more teams should be included in the Bundesliga to be in line with the most important European leagues.", "The Bundesliga has been clearly dominated throughout its history by Bayern M\u00fcnchen winning more than half of the total leagues. Since 2000, Bayern M\u00fcnchen has won 14 out of 20 leagues, being for other teams almost impossible to compete against the Reds. But has the Bundesliga always been dominated by Bayern M\u00fcnchen? When did the Bayern\u2019s hegemony begin? Let\u2019s clarify all questions with a simple plot.", "The following interactive line chart shows the evolution of the number of leagues by team. To properly visualize the results, you can deactivate some traces and only visualize those you are interested in. You can show or hide traces by clicking on their associated legend item. Additionally, you can get information about a data point (season and number of leagues) by hovering the mouse over it.", "In the seventies, the German league was dominated by two clubs, none of them founding members of the Bundesliga in 1963: Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Bayern M\u00fcnchen. Only these two clubs had the honor of lifting the Bundesliga trophy from 1969 until 1977.", "Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s glory days were in the seventies. Under the supervision of Hennes Weisweiler (1964\u20131975) and Udo Lattek (1975\u20131979), the Foals won five Bundesliga trophies, two UEFA Cups, and they even reached the Championsleague final in 1977, which they lost against Liverpool.", "From the mid-eighties on, Bayern Munich has totally dominated the Bundesliga. So far, they have won more titles than all the other teams put together. However, Bayern\u2019s hegemony has been broken several times since then. In the 90s, Kaiserslautern got their hands in the trophy two times (1990\u201391 and 1997\u201398), winning the second league just after being promoted from the 2 Bundesliga. In 2008, after defeating Bayer by 2 points, Wolfsburg won their first Bundesliga and qualified for the first time in their history for the Champions League. The last team that challenged Bayern\u2019s hegemony was Borussia Dortmund under the charismatic guidance of Jurgen Klopp way back in 2012, the last year the Bundesliga had a champion that was not Bayern. Since then, Bayern M\u00fcnchen has won the Bundesliga eight times in a row. Nowadays, Bayern M\u00fcnchen is Germany\u2019s most successful football club both at home and in Europe.", "All the aforesaid can also be observed in the following plot which shows the number of leagues by team and decade.", "The following interactive plot shows the historical performance (position in the ranking over the year) of all teams that have played in the Bundesliga. To display the historical data, we have to select the team using the drop-down list located in the upper left corner. We will notice that in some seasons there is no data available, meaning the selected team has not participated in the first division in that particular year. Feel free to check the performance of the teams you are more interested in \ud83d\udc9a", "There is one thing that most football fans across the world take for granted: the use cards. However, it was not until 1970 at the World Cup in Mexico that the yellow and red card system was used for the first time in football. The system was invented in 1966 by the English referee Ken Aston who noticed that many times football players did not understand or just ignored the warnings made by referees which at the time were orally communicated. Then, inspired by the colors of the traffic lights (red and yellow) and their meanings, Aston created a color-coding scheme to clearly indicate that a football player has been cautioned or expelled.", "The use of yellow and red cards was implemented in the Bundesliga in the season 1970\u201371. A few years later in 1991, a combined yellow/red card was introduced in the German league. The player receives a yellow/red card after getting a second yellow card in the same game, implying that he has to leave the game and is excluded for the next match. On the contrary, the player is barred from the competition for a longer time when receiving directly a red card. Additionally, if a player accumulates five yellow cards, we will also be excluded from the competition for the next game.", "The following plot shows the total number of red cards per season. As I previously said, before the year 1971, the referee announced to the player his fines verbally. In the figure below, prior to 1971, red cards represent football players that were expelled during the match only with words (without using cards). Prior to the use of cards, players often did not receive penalties. Only in special cases (really strong fouls), football players were expelled from the game.", "We observe a growing tendency (particularly fast in the 80s) until the mid-nineties. From that moment on, the total amount of red cards is slowly decreasing over time.", "Likewise, the plot below shows the total number of yellow cards per season.", "The total number of yellow cards per season has grown steadily from 1971 until the nineties. From this time on, the number of cards remains nearly constant around 1200 cards per season.", "In a previous article, we have analyzed the Spanish league (link here!). After comparing the results, we can observe that the evolution of the number of red and yellow cards over the years follows the same pattern in both leagues as shown below. However, the players in the Spanish league receive substantially more cards than players in the Bundesliga (although they play only two more games).", "Now, maybe you\u2019re wondering: What teams received more cards in the last seasons?", "The following plots show the average number of red and yellow cards by team from 2000 until 2020. As shown below, Bayern Munich is one of the teams that receive on average fewer cards per season. The same happens in Spain with Real Madrid and Barcelona, as we analyzed in prior articles.", "Bayern Munich has totally dominated the Bundesliga in the last 10 years winning 8 titles in a row. During that time, the only team that has challenged Bayern\u2019s hegemony has been Borussia Dortmund; however, Bayern M\u00fcnchen has demonstrated stronger defensive skills than its direct rival.", "The following plots show the goals for and against from 2010 until 2020 of both teams. In the two seasons in which Dortmund won the title (2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312), the black and yellows were defensively as good as the Reds, even much better in the season 2011. However, since then, Bayern M\u00fcnchen has shown a greater balance in attack and defense which explains its success in the last eight seasons.", "If you have enjoyed reading this article and you want to know more about other leagues \ud83d\ude03, take a glimpse at the analysis of the Spanish league :)", "Your home for data science.
