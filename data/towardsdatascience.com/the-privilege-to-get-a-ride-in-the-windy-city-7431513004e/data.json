On average, the temperature in Chicago dropped most significantly in the month of October. On Halloween 2019, \u201cthe snowiest Halloween\u201d according to Chicago Tribune, the temperature was particularly low and reached 24 degrees.", "Other than the distinctive weather, Chicago is also known for a segregated city with some \u201cstark dividing lines between rich and poor\u201d (Chicago Business). According to the same article, the middle class in the city is shrinking, with \u201c4 in 5 of those ex-middle-class adults moved down to a lower income tier here.\u201d", "Under the aforementioned context, I am interested in investigating how ride-share patterns in a stratified Chicago are affected by a decreasing October weather, provided with the trip dataset generated by ride-share companies in Chicago. The rest of this post is a study of the Transportation Network Providers Trip dataset provided by the City of Chicago on its Data Portal. I will cover:", "Proven by the visualization from the dataset\u2019s online dashboard, there is an increase in the use of ride-share in October. Thus, I focus my questions on how the ride-share pattern has changed spatially across the city. My hypothesis is that change in the use of ride-share is affecting the city unevenly:", "To test the hypothesis, I will compare ride-share pattern between the first and second half of October 2019. The date Oct. 17, 2019 will be the date of division, For both groups, I will visualize the following features with respect to each census tract:", "The visualization will help identify the change in ride-share patterns during the month of October. Mapping the changes across the city, I want to compare the changes spatially to the distribution of median household income and the railway lines over the same area.", "Data Collection: All datasets are accessed from aforementioned linked sites.", "Aggregation: After some initial cleaning, the trip dataset is divided into two sets by the time point of October 17, 00:00am, with the first half of 16 days and the second of 15 days. Through table join, the following ride-share features for first and second half of the month are aggregated to census tract level:", "Preparing for Visualization: All unprojected datasets are projected to the state plane. Several features are engineered in the joined table:", "Percent change is calculated as: (second_half -first_half) / first_half", "To reach meaningful conclusions through comparison, all the visualization with respect to ride-share in this post are juxtaposed with a visualization of median income distribution in the city.", "Daily Pickup-Dropoff Ratio, first half of the month", "While most of the city shows a mixing pickup-dropoff ratio, the pickup-dropoff ratio seems most stable (about \u00b1 12~15%) and clustered in the north, along and between the Red Line to the east and Blue Line to the west, corresponding to the wealthiest neighborhoods.", "Percent change in average daily pickup and daily drop-off", "In general, there is a north-south divide which correspond as well to the wealth line. Grey areas show a slight increasing trend for both pickup and drop-off (\u2264 15~17% ), while increases are significant in the orange area (\u2265 15%). Blue areas show a slight decrease (\u226411~16%).", "Percent change in median trip duration and median trip mileage", "Patterns are less pronounced with regard to changes in trip duration and mileage. Grey areas show no significant change (within 5%) in trip duration and mileage. Light blue shows a slight decrease (\u2264 11~12%) whereas orange shows a slight increase (\u2264 10~19%).", "Given the visualization, I want to test the correlation between change in pickup or drop-off with income, distance from downtown, and the number of stations. I will test their correlation by linear regression:", "Distance from Downtown: From rough visual estimates, downtown is chosen as the centroid of the census tract 8391. Distance from downtown is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the centroid of census tract 8391 and the centroids of each census tract.", "Number of Station: A spatial join is performed to count the number of stations falling into each census tract.", "Scaling: Income, distance from downtown and the number of stations are percent ranked.", "Regression: Ordinary Least Square Regression using the package statsmodel:", "While the Adjusted R-square is very low for both models, we can nevertheless argue that both income and distance from downtown are strongly correlated with the change in drop-off or pickup, supported by small P-values. In terms of the coefficients, income has a positive one whereas distance shows a negative one.", "Lastly, the number of stations correlates fairly weakly.", "We can conclude that the spatial pattern of ride-share change is correlated with the income distribution and the distance from downtown. When the weather gets colder, the affluent rides more often. Yet the drop in ridership in the poorer neighborhood and in the area further away from downtown are less explained.", "While I did not test for trip duration and mileage, their visualization does not show too much of a change for most parts of the city. However, both\u2019s increase in the periphery surely indicates a correlation with distance to downtown.", "This post is written for the course Urban Informatics, taught by Professor Boyeong Hong, at the Urban Planning Department of Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.", "Your home for data science.
