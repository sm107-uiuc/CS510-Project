We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "Illinois\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d order, the State\u2019s shelter-in-place equivalent, went into effect March 21st and continues today. But despite the quarantine, Illinois COVID-19 cases still seem to be accelerating. This is in stark contrast to the clear successes being seen in areas like the SF Bay Area.", "The first thing to notice about Illinois is that the number of total cases continues to trend upward. This is true for most states and doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are not flattening the curve. The question is, how quickly is that number of total cases increasing?", "The number of new cases daily is the most important statistic to pay attention to for determining whether a state is flattening the curve. It represents the acceleration of the infection.", "For illustrative purposes, let\u2019s use a hypothetical example over the span of a week.", "If the number of new cases in a state is doubling every two days that would mean they have 400 new cases on Monday, 800 new cases on Wednesday, 1600 new cases on Friday, and 3200 new cases on Sunday \u2014 making for a total of 6000 new cases for the week. That\u2019s bad, that shows an increasing rate of infection.", "By contrast, if the growth curve is flat, they might show 40 new cases Monday, about 40 new cases Wednesday, about 40 new cases Friday, and 40 new cases on Sunday \u2014 making the weeks total 160 new cases.", "The former case is the kind of growth curve that can quickly overwhelm a healthcare system. The latter case is what it looks like when the curve has been flattened. There are still new cases, but the number of new cases per day is not growing. Thus the number of total cases is not accelerating.", "We can see here in this chart that the growth curve in Illinois does not seem to be flattening. There\u2019s some variability from day-to-day, but if you look at the 7-day moving average (the green line), you can see that the number of daily new cases is still trending upward. What\u2019s going on here?", "One thing that stands out that is illustrated in this chart is that the vast majority of the cases in Illinois are in Cook County. Cook County is the home of Chicago, the biggest metropolitan area in the state and the region of greatest population density.", "One thing we need to consider is that the number of confirmed new cases may not always represent the actual number of new cases. A surge in testing can create a surge in confirmed new cases.", "So it stands to reason that Illinois (or even just Chicago) are doing more and more tests every day, they would show an increasing number of daily cases, even if the number of actual cases is flattening. Let\u2019s look at the testing data.", "Now looking at this chart, the narrative starts to change. Here we see a big increase in tests conducted on April 24th. If we go back to the Daily New Cases chart we also see a big increase in confirmed cases on April 24th.", "Does the testing curve account for all of the increases in the growth curve? It doesn\u2019t appear to, no. But it does flatten out some of the more alarming peaks and necessitate additional caution when reporting how effective shelter-in-place is in Illinois.", "All data and visualizations for this article are from the Knowi Coronavirus Data Hub.
