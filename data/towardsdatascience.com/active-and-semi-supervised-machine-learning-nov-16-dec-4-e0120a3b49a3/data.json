Before we get into the hot-off-the-arXiv-press research, I just want to let you know about a webinar that I will be co-hosting with an NLP-focused AI startup Kairntech on December 17, 17:30 Paris-time (also known as 5:30 pm CET):", "If you are new to active machine learning, then (a) it is unlikely that you made it this far down, (b) you might want to check out my introductory blog posts on this subject:", "Or, for the more audio-visually minded, here is my recent beginner-friendly conference talk:", "Without further ado, let\u2019s get to the advanced business.", "Healthcare is one of the domains where the costs associated with manual data annotation tend to be particularly high, so it is always nice to see an active learning benchmark for a medical application. The authors of A Transfer Learning Based Active Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Classification used active learning to develop a model than performed slightly better than the fully supervised baseline while reducing the number of the labelled samples used for training by an impressive forty percent!", "Active learning is, of course, not the only way to deal with the problem of not having enough labelled data. Semi-supervised learning (of which active learning can be viewed as an example) has a wide variety of other methods, where unlabelled data is used alongside the labelled training samples for the common goal. Then there is self-supervised learning: technically supervised (each data point is assigned a target), it requires no manual annotation on our part.", "As the cheeky title of the preprint above suggests, the authors found that when semi-supervised and self-supervised approaches join forces, the benefit of adding active learning into the mix can be marginal, at best. However, keep in mind that what is true for CIFAR10 that the authors chose, might have little bearing on the results you obtain for your dataset. (Of course, the same goes for most other active learning studies, including the more optimistic ones.)", "The next preprint, Active Learning in CNNs via Expected Improvement Maximization, gets bonus points for acronym creativity: they abbreviate Dropout-based Expected IMprOvementS as DEIMOS. Cute!", "Their paper is supposed to be an improvement on using the expected test error as a query strategy inside the active learning loop. Here \u201cexpected\u201d is meant in a statistical sense, meaning that the calculation is averaged over all label possibilities for the unlabelled samples (which it has to be \u2014 since we do not know their labels yet!). This is a computationally costly query strategy, so any method to make it more efficient is certainly welcome.", "Uncertainty sampling is known to give rise to issues in the real world (namely, the fact that it goes straight for the outliers \u2014 which is the last thing that you want to spend your hard-earned data annotation on). Deep Active Learning for Sequence Labeling Based on Diversity and Uncertainty in Gradient looks at how to get the most of active learning for NLP by combining uncertainty with diversity-based sampling:", "Not having had much experience with robotics, I must admit that I have not heard about imitation learning before. It seems to be some sort of supervised/reinforcement learning fusion \u2014 in fact, is not that how humans naturally learn as well? In any case, it turns out that robots too can benefit from a bit of active learning:", "2020 has been a rough year for many of us, but seems that there is light at the end of the tunnel at last. I wish you to end 2020 on a high note (let\u2019s be honest, a local maximum would do at this point), and have a fantastic 2021!", "Your home for data science.
