It has been almost 11 years since BYU has tasted victory against their rivals, Utah! What makes Utah\u2019s football team better than BYU? Is it the number of runs or passes they attempt? Is their offense or defense better? In order to deliver insight as to why BYU loses to Utah, we built a machine learning model to predict the yards gained from running or passing the ball in certain game-time scenarios for BYU. We are confident that this model can be used by BYU Football to make better game-time decisions, resulting in better offensive efficiency and more wins.", "Outline:- Data Analysis- Methods- Results- Web Application- Next Steps- Contributions- Summary", "Data sourceOur data source was given to us by the BYU Football Analytics department \u2014 it consists of the results of all rushing/passing plays from all games from 2015\u20132019.", "This data records several metrics about each play, such as the following:", "Data cleaningOur project focuses specifically on BYU\u2019s offense, so we filtered out all the rows documenting BYU Football\u2019s defensive plays, which left us with about half of the data set. From there, we removed all plays dealing with punts, field goals, interceptions, etc. We wanted to look specifically at passing and rushing plays.", "The BYU Football Analytics team also had several calculated features for their use, such as EPA (expected point average) and WP, but due to the projected, on-the-fly use of our application, we removed them from our data set.", "We also engineered other features to see if they were good predictors of yards gained (see below for results):", "Ideally, these metrics will be available to BYU in real-time, thus enabling BYU to use a web app tool to aid play-calling.", "FindingsOur exploratory data analysis process consisted of calculating the original correlations with data and comparing them across zone and year.", "On the left, we see that in every case, the average yards gained through passing is greater than the average yards gained by rushing. This makes sense, because passing is a higher risk, higher reward than rushing.", "However, the difference between the two is not as drastic in the red zone. This makes sense because there are fewer yards to gain. Additionally, defenses tend to kick their efforts up to another level to prevent scoring opportunities for the offense.", "As a result of this finding, we decided to build two separate models \u2014 one for rushing and one for passing. Passing and rushing data are significantly different, thus we wanted to split our data and only predict one play type at a time.", "Here we see that the yards gained on fourth down is the lowest (except in 2015). This makes sense because most teams will take a low risk, low reward play on fourth down.", "However, there are significant differences between all downs, especially third down. Third down has higher average yards gained than any other down. This kind of finding is something that indicates that we needed to include this in our model. Check out the rest of our cleaning/analysis here.", "From our findings, we were able to understand which metrics we wanted to work with for our models, such as down number, zone, yards to goal, etc.", "We first visualized the relationships between each feature in the data set and the label (yards gained). This helped us to see which features could play a large impact in predicting yards gained based off of correlation effects. Check out our initial modeling here.", "With these initial relationships confirmed by our analysis of the datasets, we selected the top 30 features that related most to the play-by-play data and began running a multi-linear regression model in python. This would help us see the combined effects of features with each other and the total relationship, or strength of prediction, with yards gained.", "We developed a function that would iterate through the model and kick out the feature with the lowest t-score effect on the label. This allows us to continually select the most important features with the best coefficient weights, while also mediating the difference between our R-squared score and the adjusted R-squared score. This iteration, visualized, plots the R-squared and adjusted R-squared through the number of remaining features.", "As features with little to no impact on the model score are removed, the R-squared and the adjusted R-squared approach one another and result in a better, and more accurate, model. We decided to use about 11\u201312 features in our model, and reviewed them to make sure they make practical sense when considering data for the next play to aid coaches in the decision-making process.", "These features are:- Defensive rank- Play count in the current drive- Month- Under two minutes left in the half- Down number- Distance to first down- Current zone position on the field- Average yards gained thus far in the drive- Yards to goal- Previous zone of play- Previous yards gained", "With these metrics, we felt that we could predict the potential yards gained on the next play. However, to create a better and more accurate model, we wanted to go farther and separate out our data set.", "Rushing and passing plays have significantly different defense/offense formations, differences in the yards gained (rushing plays typically gain less yards than a pass), and various other differing effects which led us to separate our data into a passing data set and a rushing data set. With two different models, we felt that we could group rushing and passing plays with data of the same type, thus getting a better prediction.", "Once the data was separated, we engineered specific features that better related to the type of play: pass or rush. For passing, we added a running average of the yards gained on passing plays in the current drive. We also added a running success rate up to that point in the game. If a quarterback or certain receiver is hot, then these metrics show that in the data.", "For rushing plays, we added a similar feature that would help calculate the running average of yards gained for rushing plays in the current drive. With these features ready, we ran our two models specific to play-type.", "As displayed above, the passing model has a slightly better R-squared score due to both an average amount of passing yards and a calculation of the success rate, whereas the rushing model only has the average amount of rushing yards in the drive, along with other features like distance, down number, etc.", "With the models in place, we next developed a prototype application (BYU-Analytics) that coaches could potentially use in game situations. Essentially, the app is a simple calculator with inputs for down, distance, passing completion rate, etc. These inputs are sent to a live Azure Machine Learning web service that calculates the predicted yards gained and sends it back to the application. Click to visit our Azure passing and rushing experiments.", "This application is built with a ReactJS frontend, and Django-Python backend that connects to a live database hosted on a SQL Server in the Azure cloud. We produced our models in Azure for ease of access as well as for our rush to implement a prototype app. With more time, we would like to create our machine learning models in Python.", "Essentially, this app is a full-stack machine learning platform. Inputs are sent from the user to the backend, which calls the machine learning web service. The web service imports data from our hosted database, and returns a prediction to the backend. We then save the inputs, along with the predicted total of yards gained to the database so the model can use these predictions to retrain and \u201clearn\u201d and improve accuracy and results over time. The prediction is then sent back to the user who can make better decisions based on the forecasted value of yards gained.", "On the app, there are separate input forms for both the rushing prediction and the passing prediction. We designed this so coaches could switch back and forth between views to see which play type has better results. Check out the rest of our code at our GitHub repo.", "As previously mentioned, our app is currently a prototype. However, we will outline the next steps we would like to take to make our application become a more viable game-time product that coaches can use to aid in the decision making process.", "Currently, our data can only help our model accuracy through play-time statistics that measure play impact on the field. We need more data to account for all the moving pieces on the field. We believe that with offensive and defensive formation data, we can better account for defensive lapses and offensive successes and vice versa. This will take our model of predicting yards gained to the next level.", "Another missing piece of our model is the lack of the seasonal statistics and progress of the players on the field. Knowing the total rushing yards in a season for a specific running back and the average yards gained on a play for that same running back will aid in the predictive process. Player-specific data, as well as formation data will help increase the predictive power of our model.", "This project has been in a unique space that we have not yet encountered in the realm of sports analytics. While many teams are currently analyzing NFL-level data, we believe that the niche of college football is an open opportunity for analytics.", "The contributions this specific project makes to domain knowledge of college football analytics are:", "Football is an incredibly complex game with a large human element. Through using machine learning and data analytics, we have shown that we are able to predict the outcome of a play within a reasonable level of certainty. This learning can also be integrated into an easy-to-use platform in real-time. With further development and additional data, the confidence of the model can likely be improved further.", "We expect that a future model could be derived based on our research that could recommend the ideal next play to maximize yards gained. Such a tool may be used in real-time in a game or used in past game reviews by coaches to better improve their team strategy. Game analysts and enthusiasts could also use such a tool to analyze the performance of teams and players to make investment or fantasy sport decisions.", "Ultimately, we are pleased with the research and results we have been able to achieve. Through analysis of BYU games, we were able to minimize the human element and complexity of the game of football. There are areas for improvement and further development that we would love to see pursued either by ourselves at a later time or other data scientists.", "Like what you see?
