The pioneer of iPods and smartphones is at the forefront of innovative technologies, superior marketing, and of course, big data.", "Data scientists at Apple also seem to wear the hats of software engineers, so I was only able to find so many interview questions focused on data science. That being said, I\u2019m providing you with five interview questions and their corresponding answers.", "Both L1 and L2 regularization are methods used to reduce the overfitting of training data. Least Squares minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, which can result in low bias but high variance.", "L2 Regularization, also called ridge regression, minimizes the sum of the squared residuals plus lambda times the slope squared. This additional term is called the Ridge Regression Penalty. This increases the bias of the model, making the fit worse on the training data, but also decreases the variance.", "If you take the ridge regression penalty and replace it with the absolute value of the slope, then you get Lasso regression or L1 regularization.", "L2 is less robust but has a stable solution and always one solution. L1 is more robust but has an unstable solution and can possibly have multiple solutions.", "To understand ACF and PACF, you first need to know what autocorrelation or serial correlation is. Autocorrelation looks at the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself.", "Therefore, the autocorrelation function (ACF) is a tool that is used to find patterns in the data, specifically in terms of correlations between points separated by various time lags. For example, ACF(0)=1 means that all data points are perfectly correlated with themselves and ACF(1)=0.9 means that the correlation between one point and the next one is 0.9.", "The PACF is short for partial autocorrelation function. Quoting a text from StackExchange, \u201cIt can be thought as the correlation between two points that are separated by some number of periods n, but with the effect of the intervening correlations removed.\u201d For example. If T1 is directly correlated with T2 and T2 is directly correlated with T3, it would appear that T1 is correlated with T3. PACF will remove the intervening correlation with T2.", "Here\u2019s a great explanation of ACF and PACF here.", "The bias of an estimator is the difference between the expected value and true value. A model with a high bias tends to be oversimplified and results in underfitting. Variance represents the model\u2019s sensitivity to the data and the noise. A model with high variance results in overfitting.", "Therefore, the bias-variance tradeoff is a property of machine learning models in which lower variance results in higher bias and vice versa. Generally, an optimal balance of the two can be found in which error is minimized.", "XGBoost is an ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that leverages the gradient boosting algorithm. In essence, XGBoost is like a bagging and boosting technique on steroids. Therefore, you can say that XGBoost handles bias and variance similar to that of any boosting technique. Boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm that reduces both bias and variance by takes a weighted average of many weak models. By focusing on weak predictions and iterating through models, the error (thus the bias) is reduced. Similarly, because it takes a weighted average of many weak models, the final model has a lower variance than each of the weaker models themselves.", "Random forests are an ensemble learning technique that builds off of decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree. By relying on a \u201cmajority wins\u201d model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.", "For example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would predict 0. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the predicted value would be 1. This is the power of random forests.", "Random forests offer several other benefits including strong performance, can model non-linear boundaries, no cross-validation needed, and gives feature importance.", "Naive Bayes is better in the sense that it is easy to train and understand the process and results. A random forest can seem like a black box. Therefore, a Naive Bayes algorithm may be better in terms of implementation and understanding. However, in terms of performance, a random forest is typically stronger because it is an ensemble technique.", "Here are six bonus interview questions focused on programming if you would like to try to answer them yourself!", "If you like my work and want to support me, I\u2019d greatly appreciate if you followed me on my social media channels:", "Your home for data science.
