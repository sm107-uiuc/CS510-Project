I compile it with historical data, disaggregate it based on the SOP, and then upload it into the dashboard template. Once I\u2019ve checked for errors, I alert the distro-list that the updates are complete\u201d", "I sat there and listened \u2014 half in shock but the other half of me was beaming because I saw such an easy fix in front of me.", "This was how one of our junior data scientists was describing a project, really a weekly update, that he worked on to the larger data teams in our organization.", "It was immediately clear to me that he didn\u2019t know why he was doing this work, or how it fit into the overall needs of our organization.", "It was also clear to me as I looked around the room at the nodding heads, that others didn\u2019t see how clearly lacking this was in his presentation.", "In our organization data science is a support function, not the main output. We have several different teams and individuals assigned to different parts of the organization. Each provides data support based on the needs of the part they are assigned to. This often means that they are working on projects which others don\u2019t know about, or perhaps never see the end result.", "It occurred to me recently that we needed to create a regular forum where our data scientists could share and discuss their projects in order to allow for wider understanding, cross-pollination of ideas and best practices, and shared resources where collaboration made sense.", "We repurposed a standing weekly meeting and coordinated one 15 minute presentation each week. The first couple were a struggle to make sure the presenters weren\u2019t just providing updates to the leadership who already knew all about the project \u2014 we had to be very explicit that the audience was peers and colleagues.", "However, as I listened to our junior team member describe his project as he understood it, I knew there was a coaching moment for him and other members of the team \u2014 but also for me as the team leader.", "The briefer was one of our most enthusiastic team members. He is always volunteering for new projects, making recommendation for new techniques, taking classes and training in his personal time. I\u2019m certain he is going to grow into one our star players.", "The project he described was mostly handed off to him after it was complete, but he also had bit of a hand in the design and implementation. Yet, he clearly saw the project from a very narrow perspective \u2014 really just the series of actions that he took each week, rather than the organization need which necessitated the project, the users of the project, and the outcomes for the organization.", "Maybe it\u2019s too easy for leaders, who are forced each day to have a very broad view of the work, to forget that the junior team members often spend most of their time focused on individual tasks that they can easily lose sight of the \u201cwhy\u201d of the project.", "However, I think it is imperative for data scientists to maintain that perspective. I believe individuals and the organization will always benefit when the data scientist can tell the entire story of the data project.", "I see this happen in new projects too. A data request will come in from another part of the organization and the analyst who is assigned it focuses on the key words in the request and immediately dives into the database tables. Sometimes they completely understand the request, but often they only think that they understand what is being asked for.", "As a leader, I have had several conversations with data scientists about a project where it became very clear that they thought they fully understood the request, only to have me dislodge that belief with a few well placed questions.", "This has led me to enforce a clear rule for our data scientists: if you cannot tell the entire story of this project to your grandmother (substitute rubber duck, pet, etc.), then you are not ready to roll up your sleeves and start programming.", "The point of being able to tell the story to someone outside of the organization is that it forces you to know the background of how data is collected, how the project is going to result in the desired outcome, and why this outcomes matters to the organization.", "Often this conversation forces you to check assumptions and clarify with end users. When done well, it often results in a much different direction than initially thought.", "For instance, the end users don\u2019t always know what to ask for or how to ask for it. Additionally our data scientists often make assumptions based on data inputs or particular data fields that are faulty. And lastly, it helps clarify whether a particular process is needed or if the needs can be met through less resource intensive methods.", "Anyone who has worked on data science projects from beginning to end knows there are many ways to accomplish the same tasks. Additionally, there a number of decisions that need to be made throughout the project. If you don\u2019t have a full understanding of what you are working on and why, you can\u2019t possible make those decisions in the best way.", "I strongly believe that in order to troubleshoot the project and design it for the end users you have to understand the needs of the end users.", "A couple of key goals to ensuring your or the team actual know and understand the data story:", "Your home for data science.
