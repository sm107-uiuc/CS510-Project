Overfitting arises when a model tries to fit the training data so well that it cannot generalize to new observations. An overfit model captures the details and noise in training data rather than the general trend. Therefore, even slight changes in a features greatly changes the outcome of a model. Overfit models seem to be outstanding on training data but performs poor on new, previously unseen observations.", "The main reason of overfitting is model complexity. Thus, we can prevent a model from overfitting by controlling the complexity which is exatly what regularization does. Regularization controls the model complexity by penalizing higher terms in the model. If a regularization terms is added, the model tries to minimize both loss and complexity of model.", "In this post, I will cover two commonly used regularization techniques which are L1 and L2 regularization. The two main reasons that cause a model to be complex are:", "It is also called regularization for sparsity. As the name suggests, it is used to handle sparse vectors which consist of mostly zeroes. Sparse vectors typically result in very high-dimensional feature vector space. Thus, the model becomes very difficult to handle.", "L1 regularization forces the weights of uninformative features to be zero by substracting a small amount from the weight at each iteration and thus making the weight zero, eventually.", "It is also called regularization for simplicity. If we take the model complexity as a function of weights, the complexity of a feature is proportinal to the absolute value of its weight.", "L2 regularization forces weights toward zero but it does not make them exactly zero. L2 regularization acts like a force that removes a small percentage of weights at each iteration. Therefore, weights will never be equal to zero.", "There is an additional parameter to tune the L2 regularization term which is called regularization rate (lambda). Regularization rate is a scalar and multiplied by L2 regularization term.", "Note: Choosing an optimal value for lambda is important. If lambda is too high, the model becomes too simple and tends to underfit. On the other hand, if lambda is too low, the effect of regulatization becomes negligible and the model is likely to overfit. If lambda is set to zero, then regularization will be completely removed (high risk of overfitting!).", "Note: Ridge regression uses L2 regularization whereas Lasso regression uses L1 regularization. Elastic net regression combines L1 and L2 regularization.", "Overfitting is a crucial issue for machine learning models and needs to be carefully handled. We build machine learning models to predict the unknown. We want the model to learn the trends in the training data and apply that knowledge when evaluating new observations. Thus, the model needs to generalize well to the underlying structure rather than focusing too much on detail of training points. Regularization helps models to achieve this goal.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
