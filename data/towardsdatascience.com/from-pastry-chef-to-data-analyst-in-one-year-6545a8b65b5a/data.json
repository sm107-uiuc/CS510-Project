It seems, and it is, a very exciting area to study and work\u2026 if you have at least a STEM degree.", "When you have a different background, like I do, it isn\u2019t really helpful to search for people who changed careers to work with data. In many cases, you will find stories about \u201cbig\u201d changes from people who came from physics, astronomy or mechanical engineering into data science, and it\u2019s cool, but what about chefs, bank tellers and school teachers? The feeling is that it\u2019s kind of a trap, that there is not a real possibility to work with data if you have never had any exposure to code, statistics or heavy math before. And yes, it will be much harder to learn everything from zero, but I\u2019m here to show that even though, it\u2019s possible!", "I\u2019ve studied gastronomy, which is an hybrid between culinary arts and hospitality management. After college, I\u2019ve worked as a pastry chef and gastronomy teacher, and later on, I worked also for a bank. For many years I didn\u2019t have any idea about python, loops, z-scores or all the magic you can do with pandas. However, I\u2019ve always been very curious about AI and Machine Learning, even if at that time those concepts were more close to science fiction for me.", "It all changed after I took my sabbatical year when I realized I would like to do something new with my life. Then, I started to research what was cool, flexible, dynamic and allows you to work anywhere in the world. The answer was technology, and among all the possibilities, data science was one of the coolest options, so I\u2019ve decided to start an online course at Dataquest, to see if I like it, and initially, I was focused on learning the basics of python prior to anything. I have also started to listen to podcasts, like Dataframed, to read loads of articles, mostly the ones from Towards Data Science and KD Nuggets, to familiarize myself with who is who in that world.", "After a couple of months, I was really enjoying what I was learning, and at that time I had moved to Dublin, Ireland, where I found a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics, which is basically a one year very intensive course that gives you a diploma equivalent to a bachelor\u2019s at the end. I was working full time and had little money, but I\u2019ve decided to give it a chance, in the end, one year wasn\u2019t that much time.", "Remember when I said it was an intensive course? It took literally all my free time during the whole year, with so many assignments and exams that I felt overwhelmed many, many times. But as much as I was progressing in my studies, happier I was to discover so many magic things like Tableau, Kaggle competitions, learn how to clean data (ok, not so cool, but really necessary), t-test, ANOVA, and the list could keep going. I was pretty sure that I was on the right direction, but how to get my first job opportunity?", "I\u2019d sent more than 200 applications, having changed my CV at least a dozen times, and still nothing. I was following the recipe, started a github portfolio and a blog, while I was also trying to get more hands-on knowledge in the tools a data analyst needs. What was the secret? Simply, Patience.", "Starting from zero is hard, and being resilient was the key to get my first interviews, and learn from my first negatives. You need to learn what people expect you to know, and how you will demonstrate that. As an example, I begin to use one of my college projects, an interactive dashboard (you can check it here) on my interviews. Talk about something you deeply understand always will give you extra points at any job interview, even if the project itself is not perfect or conclusive.", "Finally, the interview from which I\u2019ve received my first job offer came from a local data science meet-up, and I can\u2019t stress enough the importance to always attend all possible events that you can, meet people, show your face, and don\u2019t expect things to come to you easily, be a fighter!", "For conclusion, from the first time I\u2019ve typed \u201cdata science\u201d on Google until I signed my first contract as Data Analyst, it cost me exactly one year, plus the equivalent of an used car in terms of money, but more important than anything, it demanded a strong commitment with myself to learn as much as I could every day", ". At the present moment, I finished my course, and I\u2019m now interested to dive deep into NLP and classification techniques, probably starting a master\u2019s next year. I\u2019ve just started to bake my data science cake, but I can tell you it will be a tasty one!", "Your home for data science.
