When enquired about this network now and then, all I could accumulate is something as dubious as the dim web and I concede I will be unable to appreciate their rapture. Albeit I can feel their fascination for this network, yet I am consistently dumbfounded to quantify how such a digital or telephonic network can give them clear fulfillment to overwhelm the successive hints of despairing from regular household or workplace chores. They are unequivocally inclined towards relentless learning and experimenting with opportunities from the world of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, and numerous asset class allocations to build their investment portfolio. They are perpetually examining the trade-offs between the return and risk of their investment decisions and perceive harmony.", "After discussing the basic elements of a linear programming model here,", "we gradually have taken a bold step to discuss some of its applications here.", "We then took some effort in taking a glance at a particular progression of LPP in DEA here.", "In this article, we would look at another specialized progression of LPP through Portfolio models and asset allocations. This concept was first introduced by American economist Harry Markowitz in 1952 and later in 1989 the same won him the John von Neumann Theory Prize and then in 1990 won him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. A brief on his revolutionary \u201cModern Portfolio Theory (MPT)\u201d can be found here.", "Investment advisory firms regularly strive to provide their customers with the best optimal mix of financial assets to invest in with a broad spectrum of risk tolerances. Techniques like LPP assist in determining the optimal proportion to invest in the portfolio comprising different financial assets. The aim primarily remains at providing investors the best return possible. Determining the exact return for any financial asset in immediate future is non-viable, however, some fair assessments can be done to estimate based on historical returns.", "The table below shows data on the returns over five 1-year periods for six mutual funds. A firm\u2019s portfolio managers will assume that one of these scenarios will accurately reflect the investment climate over the next 12 months. The probabilities of each of the scenarios occurring are 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.4 for years 1 to 5, respectively. [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "Each of the above seven funds may bring 5 possible returns over the next 12 months. As a further clarification, these are not five continuous return numbers. These are five independent years and any one of these years can be a close possibility for the next 12 months, however, with certainty, the exact return can never be promised. Therefore these can be referred to as possible scenarios currently available to best estimate the future return. In the real world, there can be more than hundreds of scenarios for each fund.", "An investor can either decide to invest all available money in one particular fund or choose a mix of funds proportionately to find the best possible return. If the investor chooses the latter option, then to decide the proportion of asset allocation that would be invested in each fund must add up to one. Let us assume, LC = Proportion to be invested in Large-cap funds, MC = Proportion to be invested in Midcap funds, SC = Proportion to be invested in Small-cap funds, ES = Proportion to be invested in the Energy sector, HS = Proportion to be invested in Health sector, TS = Proportion to be invested in Technology sector, RES = Proportion to be invested in the Real estate sector. To set this proportion constraint, LC + MC + SC + ES + HS + TS + RES = 1, must be defined.", "Let us consider a scenario where one has only Large-cap and Mid-cap funds available with 15% and 10% respective possible returns to invest $500 for the next 6 months. The investor decides to allocate $250 each in both the funds. Therefore, his expected return could be (15%*$250) + (10%*$250) + ($500) = $562.5. In the above example, we have five scenarios instead of one and 7 different assets instead of two. Also, the 50:50 proportion is unknown in the above example.", "Let us assume, S1 = Return of investments from Scenario-1, S2 = Return of investments from Scenario-2, S3 = Return of investments from Scenario-3, S4 = Return of investments from Scenario-4 and S5 = Return of investments from Scenario-5. Therefore we may formulate the possible returns for all five scenarios as shown below;", "The probabilities of each of the scenarios occurring are 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.4 for years 1 to 5, respectively, which implies each scenario has a different chance of occurrence. In the case of more than hundreds of scenarios, the sum of probabilities of all such scenarios must add up to one. Hence, our objective is to maximize the minimum return which may make us form the objective as {0.1*S1 + 0.3*S2 + 0.1*S3 + 0.1*S4 +0.4*S5} subject to constraints.", "Now let us consider an investor wishes to invest if and only if the minimum return from a particular scenario is at least x%. In other words, if x is less than equal to zero then the investor could be a risk-prone or risk-tolerating player because he/she does not expect any positive returns to start with. Similarly, if x is greater than zero, then the investor could be a conservative player because he/she does expect some positive returns to start with. Separate LPP models can be solved, where x is varied from \u201320% to 20% in increments of 1% (as an example case), and the optimal expected return is calculated for each value of the minimum return.", "Develop a portfolio model for investors who are willing to risk a portfolio with a return no lower than 2%.

However, the portfolio return would be 24.33% if scenario-1 occurs, 29.99% if scenario-2 occurs, and 30.99% if scenario-4 occurs.
