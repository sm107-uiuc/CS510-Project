Unfortunately, this is also the case when an expert makes well-founded statements compared to the algorithms. Most people don\u2019t know what\u2019s the basis for a decision a computer made. Many people believe they are unconditional. But it\u2019s only partially true. Algorithms are developed by humans. Some may say with Machine Learning the bias of a human developer is being dismissed. Let\u2019s take a brief look at Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks.", "A good Machine Learning Model needs good data. In supervised learning, you need a good set of classified training data. If your training set has a bias, the model will have a bias, too. What does that mean? Let\u2019s have a look at some cases with biased training data and the consequences of their usage.", "Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the bias of humans would be eliminated at the hiring process? It doesn\u2019t matter if someone is from a foreign country, the ethnic background and gender don\u2019t matter. Just skills matter. The perfect job for an algorithm, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what Amazon thought back in 2014. An algorithm was used to pre-filter candidates for open positions. In 2015, they realized that their algorithm preferred males. Even if female candidates would have better qualifications they were not recommended by the system. Reason: The training set was biased! In a male-dominated area, the model has concluded that women are rather unsuitable. In 2015 Amazon stopped using its algorithm.", "An AI named COMPAS promises to predict the recidivism rate in crimes. Many states in the US are using COMPAS. With a set of about 137 questions, the algorithms calculate if someone will commit a crime again. Based on this people will face higher sentences. Consequences are, judges don\u2019t take a look at the criminal records. They are using the score COMPAS returns. This leads to a dangerous feedback loop because COMPAS gets no feedback about wrong accuses. And the training set may be biased as it\u2019s based on past cases. The accuracy is questionable. You get deeper insights by Pro Publica including a GitHub repository with a nice Jupyter Notebook.", "This is Tay. A chatbot created by Microsoft in 2016. The idea was to create a bot that learns from interactions with other users at Twitter. And Tay learned fast. Within less than 24h (exactly 16h), Tay got to be a racist, fascist, and being discriminating. Microsoft tried to fix their bot \u2014 unsuccessfully: Tay is offline. The Problem was: Users have specifically directed conversations with Tay in this direction. Shit in \u2014 Shit out.", "Every story above has one thing in common: Biased Data was used to train a Model. Within the models, a black box decides how to react to some input. Think about the hiring AI from Amazon. None of the applicants know what parameters were important. I doubt HR staff knew how they were being evaluated. The same applies to COMPAS and Tay. To understand the black box we take a little excursion into Deep Neural Networks.", "Disclaimer: This is a high-level explanation. The whole topic is more complex, but you\u2019ll get the idea.", "Let\u2019s start with a simple perceptron:", "Some input is being weighted, put into a function, and an activation function decides if the perceptron fires or not. Your task is to adjust the weight and define a bias (what happens when input is 0?) for every input data in your training set until it fits best.", "Machine learning means: Use training data to determine the weight to fit best for all data. For the simple perceptron, it could be an equation like", "In most cases, the input is more complex, and we get some kind of linear regression.", "And again, we have to find out the perfect parameters where our linear regression fits best for all training data.", "Today we\u2019ve got enough computing power to train a model with millions of data points in effortless time. And such a simple model is still understandable for humans.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at a Neural Network.", "A neural network has an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer. As you can see, every output of a neuron could be input for every neuron in the next layer. For every neuron weights and biases are determined. It\u2019s getting complicated and humans will have more problems to interpret what happens in this network. A Deep Neural Network could have more than 2 hidden layers. Imagine a neural network with 50\u2013100 Inputs and 5 hidden layers. The trained model is becoming a black box for human beings.", "Think about the COMPAS case: Nobody knows what parameters are used, how is the model being trained? Where does the training set come from? The same applies to the Amazon case. Neural Networks are getting more complex.", "That\u2019s why explainable AI is demanded and encouraged. The idea: It describes what a neural network does, how it\u2019s trained etc. In 2017 DARPA funded several efforts for explainable AI. Accenture is propagating responsible AI and explainable AI is a major part of it.", "But it\u2019s not just the neural network which should be explainable. AI-based systems mustn\u2019t create negative feedback loops. An algorithm based on data needs more data to get better. If a system like COMPAS predicts a high recidivism and someone is therefore sentenced to a longer prison term, the resocialization becomes more difficult. And here begins the negative feedback loop. Worse chances of getting a job, despair and possibly committing another crime to survive. The AI-System knew it! Or did the system cause it? Difficult to answer.", "Even without being a criminal, AI can get you in deep trouble. Steve Talley for example, has been falsely accused being a criminal and was brutally arrested. His fault? Image recognition has falsely linked him to a crime.", "Used training data sets must be open for everyone. If a training set has a bias, people should know. Most systems, be it at hiring people or for policing are working as black boxes. They do not have a good feedback loop, either. And people still trust the computer algorithm more than an expert. We all have to be responsible for AI-based systems. Data Scientists are in charge to be responsible. IBM recently got out of facial recognition businesses because of criticism of racial and gender bias. This is a step in the right direction towards acting responsibly. Amazon and Microsoft followed with similar moves.", "AI is great. I love the possibilities of this technology. There are tons of good examples. But we need to use it responsibly. And not every problem could be solved with AI. We need to keep this always in our minds.", "Your home for data science.
