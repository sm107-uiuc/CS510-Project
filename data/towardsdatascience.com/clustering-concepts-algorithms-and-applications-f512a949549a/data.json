If you answered B, no one else needs to explain to you what clustering is.", "In machine learning terminology, clustering is used as an unsupervised algorithm by which observations (data) are grouped in a way that similar observations are closer to each other. It is an \u201cunsupervised\u201d algorithm because unlike supervised algorithms you do not have to train it with labeled data. Instead, you put your data into a \u201cclustering machine\u201d along with some instructions (e.g. # of features & # of clusters), and the machine will figure out the rest and make clusters based on underlying patterns and properties in the data.", "So if clustering is such a simple concept then what exactly do we need to learn about them? Quite a few things actually:", "Let\u2019s crack these questions separately, then we\u2019ll dive into some technical details.", "Let\u2019s clear up a few things first. In figure B above the observations are clustered. But in what respect? The answer is \u2014 they are clustered in a two-dimensional space with respect to two variables represented by X and Y coordinates.", "But that\u2019s just one way to see clusters. Objects can be clustered in a million different ways such as by age, height, location, price, gender \u2014 you name it.", "Why at Macy\u2019s women\u2019s clothes are all in one place, men\u2019s clothes in a different corner and furniture are probably on an entirely different floor? Why do they organize products in a way that similar things are together and different things are separated? We don\u2019t need data science to understand that. But there are numerous instances where we do need data science to understand how things are clustered and how things to cluster. Here are a few examples:", "It\u2019s easy to visualize data in a two-dimensional plane and visually inspect whether they are clustered or not. But what if there are 3 or 4 dimensions; or even 10s of dimensions? What if there are millions or even billions of data points? Algorithms are here to help. Here are a few clustering algorithms frequently used in machine learning:", "Each algorithm above has strengths and weaknesses of its own and is used for specific data and application context.", "K-means Clustering is probably the most popular and frequently used one. The algorithm starts with an imaginary data point called \u201ccentroid\u201d around which each cluster is partitioned. K-means is easy to implement and interpret. But one key disadvantage is its sensitivity to outliers.", "Hierarchical clustering is more informative than K-Means but it suffers from a similar weakness of being sensitive to extreme values. Additionally, implementing this algorithm can be time-consuming for large datasets.", "DBSCAN is robust in the presence of outliers but has its own disadvantage \u2014 high sensitivity to model parameters (\u03b5 and minPts).", "I wrote more about these algorithms and their properties in a previous article if you\u2019d like to check out.", "In this section we will do a rapid implementation of K-Means clustering using sklearn package in a step-by-step approach. In the next section, we will discuss how this simple implementation can be adapted in different situations using different model setups.", "Next step is to import data. I am using the famous (and over-used!) Iris dataset for this demonstration. The data is available online and can be imported easily using the code below.", "One thing that needs to be made clear here is that the Iris dataset is a \u201ccleaned\u201d dataset \u2014 no feature engineering required, no missing values or no filtering required. I\u2019m using it solely to focus on the algorithm, but of course we know that in real-world it takes quite a bit of work to clean them up.", "Next up feature selection. In the table above, the dataset contains 5 columns \u2014 4 of which are numeric and one string values. Out of 5, we are going to choose just 2 features in this round (later we\u2019ll see how it works in multiple features space). In a two-dimensional scatterplot this is how it looks like.", "You\u2019ll immediately recognize a cluster is distinguishable in the left lower corner of the plot. But what about the rest of the data points? It\u2019s not that easy to identify whether they are just one cluster or if they could be broken into two or more clusters based on any other underlying features. That\u2019s what an algorithm is good at and we\u2019ll use an example towards the end.", "Since we are doing a two-feature cluster analysis let\u2019s select those features below. Normalizing data is also an essential part of input preparation (we\u2019ll talk about normalization later again).", "With that minimum data preparation, all that remains is instantiating the K-means algorithm from sklearnand fit the model with input data X. The only parameter we are using is n_clusters to specify the number of clusters we want.", "So we have fitted the model, now it\u2019s time to visualize them in a scatterplot.", "In a visual inspection do the clusters make sense? Pretty good, right? We can now count how many observations fall under each cluster.", "Let\u2019s keep the scatterplot and counts of data in the back of our mind, we\u2019ll need them to compare performance of alternative modeling options. Let\u2019s call this model the \u201cbaseline\u201d model.", "In the above, we implemented a model with a set of pre-determined inputs. The purpose of this section is to go beyond the baseline and see how differently we could set up the model and how that impacts clustering. We will do three different experiments:", "Like I said before, you could choose any number of features for creating clusters and in the baseline model we used just two. But what if we select three features instead and how does that impacts the clusters?", "Let\u2019s re-run the model with new features.", "If you compare this new model with the baseline you will see that we still have 3 clusters and the cluster at the bottom corner remains the same. The rest of the clusters have quite a few overlapping data points. This is because we are using a two-dimensional plane to represent 3-dimensional outputs. If we could create a 3D scatterplot the clusters probably wouldn\u2019t be overlapping.", "Normalization requires a long discussion, but to make a long story really short, the purpose of normalization is to scale data within the same range, let\u2019s say -2 to +2. The benefit of doing so is that it condenses highly scattered/dispersed data so that makes it easy to find clusters.", "Let\u2019s re-run with the new setup.", "Homework: Can you now compare the 3-feature outputs with the 2-feature outputs in the baseline? You can visually inspect in also see the value counts.", "We talked about quite a few algorithms that can be used for clustering and each has advantages and disadvantages. There is no algorithm that is better or worse in *absolute* sense, it just depends on the underlying data structure and the feature space. In real-world you will need to experiment with several algorithms and see which one does a good job.", "Let\u2019s set up the model with a different algorithm, this time using hierarchical clustering, keeping others the same, and compare the results with the baseline model.", "This is a bonus part. So we kind of arbitrarily specified 3 clusters in the baseline model and subsequent experiments. It was easy to determine from visual inspection because it\u2019s a tiny dataset. But actually, there is a data-driven approach to make that determination \u2014 called the Elbow method. The code snippet below may look a bit complex than it should be but don\u2019t put an extra effort to understand it if you don\u2019t want to.", "What the Elbow method does is help us heuristically decide the number of clusters based on a cutoff point (k = 3), beyond which adding more clusters does not significantly reduce the sum of squared errors. That\u2019s the point that looks like a human elbow.", "I\u2019ve covered several different themes in this article, it\u2019s time to summarize them:", "I hope this was a useful article.
