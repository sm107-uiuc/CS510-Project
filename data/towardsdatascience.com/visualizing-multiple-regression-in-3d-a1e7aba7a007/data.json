In this post we\u2019ll be talking about multiple regression, as a precursor, you\u2019ll definitely want some familiarity with simple linear regression. If you aren\u2019t familiar you can start here! Otherwise, let\u2019s dive in with multiple linear regression. I recently spoke about visualizing multiple linear regression with heatmaps, if you\u2019ve already read that post, feel free to jump down to the modeling section of this post where we\u2019ll build our new model and introduce the plotly package and 3 dimensional visualizaiton. If you haven't read it, this is another helpful way to visualize multiple regression.", "The distinction we draw between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression is simply the number of explanatory variables that help us understand our dependent variable.", "Multiple linear regression is an incredibly popular statistical technique for data scientists and is foundational to a lot of the more complex methodologies used by data scientists.", "In my post on simple linear regression, I gave the example of predicting home prices using a single numeric variable \u2014 square footage.", "This post is a part of a series of posts where we explore different implementations of linear regression. In a post where we explore the parallel slopes model, we create a model where we predict price using square footage and whether it\u2019s a waterfront property or not. Here we\u2019ll do something similar, but we\u2019ll create our model using multiple numeric inputs.", "Similar to what we\u2019ve built in the aforementioned posts, we\u2019ll create a linear regression model where we add a new numeric variable.", "The dataset we\u2019re working with is a Seattle home prices dataset. The record level of the dataset is by home and details price, square footage, # of beds, # of baths, and so forth.", "Through the course of this post, we\u2019ll be trying to explain price through a function of other numeric variables in the dataset.", "With that said, let\u2019s dive in. Similar to what we\u2019ve built previously we\u2019re using sqft_living to predict price, only here we'll add another variable: sqft_basement", "The inclusion of various numeric explanatory variables to a regression model is simple syntactically as well as mathematically.", "While you can technically layer numeric variables one after another into the same model, it can quickly become difficult to visualize and understand.", "In the case of our model, we have three separate dimensions we\u2019ll need to be able to assess.", "As I mentioned previously, here we will be using plotly's 3d plotting tools to generate deeper understanding.", "Let\u2019s first visualize sqft_living and price to familiarize ourselves with the syntax.", "As you can see the syntax isn\u2019t too different from ggplot. First specify the data, then jump into the aesthetics without having to explicitly declare that they\u2019re aesthetics. The above visual is a simple 2 dimensional scatter plot.", "Similar to what we did before, we\u2019ve just moved price to the z-axis and now included sqft_basement. What's fun about this plotting tool is that it's not static, you can click and drag rotating the angle from which you're viewing the plot. Obviously here you're just seeing a screenshot, but get this running on your own machine to experience the full flexibility of plotly. At the moment you run this command in RStudio, your Viewer window will populate with this dragable/moveable visual that lends well to interpreting a dataset of greater dimensions.", "When moving from two dimensions to three dimensions, things change. If you have background in linear algebra this may resonate. To put it simply, if you have a single dimension, then you have a point. If you have two dimensions you have a line. If you have three dimensions\u2026 you have a plane.", "Having this in mind, Let\u2019s visualize our multiple linear regression model with a plane.", "First things first we need to create a matrix with all possible model inputs as well as the model prediction in each case.", "Below I create a vector for our x and our y. We then pass them to the outer function where we declare the operation of passing them both to the linear regression function defined through the fitting of our model.", "Now that we have our plane, let\u2019s add it to our visual.", "Again, you\u2019ve got to jump in and play with plotly yourself.", "You\u2019ve done it! You\u2019ve added a plane to your 3D scatter plot that represents the relationship between our regression formula and different inputs of sqft_lot & sqft_basement, but we still have a question\u2026 how does this help us?", "Have you ever added a regression line to your 2D scatter plot? If so, what was the intention?", "You would add a line to your plot to give an indication of what the \u2018best fit\u2019 looks like, but it\u2019s also useful to be able to say for a given value of x, we would predict y. The plane gives us exactly that. For given values of x and y, what's z?", "We have done a lot in a short amount of time. Multiple linear regression models can become increasingly complex very quickly. My hope is that adding this functionality to your tools set, you\u2019ll be able to maintain better understanding of the data and models your working with. It\u2019s not incredibly difficult to load a model with every variable we have access to, but it does raise the question of whether it solves our objective. Does it lend the type of understanding that we set out to obtain when we engaged in the modeling process?", "In a few short minutes, we\u2019ve covered:", "If this was helpful, feel free to check out my other posts at datasciencelessons.com.
