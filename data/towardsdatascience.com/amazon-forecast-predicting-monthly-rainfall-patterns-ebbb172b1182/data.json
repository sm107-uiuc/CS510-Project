The rainfall data for Newport, Ireland was sourced from the Met \u00c9ireann website.", "To build a forecasting model with Amazon Forecast, the time series data firstly needs to be configured as follows: metric_name, timestamp, metric_value.", "Here is the original time series:", "After formatting as above, here is the new time series:", "To load this data into Amazon Forecast from S3, make sure to create an IAM role with the necessary permissions:", "Once the data is available in S3 in the correct format, the dataset can be uploaded:", "Once uploaded, the Dashboard will show the Target time series data as Active:", "Now that the data is uploaded, a predictor can be created. Amazon Forecast offers two options for forecasting:", "In this example, let\u2019s go with the automatic option.", "The forecast horizon is set to 24 (i.e. predicting two years worth of monthly rainfall data), and Forecast dimensions and Country for holidays are left at the default settings.", "Now, you should get a \u201cCreate in progress\u2026\u201d training status:", "The prediction quantiles are reported for the 10%, 50% and 90% quantiles.", "The deviation of the predicted values from the actual are reported to be lowest at the 10% quantile where the deviation is 9.8%, while being highest around the 50% quantile where the deviation is over 24%. This implies that the forecasts are biased downwards, which would appear to make sense in this case.", "For instance, here is a simple plot of the rainfall data over time in Excel:", "We can see that the series is marked by temporary spikes, where rainfall is particularly higher than normal. These anomalies are skewing the overall mean of the series upwards, and therefore it is of little surprise that the forecasts for the higher quantiles are less accurate.", "Amazon Forecast has done a reasonable job of forecasting in this example, but further investigation could be conducted into time series models that better capture the volatility in this dataset. In this regard, we cannot rule out that a non pre-defined algorithm such as LSTM or GARCH could in fact be more appropriate for this type of data.", "More information on the quantile measurements can be found under the documentation for Amazon Forecast.", "Now that the predictions have been obtained, it is good practice to close out the dataset group if not in use.", "In order to do this, one must firstly delete the dataset and predictor before being able to delete the dataset group outright.", "Upon deleting the above, the dataset group itself can be deleted:", "This has been an introduction to Amazon Forecast and how to configure this platform to make time series predictions. The article explored:", "Hope you found this article useful, and many thanks for your time.", "Disclaimer: This article is presented \u201cas is\u201d and merely intended as an introductory tutorial for Amazon Forecast \u2014 the use of which is the user\u2019s own responsbility as governed under the AWS Customer Agreement.
