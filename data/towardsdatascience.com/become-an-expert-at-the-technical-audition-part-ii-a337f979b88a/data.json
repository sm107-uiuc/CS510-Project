Be sure to check out Part III that outlines a study plan implementing deliberate practice.", "In Part I, I touched on the idea of deliberate practice\u00b9, a term coined by Dr Anders Ericsson and identified as a method used by many to excel themselves to expertise. In this article, I\u2019m going to deep-dive into what deliberate practice is and suggest how you can apply deliberate practice to your technical audition preparation.", "For example sake, I\u2019m going to structure this plan towards a software engineering interview(/audition) and structure the plan to address the main topics covered in Gayle McDowell\u2019s Cracking the Code Interview book. I\u2019ve identified 20 main topics in the book and categorised them into 3 main areas of study \u2014 you can adjust the list however you see fit. A list of these 20 topics will be shown later in this article.", "I also want to preface and say that this plan is a \u2018perfect world\u2019 plan \u2014 keep in mind that we don\u2019t live in a perfect world and you won\u2019t always be able to follow a plan perfectly \u2014 be prepared to be flexible and adapt as necessary.", "Deliberate practice is a combination of two things:", "Deliberate Practice = Purposeful Practice + Expert Coaching", "So, in order to know what deliberate practice is, we need to understand these two components. Let\u2019s break these two areas down further:", "Purposeful Practice is made up of 4 components:", "You\u2019ll notice I\u2019ll use the word \u2018objective\u2019 frequently throughout this article. That is arguably the most important part of setting up your goals. The only way you can know if you\u2019re improving is by having goals that are measurable. They might be measured in a binary way: \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019, or on a scoring system: \u20181/10\u2019 for example.", "To be able to set your goals, you need to have an understanding of where you currently are \u2014 your baseline \u2014 and where you\u2019re trying to get to \u2014 your end goal.", "Your end goal will be large and broad and so we will need to break it down into sub-goals and categorise them to make them as specific and as objective as possible.", "Successfully and confidently complete an on-site interview.", "Wow. Very broad and not very specific.", "Let\u2019s think about how we can measure success here and get more specific.", "To successfully complete an interview, you need to have competence in the 20 topics\u00b2 that you know could be tested. These 20 topics can be broken down into 3 categories (yay, now we\u2019re getting specific!).", "So our end goal is now something more specific, such as:", "Achieve competence in the 20 topics tested.", "This still isn\u2019t really specific enough \u2014 we can do better. For example, how do we define \u2018competence\u2019?", "To determine where to start and how to structure our goals and study plan, we first need to work out where we stand with all these topics right now.", "Remember, we\u2019re trying to be objective and measurable. To establish a baseline, take some time to go through and rate each topic on a scale of 1\u20133:", "1 = I know very little about this, could answer less than 20% of questions", "2 = I am somewhat familiar with this, could answer around 50% of questions", "3 = I feel extremely confident with this, could answer at least 80% of questions", "Keep all emotion out of this task. Remember \u2014 it\u2019s objective!", "The task should not overwhelm you\u00b3 if you\u2019re answering mostly with 1s \u2014 that\u2019s completely expected! We just need to establish a baseline.", "Here\u2019s how I might organise this:", "Create a table with the 20 topics organised under their 3 categories with a space to enter your baseline rating. Notice I also put answer lines next to the topic headers \u2014 it\u2019s a good idea to rate which categories you feel most/least confident with.", "With our rating system, we have now found a way to make our goals specific and objective.", "With this, the aim is to achieve a level 3 in all topics \u2014 thus, we have now defined \u2018competence\u2019 to mean \u2018achieving a level 3\u2019. Each week, we will re-rate each topic to track our progress.", "Great! We\u2019ve now established an objective end goal:", "Achieve a level 3 rating for each topic.", "Next on our discovery of purposeful practice\u2026", "I\u2019m speaking from the heart when I say that the hardest thing about interview prep is trying to not get overwhelmed by how many topics there are to cover. This is why Intense Focus is a critical skill to hone.", "Intense Focus involves tunnel visioned focus on a topic, combined with simulating the \u2018real interview environment\u2019.", "Tunnel vision focus involves ensuring that when you\u2019re studying a topic, it is the only thing on your mind during your study time. If you\u2019re working on linked lists, you only think about linked lists for the dedicated time (more specifically, you only focus on the identified problem areas of linked lists \u2014 more on this later). Try to forget any other topic exists.", "Emulating the real environment you\u2019ll have for the real interview is an important part of training focus.", "In COVID times, this is actually much easier for us to do since the location of your interview is almost guaranteed to be the place where you\u2019re studying.", "In the music world, professional musicians might book the venue space of their audition to practice with the same room, chair and acoustics etc. as the real event, or at the very least, visualise being in this environment while practicing.", "On top of simulating the physical environment of the interview, we need to train the brain to be confined to interview time intervals.", "If you know that your on-site interview is going to be 50 minutes long, you should study in 50 minute intervals. This allows your brain to get comfortable with the time frame and how long it has to answer questions. Not only this, but the brain processes information much better in shorter time periods and allows you to hold focus the whole time.", "I recommend setting timers and forcing yourself to take a 10min break between intervals. I also suggest setting mini goals for each study/practice session as this will also help you to stay focused every time you sit down at your desk.", "Feedback on our progress is how we determine what to work on next. It drives our goal setting and the focus for each study session.", "The feedback needs to be specific.", "For example, if you\u2019re weak on your understanding of Bit Manipulation, what is it specifically that you don\u2019t know about it? What do you have trouble with? Where are the roadblocks?", "If you\u2019re have trouble identifying the specific areas of difficulty yourself, this is where your \u2018expert coach\u2019 comes in (more on that later\u2026).", "Most likely, you don\u2019t have a \u2018tech coach\u2019 at your immediate disposal\u2074 so we need to be a little more creative with how to get regular feedback. Your feedback will come from:", "There will be many topics that you will be able to identify your shortfalls yourself and you will be able to pinpoint \u201cah, if I just knew blah, I\u2019d be able to overcome this\u201d and so you will then go and work on blah.", "This will be your main source of feedback during this study period. For every question you do, study the solutions in great detail. Highlight the parts of the solution you got wrong and deep dive into why this is the solution.", "For this reason, I highly recommend not doing problems that don\u2019t provide solutions \u2014 of course you can attempt them, but you will not be able to get feedback (unless you have a coach).", "Something many people often don\u2019t do that is actually very important: study the solutions of the questions you got right!", "As you know, there are often many ways to do problems, and so we can always learn a better way to do things. Thus, check to see if your solution was the optimal solution (thinking about time and space complexity) and if it was, store this in your brain and make note of it. If the solution differs to yours, and explains why it\u2019s potentially better, yay! You\u2019ve just learnt a new way to do something and gained a deeper understanding of the topic.", "Hopefully it goes without saying to make sure you\u2019re getting your solutions from a somewhat reputable source. You should be able to trust solutions from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Cracking the Code book etc. If you\u2019re reading forum discussions for solutions, be mindful that these can be heavily opinionated and not everyone in the discussion will be qualified to comment, so be sure to verify forum suggestions and solutions.", "Finally, ideally find full solutions that are detailed with the \u2018hows\u2019 and \u2018whys\u2019. If solutions aren\u2019t available, you might need to research the solution with a bit of google searching and piecing things together. A more time consuming process, but often this can lead to learning more along the way.", "This is the second part of the deliberate practice formula so I will talk about this below in the \u2018Expert Coach\u2019 section!", "Think of this as a \u20181 step forward, 2 steps back\u2019 approach.", "Aim to constantly work at the very edge of what you already know and what you don\u2019t know. This means studying the area that you don\u2019t understand and using the building blocks of what you do know to get to the new piece of understanding.", "This creates cohesion in our understanding and means we\u2019re never just mindlessly learning new topics one after the other. Work on something new, while recapturing the previous 2 steps/building blocks.", "This process ties in really closely with the feedback loop.", "Here\u2019s how I might do this:", "Keep a log of all the questions you do and make sure you\u2019re categorising them under the relevant heading. For each topic heading, have a column of questions you got right and a column of questions you got wrong. The goal here is to keep retesting the \u2018wrong\u2019 questions so that eventually all questions are in the \u2018right\u2019 pile.", "However, don\u2019t retest questions unless you\u2019ve studied the solutions and further researched that problem area \u2192 this is the \u2018operation on the edge of your ability\u2019 part.", "A tangible way to approach this is to do 3 questions at a time \u2014 1 new question and 2 old questions from the \u2018wrong\u2019 pile.", "Finally, and most importantly, in order to continuously know where the edge of your ability is, you need to rescore your topics on the 3 point scale we mentioned earlier. I suggest doing this at the end of every week.", "Even if you \u2018know\u2019 you haven\u2019t made any improvement because you didn\u2019t do much study that week, it\u2019s important to still reevaluate because it\u2019s easy to forget some of the small progress that you make. Maybe only one topic changes score, but that\u2019s still tangible, objective progress.", "Expert coaching is a little more self-explanatory than purposeful practice, however in the context of the tech interview, it isn\u2019t as clear cut. To be an expert coach,", "The main role of the expert coach is providing feedback.", "Unlike athletes, dancers and musicians, software engineers rarely have 1:1 coaches! This is where we have to be creative with the methods of feedback I mentioned above. Use a combination of these to act as your \u2018coach\u2019.", "If you\u2019re already a professional in the field and work/socialise with a bunch of experts then this is great! Identify the ones around you that are excelling in their field or are where you want to be (or have the job you\u2019re trying to get).", "Ideally, you want someone who is a good communicator and won\u2019t brush you off when you ask for feedback. These will be the people you\u2019ll ask to do mock interviews with, read over your code, or discuss concepts with. If there\u2019s a concept you don\u2019t understand, ask them to help you pinpoint which part of the topic is the biggest blank.", "If you\u2019re new to the industry, you have two options: paid coaches and organic coaches.", "You can find paid coaches from sites like Skilled, Interview Query and many more.", "Organic coaches can be found by joining community groups and attending meet ups regularly. This takes a little more time (and confidence), but don\u2019t be shy \u2014 ask a senior member of the group that you\u2019ve noticed is \u2018nice\u2019 if they\u2019d be willing to look over some code or do a mock interview for you. People are more willing to help than you think.", "I strongly encourage you to be picky about who you choose as your coach and who you take advice from. This applies to general life, not just tech!", "When receiving advice, ensure the person ticks all three of the following:", "I, personally, live by these criteria and assess these three points every time someone is dishing out advice\u2075. It doesn\u2019t mean you disregard someone\u2019s point if they don\u2019t tick one of the boxes, it just means you\u2019ll take the advice with a grain of salt.", "But I strongly recommend you keep this in mind as you\u2019re assessing who to be influenced by. Especially in today\u2019s world where everyone has an opinion\u2076\u2026", "Now that we understand the deliberate practice recipe, it\u2019s time to bring it all together into a study plan!", "Check out Part III of this blog series to see how I put all of this together into a specific study plan for software engineering interviewees!", "\u00b9Here\u2019s a great video (feat. Ericsson) that summarises deliberate practice nicely.", "\u00b2 I\u2019ve identified 20 main topics specific to software engineering competence but please adjust, add and subtract topics as you see fit! And of course if you\u2019re studying for a data science interview, the topics will be different.", "\u00b3 Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is easier said than done and can be quite a confronting task at first \u2014 I myself struggle with this!", "\u2074Although these are becoming more popular and more available to hire", "\u2075Don\u2019t worry, the irony of me giving advice about giving advice is not lost on me", "\u2076What is it that they say about opinions?", "Your home for data science.
