With the advancement of technology, digital transformation is now seen as a crucial strategic initiative and business intelligence tools have evolved like a boon to help companies make the most out of their data. The response is the result of the increasing capability of modern days business intelligence platforms in action that support data access, interactivity, discovery, real-time alerts, actionable dashboards, mobile data access, AI-generated insights, AI-powered Data Podcast and lot many things. While the overall Business Intelligence market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% from USD 17.09 Billion in 2016 to USD 26.88 Billion by 2021.", "Here are the top 10 real-world examples of Business Intelligence tools in action.", "BI reporting platforms enable you to make an informed decision but the challenge persists with how to handle growing volumes of data from multiple sources. You will also face challenges with data synchronization and stitching it at the right granularity level. To have accurate insight into how your company is doing at any given time you need a business intelligence tool that translates high volume data from across departments into a holistic view of the organization.", "Solution: Although the client was in data practice still their data were scattered at different places creating confusion about last-touch attribution. We took an approach of first understanding the business goal and their existing data sources. This helped us to decide on which all data sources should be automated and what all data should be stitched together.", "Our aggregated analysis of the situation empowered our Client to automate 7+ essential data sources and 50+ users. Being able to see one version of the truth also empowered them to take a real-time informed decision.", "It is very easy to lose track of what matters to you when you monitor plenty of KPIs and manage a lot of dashboards. Business alerts will help you out with situations like when predefined goals met, or whenever an unexpected event happens, you will be notified and keep full control of what drives your business.", "Solution: Setting up customized data alerts is the most effective way of monitoring your business performance. Setting up alerts is not that complex, but your BI team or consultants should first pick the right KPIs for the right set of people. So, the discovery phase of the BI becomes important, in which you understand the pain points. Sometimes not a lot of clarity, but that would be enough of direction to think of KPIs and alerts. At times, a high-level KPI won\u2019t be much of interest need is to look for something relatable or try to derive a score or ratio. The final step is to set up thresholds and mode of alert. Mostly emails are preferred to receive alerts, but some cases SMS text.", "Deciding on what should be on the dashboard is very important. You don\u2019t need massive amounts of data on a dashboard, just the data that is enough to help achieve your organization\u2019s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is sufficient. The winning score is not the total number of dashboards, but how many dashboards are actionable and used widely. Few elements to make the dashboard more actionable are: Content Benchmarks, Goals, Real-time KPI Monitoring, Traffic Trends, Performance by Topic and Persona, Engagement Metrics, Proof of ROI.", "Solution: We empowered our client to look through their sales performance dashboard. There were a few dashboards talking about sales performance. Each sales manager had his or her threshold on activities (follow up calls and emails/inquiry) depending on services. They used to look at those dashboards and conduct review meetings.

The correct type of charts, correct usage of metrics and dimension along with a good presentation layer makes a lot of difference.", "Solution: A switch from input to output.

This helps you create a culture of data-driven decision making by spreading business intelligence more widely throughout your organization. But the journey doesn\u2019t just happen.

Here\u2019s more on it.", "Setting up a data podcast for your enterprise is another innovative way to deliver information. The AI layer will get you the insights in plain text and the NLP layer would convert it an audio layer. You can even try something fun with background and branding for your enterprise.", "Lift analysis is a way to measure how a campaign impacts a key metric. When it is about multi-touch attribution, a marketing lift analysis can be applied by looking at occasions that were influenced by your campaign and comparing that with occasions that were not influenced by your campaign.

You can quickly spot flaws if the slope of the lift chart is not monotonic. Additionally, it helps you to set a threshold, which users are worth targeting. Finally, you have an estimate of how much better you can target users compared to random targeting.", "Successful marketing blends hard data and creative insights. You can view all your data sources in a single marketing dashboard, including your social media platforms, CRM, Google Analytics, Content Marketing Dashboard, Web Analytics Dashboard, etc. With all your marketing KPIs in one easy-to-read dashboard, you\u2019ll immediately see opportunities to optimize your overall strategy.", "Solution: Like a modern-day CMO you are using all types of marketing technologies and tools.

This helped us to decide on which all data sources should be automated and connected and make data flow to one single dashboard to give a holistic view of complete marketing performance. We also empowered our client to stitched together relevant data at the right granularity level.", "An A/B testing significance calculator is a statistical hypothesis testing tool and is made to calculate the relationship between two data sets and those data sets are then compared against each other to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship or not. Our clients use the A/B Significance calculator to determine whether the A/B test is statistically significant or not. You can also check it out HERE", "If you want to stay relevant to the digital disruption you must move forward with a serious strategy about your data. While much of the data analysis going on today is based on historical data, the focus is rapidly shifting to AI in business. Today it is no more about just presenting data.
