I wanted to know if this was even possible as well as how well or worse it performs on MNIST data.", "Principle Component Analysis (PCA) Pooling Layer", "For anyone who is not familiar with PCAP please read this blog post first. The basic idea is Pooling layers such as Max or Mean pooling operations performs dimensionality reduction to not only to save computational power but also to act as a regularizer. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique in which converts correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. And we can take advantage of this operation to do a similar job as max/mean pooling.", "Network Composed of Majority of Pooling Layers", "Now I know what you are thinking, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a network that is only composed of pooling layer while performing classification.

However, in-order for the dimension to match up we will downsample each images into 16*16 dimension. Hence the Tensors will have a shape of \u2026", "And we can perform classification with soft max layer as any other network does.", "As seen above, the training accuracy have stagnated at 18 percent accuracy which is horrible LOL. But I suspected that the network didn\u2019t have enough learning capacity from the start and this was best it could do.

For example if the top left pixel was white in the second layer this pixel will change to black in the next layer. Currently, I am not 100% sure on why this is happening, but with more study I hope to know exactly why.", "As seen above, when we replace all of the PCAP layers with max pooling operation we can observe that the accuracy on training images stagnated around 14 percent, confirming the fact that the network didn\u2019t have enough learning capacity from the start.", "Top Left Image \u2192 Original InputTop Right Image \u2192 After First LayerBottom Left Image \u2192 After Second LayerBottom Right Image \u2192 After Fourth Layer", "Contrast to PCAP, with max pooling we can clearly observe that the pixel with most high intensity moves on to the next layer.
