I have overfilled my coffee cup. I stare absentmindedly at a drop that has trickled down the side of the cup. It follows a zigzag path in its struggle to reach the bottom. For a moment I root for it, then I notice the time and get going. Later that morning, I drive to work, park my car, step out of the lot and and bump into a long-lost friend. Unknown to me, and to my friend, our eyes scan each other\u2019s faces dozens of times in a seemingly random geometrical pattern until a flood of mutual recognition sets in. At noon I catch up with him again at a nearby restaurant. The place is crowded and noisy. In a flash of inspiration I turn on the Google Science Journal app on my phone and start recording the decibel level around me. Thirty minutes later I stop the recording, put the phone back into my pocket and pay the bill. We step out of the restaurant, and over handshakes and promises to do this again soon, we walk away into the afternoon sunshine.", "When it comes to weaving randomness into our lives, nature has chosen the long thread. Whether it is the meandering\u00a0drop\u00a0of\u00a0coffee, or the pattern traced by our eyes when we scan a face, or the noise level in a room, or the number of sips of coffee we have each morning, or the number of minutes spent in the shower, or the amount of time we spend commuting, or the number of emails we send each day, we are forever weaving sequence upon sequence of stochastic events.", "And yet, in spite of all the randomness, our life isn\u2019t a chaotic mess. There is a structure to our day, and there is quite a bit of predictability.", "To recognize why, we must look closely at these random phenomena. And when we look closely, we find some interesting features.", "An easy first thing to spot is that much of what we call random is actually bounded within a range a values. Surely, there are days of mind-numbing traffic, but on most days I reach work around the same time of day, give or take 30 minutes.", "In real life, the different factors that influence a particular kind of random outcome, such as my Monday morning meeting\u2019s duration, doesn\u2019t change much from one Monday to the next.", "I have found that duration of my workplace meetings will be influenced by the number of people present, the number of topics on the agenda, the types of topics, and a few other things. On any given day, it\u2019s going to be pretty much the same set of factors.", "The practical consequence of this property is that the random variable, the duration of Monday\u2019s meeting, has a distribution of possibilities that is identical to that of next Monday\u2019s meeting, and so on. We say that the random variables\u2014Monday meeting duration \u2014are identically distributed. Every random value gets pulled out from the same distribution of values.", "Another feature worth noting is that previous outcomes do not always influence today\u2019s outcome. For example the number of bites I took into my lunch yesterday, would not normally influence how many bites I will take into my sandwich today. The two random variables: yesterday\u2019s bites and today\u2019s bites are independent of one another.", "But such type of independence is not always to be seen. For example, when the din in a restaurant grows, people start talking more loudly to make themselves heard, then other people have to talk even more loudly to make themselves heard over the loud-talkers and so on. The random variable \u2014restaurant decibel level\u200a\u2014\u200adoes not have the property of independence. In fact it is auto-correlated!", "The practical consequence of this correlation is that the decibel level that my phone recorded a second ago can possibly be used to predict the value that will be recorded in the next second.", "One can combine the previous two properties into a new property.", "When random variables in a sequence have outcomes that are independent of one another, and they also posses identical probability distributions, they are known as i.i.d. (Independent Identically Distributed) variables.", "I.i.d. variables\u00a0seem\u00a0to\u00a0pop up\u00a0in\u00a0many\u00a0situations. If you take a minute to gaze out onto a busy street and note down the brand of every vehicle passing by, you will have built a random sequence which could look like this:", "Here the random variable is the brand of the vehicle that has passed by. Whether you will see a Nissan or a Ford or a Jeep or any other brand in this second, is not determined by which brand of vehicle passed by during the previous second. So the variables have outcomes that are independent of one another.", "Furthermore, the probability of seeing a Nissan or a Ford or a Jeep in this second, is the same as the probability of respectively seeing a Nissan or a Ford or a Jeep in the following second, and respectively the same during the second after that, and so forth. Thus the variables are also identically distributed. Their outcomes are all drawn from the same distribution.", "Other examples of i.i.d. sequences are a sequence of coin tosses, any kind of random noise such as the hiss on a telephone line and the ages of people queuing up at a bus-stand.", "But in real life, pure i.i.d. variables are rare. If one peers into the phenomenon deeply enough, one can often spot some kind of a cause-effect relationship or some evidence of a correlation. But if one is willing to go easy on the pureness criterion, then sequences of i.i.d. variables are indeed to be found everywhere.", "I.i.d. principles are used to find out if a forecast model that you may have so painstakingly constructed is\u00a0something\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0proud\u00a0of. This determination works as follows:", "We notice this amazing quality about random sequences: no matter how diverse are situations that give birth to these sequences, many of them share striking similarities. And it is these similarities that allow us to study random sequences in great detail. We do this by first classifying them into one type or another.", "Let\u2019s look at some of the commonly occurring types of sequences and the situations they occur in.", "There is a certain pothole on my daily route to work that I ritualistically avoid. Actually there are many potholes on my route, but I\u2019ll talk about this one for now.", "To avoid the pothole, I have to maneuver my car to the pothole\u2019s left, or to it\u2019s right. On any given day, the strategy I adopt depends on my speed, angle of approach, whether there are any vehicles next to mine and so on. But it\u2019s always the same set of factors that affect my strategy. If each day, I were to make a note of whether I have navigated to the pothole\u2019s left side or to its right side, I would get a time series such as this one:", "This is an example of a Bernoulli sequence.", "A particular Bernoulli sequence is a realization of the Bernoulli process, and the Bernoulli process is made up of i.i.d. random variables.", "Each outcome in the sequence such as Left or Right is the outcome of a Bernoulli Trial.", "For an outcome to qualify as a Bernoulli Trial, the two possible outcomes Left and Right need to each have a fixed probability: p and (1-p). If we associate values with the outcomes Left and Right as follows: Left=0, Right=1, a plot of the Bernoulli sequence will look like this:", "Even though I have got it down to a near-perfect science, sometimes I simply forget about the pothole, and I drive straight into it. So in real life, my Bernoulli process is many-valued and it looks like this:", "A many valued Bernoulli process like this one is known as a Bernoulli Scheme.", "If we assign a value of -1 to LEFT, 0 to BUMP and +1 to RIGHT, we would get a random sequence like this one:", "A Bernoulli Scheme is also a stochastic time series of i.i.d. variables. But in a Bernoulli Scheme, each variable can take one of many values v1, v2, v3\u2026vn, each with a fixed probability p1, p2, p3\u2026pn, such as the the sum of all probabilities equals 1.0.", "Thus a Bernoulli Scheme can be thought of as a generalization of the Bernoulli Process.", "Next time you see leaves rustling in the breeze, or a flag fluttering in the wind, or your umbrella getting tossed around over your head on a stormy day, think of the Random Walk process. The geometrical path taken by any point on the leaf or the flag or the umbrella is a Random Walk in three dimensions.", "And in case you are wondering, your daily morning stagger from the bed to the bathroom is not a random walk. We\u2019ll see why it isn\u2019t in a minute.", "Meanwhile a simple 1-dimensional Random Walk can be thought of as a simple extension of the Bernoulli Process. To calculate the value of the next point in a Random Walk sequence, you do three things:", "In effect, the next value in a RW sequence is the scalar or vector sum of the outcomes of all Bernoulli trials that have taken place so far.", "The figure below shows an artificially generated 1-D Random Walk sequence using the above procedure:", "This 1-D random walk, if continued for a long period of time, has a tendency to regress to the mean which is\u2026you guessed it! Zero.", "In nature, pure random walks are rare for the same reason that pure Bernoulli sequences are rare. Sequences that look like Random Walks often aren\u2019t so.", "Therefore you will be forgiven in the belief that the path traced by your feet as they carry the rest of you out of your bed and to the bathroom every morning is a random walk. Even if it might feel like a random walk, it is not, for the following reason.", "Notice that when your foot lands somewhere on the floor, your body tilts in that direction causing your brain to make your other foot land in a location that will compensate for that tilt and therefore prevent you from tipping over.", "So the location of your foot on the ground in one time step is correlated with the location of your other foot in the previous time step.", "Thus even though the the individual feet locations might have been drawn from identical distributions, the locations of the two feet are hardly independent of each other. In other words, your morning stagger is a sequence of outcomes that are (possibly) identically distributed, but most definitely not independent. Ergo not a random walk!", "It is subtleties such as these that preclude most random-walk-like processes from being true random walks.", "A famous example of what is considered to be a random walk is the up-down movement of stock prices. It has been argued that stock prices move in a random walk pattern. As per this hypothesis, it is impossible to make a truck load of money in the stock market by doing high frequency trading over a short period of time. But this view is disputed.", "With these points in mind, let\u2019s look at one more stochastic process. This is the incredibly pervasive and very useful\u2026drum role\u2026Poisson process.", "A Poisson process consists of a sequence of random variables such that each random variable follows a Poisson distribution. This begs the question, what is a Poisson distribution? Let me explain with an example:", "Suppose you are a city planner tasked with figuring out how much wider to make some of the streets in your city, so that they can support traffic growth over the next 5 years. For one such street, the traffic forecast shows that five years from now, there will be an average of 40 vehicles per minute plying on the street in each direction.", "Note that the forecast data you have is for the average flow rate. So 5 years from now, in any given minute the actual number of vehicles plying on that road could be 0, 5, 20, 32, 44\u2026pretty much any random value up to the maximum physical capacity of the road.", "So should you widen the street to accommodate 45 vehicles per minute, or 50 vehicles per minute, or 55 vehicles\u2026?", "What would help you is if someone told you how probable it is a flow rate of 45 per minute, or 50 or 55 per minute and so one. Then you can take a decision to plan for only traffic flow rates with a likelihood of occurrence that is up to 2 standard deviations greater than the mean.", "In this example, the random variable \u2018X\u2019 is the number of vehicles per minute. If you assume that this random variable has a Poisson distribution, you will get the probability information you need by using the following formula:", "Where X = the random variable denoting the flow rate.P_X(k) is the probability of seeing a flow rate of k vehicles per minute.lambda=average flow rate. In our example: lambda = 40 vehicles per minute.", "The above formula, known as the Probability Mass Function (PMF) for the Poisson distribution, yields the following probability curve:", "The red line marks off the flow rate that is at 2 standard deviations, namely 0.037295, away from the mean likelihood of occurrence\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0distribution\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a00.009901. This point, two STD-DEVs greater than the mean probability of 0.009901, corresponds to a flow rate of 45 to 46 vehicles per minute.", "Now as per the flow rate to road width tables\u00a0that\u00a0you\u00a0have, you can now recommend that the road be widened by say, 12 feet on each side. That should cover approximately 95% of probable flow rates five years from now.", "Now that we know how incredibly useful a Poisson distribution can be, let\u2019s refocus on the Poisson process, which we said earlier was a sequence of Poisson distributed random variables.", "In the above figure, X_0, X_1, X_2,\u2026X_k are the individual random variables, each having a Poisson distribution.", "But a Poisson process is much more than just a sequence of Poisson variables.", "A Poisson process is also supposed to tell you something about how often an event occurs from the beginning of the measurement up to some time t.", "X(0) = the number of events that occurred up through t=0. This value is usually considered as zero which is the initial value of the sequence.X(1) = the number of events that occurred up through t=1, and so on, until,X(t) = the number of events that occurred up through time t.", "It is these random variables: X(0), X(1), X(2)\u2026X(k)\u2026X(t) that actually make up what we consider as the Poisson process. Each one denotes the number of events that have occurred up through some time t.", "Amazingly, and this is not obvious\u00a0at\u00a0all,\u00a0at\u00a0least\u00a0not\u00a0to\u00a0me, it can be very elegantly proved that X(0), X(1), X(2)\u2026X(k)\u2026X(t) also obey the Poisson distribution!", "This finding reaffirms our initial definition of a Poisson process as being a collection of Poisson distributed variables.", "Poisson processes are to be found everywhere, at supermarket checkout lines, at the McDonald\u2019s drive-through window, or in your physician\u2019s waiting room. Or even at a very much smaller scale: the number of electrons that pass through a cross sectional area of conductor from the time you turn on the switch, up through a certain time t, can be modeled using a Poisson process.", "While modeling time series phenomena, you should consider a Poisson process based model when you notice the following things:", "There are many other interesting stochastic processes that we unknowingly encounter in our daily life. Some well known ones are:", "The Binomial Process \u2014think about the experiment yielding the probability of getting k heads in n coin tosses,", "Markov chains in which the next event depends on (and only on) the value of previously occurring event. In other words it\u2019s quite the opposite of the Bernoulli Sequence that we went over earlier in which each event is completely independent of any other event,", "and the Wiener process which is essentially a generalization of the Random Walk. It\u2019s basically a random walk with very tiny steps. Brownian motion is probably the most well known example of a Wiener process.", "So next time you spot something that looks random, step back and see if it\u2019s a tiny piece of a bigger stochastic puzzle, a puzzle which can be modeled by one of these beautiful processes, out of which would emerge interesting predictions.", "If you liked this article, please follow me at Sachin Date to receive tips, how-tos and programming advice on topics devoted to regression, time series analysis, and forecasting.", "Your home for data science.
