Chollet mentions that XGBoost is the one shallow learning technique that a successful applied machine learner should be familiar with today, so I took his word for it and dove in to learn more.", "I mostly wanted to write this article because I thought that others with some knowledge of machine learning also may have missed this topic as I did. I am by no means an expert on the topic and to be honest had trouble understanding some of the mechanics, however I hope this article is a great primer to your exploration on the subject (list of great resources at the bottom too)!", "So what is XGBoost and where does it fit in the world of ML? Gradient Boosting Machines fit into a category of ML called Ensemble Learning, which is a branch of ML methods that train and predict with many models at once to produce a single superior output. Think of it as planning out a few different routes to a single location you\u2019ve never been to; as you use all of the routes, you begin to learn which traffic lights take long when and how the time of day impacts one route over the other, allowing you to craft the perfect route. You experimented with and combined a few different models to reach an optimal conclusion. Ensemble learning is similar!", "Ensemble learning is broken up into three primary subsets:", "eXtreme Gradient Boosting or XGBoost is a library of gradient boosting algorithms optimized for modern data science problems and tools. It leverages the techniques mentioned with boosting and comes wrapped in an easy to use library. Some of the major benefits of XGBoost are that its highly scalable/parallelizable, quick to execute, and typically out performs other algorithms.", "Throughout this section, we\u2019ll explore XGBoost by predicting whether or not passengers survived on the Titanic. The full jupyter notebook used for this analysis can be found HERE.", "I started by loading the Titanic data into a Pandas data frame and exploring the available fields. Note: I manually transformed the \u2018embarked\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019 features in the csv before loading for brevity", "Most elements seemed to be continuous and those that contained text seemed to be irrelevant to predicting survivors, so I created a new data frame (\u2018train_df\u2019) to contain only the features I wanted to train on. Also note that XGBoost will handle NaNs but (at least for me) does not handle strings.", "Just like with other models, its important to break the data up into training and test data, which I did with SKLearn\u2019s train_test_split. Note that I decided to go with only 10% test data. I did this primarily because the titanic set is already small and my training data set is already a subset of the total data set available. This is probably leading to a bit of overfitting and is likely not best practice.", "With my data ready and my goal focused on classifying passengers as survivors or not, I imported the XGBClassifier from XGBoost. We then create an object for XGBClassifier() and pass it some parameters (not necessary, but I ended up wanting to try tweaking the model a bit manually). Finally we fit() the model to our training features and labels, and we\u2019re ready to make predictions! As you can see, using the XGBoost library is very similar to using SKLearn.", "Making predictions with my model and using accuracy as my measure, I can see that I achieved over 81% accuracy. This was after a bit of manual tweaking and although I was hoping for better results, it was still better than what I\u2019ve achieved in the past with a decision tree on the same data.", "One super cool module of XGBoost is plot_importance which provides you the f-score of each feature, showing that feature\u2019s importance to the model. This is helpful for selecting features, not only for your XGB but also for any other similar model you may run on the data.", "Taking this to the next level, I found a fantastic code sample and article about an automated way of evaluating the number of features to use, so I had to try it out.", "Essentially this bit of code trains and tests the model by iteratively removing features by their importance, recording the model\u2019s accuracy along the way. This allows you to easily remove features without simply using trial and error. Although not shown here, this approach can also be applied to other parameters (learning_rate, max_depth, etc) of the model to automatically try different tuning variables. I wont go into the details of tuning the model, however the great number of tuning parameters is one of the reasons XGBoost so popular.", "I hope that this was a useful introduction into what XGBoost is and how to use it.
