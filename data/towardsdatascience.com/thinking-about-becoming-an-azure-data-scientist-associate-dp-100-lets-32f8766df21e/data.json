Here you can see a graphic representation of our agenda:", "Regardless of whether we like it or not, we can\u2019t deny that we are part of an ecosystem, and this ecosystem it\u2019s having its own trends and phenomenons that we must look at. If we avoid this part, we might be underfitting the problem.", "In the first part, we will describe the data science context and what\u2019s actually happening in the industry. Knowing what\u2019s happening around us will give us the chance to understand if certifications are or might be valuables in the near future.", "Besides, as you might know, in order to know if something is a good fit for you, you also need to explore this thing\u2019s characteristics that you are trying to put on yourself.", "In the second part, I will describe this test\u2019s peculiarities, letting you know what knowledge you are expected to have or learn if you want to pass. I will try my best to give you a general understanding of what the exam is trying to test, so I will avoid easy descriptions like just rephrasing the certification skills outline.", "In the third part (reached that point, we will already know what to expect from the certificate), we will understand if you are good to go in your particular case and when you should be thinking twice about earning this badge. Understanding things about you will help us to analyze the remaining piece of this puzzle: YOU. Your career stage, goals, and motivations give us the last and most crucial part of the discussion.", "Understanding the data science field\u2019s general context is a must to evaluate if the certificate is worth it. If you have listened to the \u201cTowards Data Science\u201d podcast, you know that the industry conversation is going more and more towards topics related to deployment, productionization, and software development. On the other side, the state-of-the-art models and the academic discussions are not the hottest topics (the following screenshots say it all).", "Saying this, I\u2019m not claiming that understanding the models isn\u2019t important. In fact, it\u2019s essential, but if these topics are not the hottest now, it\u2019s because the discussion was there in the past, and there is a solid knowledge of them (you can see that the standard courses try to teach you this first).", "The MLOps irruption was one of the most substantial hits on the AI industry. It became so popular because it aims to fix everything that went wrong in the last years with data science. You might already know the problems going into production for data science. Still, if you don\u2019t, the success rates are shocking.", "Besides, the episode \u201cleaving academia for industry\u201d reflects a critical point: machine learning is going away from academia, and that\u2019s a good thing! If they discover something extraordinary, it\u2019s natural for the industry to generate massive adoption. Again, you don\u2019t need a Ph.D. anymore; you can get hired and create great AI applications without a degree (the books are claiming so too).", "As you can see on the Google trends charts, MLOps is getting attention incredibly fast, but usual terms and models (deep learning, random forest & xgboost) are stables.", "On the other side, cloud platforms are developing more and more integrations following the MLOps principles, like versioning data and models, or creating Kubernetes integrations as AKS or EKS. Their goal is to make your experience more comfortable, and they are doing a pretty excellent job. With that, you are prone to use their platforms for every part of the machine learning end-to-end cycle.", "There is a subtle positive slope on the top 3 cloud providers\u2019 growth, and if we want to know what will happen with this trend, a great source is Gartner. On their \u201cTop 10 Trends in Data and Analytics for 2020\u201d, they describe that cloud services will be essential for 90% of data and analytics innovation. So, the cloud isn\u2019t going anywhere.", "Are new jobs asking for certificates in their requirements? Well, after reading a bunch of articles checking the most in-demand skills for data scientists, I can say that employers ask for the skill, but the certificate is only a \u201cnice to have.\u201d", "When we talk about IT certifications, in most cases, you will be tested on how good it\u2019s your domain on the TECHNOLOGY. Still, technologies are almost always related to another particular domain knowledge.", "An example could be the architecture cloud certifications. In them, you need to know the specifics about how to use those cloud tools, but you also need to be capable of understanding general architectural principles.", "It\u2019s always hard to draw a line on how much the evaluation will test the technology and its particular domain knowledge. The typical scenario is trying to measure the technology for the most part of the test, and the specific domain expertise just when it\u2019s needed.", "But when we talk about data science, drawing this line, it\u2019s harder than usual because conducting machine learning projects requires a deep understanding of all the stages in the cycle, which implies specific use cases for every different part of the process.", "Thus, we could assure that the technology application is so tightly attached to the real-life scenario that is always assuming some knowledge on the field of expertise. And that\u2019s why I think this exam (and other cloud machine learning certificates) end up trying to measure your skills in both: technology usage and data science skills.", "This is like when you decide to get healthier, and you say to your coach the following: \u201cGive me a percentage on how much should I focus on nutrition and how much on exercising\u201d Well, you can\u2019t make a pie chart with that! Because both of them are required, so you can\u2019t think in one without the other.", "On the Microsoft exam page, you can find the following:", "\u201cThe Azure Data Scientist applies their knowledge of data science and machine learning to implement and run machine learning workloads on Azure; in particular, using Azure Machine Learning Service. This entails planning and creating a suitable working environment for data science workloads on Azure, running data experiments and training predictive models, managing and optimizing models, and deploying machine learning models into production.\u201d", "And that\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s an almost complete definition of what MLOps represents. The exam is well-aware of the MLOps trend, and I think that is great because you will learn most of the operational steps found on machine learning projects.", "Another vital side of this analysis are the questions asked, and how much they will measure your technical mastery and machine learning expertise.", "At a very high-level, there is a good mix of questions trying to test your knowledge on both of them: you will find some that requires a lot of comprehension about the data science process and not much about the technology, others where you will be tested about specifics of the Azure Machine Learning tools and barely anything about data science, and, most of the times, you will need to understand both.", "Well, I think it is ambitious to test your data science abilities and one technology simultaneously (even trying to test your data science skills in one test might be ridiculous). Because of that, I would say that despite that this test DO test your knowledge on machine learning, it\u2019s hard to be sure that a person who passes knows everything about data science.", "And precisely that might be one of the reasons why data science cloud certifications are still not that well valuated for employers. You might be an Azure data scientist associate, but it is hard to know for sure if you have all the skills required to work as a machine learning engineer.", "The questions about this particular technology do the job. They are created thinking about real use case scenarios. This impregnates the test with some sense of reality that I consider it\u2019s so important when you want to test the ability to use the technology given a particular context.", "They test if you know how to apply the technology given different scenarios, for that it won\u2019t be enough if you learn how to use the Azure Machine Learning SDK.", "I think that this certificate\u2019s technology side is the strongest one because, on your learning path, you will find yourself very often nodding in front of your screen, impressed on how well Azure is connecting all the points to get machine learning models into production.", "Before going into the specific cases, let me give you an overview of this certification in general. As we discussed before, the data science ecosystem is continuously evolving and expecting different new things from you based on the new contexts.", "Knowing how to convert models into real production systems is becoming a valuable asset, and Microsoft knows that. They have teams working on improving the Azure Machine Learning service with these principles in mind. And, as we also saw, cloud infrastructure will be largely adopted in the analytics industry.", "Because of the reasons just exposed, if you have some experience in data science and Azure, this certification might give you the little push you need to expand your technical skills.", "But after a general recommendation of this certification, let me raise some white and red flags. As you know, this article is about being a \u201cmatch\u201d with this test, and depending on the stage of your career that you are and the reasons for you to take this exam, this certificate might or not be the right thing for you right now.", "If you are doing your first steps in data science, I might say that you are not the best fit for this certificate, and that is not related to your ability to pass it. It will be harder for you than for an experienced data scientist, but not impossible. You can learn every command, do every lab, and memorize all the machine learning lifecycle, and you might pass.", "The problem is that you won\u2019t be able to understand why every piece is used in that particular way, and if you can\u2019t mix this with your past experience, the knowledge won\u2019t settle on the right way.", "So if you are just starting, you should be using your learning time on the basics. You should start understanding some algorithms, learning the common frameworks, and doing your first hands-on projects. Here is a great post on that.", "Another red flag would be in case you are expecting a quick financial return. What do I mean by this? If you think that this will directly give you a new job or a raise, you might feel disappointed. Because there\u2019s no guarantee that employers will look at this certification on your resume and instantly hire you.", "So, if you want to quickly get a raise or maybe get a new job, there might be better short-term options to get there. But if you are pointing for the middle-term for this same goal, your ability to learn new tools, and constantly challenge yourself in new ways of doing the job, will be highly appreciated. Jeez! I move forward so fast, that\u2019s part of the next section!.", "The most important motivation for you to take this test should be your desire to learn and grow. I know it may sound clich\u00e9, but, as we discuss early, this certificate on its own won\u2019t give you direct access to the job of your dreams. Because it\u2019s still not that important for employers.", "f your motivation is to learn, you don\u2019t need that much Azure experience. Still, obviously, you will require a little more hands-on practice than people who had it. But I think if you prepare yourself correctly, you should be able to pass.", "Another important point that I want to address is about becoming \u201ccloud-agnostic,\u201d which describes that your ability goes beyond any cloud. If you achieve this, it means that you can run workloads independent of the cloud provider. This should be great if you work as a consultant or if you want to.", "Interestingly, this concept could mislead people, refuse to learn any cloud technology, and just learn when they are forced to. So, DON\u2019T DO THAT, the only way of becoming really \u201ccloud-agnostic\u201d is to understand every one of their strengths and weaknesses.", "Another case might be that you have a lot of experience doing machine learning on Azure. If that is the case, I think it\u2019s great for you to take this test also! I thought I knew a lot about Azure services. Still, looking at the labs and the questions, you might reinforce your knowledge, and in the way looking for other cloud providers certifications, it would be nice for you to understand the platform used for online testing.", "I visualize certifications as boosters. You might want to learn something new, and I think it\u2019s way easier when you have a concrete goal.", "I really hope that you enjoyed or found this article useful. I was thinking about creating a guide about the DP-100, so if you want that, let me know and support this article.", "If you liked it, follow me on Medium and Linkedin. If you want to write to me, I\u2019m recently on Twitter. I will gladly talk with you!", "In case you feel like reading a little more, check out some of my recent posts:", "Chilean \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf1 | Quant Finance \ud83d\udcc8 | Azure Data Scientist
