Futurists and Transhumanists eagerly await these ideas to become science fact so that that they may experience new vistas of consciousness or immortality, but they may ignore the difficulty of the groundbreaking science and technology required.", "I take the view that neural prostheses leading to partial and full replacement of the human brain and eventual mind uploading is possible since it\u2019s not anywhere explicitly forbidden by physical law, and is therefore mainly a matter of more advanced Science and Technology.", "Even if these transhumanist and futurist visions that may change the very nature of humanity are possible in theory, there is no corresponding principle that says they\u2019re reachable by humanity, nor in the near future and especially before we all die. We do not nor should not just wait for the future, but rather we must act to create it.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve immortality through not dying.\u201d", "One important consideration is the interplay between emulation and simulation in mapping out the human brain via technology. Emulation concerns more technology, whereas simulation concerns more science.", "I will explore the differences and utility in emulation and simulation of a human brain in mind uploads", "In order to best illustrate the difference between emulation and simulation of the human brain, let us consider the analogy of flight achieved by birds.", "As an example of emulation to achieve flight, let\u2019s say we simply copy exactly how a bird flies using its wings.", "This would involve exactly copying all aspects of the physiology and anatomy of the bird that we see responsible for flying without any understanding.", "We could go even further to copy such features as the color of the feathers, the exact size of the eyes, the function of the internal digestive system, and mating patterns, but this would be beyond the scope if we only care about achieving flight.", "The difficulty here is to determine which parts of the bird help it to achieve flight and it seems intuitive that these other features beyond wings are irrelevant. In other contexts, however, it may not necessarily be so apparent which features to duplicate. For example, it is not so obvious by simple observation of how a kangaroo can keep cool and not overheat in the hot Australian sun since it has no sweat glands. (Kangaroos have a special network of blood vessels on their forearms, so they lick those forearms and evaporation of the saliva carries away heat.)", "This simple emulation of bird flight may seem primitive, but consider that we\u2019re copying something that nature has taken millions of years to evolve and is the culmination of advances from single-celled organisms to the distant ancestors of birds to flightless close ancestors of the bird, before finally reaching the current bird.", "There\u2019s much progress that can be made simply by observing and copying the shape of the bird\u2019s wings without understanding anything else. The very existence of the bird itself is a proof of concept of flight.", "Similar to emulating a bird to achieve flight, we may be able to emulate a human brain to achieve consciousness and don\u2019t necessarily need to understand exactly how all the components of the brain work or how consciousness may arise from it. We can just observe and replicate the brain at the following levels:", "The difficulty here would be to consider what minimum layer of abstraction is required to successfully emulate a brain. It might not necessarily require emulating the motions of individual molecules, but may require that we correctly replicate neurotransmitters and their interactions with synapses, which may be very complex itself.", "Furthermore, we will need highly-advanced technological tools to successfully probe, copy, replicate, instantiate, and then run.", "Although this is very difficult, it would be more a matter of engineering for this emulation process, without any deeper scientific principles required.", "Emulation is very useful since it does not require understanding or discovering abstract Scientific concepts about brain function and consciousness, it just needs to be done, and this could occur on a substrate beyond the original human neurons.", "Now let\u2019s say we want to \u201csimulate\u201d how a bird flies. This would require the principles of flight, which is a scientific understanding.", "This would require a higher level of abstraction beyond mere copying. But once we understand higher-order principles such as thrust, lift, drag, and principles of aerodynamics and physics, we can then engineer other wings to \u201csimulate\u201d flight. This flight could be on wing designs that may not necessarily look like the shape of the original bird\u2019s wings, while completely ignoring superficial aspects like the color of the wings.", "Furthermore, because we are working with the principles of flight on an abstract level, we can then use these principles for vastly different engineering based on those same principles. For example, we could build a helicopter with rotor blades that function differently but based on the same scientific principles as bird flight.", "We could even take the aerodynamics and physics principles further to consider rocket propulsion, which would then permit us to entire an entirely new domain of Space. Here, we\u2019re able to go far beyond bird flight in the atmosphere and go into a different domain altogether.", "Similarly, if we understand higher abstractions of brain anatomy and physiology, we do not have to copy exactly how organic and natural neurons work precisely like is done in emulation.", "This simulation of brain function would rely more heavily on scientific principles. As an example, replicating the movement of waves on water according to wave mechanics does not rely on a specific body of water or even water itself, since the wave mechanics have been abstracted away in the math.", "(As an aside: taking the metaphor even further, the very notion of waves require a conceptual leap, since for example, when waves travel across the ocean, each individual water molecule is not carried by the way, but rather the wave is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the constituent water molecules. It could be construed that human consciousness is the \u201cwave\u201d that exists on the constituent underlying \u201cwater molecules\u201d of neurons and could conceivably exist on any other medium in too.)", "Although an understanding of brain principles would permit us to simulate the human mind on other substrates beyond organic neurons, it may be very difficult in the foreseeable future to get an abstract scientific understanding of human brain function, and so the pure engineering approach of emulation may be more viable in the nearer term.", "Much like aerodynamic principles of a bird can be used to build rockets and reach the entirely new domain of space, perhaps the scientific principles underlying brain function and consciousness can be used to build Artificial Intelligence, enhance our own minds, or even merge them together to explore truly new vistas of consciousness that we could not even conceptualize before abstracting away the particular details of bird flight.", "Thus, it appears that when trying to reproduce a human brain in another physical system that could give rise to consciousness, we may need a combination of both \u201cemulation\u201d focused on engineering for components of the brain we may not fully understand and \u201csimulation\u201d based on science for aspects we do understand at a more abstract level.", "This way, we can utilize each of their strengths and avoid their limitations with our current level of technological and scientific progress.", "Regardless of the specific mix of emulation or simulation, and how much this mix will evolve as science and technology become better, it\u2019s useful to distinguish them explicitly when replicating a human brain.", "Scientists and Technologists tend to harbor attitudes towards philosophy that range from an explicit and proactive aversion to an apathetic stance. I do believe good philosophy enhanced by an understanding of science and technology can be highly beneficial, but it\u2019s very easy to do bad philosophy that\u2019s not grounded in either.", "Let\u2019s consider the existence of cognitive biases in human brains.", "This may not be just a philosophical exercise because implementing those cognitive biases in emulation or simulation may require deeper scanning of neurons for more fine-grained detail, more data processing, and much more computation or energy.", "This is one of many examples, but other examples may be more abstract, such as: To what extent should we lean more towards emulation that may require much more computation to achieve the same performance versus simulation instead that may abstract some irrelevant parts away.", "There used to be a question of whether Science or Engineering/Technology is more fundamental and important, and which drives the other. But this is an ill-defined question. Why? Because they exist in a mutually-reinforcing virtuous circle: technology can permit more powerful Science to be done as exemplified by the Large Hadron Collider, which in turn drives even better information technology that can be used to build more impressive technology that can be used for better science.", "In the same way, philosophy has great utility and promise to enhance both Science and Technology in a virtuous upward cycle by focusing them on what matters or at least what to push off into the future.", "Do the cognitive biases in a human brain as stated above matter ultimately? Maybe. Maybe not. But considering whether those cognitive biases are required to replicate a human brain and actually replicating them is crucial.", "Progress must be made in tandem in science, technology, and philosophy so that they reinforce each other. It can be construed that the philosophy may be the hardest of all since problems may be open-ended or even intractable, and so we must settle for good enough.", "Your home for data science.
