I used to be foolish enough to think that one day in the future, Excel was going to be considered irrelevant. The truth is, the opposite is happening. Excel and spreadsheets in general, are more relevant than ever.", "I often run into people who work in some capacity which requires some basic analysis and/or reporting. They handle this entirely within Excel.", "The issue is that when this data exists in a database, most of the time the person who has to use the data for analysis or reporting is different than the person who knows how to pull the data. This creates a problem in every company that has a limited amount of analysts that have to constantly context switch.", "This has created a demand for employees in a non-data analyst role that understand basic queries and the basics of databases.", "The main problem is that a lot of people don\u2019t know where and how to start.", "Fortunately, as someone who\u2019s traveled the journey from spreadsheets to databases, I can and want to be your Sherpa. Realistically speaking, spreadsheets are the same thing as databases, but we just need to learn a new simple language to navigate through them.", "I have an Excel workbook I\u2019ll be using as a basis for my explanations. In this workbook, I have multiple sheets that look and function like tabs in your web browser. Each of these sheets stores different data.", "The workbook I\u2019ll be using contains data of operations of my fruit store. As you can see, there are sheets for customers, items, and purchase_log.", "These tabs will each contain raw data that hasn\u2019t yet been formatted. The data is organized into columns for each field and rows for each record.", "As you can see, the table consists of IDs, followed by other details. Traditionally in Excel, if I wanted to attach more items and customer information to the purchase log, I would use an index match or vlookup to do so like below.", "There we have it \u2014 very simple to combine information from different tables in our spreadsheet database. We can be very dangerous with our analysis now.", "In Excel we have workbooks and within them we have sheets. In a database we can just call the workbook a schema and we can call the sheets tables. They work the same way. The tables also contain information in the exact same format as well \u2014 tabular with fields as columns and rows being records.", "The difference now is instead of having data a click of a button away, we\u2019ll just have to write quick queries.", "We now have a schema which contains 3 tables:", "If we wanted to view all of the data in each table, we would just write the following:", "Or if we wanted to select from the items table:", "If we wanted to create the purchase log with customer full names as well as names of the fruits they purchased like what", "SQL goes very deep and there are a lot of ways we can adjust queries, but what I\u2019ve shown you above knocks out a bulk of it.", "It\u2019s pretty easy to read the earlier queries that I wrote. Select means to select, the * means all fields, from identifies the table in which I want to select all from.", "For example, I want to select all fields/columns from the customers table, so I\u2019ll write:", "In the last table above, I pulled data from other tables into the purchase log and renamed the fields. The query is slightly more complicated than using a \u2018select all\u2019 to view a table. No need to worry, I\u2019ll break it down in a way that\u2019s digestible.", "In our earlier queries, because we were using *, we were simply selecting all the fields. If our query is isolated to one table, we can select which fields we want by writing them out and separate them with a comma.", "This would give us just a table with items and their prices, without their IDs.", "However, this query pulls data from different tables, and sometimes the fields in this table are named the same such as \u2018id\u2019. Therefore we have to specify which id it is that we want.", "The above reads as follows \u2014", "This allows us to glue two different tables together using columns that have matching values.", "Translating this to plain English : I want to use data from the customers table in my current table (purchase_log) and I can do this because customer_id in this table exists in id in the customers table.", "The actual data you want to use from the joined table will be added into the select statement.", "Having this handy will let you pull anything you want in a database and keep it to a single table.", "Commonly used statements and functions that are included in my query to make modifications to the way data is labeled:", "There we have it. You\u2019re now able to pull data as you like from a database and make modifications to the way it is labeled!", "While I\u2019m a loyal fan of Excel for getting me through my early career, I\u2019ve since added a lot to my tool stack. The rabbit hole to SQL goes much deeper and I hope that this intro can inspire you to explore it.", "Your home for data science.
