Unless otherwise stated, the next conclusions are valid for GN and LFR. In terms of speed, Louvain outperformed all others. Considering accuracy, in networks with well-defined communities, Louvain was the most accurate. For higher mixing, LLP was the best. Contrarily to weakly mixed, it is advantageous to increase the resolution parameter is highly mixed GN. In LFR, higher resolution decreases the accuracy of detection, independently of the mixing parameter. The increase of the average node degree enhanced partitioning accuracy and suggested detection by chance was minimized. It is computationally more intensive to generate GN with higher mixing or average degree, using the algorithm developed in the project or the LFR implementation. In S. aureus network, Louvain was the fastest and the most accurate in detecting the clusters of seven groups of strains directly evolved from the common ancestor.", "According to The Economist, data has become the most important resource in the world [1]. New ways to storage, analyze and visualize increasing amounts of information are becoming a pressing need.", "Interactions among different elements of real systems can be seen as networks [2]. From their topology or pattern of connections, functional knowledge can be extracted. Although empirical analysis can be useful in small networks, for big data it is indispensable the use of algorithms to uncover their properties. Consequently, mathematical models called graphs are used to simplify their representation. Graph theory provides all the tools available to analyze them. This representation implies all the elements of the network and their relations must be acquired. Generally, the closer to the human population is the analysis, the more difficult it gets to gather data. The two main reasons are the lack of non-invasive acquisition methods or privacy issues [3]. In fact, in health, legislation is becoming progressively stricter with respect to patient\u2019s data protection [4]. On one hand, it is fundamental to assure ethical use of medical data, on the other, it may constitute a hurdle for investigating the causes of many pathologies. In the next lines, the discussion will focus on the specific topic of infectious diseases.", "As stated by the World Health Organization, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is in the top ten of major threats demanding attention in 2019 [5]. In the last years, AMR has been potentiated by the use of drugs intended to treat diseases caused by pathogenic organisms. Depending on the organism, it is subdivided in antiviral (virus), antibiotic (bacteria), antifungal (fungi) or antiparasitic (parasites) resistance. Although resistance is a natural evolutionary process, in which the most competent strains get selected over time, the frequency of use, or even misuse, of antimicrobial drugs is accelerating the growth of resistance rates for several microbial species [6]. This is particularly relevant not only among the human population but also in farms where cattle are being given preventive doses of antibiotics as growth adjuvants. Moreover, the frequency people are travelling around the world is facilitating the spread of resistant organisms. Due to all of this and the high mortality of infectious diseases (Figure 1), it is fundamental to empower central health authorities with scalable and easy-to-use tools to allow their intervention in short time scales [7].", "Next Generation Sequencing methods, developed in the last years, have been providing us massive quantities of microbiological data [9]. In fact, due to the high discriminative power of whole genome sequencing methods, it has been possible to infer more precise evolutionary relationships among strains. Consequently, allelic profiles with higher number of genes keep increasing and, with them, more complete phylogenetic trees or networks depicting evolutionary distances among strains can be assessed. All of this has been useful in the multiple stages of disease prevention: vaccine design, assess the pathogenicity of a sequenced strain, detect outbreaks and in infection control. As well as diagnosis, enhancing the detection of mixed infections (caused by multiple genetically distinct organisms) [10].", "Generally, the goal of this project was to extract functional knowledge from the topological structure of phylogenetic networks. For instance, to be able to infer properties like resistance to antimicrobials, based on the similarity and characteristics of the other organisms in the network. Contrarily to random networks, real ones present an asymmetrical distribution of edges. From this asymmetry, clusters of nodes can be identified. By definition, communities are regions in the network with a higher density of edges. Nonetheless, this definition is not restrictive enough to undoubtedly identify them in graphs. This raises the following question: how can we detect communities if it is not clear what we are looking for? To answer this question, community finding theory has been developed in the past years. In spite there has been a considerable advance in terms of accuracy and speed of detection, some algorithms perform better than others in different networks.", "The aim of the project was to implement three community finding algorithms in JavaScript \u2014 Louvain, Infomap and Layered Label Propagation (LLP); to benchmark them, in terms of accuracy and speed, against two synthetic networks \u2014 Girvan-Newman (GN) and Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR) networks; to perform additional testing using an Amazon, Zachary\u2019s Karate Club and Staphylococcus aureus Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) Single Locus Variant (SLV) network; to compare different visualization frameworks in terms of their tools and robustness to big data \u2014 D3.js (using SVG and Canvas elements) and Cytoscape.js, and to create a web application to allow network visualization (before and after running community finding algorithms) and plot all data obtained from the benchmark tests.", "In Methodology, the implemented community finding algorithms, implemented benchmark tools, real test data and data visualization libraries are introduced. In Results, community finding algorithms are analyzed in terms of accuracy and speed. The speed of generation of benchmark networks is determined based on the different properties of the networks. Different web visualization frameworks are compared. And a S. aureus MLST SLV network is partitioned using different algorithms and input parameters. In Conclusion, a retrospective analysis on whether the goals were attained or not is made, main difficulties, future work to be performed in INSaFLU web application is detailed and a set of prospective improvements to the work already done is suggested.", "This algorithm, which was implemented in the project, is divided in 2 phases: Modularity Optimization and Community Aggregation [11]. Together, they are considered 1 pass. After the first step is completed, the second follows. Both are executed until there are no more changes in the network and maximum modularity is achieved.", "Modularity Optimization \u2014 the algorithm will randomly order all nodes in the network such that, one by one, it will remove and insert them in a different community C.

Links connecting giant nodes are the sum of the ones previously connecting nodes from the same different communities. This step also generates self-loops which are the sum of all links inside a given community before being collapsed into one node.", "Similarly to Louvain, Infomap algorithm was also implemented.

The latter starts by assigning a different community to each node in the network and then, iteratively, it modifies the respective community based on the dominant one from the nodes in the immediate neighborhood. In each iterate, this step is executed for all nodes, in a previously randomized order.", "LLP not only takes into account the nodes in the neighborhood, but also the ones in the remaining network [14]. The iterative process is the same, the difference resides in the value it optimizes. In this case, the assigned community is the one that maximizes:", "Being ki the number of nodes with label \u03bbi in the neighborhood of a given node and \u03bdi the total number in the whole graph labeled the same way.", "This approach, which was also implemented, buffers the number of nodes belonging to a certain community (in the node\u2019s neighborhood), by its usual presence across the whole network.", "Different community finding algorithms partition the same graph in different ways. Consequently, it is important to understand which algorithms are the most indicated.", "An accurate way to gain this insight is by partitioning networks whose community structure is known. GN and LFR benchmark networks are presented in the next sub-sections, as well as NMI which estimates the similarity between the original and the detected partitions.", "Community finding algorithms were not only tested in terms of accuracy but also speed. All benchmark tests were repeated 10 times. The mean values and corresponding confidence intervals at 95% were included in Results.", "In GN network, 128 nodes are divided in 4 groups, each one with exactly 32 nodes [16]. Then, a mixing parameter, chosen by the user, defines the probability of nodes from different communities being connected.

It receives an input of 2 arrays, with the same length, and returns the corresponding NMI:", "NMI is dependent on the mutual information I, the conditional entropy H(Y|C) and the entropy of the labeled H(Y) and clustered set H(C).", "The higher the number of tests performed using the implemented algorithms, the higher the certainty they are working properly for the broadest number of networks. This way, disconnected networks (sampled from an Amazon network), small sized ones (Zachary\u2019s Karate Club) and a phylogenetic network (S. aureus MLST SLV) were additionally considered. Nevertheless, no benchmark tests were performed using those.", "This network was obtained after crawling Amazon website [19]. Each node represents a given product available in the store and a connected pair means they are frequently bought together. The original network contains 334 863 nodes and 925 872 links.

The MLST profiles contain information about seven loci (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi and yqiL) and, at the time of download, it had 5199 MLST profiles (ST). A graph was created by linking each ST to all of its SLVs and the largest component was used for the benchmark of the community finding algorithms. The choice of this test network was based on the fact it can emulate similar patterns to the ones that are created using cgMLST or wgMLST profiles, which have many more loci than MLST.", "In the visualization application, the user can opt by visualizing every network using D3 or Cytoscape JavaScript libraries. In the case of the first framework, there is the possibility of visualizing data through a Canvas or an SVG element. All networks were plotted using a force directed implementation. This mode requires the developer to set features like the gravity, repulsion or spring constant which will affect how the network is displayed. Depending those parameters, node and link overlapping should be reduced in order to get an enhanced view of the graph (Figure 7).", "Regarding benchmark plotting, D3.js was used. Its flexibility in terms of visual representation, performance and the number of practical examples available on the web, determined this choice.", "In order to facilitate the analysis and visualization of the results after the execution of the previous algorithms, a web application was implemented (mscthesis.herokuapp.com).", "Its backend was conceived using Node.js and it runs in a Heroku server which is linked to a GitHub repository (github.com/warcraft12321/Thesis) containing all the implementations and documents related to the project.

By increasing \u03bc, LLP, which is able to detect communities based on the panorama of the whole network, consistently becomes the most effective for \u03bc \u2265 0.5. Comparing Louvain and Infomap when \u03bc \u2265 0.5, their performance is similar. Based on the CI 95%, it is not possible to state one performs better than the other. Another point to highlight is that Louvain and Infomap are very sensitive, consequently, unreliable detecting communities in networks with \u03bc \u2248 0.5. LLP and LP do not present any specific value in which community detection is steeply affected. These conclusions are all valid to GN and LFR networks (Figure 9 and Figure 10).", "Having considered only two gamma values in LLP, a more precise analysis was needed to check whether there could be others achieving better results.", "In the case of GN network (Figure 11), it is possible to detect communities with higher accuracy in networks less mixed. The performance decreases whenever we increase \u03b3 for \u03bc < 0.5. When \u03bc \u2265 0.5, the NMI between the detected partition and the one in the original network is higher as long as we keep increasing \u03b3. Another point to highlight is the possibility of detecting communities with higher precision in networks with higher \u03bc using appropriate \u03b3 than in others with lower \u03bc but with a non-optimal \u03b3. This is valid for networks with \u03bc > 0.5(Figure 12).", "In LFR networks, increasing gamma always leads to a decrease in the NMI (Figure 13).", "The influence of the average node degree was tested to check whether it affects the capacity of each algorithm to identify communities.", "In the case of GN networks, for \u03bc \u2264 0.5, an increased average degree enhances the capacity of Louvain, Infomap, LP and LLP to differentiate communities. For \u03bc > 0.5, NMI clustering quality is lower as higher is the average node degree. Assuming it is not expected the algorithms to identify the original communities for \u03bc \u2248 1, this suggests that higher average degrees tends to decrease detection by chance. This observation can be applied to GN and LFR networks (Figure 14).", "In terms of speed, Louvain algorithm performed significantly better than any other. One important property that contributes to its efficiency is that it only calculates modularity variation at each iteration of Modularity Optimization phase (1). In Infomap, minimum description length is recalculated at the end of each iteration of the optimization step (2). Due to this computationally intensive step, Infomap presented the poorest performance in the benchmark tests. Based on Table 1, it was expected the difference of execution time between Infomap and all others to be logarithmic. Due to inefficient steps in the implementation, this was not achieved. Comparing LLP and LP, the fastest was the one that needed to optimize the simplest equation \u2014 LP (Figure 15). Although, time complexity appears to be the same, as predicted in Table 1. Again, using the same table, it was expected LLP and LP to execute about as fast as Louvain. The small difference observed in Figure 15 might be explained by some non-optimized step in the implementation of LLP/LP.", "Previous GN and LFR networks were generated so the previous tests could be performed. The algorithm to create the former was implemented in the project. The time it takes to generate such networks increases exponentially with the average node degree and the mixing parameter (Figure 17). Becoming unfeasible to execute it for average degrees higher than 20, in an ordinary computer. Its performance was compared to the Fortunato\u2019s implementation which is highly scalable and allows the generation of networks with much higher number of links in shorter times (Figure 16). It was verified an approximately linear increase in the time of generation of networks with progressively higher mixing parameters, contrarily to the one implemented in the project. Just like before, generating networks with more edges, requires additional computational power.", "Additional tests were performed in LFR networks. The execution time was tested against the number of nodes and the mixing parameter of the network. In both cases, it was verified an approximately linear relation (Figure 18 and Figure 19). The number of nodes was not considered in GN networks, once they have a fixed number of elements per community and of communities. In spite only the mixing parameter and the number of nodes were analyzed, the user can still choose to adjust nodes maximum degree, the exponents of the nodes degree distribution and communities size distribution, the maximum/minimum number of nodes per community, the number of overlapping nodes per community (covers were not considered in the project) and the number of memberships for the overlapping nodes [22].", "Every community finding, benchmark network generator, accuracy measure and related algorithms were made available in NPM (Table 2).

This characteristic makes modularity-based algorithms fast.", "Using Infomap algorithm, several minimum description length thresholds were considered: 0.1, 0.02 and 0.01. For all values, every small dense group of nodes descending from the same ancestor was separated in different communities. Thus, it was not further considered.", "LLP algorithm considered three values for the resolution parameter: 0, 0.5 and 1. Similarly to Infomap, it partitioned the network in several small and dense communities.", "From the benchmark analyses of Louvain, Infomap and LLP against GN network (Figure 9 and Figure 10), it was predictable Louvain would perform better than the others, once it run in a network with well-defined communities. After adjusting the stopping parameter of Louvain, such that the communities identified were the most pertinent \u2014 nodes from densely connected regions descendent from the same ancestor belonging to the same community, a final partition was obtained (Figure 20). It is important to note that some clusters analogous to the one highlighted with a square were subdivided by the algorithm. One explanation is the presence of high recombination rates between strains of different sub-groups.", "By uploading to PHYLOViZ Online the generated metadata file with the nodes labeled accordingly to the inferred communities, one may observe the original phylogenetic tree with the same communities identified.", "Louvain, Infomap and LLP algorithms were implemented in JavaScript.
