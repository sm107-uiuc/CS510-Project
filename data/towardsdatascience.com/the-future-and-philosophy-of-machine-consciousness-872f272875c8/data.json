Complex, emotional, and often thought provoking, these stories have gained massive popularity with fans and futurists alike.", "Some notable, and rather dark, examples are:", "These stories are scary because they force us to confront possible realities that we may not understand, or know the answer to. One day, we won\u2019t be able to turn off the TV and return to a life where those situations aren\u2019t at your front door. But, even if that day isn\u2019t here yet, it\u2019s important to start exploring the philosophical questions that become increasingly relevant as these futuristic machines slowly become reality.", "Today, we\u2019ll explore questions related to machine consciousness, such as:", "We\u2019ll try to keep things objective, taking diverse perspectives from multiple sources. Here goes:", "Long answer: It\u2019s complicated. In 1950, Alan Turing, known as the father of modern computing and artificial intelligence, wondered the same thing. In an attempt to answer, he coined the famous Turing test. Put simply:", "\u201cThe Turing test, developed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine\u2019s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.\u201d", "Turing argued that thinking machines can exist. Contemporaries argue both ways, but the needle tips towards agreement with Turing\u2019s original arguments.", "But, what is thinking? This question might be more subjective that it first appears.", "A common thought experiment that argues against the validity of the Turing test as a proxy for whether machines can think is called the Chinese Room. John Searle, author of the paper that proposed this thought experiment, argued that a Chatbot does not think \u2014 it merely manipulates symbols it has no understanding of, which is not thinking.", "Essentially, the Chinese room highlights that what we perceive as machine intelligence is just a kind of computation. But, if silicon chips and electrical circuits are just the machine analog to our fatty tissue and chemical brains, what\u2019s the difference?", "This is the crux of the brain simulator response (a computationalism argument) to the Chinese room. The computational theory of mind states that the human mind is just information processing in a physical system. The brain simulator response argues that on the smallest scales, brains and processors are just two systems of information \u2014 they exchange data, update state, and produce outputs.", "So, let\u2019s assume that there is no soul, and that thinking really is just an emergent property of information processing. In that case, are emotions part of thinking? Or are they a uniquely biological thing?", "If \u201cemotions\u201d are defined only in terms of their effect on behavior or on how they function inside an organism, then emotions can be viewed as a mechanism that an intelligent agent uses to maximize the utility of its actions. Given this definition of emotion, Hans Moravec believes that \u201crobots in general will be quite emotional about being nice people\u201d.", "As stated above, emotions grant utility. For example, the two most primal emotions an animal can experience are fear and attraction. The gut stirring fear of dangerous environments, predators, and situations has stuck with us because it kept our ancestors alive. Attraction towards nutritious food, safe environments, and reproductive partners is no different. Those emotions helped us survive, and pass on our genes. It\u2019s worked pretty well so far.", "As all pet owners will tell you, to suggest that emotions are a purely \u201chuman\u201d trait is wrong. Animals across the intelligence spectrum experience emotions.", "So, why would robots be any different?", "Hans Moravec argues that robots \u201cwill try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement. You can interpret this as a kind of love.\u201d", "This argument is based on the fact that learning machines are based in function optimization. Whether it\u2019s maximizing a reward or fitness function (in Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithms) or minimizing a cost function (In Supervised Learning), the goal is analogous: achieve the best score possible.", "Knowing this, it\u2019s easy to see how Moravec\u2019s argument makes sense. Define the robots objective function as pleasing you, and kick your feet up as it tries to get a high score.", "So in short, yes \u2014 from an outside observer, robots can display emotions.", "But, emotions are also feelings. Asking if a machine can ever truly feel angry, happy, sad, touches on if the question of consciousness, which we will explore next.", "The words \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cconsciousness\u201d are used by different communities in different ways.", "Is consciousness, essentially, an emergent property of intelligence? This would make sense, as we can say that a dog is more conscious than a chicken, which is more conscious than an ant. With this line of thought, consciousness is not binary, but a continuum.", "And, who is to say the scale ends with us? Genetically speaking, we\u2019re hardly different from apes. To declare humans as the pinnacle of consciousness is hubristic, and is surely not the case (in terms of what is theoretically possible).", "John Searle, an American philosopher, theorized two types of AI:", "His goal was to distinguish the two in order to focus on the more \u201cinteresting\u201d issue at hand \u2014 referred to as the hard problem of consciousness. This problem is \u201chard\u201d since we understand and can replicate many of the subsystems of consciousness (such as mental states, information processing, etc\u2026), but not how they come together form a beings qualia. We simply don\u2019t understand a mechanism through which the function of consciousness is performed.", "However, AI researchers today are not concerned with the difference between Strong and Weak AI, since a General Intelligence would only need to \u201cact\u201d as such, unless it is proven that there is some secret extra ingredient to \u201cconsciousness\u201d that is required. If we can replicate a brain with software, it would (in theory) have all the capabilities of a human brain.", "In summary, these arguments show that until we find a quantifiable, objective mechanism responsible for consciousness, we must assume that a thinking, learning, generally intelligent machine is just as conscious as we are.", "Some new age thinkers describe consciousness as an \u201cinvisible, energetic fluid that permeates life and the mind.\u201d This thinking follows the same vein as a soul, spirit, or some other otherworldly, ethereal part of a person that makes them more than a piece of flesh. But, to consider this possibility, we again visit the problem of binary consciousness. Do dogs, chickens, ants, etc\u2026, also possess souls? If not, then they are all equally conscious, which certainly doesn\u2019t seem like the case.", "There have been a number of experiments done to quantitatively measure the presence of a soul \u2014 none of which have given experimental confirmation. You may say that the soul, and therefore consciousness, is not quantitatively measurable. If that\u2019s the case, an invisible, unmeasurable thing has no weight (get it) in our discussion. Overall, the arguments against machine consciousness can be summed up as spiritual, and have no credibility as far as experimental evidence.", "Overall, the scales tip towards the possibility of machine consciousness. There are no real roadblocks to say it\u2019s not possible. In the end, we can\u2019t say with certainty either way.", "These are incredibly complex topics. The ideas we\u2019ve explored are barely a drop in the ocean of perspectives that others have been pondering for decades. There is no black and white answer to any of these questions.", "In the near future, nothing will change. Our robots are far (enough) from anything available on Netflix to really cause any panic.", "In the future, who knows? That\u2019s an open ended topic for another day.", "I\u2019ve simply laid out what I think are the most reasonable answers. The important things is to keep an open mind, and always be open to new information, especially regarding such complex topics.", "If you found this post interesting, I encourage you to read further into the topic (check out the resources below).
