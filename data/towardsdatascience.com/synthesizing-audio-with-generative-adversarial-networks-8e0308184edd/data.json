We are now able to generate highly realistic images in high definition thanks to recent advancements like StyleGAN from Nvidia and BigGAN from Google; often the generated or \u2018fake\u2019 images are completely indistinguishable from the real ones, defining how far GAN developement has really come.", "But images aren\u2019t the only food that GANs are capable of eating: audio is another possible application for this kind of network, and somehow this field remains widely unexplored.", "In this article we are going to explain how to apply GANs to audio signals, and finally we will try to generate some audio clips.", "What\u2019s the difference between audio and images? Well, they are more similar than you may think.", "When dealing with Data Science and Machine learning, we must think of everything as numbers, vectors and tensors; a black and white image, as you may already know, can be considered as a simple 2D matrix in which every number represents a pixel and indicates \u2018how white\u2019 the pixel is in that particular position. With RGB images however, we must have 3 matrices, or channels, one for each primary color.", "Now let\u2019s move to audio signals. When listening to music, you are essentially hearing different sounds through time: that\u2019s why we can consider audio signals as time series.", "At every point in time the \u2018sound\u2019 can be represented by a single value; thus, we can think of sound (or \u2018amplitude\u2019 a) as a simple function of time (t), so that a=f(t). The function f is continuous (in nature), so to turn a signal into a finite set of numbers we need to choose a sampling rate.", "If the sampling rate is 16000 Hz, it means that we will write down the value of the amplitude in intervals of 1/16000 seconds, so that an audio clip of 2 seconds will result in a single vector of 32000 numbers (if the audio is stereo we will have 2 vectors of the same length, one for each audio channel).", "In conclusion, while images can be viewed as matrices (or tensors), audio signals can be considered as simple vectors.", "There is a lot more interesting theory on audio signals and many more ways to encode audio (for example as an image), but this is enough for what we are going to cover in this article.", "A 2018 paper introduced WaveGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network architecture capable of synthesizing audio. The network structure is extremely similar to the one called DCGAN, using convolutional layers in both the generator and the discriminator: if you are familiar with a traditional convolutional GAN architecture used to generate images, WaveGAN will be incredibly easy to understand.", "Let\u2019s say we have a generator that must output 1 second of audio (if the sample rate is 16 kHz, this will be a 16000 long vector, not accounting the fact that it must be a power of 4 as we will explain later) from a noise vector.", "First of all, as we are not dealing with 2D images anymore, the 2D filters used in the traditional convolutional layers are now useless. Remember that audio signals can be considered as simple vectors: thus, we must change the filters to be 1 Dimensional: 5x5 2D filters in DCGAN now become 25 long 1D filters in WaveGAN.", "Using Transposed Convolutions to upscale the audio from noise to the 16000 long vector will impact on the synthesized audio, as they notoriously produce checkerboard artifacts in images and the equivalent in audio signals. The Discriminator could easily learn to spot fake audio based on this artifact alone, deteriorating the whole training process. The paper proposes a smart solution called Phase Shuffle, but we will avoid Transposed Convolutions and use Upsampling layers (Nearest Neighbours) followed by normal Convolutions instead.", "While in DCGAN at each layer we upscale the \u2018image\u2019 by a factor of 2 (for example 32x32 to 64x64), in 1 Dimension the vector is upscaled by a factor of 4 each time (for example 1024 to 4096).", "This is important because we need to keep in mind that for just 1 second of audio, considering a sampe rate of 16 kHz, the corresponding vector is 16000 long, and choosing to upsample each time by a factor of 2 would require many many layers.", "This is also why the generated vector will have a length that is a power of 4 (16384 if we want about 1 second of synthesized audio sampled at 16 kHz).", "Consequently, everything also applies to the discriminator: in this case we will use 1D convolutions with stride 4, which is equivalent to downsampling by a factor of 4 at each layer.", "This is absolutely everything you need to know to make a conventional GAN for images work with audio signals: change the filters to be 1 dimensional and upscale and downscale by a factor of 4. The way the two networks are trained and the loss function are the same, so nothing new there.", "The original WaveGAN paper authors showcase their results in the official web page here. They attempted to generate a wide variety of audio domains such as human speech, bird sounds, drums and music, with pretty convincing results. I really recommend you check them out for yourself.", "One of the most difficult domain to synthesize is for sure human speech: while we don\u2019t really know a realistic bird sound should sound like, we have a very deep understanding on how to interpret human voice and how to spot if it is real or fake.", "We can say that human voice is for audio what human faces are for images: it is really hard for a machine to learn how to generate these domains while keeping them indistinguishable from the real ones. That\u2019s why the generations of WaveGAN in this particular case are clearly fake to our ears: we must remember that the GAN has no idea about words, phrase composition and intonation, all concepts incredibly difficult to learn, representing immediate red flags for us in the synthesized samples.", "We need to make some more steps in the development of this technology to be able to create realistic samples from raw speech data, but I think we are not too far from this achievement.", "I myself have tried to generate some samples from raw audio of Barack Obama speeches, predictably without any convincing results. Here are some examples:", "Using GANs for audio generation has a lot of potential, both positive and negative: some researchers have explored the idea of domain translation for human voices (imagine turning Obama\u2019s voice into Trump\u2019s, like Deepfakes for voice), using some well know GANs architectures, such as CycleGAN, to reach their goal.", "While this technology, as we have seen, produces far from indistinguishable from reality results, we need to consider the fact that it opens possibilities for misuse, like what happened with Deepfakes. In my opinion, this shouldn\u2019t scare us from exploring the world of synthetic audio generation, but should invite us to embrace it and discover its potential and weaknesses.", "I would like to sincerely thank you for reading this article, I really appreciate it, hoping that you managed to learn something new.", "Your home for data science.
