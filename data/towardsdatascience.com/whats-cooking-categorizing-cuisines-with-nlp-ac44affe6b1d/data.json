Want to try foods from around the world but stuck at home? Well, this is the project for you! As a foodie myself, this was a fascinating dataset to play with, learning about the different specialty ingredients of each cuisine. The \u201cWhat\u2019s Cooking\u201d dataset is a list of recipes from 20 different cuisines and the task is to build a classifier for the different recipes. In this article, I\u2019ll be comparing two different approaches towards understanding this dataset.", "Before feeding the data into a machine learning model the first step would be to transform the data into a quantitative form that a machine learning model is able to use. The easiest way to do this would be to use one-hot encoding, a technique where a list is converted to a vector of 1s and 0s depending on whether an item is present.", "In this dataset of 7137 ingredients, things can quickly get out of hand if there is no additional processing. Having too many dimensions will make performing operations a lot more computationally difficult which will greatly extend the time needed to train the model. This problem is a common one known as the Curse of Dimensionality.", "To solve this issue we have to project the data onto a lower dimension which is more manageable for us to work with. These lower-dimensional vectors are known as word vectors or word embeddings and they are essentially a numerical representation of the meaning of the word. These word vectors can then be combined to create sentence vectors or in this case, recipe vectors. To obtain these recipe vectors, we look at 2 methods, The first method is Principal Component Analysis or using a Natural Language model known as Continuous Bag of Words.", "PCA is a statistical technique used to compress a dataset into lower dimensions. This is done by finding the directions of highest variance and then projecting the data onto those axes. The idea behind this is that the axes of highest variance are able to preserve the most amount of information from your dataset and this minimizes the information loss from transforming to a smaller dimension.", "In the context of this problem, PCA can be directly applied to the recipe vectors without learning the embeddings of each ingredient. The original matrix of size is compressed into 32 dimensions which will serve as the embeddings for the recipes.", "A huge breakthrough in the area of Natural Language Processing was the advent of word2vec, a systematic approach that can transform the meaning of words into a numerical vector representation that computers can understand. The famous equation \u201cQueen - Woman + Man = King\u201d showed us how accurate word vectors are able to effectively capture the semantics of words.", "One common model used to generate this word vector is the Continuous Bag-Of-Words (CBOW) model which uses adjacent words (context words) to learn associations between different words.", "In the first part, the model passes the one-hot vectors of the context words through an encoder to transform it to a lower dimension. These vectors are then summed to get the 32-D embedding vector we are looking for. The next part of the model will then try to convert this lower dimension embedding vector back into the one-hot encoded vector of the target word. As expected, the reconstruction of the one-hot vector from the embedding vector will not be perfect and the error between the 2 vectors will be backpropagated through the model. After successive epochs of learning, the model will be able to convert one-hot vectors to embedding vectors whilst preserving as much information.", "If you\u2019re interested to learn more you can check out this article which explains other models here or for those who want to delve more into the math, the notes here are pretty good.", "However unlike a sentence, ingredients in a recipe are inherently unordered and instead of taking adjacent ingredients in the recipe, the context ingredients are sampled randomly from the entire ingredient list. The training dataset is also resampled every 5 epochs to learn as many associations as possible.", "After finding an optimum learning rate for the training of the model, the CBOW model is trained for 60 epochs where the data is shuffled every 5 epochs. This results in the loss function increasing every 5 epochs as the model has to adapt to the newly shuffled data which will hopefully allow it to generalize better.", "Once we have obtained our word embeddings using this technique we can do some preliminary assessment on them. A quantitative way of looking at these vectors would be to find the similarity between vectors that we expect to be similar. For example, the similarity between soy sauce and chicken should be significantly higher than soy sauce and milk. This can be evaluated using cosine similarity which measures the cosine of the angle between 2 vectors. Vectors that are pointing in similar directions will have the cosine similarity being close to 1 while vectors that are different should have similarity near -1.", "Back to the task at hand, we are more interested in classifying recipes instead of the ingredient vectors. Averaging over all the ingredients in a recipe will give us a recipe vector which we can then compare to the recipe vectors obtained from PCA. A qualitative way of evaluating these two models would be to visualize them on a 2-Dimensional space. We can then look at the separation between recipes from different cuisines to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms.", "The way which we can do this is to use t-SNE a manifold dimensionality reduction tool which is very useful for mapping out high-dimensional spaces. From the 32-D vectors obtained from both techniques, t-SNE is performed on both to get a 2-D plot.", "Clearly, we see that the plot obtained from our NLP model performs significantly better than the PCA model which is to be expected. Neural networks such as the CBOW model can learn a lot more high dimensional features compared to PCA and we can see this from the better separation in the plots. At the same time, these plots can provide valuable insights into different cuisines. From the plots we can see that cuisines such as Mexican and Indian form a very distinct cluster whilst Greek and Southern US cuisines are more spread out, indicating that they incorporate a greater variety of ingredients. From the distances between each cluster, we can also compare the similarities of different cuisines. As expected, Japanese, Chinese and Thai are clustered together while Greek, Italian and French cuisines form another cluster on the opposite end. See what other insights you can gain from the data!", "Your home for data science.
