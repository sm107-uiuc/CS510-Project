I\u2019ve deliberately avoided installing any plugins up till today because I wanted to make sure I grasp the basics before using any plugins.", "Today, I felt I was ready for a plugin, especially if I think it\u2019ll greatly improve my productivity.

In fact, I don\u2019t look forward to coding in MATLAB and RStudio\u2019s IDEs where I can\u2019t use Vim.", "I learned many new motions and tips today. For example, I can jump between matching parenthesis using %. That\u2019s cool and will be super useful for programming.", "I started working on a JavaScript and Node.js project today and used Vim in Visual Studio Code throughout the day.

The Cult of Vim", "The \u201cZen\u201d of vim is that you\u2019re speaking a language, and a good way I learned to think about normal mode commands is as a language, with verbs, nouns, and adjectives.

As a result, I\u2019ve started using deliberate practice, a powerful learning strategy, to improve my Vim skills.", "I bought Udemy\u2019s Vim masterclass today because I felt some structure in my learning might be helpful. I completed the first few sections and really liked it. Perhaps I should have started with this Udemy course on Day 1.", "I\u2019ve been feeling quite comfortable using Vim in Visual Studio Code recently so I tried using Vim in RStudio again. I hated it on Day 2, but it wasn\u2019t that bad today so I might continue using Vim in RStudio.", "It\u2019s only been two weeks plus one day, but I already like it so much that I decided to write tutorial on how to use the surround.vim plugin, which played a huge role in making me like Vim.", "Learning Vim has reminded me of the importance of persistence, especially when struggling initially. I\u2019ve enjoyed the challenge, which involved lots of learning, struggling, and a literal headache.", "But I surprised myself eventually: I never thought I could feel at home with Vim in just 15 days.

I\u2019m improving every day because I\u2019m using it regularly; but like every language, I know I\u2019ll never fully master Vim because there\u2019s too much to it (and what does it even mean to \u201cfully master\u201d something anyway?).
