Everyone is on board, the aircraft has even left the departure gate, and yet it\u2019s taking quite a bit of time to even take off.", "A simple way to define taxi time is the amount of time an aircraft spends in movement on the surface of an airport. For the scope of this project, I only focused on departure taxi-time (or taxi-out time) which is the period of time between an aircraft leaving a terminal gate and actually taking off from an airport. Typically this entire process is supervised by ATC (Air Traffic Control) where pilots are given clearance to depart from the gate, takeoff, etc.", "Great! We defined what taxi time is but why does it actually matter?", "A quick look at some information provided by the ICAO above reveals that a typical Boeing 777 spends 23.3 kg/min (or 6.15 gallons/min) of fuel just taxiing. With taxi times having an average of 15 minutes, this totals up to around 92 gallons of fuel spent just taxiing out to the takeoff point!", "And while different types of aircraft will have different consumption rates, being able to optimize airport surface movement and reduce taxi times will allow airlines to save on some serious fuel costs as well as reduce CO2 emissions which improving customer experience.", "Because a lot of flight data is internal or subjective based on airline, I chose to compare how the top 4 airlines performed in taxi-time speed and also focus on how weather patterns affected taxi times. So my objective can be condensed into the following questions:", "For the scope of this project, I chose to focus on just 10 airports over 4 different months (Jan, Apr, Jun, Oct) in 2018 to try to account for seasonality. I also limited my airlines to the top 4 (Southwest, American, Delta, United) since they make up a significant portion of the domestic flight market. I used Selenium to automate the process of downloading flight statistics from the Bureau of Transportation\u2019s aviation page and utilized BeautifulSoup as well to scrape weather data for corresponding dates and airports.", "A quick look at the bar chart above shows that extremely busy airports such as JFK and SFO tend to have longer taxi-out times. This was expected since just the volume of air traffic going through these airports is a lot higher than airports such as STL but it is still important that these initial assumptions were validated by data.", "One interesting observation was that Southwest tends to have the fastest taxi-out time. This was quite surprising since this was a noticeable difference from the other airlines and despite my research, it was hard to pinpoint the reasons for this.", "I did account for the fact that Southwest doesn\u2019t fly to some airports like JFK by only considering airports that they do fly to, but it still remained the fastest airline.", "Browsing through some aviation forums reveals that even air traffic controllers know that Southwest taxis faster than other airlines but aren\u2019t sure why. One possible reason may be that Southwest only uses a Boeing 737 which is smaller and therefore easier to navigate when compared to some of the bigger aircraft that other airlines use. And this may be something worth looking into in a later project.", "One notable relationship that confused me at first was a positive correlation between average air pressure and taxi time.", "Despite my research, I wasn\u2019t able to find a reasonable explanation for this positive correlation between pressure and taxi time. However, a countplot of air pressure in the data revealed that different airports just tend to have different average pressure readings as can be seen below. Therefore, this correlation between pressure and taxi time turned out to be a proxy for which airport a plane was departing from.", "For the actual modeling, I chose to stick to linear regression as a baseline while also using lasso and ridge regression to improve model performance if necessary. I used mean absolute error as my evaluation metric because I was more interested in how far off my predictions are from the actual taxi time. The results are as follows:", "As you can see, the MAE comes out to around 3.5 mins. This means on average, the model\u2019s prediction would be around 3.5 mins off from the actual taxi time. Furthermore, regularization didn\u2019t have a huge impact and linear regression with polynomial features had the best performance, likely because this would allow for interactions between airlines and airports. For example, one polynomial feature would be JFK * Delta(Airport * Airline) which may be a better feature at predicting Delta\u2019s taxi time in JFK than if the feature was just Delta. However, even this only decreases MAE by about 10 seconds.", "One thing to note though is that this model breaks one of the assumptions of linear regression \u2014 homoscedasticity. This can be seen in the residual plot below:", "As you can see, there is heteroscedasticity present in the residual plot above. The model tends to perform a little better at predicting longer taxi times compared to shorter times where residual errors reach up to 15 minutes. This actually makes sense when we think about the problem of taxi time. During short taxi times, a simple difference such as how fast a pilot drives can cause variance in the data and our model isn\u2019t equipped to deal with this. Whereas in longer taxi times, there are probably other factors contributing to it. For example, one of the features in this data is Delay in NAS(mins) which is basically a delay in the National Aviation System. This type of delay can cause long taxi-times and as a result, this feature is probably an important reason for why the model can predict longer taxi-times better than shorter ones.", "From this regression model, we can conclude that busy airports and morning flights tend to have longer taxi times. While this trend is reasonable and something that can be guessed at, validating it with data is important. In addition, this model is able to more intricately weigh each airport to determine a plane\u2019s taxi time.", "And while the reasons for Southwest\u2019s dominating performance in taxi time metrics remain unknown, it is something worth looking into to determine other factors that can influence tarmac delays.", "Project repository can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
