The term supervised is a direct reference to how these models rely on accurately labelled training data in order for them to learn.", "Say we want to train an image classification model to identify if an image contains cats; we would need to start with a training set of images, with each image labelled \u201cHas cats\u201d or \u201cNo cats\u201d. The model relies on these observed labels during training.", "We are an insurance company and we want a classification model to classify the likelihood of a claim being paid out. Again, we need a training set, this time comprising of all the relevant information linked to a claim, together with a label \u201cPaid Out\u201d or \u201cNot Paid Out\u201d.", "We are a news feed who wants to classify third-party news articles into the genre they apply to (business, entertainment, technology etc). In this example, our training set will comprise of many articles, complete with the text, labelled with the genre of that article.", "We are developing an app for bird watchers that can identify a species of bird from its call (think Shazam for birdsong!). For this, we need a training set of bird song audio files, each labelled with the bird it pertains to.", "This example formed the foundation for a recent Data Science competition hosted by Kaggle :)", "An online video service decides they want to serve adverts for cat food, each time a viewer streams a video containing cats. In this example, videos will be served to the model during training, labelled \u201cContains Cat\u201d or \u201cNo Cat\u201d.", "In summary then, labelling applies to many different media types that we work with in data science.", "Unsupervised models, such as a K-means clustering, do not require labelling because, in a sense, unsupervised models discover (i.e. learn) these labels for themselves.", "When training supervised machine learning models, labelling is one of the first activities we carry out, and therefore, takes place very early on in the ML development lifecycle.", "As a data science team, when training ML models we often revert back to this mantra:", "\u201cThe accuracy of a machine learning model is only as good as it\u2019s (training) data.\u201d", "Consider a recent example \u2014 we trained a collaborative-based recommendation engine to recommend social media posts for a global social media platform; one of the key activities here was to accurately score (label) each users\u2019 engagement with a post. We scored the engagement on a 10 point scale, and if we got this scoring wrong \u2014 the end model would be seriously flawed.", "So, accurately labelling your training set is crucial.", "It\u2019s worth noting that accurately labelling your training set can still lead to problems. Here\u2019s an example.", "An image classification model was trained to detect wolves. The creators were perplexed when the algorithm incorrectly classified a German Shephard dog as a wolf. It turned out, the trained model was actually just looking for snow and trees in the image (which featured heavily in the training set).", "This is a great TED Talk that cites this, and other examples.", "Google\u2019s Data Labelling Service provides access to human labellers to generate highly accurate labels for training data.", "Currently in public-beta, the service formed part of the original AI Platform launch in April 2019.", "The labelling service currently supports 3 media types:", "We will now explore image labelling, including an easy to follow, technical walkthrough.", "Image labelling is the most common use-case we come across in our client projects. The service covers a good range of image labelling tasks:", "Image classification is the simplest to do, and a good place to start if you are using the service for the first time. I\u2019ll use the above two images as an example of how easy it is.", "Tip: This applies to any image labelling. Make sure your training images are as close as possible to the images the model will be predicting on. For example, think about resolution, colour/black and white, avoid commonalities in backgrounds (as in our wolf example earlier) that can confuse the model.", "2. Next you need to create a .CSV file that contains the URIs to your images in your GCS bucket. So, in my example, my CSV just contains two lines:", "Upload this .CSV file to the same bucket that contains your image files.", "3. Next we need to create data labelling dataset. This dataset is simply a resource that the human labellers will refer to for your lablleing request. It contains your images, image .CSV file and your instructions (I\u2019ll cover instructions shortly).", "To create a dataset, first, navigate to the Data Labelling Service UI in the Google Cloud console. You should see a screen like this (enable the API if you are prompted).", "Click the CREATE button. Then, enter the details of your new dataset in the panel, shown below. Note I have to choose the CSV file in my cats-or-no-cats GCS bucket. Finally, click CREATE.", "I now see my dataset with both of my images imported. Google documentation states this step takes approximately 10 minutes per 10,000 images uploaded.", "4. Next we create a label set, to define the label options we want the human labels to label our images with. In our example, we need two labels: \u201cCat\u201d and \u201cNo Cat\u201d.", "To do this, from the Data Labelling UI click Label Sets from the menu on the left and then click CREATE at the top of the screen. Then, in the panel on the right, simply define your labels. Here are mine:", "Tip #1. We always include a clear, unambiguous description with each label. Labellers will see these, and therefore these supplement your instructions!", "Tip #2. For multi-classifcation use-cases (such as cats or dogs) we always include a label for \u201cBoth\u201d (image has a cat and dog) and \u201cNone\u201d (image has no cats or dogs). As well as, of course, \u201cCat\u201d and \u201cDog\u201d :)", "5. The penultimate step is to create an instruction document. This is a PDF document that helps human labellers to understand what you want them to label. Now, for our classification task this is really simple and just requires a few example images (positive and negative) under each of our labels.", "Google has a lot of detailed guidance on writing good instruction documents. We would recommend reading this, as if these instructions aren\u2019t clear, your labellers may not do what you want them to do!", "Once your PDF document is ready, upload it to your GCS bucket that contains your images and .CSV file. Next, click Instructions in the UI and in the panel on the right just navigate to your instructions document. Here\u2019s what mine looks like:", "Click CREATE INSTRUCTIONS and wait for an email confirmation before continuing. Here\u2019s my email (it usually only takes a few seconds).", "6. We are now ready to submit our labelling task! This is really straightforward \u2014 navigate to your dataset (see step 3) and click on the dataset name. You will see your dataset contents. Here are mine:", "Click on CREATE LABELLING TASK at the top. In the panel that\u2019s displayed enter:", "Congratulations! Your images will now be labelled by skilled human labellers. Pretty cool, hey?", "Once the labelling process is complete, you will receive an email confirmation. To review your labelled images, first, navigate to your dataset. Here is mine:", "Click on the LABELLED DATA SETS link and you will see your labelled images. Exporting labelled images is a really useful feature, especially if your image training set is large. Options are to exports as a CSV or json file. To export your images:", "Tip: Both CSV and json exports can easily be viewed in BigQuery (via a federated external table) for further analysis.", "As well as classification, Google\u2019s Data Labelling Service covers the following other image labelling tasks:", "In bounding box, we want to label a particular feature of an image using a rectangular box. For example, as an extension of our Cats-or-no-cats example, we may choose to train a second model that can detect the position of a cats face within an image.", "Tip. Pay close attention to your instructions document and make sure it\u2019s really clear to labellers what you want (and don\u2019t want) boxed in your images.", "This is similar to the bounding box task, with the only difference being the boxes can be orientated (angled). We haven't come across this in the field, but this paper has some good examples relating to the identification of cars in aerial photography.", "This is useful if more precision is needed in object detection than bounded box. In this task, human labellers will label an image with closed polygons (comprising of a series of co-ordinates).", "Let\u2019s say we want our cat to be bounded by a polygon. Here\u2019s what the labelled image might look like:", "Polyline is similar to Bounded Polygon, with the exception the polygon does not need to be closed. This is often used for labelling roads in images, but if we continue our cat example, we could use a polyline to mark the cat\u2019s mouth (perhaps we want to analyze if a cat is happy!).", "This form of labelling splits an image into a series of segments, each labelled with a colour. It\u2019s frequently used in driverless car AI, where a street scene must be separated into different segments (road, pavement, cars, buildings, sky, etc).", "In our example, we simply use this to label segments comprising cats.", "Pricing is documented really well in the Google Cloud documentation. This describes the overall pricing structure:", "\u201cPrices for the service are computed based on:", "1. The type of labeling task.", "2. The number of annotation units generated.\u201d", "So, if we look at our classification example I used earlier. Here is the definition of annotation units for classification tasks:", "For an image classification task, units are determined by the label set size (for labeling quality concern, every 20 labels is a problem set and a price unit) and the number of human labelers. The price for single-label and multi-label classification is the same. For example, for an image, the label set size is 22, the number of human labelers is 3, this image will count for 2 * 3 = 6 units.", "In our example, our label set size was 2; \u201cCat\u201d and \u201cNo Cat\u201d.", "As a price unit covers up to 20 labels, ours constitutes 1 unit.", "We left the number of human labellers at the default of 1.", "Therefore, our labelling task is priced at 2 units (1 per image).", "At the time of writing, image classification is priced at $35 per 1,000 units for the first 50,000 units per month, and $25 for every 1,000 units thereafter.", "This is equivalent to 3.5 cents per image, reducing to 2.5 cents.", "The first thing I\u2019d like readers to take away with them is just how important accurate labelling is when training your models. Sometimes it can be tempting to rush this step in the excitement to see your model live, but just to remind you once again of the mantra our team refers back to:", "\u201cThe accuracy of a machine learning model is only as good as it\u2019s (training) data.\u201d", "The second key takeaway, and something I found personally insightful writing this, is just how many different sub-classes of image labelling there are. Some of these, such as Orientated Bounded Box, I never even knew existed. I hope you found these interesting too. I\u2019m already looking forward to the follow-up articles, where I\u2019ll be exploring the various video and free-text labelling tasks.", "My third takeaway is how simple the Data Labelling Service from Google Cloud is to use; Google has done a great job at making this really user friendly and accessible. I feel it follows a logical flow, and I hope this was evident as you followed along with my example. The ability to easily export to GCS and therefore into BigQuery we find super useful too.", "I feel the service offers generally good value for money, especially for simpler tasks such as classification. I think 3.5 cents per image is reasonable, and accessible for most use-cases. Furthermore, you can often achieve a level of model accuracy from a relatively small set of training images.", "Lastly, as the wolf example pointed out, labelling is not the silver bullet when training image related models. Be mindful to not allow other bias to creep into the model. Always try and keep your images as close to the ones your model will face \u201cin the field\u201d, and you will be on the right track!", "1.
