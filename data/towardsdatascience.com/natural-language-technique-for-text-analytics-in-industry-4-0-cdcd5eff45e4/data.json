In\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Natural Language Processing (NLP) is described as an application and research area that study how computers and learn and exploit natural language text or speech to create meaningful stuff [1]. In order to achieve human-like language processing for a variety of tasks or applications, NLP as a theoretically inspired set of computational techniques for the analysis and representation of naturally occurring texts at one or more levels of linguistic analysis is necessary [2]. The term NLP is typically used to describe the role of computer system components, software or hardware that analyses or synthesize spoken or written language [3].", "Text analytics, sometimes referred to as text mining or data mining, is the process of acquiring insightful information from text. Text mining is an important research topic because most of the data is unstructured. Text mining plays an important role to extract meaningful information from the data by identifying and exploring the interesting patterns [4]. Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing technique for text analytic, which are used to analyze the polarity of a document or a sentence, or an attribute [5].", "Industry 4.0 refers to the process of changing the production system. In the concept of Industry 4.0, the need for manpower is changed to human brainpower instead of human muscle strength, and the manpower in production will be replaced with the machines. The modern manufacturing technologies including Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, big data and analytics, autonomous robots, additive manufacturing, simulation, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, simulation, horizontal and vertical system integration as well as cloud computing [4] [6]. In short, Industry 4.0 is \u201cInterconnected World\u201d [7].", "In this article, how the techniques can be applied, and the type of analysis can be performed will be discussed.", "In the study of [8], text mining is applied to study the job characteristics in Industry 4.0 by analyzing the job advertisement. The rapid changes in technology also bring changes in the skills and knowledge required in the smart factory (smart factory referring to a factory that exploits the cyber-physical system (CPS) for the manufacturing process). Quick analysis tools are necessary to analyze the job advertisement as the job characteristics of Industry 4.0 are changing fast. From the research, the authors proposed new job profiles for Industry 4.0, provided guidance on the way of tracking the changes in the skills and knowledge needed for Industry 4.0 to the professionals in human resource, provided insight on the new curricula needed in the Industry 4.0 for the institution of high education, and proved the essential of text mining for analyzing the job advertisement.", "The authors in [8] analyzed more than 1400 job advertisements in Industry 4.0 to extract new job profiles. Based on the study, the organization with the concept of Industry 4.0, are no longer looking for traditional engineers like software engineer and mechanical engineer, the organization are looking for experts with the multidisciplinary skills to improve the machine capabilities and develop the distributed system. Furthermore, as the automation in the production process increased, the need for man labor decreased.", "Text mining also applied to study scientific publications related to Industry 4.0. In [4], Tayfun applied text mining and bibliometric analysis method with science mapping to perform statistical analysis on the attribute of scientific publications published in 2012 to 2018 that discussed Industry 4.0 in the Scopus database. The attributes include the country, authors(s), cooperate author, institution, date of publication, and references. Based on the research, the author identified the evolution of the main theme(s) and the growth of the scientific publication in the field of Industry 4.0. The country contributes the most to the scientific publication with concept Industry 4.0 also able to be identified.", "Based on [4], the scientific publications related to Industry 4.0 are increasing exponentially from the year 2012 to the year 2018. Then, the main country contributed to the concept of Industry 4.0 is Germany, followed by Italy, China and the United States. The theme of the scientific publication in Industry 4.0 field is changing and evolving from the year 2012 to the year 2018. In the year 2012, the only research theme is industrial research. Then, there are six research themes in the year 2013, which are Industry 4.0, Internet of Things (IoT), manufacture, information management, small and medium-sized enterprise and automotive industry. Industry 4.0, IOT and manufacture are the main research theme in the year 2014 and the year 2015 as well. In the year 2016 and the year 2017, there is three research theme each year, and not repeated. In the year 2016, the research them are Industry 4.0, industrial revolutions and information management, while in the year 2017, the research theme is engineering, manufacture and IoT. In tear 2018, the popular research theme has reduced to two, which are Industry 4.0 and industrial revolutions [4].", "The second text analytics method in Industry 4.0 is Sentiment Analysis. In [7], the author pointed out that Industry 4.0 have changed the Retail Industry. The changes include a flexible production system, faster development cycle, enrich retail experiences and mass-customization. Furthermore, Industry 4.0 also brought the era of eCommerce.", "A quarter of the client will be changed to a competitor\u2019s product or brand after just ONE bad experience with a retailer.", "Hence, the benefit of studying the sentiment of the client is invaluable. Sentiment Analysis is a method that implements text analytic algorithms to perform classification on the feedback, review or any text content from the customers into positive (happy or satisfies) and negative (disappointed or annoyed) [9]. By studying the sentiment of the client, the retailer will be able to resolve the quality issues effectively.", "Based on [9], the Sentiment Analysis can improve the retail industry with Industry 4.0 concept in operation, product quality, competitive intelligence and brand reputation threat analysis. The elements in the operation of the retail are staffs, venue and utilities. For example, it could be lack of staffs in the store or slow response. For product quality, based on Sentiment Analysis, the retailer able to identify the aspect of the product that makes the client happy or the defect that brings disappointment.", "The Sentiment Analysis also can be used to study the opinion of the market towards the competitors, in order to analyze the competitors\u2019 capabilities, performance and their offerings. Furthermore, the brand reputation threat. The retailer can identify the brand influencers by studying the post on social media about their products. The retailer can react with the comment, and study how they feel.", "In conclusion, there are two natural language processing techniques discussed in this paper. The first technique is text mining. By performing text mining on the job advertisement in Industry 4.0, both employees and employers able to identify the knowledge and skills that are essential in the Industry. Text mining also applied to explore the scientific literature in the field of Industry 4.0. By studying the trending research topic of Industry 4.0, the organization able to identify the technology and knowledge they need to acquire to keep themselves competitive in the rapid changes environment of Industry 4.0. The second technique is Sentiment Analysis which is used to study the opinion of the client in order to improve their products, services, competitive power and brand reputation. Industry 4.0 have interconnected the world, the text data from the publication, social media, review and other sources have increased rapidly. By applying the correct text analytics technique, the information obtained could bring invaluable insight into various improvement.", "[3]P. Jackson and I.
