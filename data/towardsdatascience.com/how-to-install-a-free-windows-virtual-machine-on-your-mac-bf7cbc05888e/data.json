It could be up and running in about five minutes.", "Want a machine that\u2019s running Windows 10?", "Even the most devoted Mac fan might want or need to use Windows (or another operating system) at some point. You might want to test out some cool tools or games that work off of Windows. You may have a desperate and immediate need for a different OS than the one sitting in front of you. You might need to check out some software that\u2019s having problems or work with a bug or a virus.", "It\u2019s possible that it\u2019s time for you to really start to play the game\u2026", "Fortunately, it\u2019s incredibly simple to install a free virtual machine right on your Mac and run it like you would any other application. It takes less than five minutes once you know what you\u2019re doing!", "Whether you\u2019re interested in penetration testing, hacking, debugging software, or you just want (or need) to run a few Windows-based programs and games, a virtual machine (VM) can be a handy thing to have. They allow you to install and run operating systems like Windows or Kali Linux in a window right on your desktop.", "This new guest operating system thinks it\u2019s running on a real computer, but it\u2019s actually running inside of a piece of software on your Mac. This virtual machine is \u201csandboxed\u201d from the rest of your computer. That means that it\u2019s completely separate from your computer. You\u2019re safe from bugs, viruses, and a host of other security problems.", "Virtual machines allow you to run more than one OS at a time. You can run software written for one OS on another without needing to reboot. Because you can configure your virtual hardware, you can even install an old OS like DOS or OS/2.", "You can, at any point, save the state of your machine with a \u201csnapshot\u201d and revert back to that state if you need to. This lets you experiment freely with your environment. If something goes wrong, whether with software installations or by infecting your system with a virus, you can easily switch back to a previous snapshot. There\u2019s no need for constant backups and restores.", "Although there are a number of popular VM programs out there, VirtualBox is completely free, open-source, and awesome. There are, of course, some details like 3D graphics that might not be as good on VirtualBox as they might be on something you pay for. If it\u2019s speed and graphics that you\u2019re after, you might want to check out a paid version.", "I\u2019ve heard that Parallels Desktop is amazing and wildly faster that VirtualBox, but I haven\u2019t actually tried it myself. If you have a favorite, let people know about it in the comments below!", "So what is a virtual machine? It\u2019s a computer file (often referred to as an image) that behaves like an actual computer. It\u2019s like you\u2019re creating a computer within your computer. It runs a lot like any other program, but the virtual machine is separate from the rest of the system. That means that the software inside a virtual machine can\u2019t escape and tamper with your computer. This makes it an ideal spot for testing new releases, examining infected data, creating OS backups and running applications and software on operating systems that they weren\u2019t originally intended for.", "You can even run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on the same computer.", "We\u2019re going to do a simple walkthrough of the absolute basics you need to set up VirtualBox with the extension pack and run Windows 10. This is only one way to set things up. You can have a lot more fun from here if you\u2019re interested!", "The programs we\u2019re going to use are completely free and we have permission to use them. (I\u2019m putting that out there because things can get pretty slippery as you get closer to the world of hacking.) We\u2019ll head over to Oracle to grab VirtualBox and the VirtualBox extension pack.

It\u2019s designed and released by Microsoft specifically for testing purposes. Make sure you choose \u201cMSEdge on Win10 (x64) Stable 1809\u201d if you want to run Windows 10 and \u201cVirtualBox\u201d under \u201cSelect platform.\u201d Then click the \u201cDownload .zip\u201d button!", "***Update*** This is a totally free version of Windows 10, but you don\u2019t have unlimited and unrestricted use of this software.

You can make a copy and use it to reinstall the software no problem after your 90 days are up (that\u2019s specified right in the official documentation. Please make a copy for this purpose if you would like to continue using this software after 90 days), but this is not a full version of Windows 10 that\u2019s available for free forever without any restrictions. This is a legally available free version of Windows 10 provided by Microsoft that you can use for limited purposes for a limited time and quickly and easily reinstall any time, either from the website or from your backup copy.", "This is, of course, not the only way to install Windows 10 on VirtualBox. It\u2019s just an incredibly quick and convenient way for beginners and developers to access and test much of what Windows 10 has to offer.", "Please refer to the official documentation for clarification.", "It also makes sense to download The Unarchiver. It\u2019s a quick, free, and powerful way to open these files. It\u2019s also recommended in Microsoft\u2019s official documentation. You don\u2019t need to use it to open VirtualBox or the extension pack, but it\u2019s a good idea to use an app like this one to extract the Windows 10 download.", "Once your downloads are ready, head over to your downloads folder. Right-click the VirtualBox icon and go to \u201cOpen with\u201d and click on \u201cThe Unarchiver.\u201d This will unzip and open your file.", "You can install VirtualBox just like you would any program or application right into your Applications folder. Of course, you can change the location if you want to. Then follow the installer prompts.", "Next, go to your Applications folder (or to the location you specified for VirtualBox) and double click the icon to open it.", "You can open and install your extension pack the same way as you did for VirtualBox. When you start your installation, you\u2019ll see a popup window that lets you know what you\u2019re installing. Click \u201cInstall.\u201d", "Now that you have VirtualBox installed, it\u2019s time to create a virtual machine. To do that, you need to have an operating system. We\u2019re going to use our Windows 10 Microsoft download, but you have a lot of options if you get into this!", "Go ahead and open up your Microsoft download with the Unarchiver. Windows is already set up and ready to go if you want to use it as-is. To do that, click \u201cImport.\u201d You can import it as-is and then modify your settings at any time. Go ahead and import it the way it is if you don\u2019t have a different plan in mind.", "Now go to VirtualBox and click \u201cNew.\u201d This will open a wizard that will guide you through installation.", "First, you\u2019re going to want to give your virtual machine a name. Because this is so fun, I strongly recommend giving your virtual machine a very descriptive and straightforward name. They start to look a lot alike after a while and this will save you some serious frustration. Something like \u201cWindows 10\u201d or \u201cMSEdge-Win10\u201d makes a lot of sense.", "If you choose creative names and really get into this, you might have trouble later remembering that \u201cMuffins\u201d is running Windows 10 while \u201cTchotchke\u201d is running Kali Linux and so on.", "Specify the type of operating system you\u2019ll be running (Microsoft Windows) and the version (Windows 10 64 bit) and click \u201cNext.\u201d", "Now you need to set the amount of RAM. You\u2019re specifying how much of your computer\u2019s RAM will go to your virtual machine. VirtualBox automatically lets you know the recommended minimum amount for the OS you selected, but you can increase or decrease this if you want to.", "Remember that you can only go as high as the amount of RAM your system actually has and it\u2019s not a great idea to set it to the maximum amount. There wouldn\u2019t be any left for your regular OS to use while you\u2019re running your virtual machine! Don\u2019t specify more than you can spare, especially if you think you might wind up running multiple VMs at the same time. No matter what, your best bet is to stay in the green section. Otherwise, you\u2019ll probably face some serious performance issues.", "Now you need to create a virtual hard drive. Select an option and click \u201cCreate\u201d and then go through the prompts and click \u201cCreate\u201d again. You do need a virtual hard drive to install your operating system and any other programs.", "The most common format for virtual hard drives is VirtualBox Disk Image (VDI). Make sure that it has at least enough space to install the operating system. Remember that any programs you want to install will also take up space on your virtual hard drive!", "I went ahead and chose \u201cDynamically Allocated\u201d for the storage details, but that might not be the right choice for you. A dynamically allocated file will grow in size as you store data. It starts small, but it will grow. A fixed-size file, on the other hand, will immediately occupy the size you specify. Even though it initially occupies more space, this type of file incurs less overhead. That means that it\u2019s actually slightly faster.", "Click \u201cCreate\u201d to create your new virtual machine! Now you\u2019ll see your new machine listed on the left-hand side of your VirtualBox window.", "It\u2019s time to start the operating system installation! Once your virtual machine has been configured, the installation wizard will close and you\u2019ll be back at the VirtualBox main window.

Once it\u2019s complete, you\u2019re ready to go.", "You are now the proud owner of a Windows machine that\u2019s running right inside of your Mac!", "Make sure you think of your VM as a totally separate computer as you\u2019re setting things up. That will help you avoid getting frustrated. When you\u2019re running your virtual machine, it\u2019s completely separate from your actual computer. You don\u2019t have access to the same files and folders. Even your mouse clicks won\u2019t move back and forth between your computer and your virtual machine unless you set it up that way.", "Double click on your machine on the left-hand side of the VirtualBox screen, or click on your machine and hit \u201cStart\u201d any time you want to run your machine.", "A window will open and you\u2019ll see your brand new Windows machine. It can take a couple of seconds (or minutes) to really get up and running. Take a couple of breaths if it seems a little slow or glitchy at first.", "Once your new Windows machine is running, go ahead and click anywhere in the window to wake it up. It will ask you for your username and password. You can find those any time in the official installation documentation. (Your username is \u201cIEUser\u201d and your password is \u201cPassw0rd!\u201d but you can change that any time in the control panel under \u201cUser Accounts.\u201d)", "When you first boot up your machine, the window is pretty small. You can expand the window the normal way, but it\u2019s unlikely it will resize to fit at first. You can make that happen by selecting \u201cScaled mode\u201d from the view menu. If you want to ignore the aspect ratio, hold down the shift key while you\u2019re resizing your window.", "At first, when you work on your VM, it will \u201cown\u201d both your keyboard and mouse. You can look at the bottom right corner of the window to see the command you need to swich from your virtual machine to your regular OS. You also have the option to move your mouse back and forth between the two by going to Input at the top of your screen while your VM is running and selecting \u201cMouse Integration.\u201d", "After setting up my VM, I needed to quickly grab some files and programs that I had downloaded on my Mac. It was a minor emergency and there wasn\u2019t time for research. This may not be the best way to move your information from your Mac to your Windows machine (and vice versa), but I found that uploading my files into OneDrive was the easiest and fastest workaround for grabbing what I needed from my Mac. It was installed and ready to go on the Windows machine. Signing up for OneDrive is fast and free.", "This is definitely not the only solution, but it\u2019s here if you\u2019re in a hurry. (Dropbox would work just as well, assuming you aren\u2019t having a bit of a storage issue at the moment\u2026)", "VirtualBox lets you copy your virtual machine\u2019s exact state. That allows you to return to that state at any time. This is incredibly useful for testing software or other configurations. You can take a snapshot by clicking the Machine menu and selecting \u201cTake a snapshot.\u201d The snapshot will be added to the list of your virtual machines on the left side of the VirtualBox menu. You can restore a snapshot by right-clicking the snapshot and selecting \u201cRestore.\u201d Any changes to your virtual hard drive since the time you created the snapshot will be lost when you restore the snapshot.", "You have a couple of different options when you close your virtual machine. Each affects the machine a little differently. When you close your virtual machine window, you\u2018ll see several options. You can choose:", "Congratulations!!!
