Like many other Data Scientists, I use both languages frequently and love working with Google Compute Platform (\u201cGCP\u201d). Hope you enjoy the simplicity of my approach, and get some mileage out of this walk-through!", "These GCE machines are highly dynamic, like AWS instances, and work with both Tensor Processing Units(\u201cTPUs\u201d which are ASIC cards recently available on GCP under Beta) and Graphics Processing Units (\u201cGPUs\u201d or \u2018graphics cards\u2019 used in \u2018alt coin\u2019 mining, gaming, and deep learning). This post will not cover automatic TPU installs (perhaps that would be another useful one, when prices come down). We\u2019ll run a simple install of Tensorflow, to check the GPUs are working, for both R and Python after running a bash script which does all of the heavy lifting first.", "Initially, I tried many different walk-throughs related to GCloud and GPUs, and eventually landed on two fantastic posts on Medium, which are referenced here (Durgesh Mankekar) and here (Luuk Derksen). Parts of my automated script are based on the above two posts, and also this useful gist (by Michael Dietz) among countless other sources. However, other posts were either geared more toward Jupyter Notebook setups, or setting up NVIDIA Cuda manually prior to CuDNN drivers, and testing Python only. Frankly, I had difficulty getting the environments setup from other walk-throughs, given many recent changes.", "Therefore, I decided to take a complete automated approach, which doesn\u2019t require signing up with NVIDIA, logins, and downloading a specific driver for a specific operating system. It assumes the user can reproduce the outputs below with one bash script, given the setup of a GCE VM with any current GCloud GPU available (NVIDIA: Tesla K80 or P100), at least 25Gb of HD on an Ubuntu 16.04, and 2+ cores, with a minimum of 7.5Gb of RAM, which we\u2019ll also step through below.", "The below will hopefully allow for multi-user Jupyter Notebook configurations, if set up properly with a shared GPU, and I hope to follow up with another blog which builds on this with RStudio Server (easy to setup in GCloud with password logins) or JupyterLab (not so easy). In addition, it uses Anaconda installs of both R / Python, in the same conda environment, which should support multi-users sharing GPUs.", "We\u2019ll keep this part quite simple, without too many screen shots (\u2018cough!uhuh\u2026\u2019). Google gifts a $300 credit for 12 months, to get started on GCP. You\u2019ll use this allowance to request a GPU quota for a particular region, and apply the credit after the quota is permitted.", "You\u2019ll first need to create a Project; here I\u2019ve created ML-Test from the highlighted links in the photo. Use the + sign to set up a project. You\u2019ll see the projects in the highlighted upper left drop down.", "After you have your project set up, you\u2019ll immediately want to request a quota for GPUs. In fact, it\u2019s likely Google will ask you for a secondary reference project, so just set up another one with the name Project-Placeholder which you\u2019ll use to reference when emailed by Google.", "It takes roughly 24 hours to get an email, and you can reference the amount of credit available for Project-Placeholder by dropping down the \u2018Hamburger Menu\u2019 in the top left, to Billing >> Amount Remaining (for you it will be ~$300.00). The Google folks who got me setup were very friendly, BTW. And politely, if someone from Google is reading this, I think this step could be automated.", "To access the Quota page, you\u2019ll want to first be under ML-Test project, then you\u2019ll drop-down to IAM>>Quotas and edit your GCE to request a quota update for GCE.", "You\u2019ll then click Next (as seen above) after your user info is validated (i.e., Name, Email, and Phone [make sure to use your account email [[ I learned the hard way ]]]). Now type out something similar to the below.", "Submit. And wait. The friendly folks at Google will email you in 24\u201348hrs and hopefully ML-Test will be ready to use GPUs!", "If you want to get set up quickly without GPUs, using Anaconda on GCE with both Python and R, you can check out these notes I created recently from a talk at Pepperdine. However, if you\u2019re only interested in GPUs, and your quotas are approved, then it\u2019s time to launch the VM.", "Once logged into ML-Test, click on the Hamburger-Bar to COMPUTE >> Compute Engine >> VM Instances. From there we\u2019ll click Create.", "You\u2019ll want to config the first few steps to match our minimum requirements before moving on to disk space and OS. You\u2019ll name the VM gpu-vm, and match the minimum highlighted settings below. Note, your quota will likely include us-west1-b, but could include other zones for particular GPU types. If you use a zone where your quota is not supported, the machine will error out \u2014 this hung me up for a while.", "And finally, before launch, and to reproduce, you\u2019ll want to install Ubuntu16.04 by clicking \u201cChange\u201d and an HDD minimum of 25Gb (Note: you may be able to go lower to avoid storage charges, but found this may change environment max storage on install of R in the conda environment).", "Once the OS and storage are selected, then you will launch the VM with theCreate button. Optionally, you may want to consider thePre-Emptible option on this VM once you test this dry-run install. These can save up to 75% on hourly charges. However, they can be shut down after an hour of use, based on other demand, and I have not tested this install on Pre-Emptible mode. I think it is similar to AWS\u2019 Reserve instance opportunity, in terms of cost cutting. See the Pre-Emptible option below, in red, under the \u201cManagement, disks, networking, SSH keys\u201d under the creation menu, but once again, leave it \u201cOff\u201d for now.", "Your machine is launching now, and once it\u2019s ready (30 seconds later), you\u2019ll see gpu-vm with a green check mark.", "Note: you\u2019re now being billed, and will always want to check mark this machine and click STOP when not using. I usually just confirm a machine is turned off, when the green check-mark is turned into grey stop signal.", "Now you\u2019ll click on the SSH button above. This will launch your SSH connection to gpu-vm, and opens up a separate tab to your VM. You can also run your SSH shell by clicking on the left arrow of the SSH button, and accessing via View Gcloud Command like below.", "Click RUN IN CLOUD SHELL and an in line Cloud Shell will insert the above command, hit enter, and you\u2019ll be SSH\u2019ed into your VM. On Windows, this is often better, as the SSH button pops open a floating shell, whereas on Mac, it opens a new tab.", "Note: There is a free cloud shell for use in the upper right of screen under \u201cActivate Google Cloud Shell\u201d button. Another great thing about GCloud, is it\u2019s fully SSH secure all within their environment \u2014 this means no local firewalls and Putty.", "Lets install GPUs with an automatic script", "You should see something like this, but with your own user name before the VM name.", "You\u2019re good to go, and SSH\u2019ed into your GCE. Now you\u2019ll want to copy the complete script below into your command line. It will execute, because NVIDIA\u2019s Cuda is not installed yet in an if statement. If you have any particular questions about any of the lines herein, don\u2019t hesitate to leave a comment and ask. I\u2019d rather not go into the weeds on Cuda \u2014 let\u2019s just say, this makes the process much easier to implement. The script has been tested thoroughly to preserve paths, folders, delete downloaded zips, and manage environments for correct installs based on the abilty to close this machine, and start it up again, without breaking anything!", "Note: This bash script takes roughly 10 minutes and installs Cuda/CuDNN/Tensorflow-GPU/Python/R in one fell swoop!", "Waiting\u2026. If you\u2019re seeing this, then things look good!", "After we run through this once, it won\u2019t need to be ran again, after we stop the VM. In fact, the for loop will prevent us from running it again if we try, given that CUDA is installed in the process. If we\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll see an initial indication that CUDA and GPUs are recognized, along with a time to complete (as highlighted below).", "Now let\u2019s test our tensorflow-gpu install on both R and Python", "First we\u2019ll want to get familiar with the newly created conda environment, which has tensorflow-gpu Python module installed, along with the most current versions of R and Python languages installed in the home directory prog_env (\u2018program environment\u2019).", "To test the GPU\u2019s on Tensorflow in both R and Python, we\u2019ll run through the below code and should get the exact same results as commented out below with # marks.", "For details on using Anaconda with Conda Environments.", "Summary for all those R and Python lovers", "That\u2019s it, we did it! You\u2019ve now got a complete machine you can do GPU deep learning with in both R and Python. Look forward to hear if this post was helpful, and how else you may expand on it. Looking forward to a multi-user environment with logins, linked to GPUs, and pay-by-the-minute pre-emptibility using GCloud.", "Note on DataLab Notebooks: With GCP\u2019s newer product DataLab, a single user GCE, using a custom Jupyter Notebook interface, setup with GPUs, is as easy to get up and running with a single line of code. Unfortunately, aside from only being single-user, it also does not ship with an R kernel for connecting to GPUs and Tensorflow through the Jupyter interface; it also requires all interaction be ran through the notebook and not the command line, given it\u2019s Docker configuration. For an excellent walkthrough of setting up a GPU enabled DataLab GCE notebook quickly, see this article posted by Kaz Sato (you can right click translate from Japanese to English in Chrome, if needed [for the most part \u6b21\u306b\u5909\u66f4 ]).", "Your home for data science.
