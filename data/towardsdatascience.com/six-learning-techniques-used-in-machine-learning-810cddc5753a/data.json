In 1950, Alan Turing created the Turning Test. It was a test for computers to see if a machine can convince a human it is a human and not a computer. Soon after that, in 1952, Arthur Samuel designed the first computer program where a computer can learn as it ran. This program was a checker game, where the computer learned the player\u2019s patterns during the match, and then use this knowledge to improve the computer\u2019s next moves. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence where the application will automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.", "Since then, machine learning techniques had advanced rapidly and are now used in different applications. Machine learning has especially seen a massive development with the increase in the amount of data that computers need to handle daily. Machine learning is mainly the result of analyzing ever-increasing amounts of information, that is, the underlying algorithms don\u2019t change, but the approach of which the code is implemented internally will change slightly to adapt to that increase in the amount of data. Machine learning techniques can be vaguely categorized based on the fundamental algorithms in three general categories: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.", "In supervised learning algorithms, the computer learns by example. The programmer provides the algorithm with a known dataset that features desired inputs and outputs. The algorithm must find a way to attain those outputs from the given inputs.", "In unsupervised learning algorithms, the computer learns by exploring and analyzing data to spot patterns. There are no established answer keys or a developer to deliver instructions. Instead, the algorithm determines the correlations and relationships binding the available data.", "In reinforcement learning algorithms, the algorithm is supplied with a set of actions, parameters, and end values. By defining these associations, the algorithm tries to explore different options and possibilities, monitoring and evaluating each result to work out which one is ideal.", "However, researchers have been working on building more optimized and efficient approaches of the above three algorithms in order to keep up with the growth of data needed to be analyzed. This article will cover six learning techniques that make training machine learning models faster and more efficient. The approach we will discuss is Patch Learning, Active Learning, Online Learning, Transfer Learning, Federated Learning, and Enable Learning.", "Patch Learning (PL) is an approach to increase the ability of a machine-learning algorithm to learn by optimizing its performance. In Patch Learning, they train a complex general model using a specific data set to generate points in the input dataset that causes the model to produce the wrong results. Afterward, the false results and the sections of the data set causing it are used to form simple models for each error section. These simple models are then connected in series or parallel to enhance the performance of the overall algorithm by reducing the error percentage.", "The complexity of Patch Learning lies in the number of patch models needed to obtain the best results. Researchers usually try different numbers of patch models and observe which number corresponds to the least amount of overall error. The process of choosing the number of patch models is usually a trade-off process; if the number is high, then the model is super complicated, however, if it was too small, then the error rate is high. An acceptable number of patches is one with error rate without being too big is the ideal option.", "In Online Learning (OL), the date used to train the model is available online and is frequently updated. Using Online Learning models, you\u2019re allowed to create precisely one set of reference data. After that, the algorithm updates its data and approach to Learning by getting information online. Hence, these algorithms are typically much faster than batch learning, since most batch learning algorithms contain a multi-pass process over the same dataset. Since the model doesn\u2019t reconsider previous datasets, old datasets don\u2019t need to be stored, so this approach is faster and more memory efficient.", "The E-commerce and social networking industry widely employ online Learning algorithms. The reason for that is its speed of Learning and its ability to capture any recent trends in no time.", "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning algorithm, enabling the use of training from large areas of decentralized data existing on devices like mobile phones and personal laptops. Big companies like Google often use federated Learning; the models are trained by collecting data from user interaction with mobile devices.", "The use of Federated Learning algorithms generates smarter models with low latency and power consumption while ensuring privacy. Moreover, the enhanced model \u2014 the one built based on specific user interaction \u2014 can be used immediately on that user\u2019s device. So, this approach is not just more efficient, its also customizable for each user based on their own experience preferences.one.", "Transfer Learning (TL) is a machine learning technique were the model transfers the knowledge of a previous, yet related data to the Learning of a new target task. The goal of using this approach of Learning is to make machine learning as efficient as human Learning. There are three ways that Transfer Learning can improve machine learning processes.", "Transfer Learning algorithm involves expanding well-known classification and inference algorithms like neural networks, Bayesian networks, and Markov Logic networks to be more efficient and adaptable. It can also be used in reinforcement learning by extending algorithms like Q-learning and policy search.", "In Active Learning, the algorithm is encouraged to be \u201ccurious\u201d by allowing it to choose the datasets it wants to learn from. Researchers believe that by enabling the model to select its own training data, it will learn faster and hence perform better.", "Active learning models try to overcome the labeling bottleneck by asking for \u201cqueries\u201d in the shape of unlabeled instances to be labeled by an \u201coracle\u201d(a human annotator). This way, the Active Learning model aims to attain high accuracy using as few labeled instances as possible. Active Learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems where data is also sufficient, but labels are difficult or expensive to obtain.", "There are various ways the Active Learning model forms and labels queries; three of the most common ones are:", "Ensemble Learning applies a \u201cbase learning model\u201d multiple times to different datasets and then analyzes the distinct resultant hypothesis. This could be done using one of two ways:", "These six learning techniques are not the only approaches we apply machine learning algorithms. Since the field is quite active, recent developments are always proposed by researchers. Despite that fact, all proposals aim towards the same goal, an algorithm that is fast, efficient with low or no error.", "[3] McMahan, H.
