Back at NYU, I came across a case study about the founder, Thomas Tull, and his effort to incorporate advanced data analysis into the decision to choose which film ideas were worth splashing millions of dollars on and how to bring them to market cost-effectively. I never thought I would one day be a part of it. I knew the insights I would deliver to the company\u2019s producers and marketers were being sourced from hard work and sharp minds of quantitative analysts, engineers, and researchers in Boston, but I knew little about computer programming, advanced statistics, or the sheer extent of valuable data being generated that could unlock opportunity for a company often taking huge financial risks on creative intuition.", "I was simply happy to be there and to be a part of making amazing content, but my fascination with our team\u2019s capabilities made me realize I had only been exposed to the tip of the iceberg. I had to keep learning. In the Fall of 2018, I decided to take an online course to see if data science was something I wanted to pursue more seriously. It is. I left my role at Legendary a few weeks ago and have since been studying full-time at Flatiron School\u2019s Data Science Immersive Bootcamp in Seattle, where I write to you from today.", "Embracing the risk of leaving a good job for more education has given me the freedom to think beyond my past in crafting a future. If only for a brief moment, my support system and good luck have granted me the privilege to cast aside a mindset of paying bills for one that allows me to think more deeply about what motivates me, both intrinsically and extrinsically. I hope to use this platform to communicate a simplified version of my conclusions about myself and my reflections about the world I\u2019ll be rejoining with a new toolbox after the boot camp. To be clear, this article is non-technical, exploratory brainstorm at the intersection of motivation, business, culture, and my enthusiasm for data science.", "I was able to simplify my current central motivations down to four main areas, visualized below in no particular order. With a bit of self-examination, I realized these driving forces were relevant to my choices before I ever knew what data science entailed, and I hope each sticks with me in a significant way going forward.", "To be direct, I am passionate about using my abilities to empower artistic endeavors. I know that I want to have a positive impact on people and the world. I love to travel, and I want to keep traveling. I want to eventually own a home. The why behind each of these factors could lead to a personal, exciting, and likely endless conversation (which I\u2019m happy to have with anyone interested). For now, I will stick to attempting to understand how these motivations come in contact with a tougher reality, and why I think data science will provide a great toolkit to make progress on some of these aspirations. I will always have more questions than answers, but I invite you all to join the conversation as I ruminate on a few different topics directly or loosely related to my trajectory.", "\u201cEvery man lives in two realms: the internal and the external. The internal is that realm of spiritual ends expressed in art, literature, morals, and religion. The external is that complex of devices, techniques, mechanisms, and instrumentalities by means of which we live.\u201d", "My fascination with art, creative culture, and the creative economy has provided me with the pretext to consider more interesting ideas, visit more interesting places, and meet more interesting people than I would have without it. I believe that film, music, painting, language, and other forms of personal expression have a more unique importance to the history of human progress than meets the eye, and I decided a long time ago that I would utilize my abilities to empower the artists and thinkers I consider great. Economics doesn\u2019t always favor the artist, but I do think technology has the potential to democratize creative career-building.", "With the rise of organizations that reduce entry barriers of premium creative production and guide delivery to mass audiences like YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix, and given the recent efforts of organizations like Etsy, Patreon, and crowdfunding platforms Kickstarter and Indiegogo \u2014 a world where creative ability and independent resourcefulness is more definitively correlated to financial well-being is being crafted before our eyes. Super devices are lowering the cost to scale production, and award-winning films are being created with smartphones (Tangerine (2015) \u2014 IMDb). The internet is making it easier to find audiences that are willing to pay for great content (Patreon). Blockchain has the potential to cut out margin-sharing intermediaries (Blockchain & Media \u2014 MIT Sloan Review). Hollywood talent agencies are now viewing analytics as a core strategy in understanding consumer appetite (Parrot Analytics signs CAA). A dynamic where more of the money spent on consuming creativity is being directly funneled to the artist\u2019s pocket is tangible.", "The concept of \u201cthe struggling artist\u201d will not be eliminated overnight, but more people with lesser resources have a greater shot at putting that notion to rest. The key organizations with either an explicit or implicit commitment, reliance, or simply an openness to the cultural significance of new media content will need data scientists to help guide their decision making in countless functional areas going forward. Whether you think similarly or differently, let\u2019s keep the conversation going. I\u2019d love to hear your vision for technology-empowered creativity, and your thoughts on where the creative economy is headed.", "\u201cWe obsess over our emails, Instagram likes, and Facebook feeds; we binge on TV episodes and YouTube videos; we work longer hours each year, and we spend an average of three hours each day using our smartphones. Half of us would rather suffer a broken bone than a broken phone, and Millennial kids spend so much time in front of screens that they struggle to interact with real, live humans.\u201d", "\u2014 Adam Alter\u2019s Irresistible about the rise of addictive technology", "Are financial obligation and ethical behavior mutually exclusive? Do Big Tech\u2019s complicated, legal jargon-filled Terms of Service agreements serve as adequate transparency about data privacy? Technological progress will continue to demand self-regulation, at least while the old guys in Washington D.C. (namely, Senator Hatch) are still asking questions of Mark Zuckerberg wondering how he sustains a business model in which users don\u2019t pay for the service. If you were wondering, they run ads. Zuck\u2019s response was nothing short of a thoughtful elaboration on the topic: \u201cSenator, we run ads.\u201d", "Most devices and apps we use are designed to maximize our engagement and, in many cases, attract our discretionary spending. Thought leaders warn that we have approached dangerous territory. As a user, I am certainly guilty of the types of behaviors I warn about. As a future data scientist, I believe Big Data grants enough unregulated power to profit-seeking entities to warrant an honest conversation about ethical data collection and utilization. It\u2019s tough to draw a hard line in the sand for the industry where one use case is clearly okay and another is clearly not. We must decide for ourselves as data collectors where we draw the line. I\u2019m interested to learn more about how other data-centric entrepreneurs and executives are handling that responsibility. In the meantime, let\u2019s remain self-aware and continue self-regulating, both as data scientists and consumers.", "\u201cThe transformation we need requires us to acknowledge that everyone is a development actor\u2026All stakeholders, big or small should find a place to play their role and make their contribution.\u201d", "\u2014 United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed", "I have always wanted to use my skills and circumstances to help others, especially those existing in a more troubling reality. I attribute most of my blessings to two loving parents who managed to dig themselves out of a small industrial town near Liverpool, England that consistently appears in the UK\u2019s Crap Towns book series and apparently stirred Paul Simon to write Homeward Bound. After visiting myself, it\u2019s obvious why my parents worked hard to build a new life in California. I\u2019m lucky. With such luck comes with a desire to pay it forward, and I believe a data scientist\u2019s toolkit provides me with a real opportunity to up my impact.", "I\u2019ve often referred to the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals as a guide to orient myself to the world\u2019s most pressing needs and opportunities for those with skills in big data to get involved. Poverty, hunger, clean water, and basic human rights are the issues that compel me to act in earnest towards the SDGs alongside an increasing number of mission-driven institutions, NGOs, private enterprises that drive both impact and profit in a sustainable way, and data scientist-armed organizations like DataKind that connect people with the skills I\u2019m now learning to the right projects. In crafting a fulfilling life and career, this is no longer something I feel comfortable delaying. That said, the desire to change the world for the better is easier to pontificate about on a blog than to put into action. How should we prioritize humanity\u2019s most pressing needs? How do we properly measure impact? How must the powers that be incentivize involvement? I\u2019d love to hear more ideas on how you all keep yourself accountable to those worse off while keeping your other goals and engagements in business and technology intact.", "\u201cScientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.\u201d", "\u2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (United Nations) & NASA", "Scientists are in agreement, policymakers are not. Some frank words to help fuel unproductive debates with your crazy uncles and politically-charged friends: Global temperatures are rising. Oceans are warming and becoming more acidic. Sea levels are rising, ice sheets are shrinking, glaciers are retreating, and snow is melting. Extreme weather events are increasing. In late 2018, a congressionally mandated report produced by 13 federal agencies that make up the U.S. Global Change Research Program (incl. the EPA, NASA, the Pentagon, and the US State Department, among others) concluded that human activity is causing climate change and that we are set to do irreparable damage to our planet without calculated intervention. There seems to be an endless list of doomsday-related climate factoids at our fingertips to fashionably share on social media, and although I\u2019m not a climate scientist, I believe the time for debate has passed. Swift action is paramount. Data science can help. I\u2019ll keep studying.", "Science, in general, is the most vetted, trusted field of study we have to measure and understand our place on Earth. I believe in the humanities, and although I like to think healthy skepticism is often warranted, we have not yet discovered a more compelling source of evidence-based authority than science. That said, we\u2019re in a fragile moment, where even scientists are being accused of dishonesty. How dangerous is political action and rhetoric divorced from science? When do scientific discoveries become fact, and why has it become so easy to deny science? How do we emerge from this moment of deep institutional distrust? How can big data help? I have more questions than answers, but I welcome your thoughts in a respectful, continued conversation.", "I admit, like many millennials, I don\u2019t want to separate my passions and values from my work. Of course, like my heroes, I want to make the world a better place and save it from all its apparent defects. No matter how many times I quote Lao Tzu to friends, I have a lot of desires, some of which are admittedly material. I want to make my own money to then spend that money on travel and, eventually and with continued luck, real estate. That said, I\u2019m writing these very words on a MacBook while sipping a $3 cup of coffee. I\u2019ve never been drafted into the armed forces, nor have I witnessed war. I grew up in a safe home in a safe neighborhood. My parents made sure I didn\u2019t miss a meal. I\u2019ve had the privilege of dreaming big and failing often. Being idealistic doesn\u2019t always pay the bills, but the two are not mutually exclusive. I am in equal parts ambitious, lucky, and grateful.", "Despite my many blessings and like my peers, I am also saddled with a ridiculous mound of student debt. The only people I know under the age of 30 that have managed to remain hopeful in paying down the costs of a college education while saving for a house are friends that sacrificed a lot to land a job on Wall Street out of college to then sleeplessly toil for 80+ hours a week for many years. Home ownership is not something my age group, on average, expects to reasonably accomplish before we get bad knees and gray hair. The old American Dream may have become a bit of a pipe dream.", "That said, I\u2019m optimistic about the democratization of education that technology can bring. I\u2019m a big proponent of online courses and degrees (ex. EdX), boot camp-style professional education (shout out to Flatiron School), and rewarding collaboration-inspired educators like the premium content and resource producers they truly are (ex. Teachers Pay Teachers). I hope that some of these innovations can restore some hope. Subject variety and inclusiveness must remain central to society\u2019s education-based progress. Education is a human right, and we should celebrate a diversity of discipline and perspective at all grade levels. Most importantly, educators and students alike must be prioritized, not preyed upon, in the pursuit of education-related innovations in both the public and private sector.", "The last reason I decided to learn data science is in equal parts the most important and the least charming. It\u2019s a skill in demand, and demand currently outweighs supply (hopefully, through July!) The opportunity to potentially become indispensable to a high-growth organization could give me some additional peace of mind on my path to eliminate student debt, and my costly ambitions to travel and eventually own a home. To those drowning in student debt, what is your strategy to free yourself? Teachers and students \u2014 what trends in education or EduTech give you hope, if any? To those who beat student debt, what strategies worked for you? What did you sacrifice in the process?", "There aren\u2019t an abundance of professions that seem to cater to my seemingly endless list of interests and questions, but my pursuit of a data science skillset allows me to be decisively indecisive. Beyond the technical skill set, the best data scientists seem to have a few different personality traits that allow for powerful, interesting projects in a wide variety of sectors.", "Data scientists must ask the right questions. What knowledge does the organization need to be confident in its strategic path, to understand their customers, to optimize costs and processes, and to find new opportunities? Data Scientists must marry a deep technical skillset with domain expertise and context in order to extract real value from raw data. That said, it seems data scientists can become valuable in many industries and research areas, and those already established in the field seem to have encouraged a nimble, pivot-friendly culture for both generalists and specialists.", "Data scientists must also have passion. The best solutions only arrive with determination, and I believe life is more fun when intrinsic motivation fuels a bigger chunk of your daily outward effort than coffee. Without strong direction and a dose of perfectionist qualities, data scientists may be prone to stopping short of finding the most optimal way forward. However, effective data scientists are aware of when to stop analyzing and when to start deploying insights, crafting recommendations, solving problems, and inspiring action.", "Data scientists must be curious. There are often many unique ways to approach a problem, and a good data scientist must consider alternatives often. I find it consistently beneficial to ask myself if there are better ways to acquire, clean, and merge data than the method I\u2019m currently employing. It requires both process and creativity to be effective. It demands that you exercise your analytical, left brain to complete tasks and projects, and thereafter, to step outside, smell the roses, and be creative about where you can effectively apply your efforts next. The work equally benefits from an autonomous, distraction-free approach, and a productively critical team dialogue. Programming alongside a colleague in a driver-navigator format has a compounding effect on productivity. It\u2019s built for the curious and open-minded, as the field itself is always changing as new innovations get adopted. A good data scientist must be aware of the latest news stories and advances, and up-skill in lockstep.", "Tied to the idea of unrelenting curiosity comes an important acknowledgment that not every problem can be solved with data. Certain aspects of a decision must be left to human intuition. Data should be used to inform a decision and improve a prediction, but there are times when it should not be held as eternal truth. It is fallible and has its limits. It\u2019s often an art as much as it is a science. Sometimes models are stale. Sometimes business environments change. Sometimes predictions fall victim to bias, variance, or the data community\u2019s least favorite variable: the idea of \u201cirreducible error\u201d. Confidence in a prediction will never reach 100%, and nobody can truly know the future. We can only improve how we go about navigating the unknown by taking full advantage of what\u2019s known.", "More powerful than the pursuit of new knowledge is the recognition that there will always be so much we cannot know. I\u2019m learning to accept this in business, in life, and move forward in spite of it. I don\u2019t know if my dreams, my plans, and my skills will all come together to form the perfect cocktail of data science, joy, success, and fulfillment, but I do know that I\u2019ve never regretted a calculated, education-first risk that puts me outside of my comfort zone. The most impactful experiences I\u2019ve had have been stationed in such environments. The more I learn, the more I realize, with increasing certainty, there\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know and so much left to discover. That said, let\u2019s stay curious together. Let\u2019s keep learning and improving together.", "Stay tuned as I move forward from here with increasingly technical posts as I dive further into data science. I encourage you all to like, comment, share, or message me directly with your thoughts on the ideas presented here, or suggestions on interesting topics I should look into going forward.", "Your home for data science.
