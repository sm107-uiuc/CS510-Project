Yann LeCun himself named GANs the \u201ccoolest thing since sliced bread\u201d [1].", "These architectures are being applied to a huge range of problems. Finding success in applications from dark matter research [2], to interior design [3].", "Seeing this breadth of fascinating applications, the desire to research and develop GANs has been itching at the back of my mind for a long time. Recently, I gave in and decided it was time to dive in.", "I learned very quickly that GANs are not easily tamed. Because of this, I have a fresh experience with many misconceptions and mistakes that are common when first diving into the world of GANs.", "The mistakes I learned from I have summarized in this article, these can be the difference between failure and success in GAN implementation and convergence.", "When pre-processing image data, we should normalize it to between -1 and 1 rather than 0 and 1 [4].", "This also means that our final layer activation in G should be tanh rather than sigmoid.", "Another important thing to note here is that post-generation, don\u2019t forget to multiply values by 127.5 and add 127.5 to return to the original range of 0\u2013255.", "Initially, when my DCGAN (deep convolutional GAN) was struggling with variance in brightness, I figured the generator\u2019s transpose convolutional layers were simply lacking in complexity.", "So, I added more filters. It turns out that this is absolutely the complete opposite of what I should have done.", "Reducing the number of filters allowed the generator to represent the range of values much better.", "Here are some filter-heavy generated MNIST numbers:", "Too many filters pushes generator values to their limits. For tanh this is -1 or +1. Resulting in a lack of convincing generated images.", "Sparse gradients are essentially weak signals. Or, signals with a very low value.", "The problem with these low value signals is that with the many numerical operations being performed on them, they can get smaller and smaller.", "Those of you familiar with RNNs will undoubtedly have come across the vanishing gradient problem. This is exactly the same.", "To fix this, we can add Batch Normalization to our network [5].", "Important to note, batch normalization should occur after s-shaped activations (tanh, sigmoid/logistic), and before non-Gaussian activations (ReLU, LeakyReLU) [5].", "Additionally, use LeakyReLU throughout for both the Generator and Discriminator*[4] \u2014 other than for the final layer, where we use an s-shaped activation function.", "*The original DCGAN uses ReLU activations in the generator, and LeakyReLU in the discriminator [3]", "Sometimes we need to find a better balance between the discriminator and generator.", "Initially, my discriminator was far too quick to learn. Essentially freezing the generator, which was unable to make any progress.", "We can balance this by reducing or increasing the learning rates of both adversaries, allowing our weaker network a little more breathing space.", "The first thing I tried to do was generate these complex art styles. When it didn\u2019t work, I had no idea why. Were the images too complex? Was I pre-processing them correctly? Maybe the problem was with the network, which could be anywhere.", "Because I had built something from scratch, I had no other implementation to compare and benchmark against. In the end, there were several problems throughout the code, but I only identified these by rebuilding it for the MNIST data-set.", "This allows you to see where your results and code diverge from that of others, so problems are much easier to diagnose. Once your network is producing reasonable outputs, you can benchmark the quality against other implementations too.", "So before jumping into some cool, but complex project, have a go with MNIST (or another established data-set) first.", "In the end, GANs are not as wild as they first seem. With the right resources, building our first GAN is a reasonably straightforward process.", "But every mistake-made will improves our knowledge, and takes us one step closer to taming these notoriously difficult architectures.", "I have included a list of resources below that I relied on heavily whilst researching and implementing GANs (in bold). I cannot recommend these enough.", "[2] M. Mustafa, D. Bard, W. Bhimji, Z. Luki\u0107, R. Al-Rfou, J.
