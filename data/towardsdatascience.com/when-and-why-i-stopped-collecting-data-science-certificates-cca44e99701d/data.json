There is a high and increasing demand for them so a new one is released in no time. There are a few reasons why there exists a rich selection of these certificates on many different platforms.", "The introduction seemed like a motivation towards collecting certificates. Actually, yes it is, but to a certain extent.", "I have also started my data science journey with certificates. The first one I took was IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It lays down the basic principles and provides a general, well-structured overview of the field. I have collected a few more certificates and then stopped.", "In this post, I will write about when and why I stopped collecting data science certificates and what I started to do instead.", "Let\u2019s start with, according to my opinion, the downsides of spending lots of time collecting numerous certificates.", "Certificates are good at teaching the basics and getting you familiar with the field. Since data science is an interdisciplinary field and has a broad spectrum, getting a well-structured overview is fundamental to start with.", "However, after gaining a few of them, certificates start to be repetitive. You go over the same principles and practices from different perspectives. The amount of what you learn per time you spend starts to decrease substantially.", "Certificates are usually too general and not diving deep enough. What they cover is superficial. The skills that distinguish you from others lay in those deep areas.", "In order to really \u201clearn\u201d something, you need to be challenged. Going over simple video recordings and completing fairly easy assignments are definitely not challenging you enough.", "One way to challenge yourself is to do projects. For instance, you can try to re-create a machine learning microservice currently in use. It does not have to perfect or flawless. Even if you get close, you will learn a ton of valuable information. Another option is to improve a simple use case or project.", "I\u2019d like to emphasize my point with a tweet from Francois Chollet, founder of Keras, and one of the pioneers in the field of data science.", "He mentions the importance of recreating variations that I think cannot be achieved by obtaining many certificates. Instead, completing projects will help you \u201clearn\u201d deeper and better.", "In my opinion, you should stop collecting certificates after you cover the basics. You may be asking what should we do then?", "Obviously, the first one is to do projects. I\u2019ve already mentioned the importance of projects. If you\u2019d like to get a more detailed overview, I wrote a separate article that lists my 5 reasons to do projects.", "Documentation is your gold! All well-known libraries are well documented and they also provide a user guide. It is extremely helpful to spend time reading those. Even if you are looking for a specific task or operation, you learn more than what you are looking for.", "Read the problems and difficulties faced by other people and how they solve these issues. Stackoverflow and Quora are two common platforms for this purpose. When there is an issue you can\u2019t solve, it is most likely that someone else has encountered the same issue before. You can look for problems and solutions on such platforms.", "Furthermore, you can browse the top questions and try to provide answers which will definitely improve your skillset. I just made a quick search on stackoverflow about Pandas, a prominent python data analysis library. Here is the result:", "Data science is an evolving field. It is also an interdisciplinary field composed of math, statistics, and software. New technologies and tools are being released constantly. Thus, it is important to stay up-to-date. I have two suggestions:", "I have shared my experience and opinions on \u201clearning\u201d in the field of data science. Your learning path and style may, of course, be different. For instance, some prefer reading or watching videos on youtube.", "Whatever path you follow, make sure you challenge yourself.", "Try to create. Start with simple ones and increase the complexity gradually.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
