So, what do you use as a Data Scientist? Can you use something else? Is it a Data Scientist's responsibility? Below, I will be discussing the role of SQL in Data Science, as well as the alternatives to the structured query language.", "You may need to know SQL ultimately depending on your company and Data Science team. Some teams have several Data Engineers and Data Analysts, along with Machine Learning Engineers, while some teams can be composed of just one Data Scientist. You most likely know the answer to this question that is if you need to know SQL as a Data Scientist. However, it is interesting and important to discuss why you do need it, why you do not need it, and when you do not need it. Also, it can be helpful to discs this question for incoming Data Scientists to become familiar with expectations as they enter the workforce. Here is why I use SQL:", "Although Data Science can be seen as this career where you focus solely on Python and R, as well as complex Machine Learning algorithms, it may be difficult to perform your Data Science process as a team without utilizing the benefits of SQL in some way. However, there is still a time when you do not need it completely depending on your specific role in Data Science.", "The time when you can refer to alternative methods is if you have some help from a Data Engineer or Data Analyst for example, as well as other people in similar positions. Additionally, you may find yourself not requiring SQL when the role of SQL querying is simply not a part of your specialized role because you are focusing more on Data Science model development \u2014 like testing various Machine Learning algorithms against one another on data you already received.", "When you already have your dataset queried from either obtaining it from a Data Analyst or Data Engineer, the next improvement on the dataset can be creating new features that are not directly just fields from data tables. For example, if you have, say 10 fields in your dataset, you could develop several new metrics as fields instead by calculating column 1 and column 2 to create a new column 11. One of the more easy places to do this calculation in, other than SQL itself, is in pandas [4]. This library is widely used by both Data Analysts and Data Scientists for good reason.", "With pandas, you are able to perform complex calculations quickly and in just one line of code.", "Sometimes I find it difficult to use SQL for calculations on my data because it visually is laid out in multiple lines (just my opinion).", "Here are some common pandas DataFrame operations to make your dataset feature engineering more convenient.", "As you can see, there are tons of operations that you can apply to your pandas DataFrame. The complete list is here [5].", "I personally find it easier to compute new fields or metrics that will ultimately be used in your Data Science model with pandas. However, some people prefer to perform their calculations in SQL only (it can be more simple perhaps to manage all your fields in one place). The benefit for me is that I do not have to keep appending to a long query so that when I do want to add a new feature, it is quite simple and effective.", "Does a Data Scientist need to know SQL? The answer is both yes and no. It depends on your company, team, and sometimes your preferences. You can benefit from being able to query yourself with SQL, and if you do not know it, you can learn. If you prefer alternative methods like pandas for example, then you might find yourself on a bigger Data Science team. Some Data Scientists perform both SQL and Python pandas to create their ultimate dataset for their respective models as well. The most unique part of pandas is that there is a query operation that acts like SQL, so you can have a mix of both methods within your pandas DataFrame.", "Here is my article that discusses the pandas query function if you would like to learn more [7]:", "Feel free to comment down below which method or methods you prefer as a Data Scientist.
