In my opinion, one of the coolest parts of our job is interacting with data, especially when there is visual interaction. At times where we might want to build an interactive application, one of the options available to us is a framework called Dash. Dash is an open source Python framework for building web applications, created and maintained by the people at Plotly. Dash\u2019s web graphics are completely interactive because the framework is built on top of Ploty.js, a JavaScript library written and maintained by Ploty. This means that after importing the Dash framework into a Python file you can build a web application writing strictly in Python with no other languages necessary.", "If you\u2019re new to coding, you might be saying to yourself, \u201cA framework sounds like a library\u2026what\u2019s the difference?\u201d I\u2019m glad you asked!", "\u201cInversion of Control is a key part of what makes a framework different to a library. A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client. A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by subclassing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework\u2019s code then calls your code at these points.\u201d - Martin Fowler -", "The key difference between a library and a framework is that \u201ccontrol\u201d is inverted. When you call a method from a library, you are in control. However, with a framework the control is inverted; the framework calls you. One easy way to think of this concept is the Hollywood Principle - \u201cDon\u2019t call us, we\u2019ll call you.\u201d", "\u201cDash app code is declarative and reactive, which makes it easy to build complex apps that contain many interactive elements.\u201d", "Let\u2019s break that down into simpler terms. Declarative programming is a technique of building computer programs in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result although not how to compute it. This style basically tells you what the program should accomplish but not the specific sequence of steps to follow. The \u201chow\u201d is left up to the program\u2019s interpreter. I\u2019ll make an analogy based on the assumption that you have friends whom possess baking skills. Declarative Programming is like asking your friend to make you a cake. You don\u2019t care how they make it; the process is up to them. One example of a declarative language is SQL, a database query language.", "You can find installation instructions here: https://dash.plot.ly/installation. Since you\u2019ll be working in Python, you will just have to learn some syntax with regards to writing Dash apps. A loosely defined format would go something like this: 1) Import your necessary frameworks and libraries. 2) Provide the layout, including inputs and outputs. 3) Provide how your application is going to interact with the user.", "The first two examples are fairly simple applications, written in 43 and 59 lines of code, respectively.", "As we see in the prototype Goldman Sachs report, Dash report applications have the ability to be extremely customized, stylish, and intuitive. Applications can be explorations of human and mice brains in 3-D or an object-detector that provides useful visualizations about what\u2019s happening inside a complex video in real time (example below). The myriad of possibilities is quite amazing.", "Here is a cool example of a Dash application that only took 56 lines:", "I thought this was a cool example because the code snippet included several decorators (which I recently learned about in class) and chained outputs and inputs together such that the output of one callback function was the input of another callback function.", "Dash is a great tool for data scientists to use because it allows you to build the frontend to your analytical Python backend without having to use a separate team of engineers/developers. Because Dash application code is both declarative and reactive, the process of creating rich, easily-sharable, web-based applications that contain many interactive elements is now much easier. I am genuinely exited to start using Dash in my future projects.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Scientist | Data Engineer.
