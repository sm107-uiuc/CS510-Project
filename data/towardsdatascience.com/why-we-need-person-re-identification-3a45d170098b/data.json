Before talking about re-identification it is essential to mention what person identification (tracking) is and how it works. Tracking is what the security people are responsible for with the only difference being that the machines do all the work. Therefore, a computer receives either some pre-recorded videos from surveillance cameras or real-time video and attempts to differentiate people and classify them. With the help of tracking, we can see the shapes of every person in the scene and identify their movements. This is all great but there are several issues with tracking in real-world scenarios...", "While tracking allows us to receive all the trajectories of movement of anyone in the scene and identify one person from another, the issues start to appear when we have multiple cameras. If the same person moves across a shopping mall and, for example, takes off his jacket in-between cameras, he will not be recognized. Different poses, outfits, backpacks, and other details can mess up our model and recognize the same person as two different ones.", "Re-identification(reID) is the process of associating images or videos of the same person taken from different angles and cameras. The key to the issue is to find features that represent a person. Many of the recent models use deeply learned models to extract features and achieve good performance. Certain state-of-art methods are proposed based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), due to its powerful feature learning abilities and fitting capacity.", "According to the research done by Xiong et al.[3], there are several ways to build an accurate CNN model or improve the existing one. These ways were tested on different re-identification methods and are considered to be generally successful. Let\u2019s take a brief look at these practices since they can help us define what a good re-identification model should look like.", "It is a rather technical concept, so in general, we are trying to prevent overfitting during training. Overfitting is when we optimize too much for one dataset and the other examples would become inaccurate because of that.", "In batch normalization, we aim to normalize the output of each neuron using mini-tach mean and variance. Because of that certain features during training are generalized, which allows us to apply the same model on different datasets.", "In a CNN there usually are two fully-connected layers. The first one plays the role of a \u201cbottleneck\u201d to reduce feature dimensions. The second layer performs identity categorization.", "The authors suggest removing the \u201cbottleneck\u201d layer since it has shown to decrease performance and use the second layer directly. Additionally, it further helps prevent overfitting.", "Adam is a rather recently proposed optimization method for the stochastic objective function. Compared to the most popular used SGD, Adam works on lower-order moments, which allows us to smooth the variation between gradients. As you might have thought, it also helps prevent overfitting and alleviate disturbance to the pre-trained model.", "The most typical scenario where it is used is some type of video surveillance. When multiple cameras are located around a shopping mall, parking lot, university, or any other location and we want to ensure security. By using re-identification and tracking models, we are able to follow the path that a person is taking and make sure nothing illegal or inappropriate is done. The only concern for such systems would be privacy, but the surveillance in public places is already functional and active, so adding person tracking would not change the situation.", "Additionally, vehicles and other objects could be tracked. In this way, the road situation can be analyzed and further improved.", "If the power of computers is used wisely and in a timely manner, crimes and other illegal actions can be prevented and the offenders could be easily tracked. Even though the development of such models is still in progress, their improvement is incredibly impressive and applications are wide.", "Here are some popular projects in the field for everyone who understands Python:", "[4] CCTV pedestrian recognition and tracking technology by Accuware (2017).
