Reproduce-ability is hard and often the transition from the development of the best models and shifting it to production gets messy and delayed.", "The reason being that every new model requires changes in the production code since now your server needs to point at the new model and iterating quickly while also maintaining the audit trail becomes a challenging task. This is where mlflow comes in. From tracking model parameters, metrics and artifacts to shipping your code as a project to be run on other systems as well as serving models Mlflow does it all.", "Note: For installation of mlflow follow the docs", "Let's start with tracking module and setup our tracking server. To setup our tracking server we first need to create a database. Simply open the mysql command prompt and execute the following query", "Now you have the database to track your machine learning model results, parameters and models. The database will store the metrics, parameters and other meta related info. For the files or artifacts produced during runs we will use file based storage and specify the path in the command below to find these runs in the tracking server.", "The --backend-sotre-uri specifies the uri for the database where we need to track our mlflow runs and --default-artifact-root specifies the path where model files and other artifacts are stored.", "Your tracking server should be up and running now. To verify if its correctly setup just go to http://localhost:8000 and you will see the mlflow ui.", "Lets now train a couple of models and log them using the server we just created.", "We can either run this script multiple times or another script and all our runs will be recorded to the tracking server that we just setup. After multiple iterations and trying different techniques we can then compare the runs that we have tracked on the tracking server. The advantage of this tracking server is that multiple teams within the same network can track their runs in a centralized way and everyone can collaborate more effectively and efficiently.", "After comparing the runs in the mlflow UI all we need to do identify the run id of the best model and serve it using the mlflow models feature. This will set up a web-server allowing you to send POST requests to get predictions from your model.", "-m flag specifies the model uri. You can also pass other flags according to your requirement. For instance --no-conda will allow you to run your model in the same environment instead of creating a new. You can learn more about serving mlflow models here", "Note: mlflow models serve is only available on Linux it is not yet supported on windows.", "Now to test our mlflow model server all we need to do is send a POST request. I will do this using POSTMAN.", "And as expected I get a response from the mlflow model server specifying the price. I hope this article will get you started quickly on mlflow and how you can use it in production.", "Personally I think mlflow makes the developement cycle a lot easier for machine learning models. Its very intuitive and also has a growing community to help you whenever you get stuck. Mlflow has still a lot to offer and I encourage you to explore it further.", "Your home for data science.
