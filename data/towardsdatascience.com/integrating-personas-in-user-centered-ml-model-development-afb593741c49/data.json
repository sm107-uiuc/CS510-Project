And yes, amassing a large data set is fundamentally important in building an effective ML model, but yet again it misses some more fundamental challenges in developing ML products:", "In my last article and in my PyGotham talk, I argued that the best way to ground the model in the problem domain is to radically keep the user front-and-center in the entire development lifecycle. As it turns out, the field of User-Centered Design has been advocating for this thinking for the past couple of decades.", "Central to the discipline of user-centered research are Personas, which are fictitious representations of real users that inform our development work. Developed by programmer Alan Cooper in the \u201980s, Personas:", "When the whole team internalizes the personas, it helps focus their work. They can now refer to users by name, considering whether each product feature, or machine learning capability they develop will impact their customer personally.", "Personas, in short, animate our customer and put them first in every product- (and data-) decision that we make.", "Imagine a scene playing out in the engineering team at AcmeWidgets.com, where our team is developing a recommendation system for the e-commerce retailer to surface relevant items on product pages. To do this, a skilled team of ML engineers and data scientists are gathered to build the system.", "The team begins by defining an objective function for their model. In this case, the team decides to choose a function that maximizes shopping cart value (our objective function). For example, it may discover that users have a propensity to splurge on a set of high-ticket-value items in our catalog.", "However, things soon go awry. The team notices that their model ends up making low-quality recommendations that sacrifice long-term customer retention for short-term boosts in average order value. The team discovers that their model ends up pushing customers to purchase items that they don\u2019t really want or need, decreasing the long-term loyalty of the customer to the product and the business. In fact, the products that the recommendation engine suggests end up being returned at a far higher rate, incurring operating expenses and costs for the business.", "Well surely that\u2019s just a matter of tweaking the model! The team goes back to the drawing board and this time launches a model that changes the objective function of the model to minimize the return rate of its products. The model is tested and voila, the system is again chugging along happily again. Users seem to be happy with their purchases\u2026", "\u2026until three months down the line, when they discover that users that interact with this recommendation engine are actually churning and leaving the product at far higher rates than those who do not see the recommendations! As it turns out, these recommendations have upset and angered users so much that they do not even bother returning.", "And so the team goes back to the drawing board, dejected and feeling a sense of foreboding of what else they might find in the next iteration of their project.", "If we went back and sat down with the team at their project retrospective, we might have heard reflections like:", "Of course, many of these things can only be learned from experience! But could there have been a better way forward for the project?", "The key issue is that team was only thinking at the tactical level. They thought \u2014 \u201coh, a recommendation engine should be simple. We\u2019ll just pull in Architecture X for our model, train against objective Y and ship it when we can attain model performance Z\u201d.", "ML practitioners will often tell you that a great ML system blends domain expertise and expert intuition. What this means is that ML models must be designed with team members who have deep understanding with the business domain, a deep familiarity of the data set, and a deep intuition of the customer\u2019s needs.", "How do you get domain expertise? Well, you have to have the right people embedded on the team, solving the right problems, considering the customer at all points in the model development process. How might having user personas have helped us avert this situation?", "Imagine that the team, back in the beginning, agreed to consider their customers as living, breathing people in the real world. In fact, their UX colleague did a set of customer interviews that resulted in a set of composite sketches of their customers:", "Luke is a 31-year old man living in Indianapolis and works as an office admin for a small fulfillment business", "Luke needs to keep widgets stocked in the office for the employees to use. Given that the office runs out of widgets regularly, he needs to keep them stocked every couple of weeks. He dreads having to log back in to the web site to place another order since he finds it tedious.", "Seamless, regular order re-fulfillment for the same SKU", "Harmony is a 27-year old woman who lives in Boston and runs an event-planning business that is just getting off the ground. She loves to supply Acme Widgets at her events because they are loved by the guests and provide her business the visibility she needs.", "Harmony has dreams to build an event-planning empire in her city", "Unique, hard-to-find, desirable widgets to make her business stand out", "Tianqi is a remote freelancer who lives in Shanghai, who enjoys his work-from-home flexibility because it allows him to do childcare for his family while his partner works full-time.", "Tianqi wants an ordered, efficient home life on a shoestring budget", "Buy what he wants at a budget price.", "The reason we might want to consider personas is so we can firsthand understand our customers\u2019 goals and motivations. Harmony wants to discover unique items that pop. Luke just wants to fulfill a recurring order for the office. Tianqi wants the cheapest items, period.", "The team, when considering their recommendation algorithm, should be actively referring to Harmony, Luke and Tianqi by name as they develop their model -", "TEAMMATE 1: If we choose to use the collaborative filtering model, we have to consider the fact that we have a very small sample size of users who match up to Luke\u2019s use case (power fulfiller). I\u2019m worried that Luke\u2019s cohort is just going to see a lot of garbage recommendations before any meaningful signal emerges, and get turned off by our product.", "TEAMMATE 2: Yeah, that\u2019s true. But we know that Harmony\u2019s cohort accounts for over 75% of our sales. There\u2019s lots of opportunity here. What if we went with a bandit approach? That should hopefully minimize the number of bad recommendations that get out in front of our users.", "TEAMMATE 1: Not a bad idea. We could learn pretty quickly given the scale that we operate at, and we\u2019d minimize the amount of time we serve bad recommendations to Luke\u2019s cohort.", "Or consider another scenario in the development process, where the team has to grapple with negative interactions with the recommender in the wild:", "TEAMMATE 1: We\u2019ve received some customer feedback on Twitter that our products are too expensive. Apparently some customers feel like they were duped into purchasing items they didn\u2019t need \u2014 the Tianqi cohort. How can we be sure that folks are truly receiving valuable and worthy recommendations?", "TEAMMATE 2: Why don\u2019t they feel like their items are valuable?", "TEAMMATE 1: For some reason, our recommendation system is creating some sort of buyers\u2019 regret. We might be over-hyping some of our promotions, or we may be pushing some items that have had quality issues.", "TEAMMATE 2: Let me start a conversation with Juli, our UX designer, to see if there\u2019s some sort of user research that would confirm or validate this hypothesis. And if there\u2019s some sort of feature we need to re-incorporate into our model to make sure we\u2019re making truly high-quality recommendations, let\u2019s incorporate it. Else if our recommendations aren\u2019t up to snuff, let\u2019s test a new model variant where we don\u2019t show any results at all.", "See? That\u2019s the kind of holistic, customer-centric conversation we want to build into the team\u2019s natural modus operandi. And all those things are enabled by customer personas.", "In my days working at startups, we\u2019d often take our customer personas and print them out and post them up on the walls for the team to see. When the team sees the customer in living color, they are reminded of who they are solving the problem for. Should the team fall into the rabbit hole of only ever discussing deep technical details of feature engineering issues, precision-recall curves and accuracy metrics, having reminders of your customers in the room will help contextualize the ML product to the actual customer problem you\u2019re solving.", "Personas are powerful \u2014 but they\u2019re not a silver bullet. What personas help us do is imagine our customers as real people, with real goals, motivations and frustrations. When we define our customers, we give ourselves a vocabulary to discuss them as first-class citizens to then orient our technical solutions around.", "Oh \u2014 and by the way, the People & AI Research (PAIR) team at Google has done far more thinking about the process of designing human-centered AI products. Have a read through their best practices guide to learn from their deep experience building ML products.", "What do you think? Do you have experience building ML models in customer-centric ways?
