It wasn\u2019t until I had worked with python for about a year that I started profoundly worrying about my python skills (I have some people to thank for that, shoutout to Tom\u00e1s Moyano, Daniel Monta\u00f1o and Eric Morfa Morales for their critique of me as a developer, it highly helped me improve!).", "So I wanted to share my experience about what were the tips that helped me improve the fastest over my last two years as a data scientist, but also as a developer.", "\u201cWhat one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months.\u201d", "Most people who begin will get told \u201cworry about git later, first start by writing good code\u201d or \u201cuse the terminal at the beginning, that\u2019s how the true pros do it\u201d. I totally disagree with that, because my personal experience tells me otherwise\u2026 even though it is also paradoxically true that the first rule of creating any kind of content is \u201cfocus on the content, then the content, and then, if you have time, improve the content\u201d.", "Git is not just a tool in your toolbox. It records your changes, so that you can keep track not just of your work, but also of your improvements, and it gives you the ability to repair your mistakes by reverting changes. You can also work on different ideas simultaneously and manage your time by having them separated. This is invaluable, especially in a learning phase, where you can annotate modifications to your code by adding useful messages to your commit.", "I also highly recommending using a GUI such as SourceTree or GitKraken to be able to visually see the evolution of your codebase. To get started, the Git Handbook will give you the basics, and I also strongly recommend creating a dummy repository, making test changes to it (or even better, realistic changes on a small project) to try out the commands and gain familiarity with git and the GUI you want to use. The main reason to use a GUI is very simple: you open the thing, and you see what happened in the entire repository in the blink of an eye. The git command-line tool will never achieve this level of communication, and being in sync with the current status of your repository is crucial. A Git repository is, in my opinion, a very visual object, so it should be visualized.", "2. Learn the basics of the programming language you use", "Python is the main language used for data science and machine learning, but it\u2019s not its only use, and some people may also be using R, JavaScript, Go, or even Java (yuck!) for their use-case/job. Python was designed as a full-fledged programming language and it has an insane amount of use-cases, so it is extremely versatile, flexible and useful. Learning to use it will make you more efficient and productive not just in your data science or machine learning career but also as a developer in general.", "Here is a short list of things you might want to have a look into (in order of difficulty):", "A Makefile can be seen as a collection of terminal shortcut commands stored in a text file that integrates with the make command-line utility. Have a look at this tutorial to understand how to use Makefiles. This is an easy tip to start implementing, but it has two main impacts:", "4. Learn how to work with unit tests early", "There\u2019s one thing I was always doing when I began writing code: I wrote some code, I would open a terminal, and then I would paste my code in the terminal and then keep playing with it to see if it worked like I wanted. If you\u2019re going to use this code once or twice, this is optimal. If you\u2019re going to use it more than that, it\u2019s a total waste of time. (That\u2019s a general pattern in programming: if you do something more than twice, you should probably automate it. Sometimes even if you do it twice. Less often, even if you do it once. But at some point, the Zen of Python should kick in: premature optimization is the root of all evil!)", "What you should do is get acquainted with the python library unittest. It\u2019s built into python and it works wonderfully. What it allows you to do is the following: that thing you wrote in the terminal? You write it in a unit test, and then all you have to do is run that test from the terminal (ideally, write a shortcut to call your test script in a Makefile).", "5. Learn the standard library of python", "How many times did I try to be smart and write some super complicated code (that also looked really complicated) to solve a problem already solved by python\u2019s standard library! I\u2019ll give you an example.", "Let\u2019s say you have in front of you the menu of the cafeteria for each day of the week. So you\u2019re given two dictionaries:", "and you want to write a function that generates the following sentences:", "Now of course, you can see the template:", "But how do we get to iterate over all of those at once?", "A naive way would be to create a new data structure (ideally the first example, with list comprehension, less ideally the second example, not automated at all, but they create the same structure):", "and then use that data structure in a for loop:", "A little bit less naive way would be to do a for loop and use the dictionaries:", "but that makes the f-string a bit unnatural to read. The ideal way would be if we could name those variables what they actually are, and this is possible with zip!", "There are so many more tools from the standard library that I encourage you to explore to improve your code as in the above situation, such as", "I believe that if as a data scientist, you take the time to do a little bit of those five steps in your spare time, your coding skills will grow extremely fast and you will quickly become much more productive.", "Let me know what you think of this article in the comments!", "Your home for data science.
