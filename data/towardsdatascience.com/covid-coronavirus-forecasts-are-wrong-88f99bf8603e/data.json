University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) updated the estimation framework used for projecting Covid related deaths in the United States. The substantial changes reported on their site reflect mobility in relation to social distancing policies, correcting reported cases to account for increased testing and drivers such as temperature, population density and testing per capita.", "They also revised estimates upwards to 134,475 deaths. That projection was 72,433 just 3 days prior.", "The fact is, the IHME forecasts, upon which the US administration and health officials have relied have been a roller coaster ride since March, it\u2019s just not obvious.", "Since the forecast visualization on the IHME site is dynamic, it\u2019s challenging for the casual visitor to see these fluctuations over time. And it doesn\u2019t help that most news cycles only report the most recent delta which obfuscate the issue. As the IHME doesn\u2019t provide archives of their visualizations, I\u2019ve used their freely available data to produce the graph below of forecast deaths over time.", "In a March 30th press briefing, Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator, referenced 12 global models that had been under review. Though no reasons were shared, they dismissed those and instead developed a new model from the \u201cground up\u201d and then subsequently learned of research coming from the IHME. Dr. Birx ultimately landed on the IHME forecasts going forward as they \u201cended up at the same numbers.\u201d", "Since then, the administration and health officials have relied upon IHME models for coronavirus planning, to extend social distancing guidelines, for containment strategies, and most recently for plans to ease shelter-in-place restrictions at the state level to support economic recovery. As the IHME has modified their figures, their best-case predictions have been parroted at briefings.", "For example, at a press conference May 1st, President Donald Trump said of the coronavirus, \u201chopefully we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost\u201d, referring to the upper range of the average projection. Just 4 days prior, the average death toll shared by the administration was upwards of 70,000. And two weeks earlier on April 20th, that estimate was 60,000. All based upon the IHME models.", "Though there may be justifiable concern about the perceived goal post movement, it diverts from the deeper issue: that few of us (from the administration, to news outlets, to every social media armchair data scientist) have been scrutinizing the soccer field itself.", "As such, by way of omission, most news reports, press briefings and blind tweets of the death forecast have been open to interpretation.", "The IHME models utilize data from across the globe, along with assumed adherence to response strategies in the United States (school closures, shelter-in-place orders, non-essential business closings) to predict peak healthcare demand, and a forecast death toll. Since the IHME provides academic analysis funded in part by well-known philanthropists, I ask in the words of Marvin Gaye, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d", "\u201cthe IHME projections are based not on transmission dynamics but on a statistical model with no epidemiologic basis.\u201d", "There are several factors to consider. First, as the The Annals of Internal Medicine have simply put, \u201cthe IHME projections are based not on transmission dynamics but on a statistical model with no epidemiologic basis.\u201d Rather than use an epidemiology discipline, they opted instead to base their model on the trajectory of cases and deaths from Wuhan, China along with indicators from Italy and South Korea.", "Second, the IHME uses an overly optimistic forecast rendered in such simplicity that it obfuscates some rather complex assumptions and limitations, some of which had not been enforced consistently in the United States in late March and early April. As you\u2019ll see in some screenshots captured below, the descriptions, context and visualization format keep changing.", "Last, we are to blame, as we have blindly seized upon the headlines without scrutinizing the source and demanding context.", "In some fairness to the IHME, the spartan projection page which contains the published results of each model change do provide links to update notes. But I suspect that reporting has been reviewed with the same rigor as an iOS license agreement preceding a software update. Like so many application Terms & Conditions, we simply scroll to the bottom and click \u201cAgree\u201d so we can get on to the next thing. The devil though, is in all of those details and assumptions, especially when the goal posts and context keep changing.", "For example, take note of this screenshot of the IHME projections page on May 1st. The overly broad disclaimer \u201csocial distancing until infection minimized and containment implemented\u201d displays at the top of the fold.", "But on May 4th, the revised model forecast nearly doubling the estimate just days prior carries no cautionary assumptions. They\u2019ve also chosen to smooth the visualization, rather than their previous straight line plot based upon lags in reporting.", "In their first paper published on March 27th, the IHME outlined an initial forecast of excess ventilator demand and hospital beds as well as a death projection of over 81,000. When the model was first launched, many US states had not yet implemented social distancing policies, and those that did weren\u2019t consistent. Nonetheless, the IHME were using trends, projections and death tolls from other countries (China and Italy primarily) to predict outcomes in the United States.", "But each country responded to coronavirus differently, and with varying velocity and effectiveness. In contrast to the US, China mobilized quickly: They had tests readily available and free of charge, built 1,000 bed hospitals, developed rapid testing protocols, stopped mass-transit in hot spots like Wuhan, enforced quarantines and attempted contact tracing. All of these initiatives were never likely at the onset of the virus in the US.", "As of May 4th, the IHME seems to have finally received the message, and acknowledges, \u201cIt is increasingly clear that COVID-19 epidemic trajectories \u2014 and corresponding responses \u2014 are highly variable throughout the world.\u201d Ya, think?", "Next, the international death tolls upon which they relied to predict US rates, weren\u2019t entirely accurate. Italy had been innocently under reporting deaths, as many had died without making it to the hospital or having been tested. In comparison, works of fiction were coming out of China, as alleged by CIA officials in a New York Times expose. In it, they claim China had been vastly understating coronavirus infections as mid-level bureaucrats in China had been lying about infection rates, testing and death counts, fearful of punishment.", "Whether due to honest mistakes in the fog of pandemic war, or intentional falsehoods, the issue remains: the deaths of the unseen and uncounted were not included in the IHME forecast though mid-April.", "Despite those early challenges, the IHME has had the benefit of time to improve forecast accuracy: they now use actual death counts from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and include assumptions of state level social distancing measures.", "And so, the April 17th forecast arrived with several updates which led with, as they proclaimed, \u201csubstantial\u201d improvements to the model. It was also when they projected their lowest death toll to date (60,308).", "This was met with some skepticism.", "At the time, the IHME model was called \u201cunrealistically optimistic\u201d by Forbes while the New York Times deemed it \u201cless pessimistic\u201d when compared to epidemiological based models from Columbia University, Northeastern University and other institutions.", "Despite providing very prescriptive guidance for reopening strategies, and the dates by which each state might relax restrictions, the IHME does not apply this in their forecast at all.", "The April 17th update also arrived with guidance for states to ease social distancing restrictions. For example, they suggested that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut could safely consider easing social distancing as early as late May.", "But despite providing very prescriptive guidance for reopening strategies, and the dates by which each state might relax restrictions, the IHME does not actually apply this in their forecast at all. As of April 17th, their forecast \u201cno longer accounts for variability in social distancing mandates\u201d, according to their FAQ.", "In contrast, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has developed a modeling tool to visualize the health and economic effects of state reopenings, called the Coronavirus Policy Response Simulator. They describe the tool as using an \u201cepidemiological framework along with empirical estimates to simulate the health and economic effects of easing state lockdown policies.\u201d", "Should states begin partial reopening, the Wharton tool forecasts an additional 43,683 lives claimed on top of a baseline of 115,937 Covid related deaths. They define partial reopening as lifting emergency declarations, stay-at-home orders and school closures.", "The simulator further forecasts an additional 222,823 deaths (for a total of 338,760) by June 29th should all restrictions be lifted which would include lifting restrictions on businesses and restaurants in addition to the partial reopening criteria.", "Some forecasters have taken a different approach to forecast confidence, to account for the IHME\u2019s optimism. A consortium at the University of Texas at Austin reviewed the IHME model with an aim to correct for it using GPS signal patterns rather than using trends of other countries. In the course of their research, they noted that the IHME model showed increased certainty the further it looked into the future. Taken another way, one might expect a higher degree of confidence in forecasting the near team inches of rainfall as opposed to say, six weeks ahead.", "This might be the reason Northeastern University will only forecast death tolls out 2 weeks in advance from the current date. In contrast, the IHME has claimed to forecast through for four months through August 4th since the start. Though even that date is suspect. Hold that date though, because we will return to it later.", "Consider how other forecasts of disease and illness are delivered: The CDC estimates 61,000 influenza-associated deaths in the US during the 2017\u20132018 flu season, and claims about 647,000 Americans die each year from heart disease. They include a time period.", "But in reference to Covid, that same duration based context is commonly omitted. Headlines and briefings have, for the most part, been simply stating the total death count. For example, US News & World Report touted the lower forecasts April 6th with an article stating \u201cThe new assessment predicts approximately 81,766 deaths.\u201d NPR on April 9th, led with \u201cCoronavirus Deaths May Be More Like 60,000.\u201d Nowhere in either story is a mention of the time period.", "Recall that at the May 1st press briefing, the Presidents\u2019 statement was also absent any clarification of time, \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.\u201d", "Consider reports from the IHME itself. It their April 5th press release they claim, \u201cIHME forecasts 81,766 deaths, with a range between 49,431 and 136,401.\u201d Absent in the 780-word statement is a limiting condition on the death count in terms of date range or wave. Is that forecast by the end of summer? December 31st? The end of quarantine?", "As such, by way of omission, most news reports, press briefings and blind tweets of the death forecast have been open to interpretation.", "So ask yourself this question: When you read those stories, or similar ones in March and April as the forecasts were referenced, what did you think they meant? The mortality toll for the duration of the pandemic, or until a vaccine has been developed would be plausible answers. Another logical connotation might be for the year ending December 31st, or for a season, in keeping with flu-like statistics.", "But none of those assumptions would be true.", "According to the IHME, there is an end date to the forecast and some news outlets have begun to pick up on this nugget. In the Forbes article, they state, \u201caccording to the IHME model, by August 4, 2020 the outbreak will come to a close\u201d and \u201cby then, daily death rates will have dropped to zero.\u201d They use this date presumably due to the chart labeled \u201cprojected by August 4, 2020.\u201d", "But it gets even more bizarre, as the four-month forecast \u2018by August 4th\u2019 actually ends July 6th. Let that sink in for a moment as you watch this visualization I\u2019ve conjured from the IHME website.", "The animation shows that (as of May 1st when I took the screengrab above) in the US, we will reach the maximum projected deaths of 72,433 on July 6th, and then it just flat-lines all the way to August 4th. If you assume that this means there will be no more forecast deaths after July 6th, then you\u2019d be completely aligned with what the IHME believes.", "The May 4th update slightly improves upon this by removing the flat line outcome that the IHME has used since March 28th. As you can see in the screenshot below, this adjusts the July 6th forecast to 130,255 deaths. Or other words, within 96.9% of the forecast death toll (134,475). By this logic, they assume that only 4,220 lives will be lost due to coronavirus in the nearly thirty days from July 6th through August.", "The IHME detail their logic in their paper,noting that the Covid-19 death rate will fall below 0.3 per million by state by May or June, thus becoming statistically insignificant to plot beyond then.", "In more simple terms, they explain on their FAQ, that \u201cassuming current social distancing measures stay in place until infections are minimized, and containment strategies are implemented (author note: which as reported earlier has now been removed from the projections page), our model predicts that deaths from COVID-19 will be near zero by this date in your location.\u201d That\u2019s not only a generous disclaimer, it allows for continuous movement of the proverbial goal post. Remember that claim about future forecast certainty mentioned by the University of Texas research?", "In comparison to the IHME forecast mortality rate for Covid-19, the CDC finds that influenza has a mortality rate of 2.0 for each 100,000 in population. Granted that the rate for the flu is over the season, and the assumption for Covid is that the rate will have significantly decline in the tail end of it\u2019s cycle, it still seems suspect. For the flu, both tests and flu shots are widely available. For Covid, we have neither. To assume that social distancing alone will bring the aggressive virus to mortality rates lower than the flu in two months is dubious.", "The shaded band you see around the death projection dotted line charts above displays the range of the forecast with an upper and lower boundary. Though that\u2019s reasonable as forecasts will include ranges due to their imprecise nature, it is interesting that on April 27th, more than 56,000 had died and yet the lower boundary of the IHME forecast range for the same date was curiously sitting at 56,563. On April 29th, the lower bound of the average forecast was 59,343, even as the death toll reported by JHU was over 60,000. That\u2019s like the weatherman forecasting temperature between 45 and 67 degrees for the day, when its 29 degrees and snowing outside during his live broadcast.", "Interestingly, a new phrase has been sporadically popping up in reference to the IHME death forecast, though not displayed on their projections page. This term now refers to the projections not as death toll through August, but as through \u201cthe first wave\u201d of the virus.", "However, the IHME report provides no firm definition of the wave, and without context allows the goal post to change here too. The first wave might include a set of conditions to be met like a reduced trend in coronavirus cases over a period of time, or rate of spread. The first wave might be when a majority of states reopen for business. Without a definition, it could be anything.", "It is important to note that with the most recent model changes on May 4th, the explanation of updates page , and the projections visualization are now conspicuously absent of the word \u201cwave\u201d or phrase \u201cfirst wave.\u201d", "It is indeed possible that the first wave is the arbitrary four month window (ending August 4th) as defined by the IHME back in March. They coined the phrase after all. Rather than using a future looking rolling period forecast (like the 2-week outlook from Northeastern University), they\u2019ll just continue to update their forecasts on the path to August 4th or some arbitrary wave-ending condition. So in the end, the death forecast will always be accurate.", "It\u2019s like betting on the final score of a football game, and updating your wager after every touchdown and each player injury. If only my bookie would allow me such latitude. My forecasts would be perfect.", "(edited 5.16.20: Corrected the hyperlink to the New York Times article)", "Your home for data science.
