As a data scientist, you will often draw a random sample from the population to conduct experiments or analyses. With the random sample, you make statistical inferences to the larger population.", "For example, as a mobile app data scientist, during an AB Test, I will draw a random sample of all users who installed the mobile app and I will quantify the probability of a user coming back after one week the user installs the app.", "This probability that I use will most likely be an expected value, which is the average value of a random variable. It is important to understand this term called Random Variable. Simply, a random variable means quantifying an outcome for a random process. So what does this have to do with an article about probability distribution?", "\u201cA list of all possible values of a random variable, along with their probabilities, is called a probability distribution.\u201d \u2014 Statistics Essentials For Dummies", "Probability distribution will differ depending on the what type of distribution it is. I\u2019m not going to cover all types of distributions, but I will cover what I believe are the most common. There are two overarching types called discrete and continuous. I\u2019ll cover a probability distribution that falls under each type.", "Let\u2019s first begin with binomial distribution. To know whether or not a distribution is binomial, you need to make sure it meets the following conditions.", "Note: The terms event and trial are interchangeable.", "For binomial distributions, there is a formula you can utilize to predict the probability of the random variable, often represented by the variable X.", "Going back to the conditions stated above, here is the breakdown of the formula.", "Another critical piece that might be confusing is the left portion of the formula.", "This means the number of ways to arrange x successes in n trials. F", "Let\u2019s go through an example to make this more clear.", "What would the probability distribution of four users installing an app and coming back after one week look like?", "Note: We are assuming that the probability of a user coming back after one week for each individual user is the same. Not realistic.", "In order to find the probability distribution, you have the calculate using the formula for all possible x (0,1,2,3,4).", "Normally, you will never have to calculate these by hand with all the tools out there to help you. However, it\u2019s good to have the foundational knowledge of the tools you\u2019re using and understand what\u2019s going on under the hood to be a good data scientist.", "The normal distribution is probably one of the most common distribution you will see. It has what you call a bell-shaped distribution as shown below. The actual distribution might not look completely the same, but you will see the distribution has one main peak with rounds smooth curves on both sides.", "It is one of the most important distributions because many real-world experiments utilize the the normal distribution whether it is AB tests in the corporate world or an experiment within a research institution. This is largely due to the central limit theorem, which assumes as the sample size becomes bigger and bigger, the distribution will take on a normal shape.", "Now let\u2019s go through an example to better understand this distribution. I believe the distribution is pretty simple.", "Here are some important characteristics of a normal distribution:", "Note: If you don\u2019t understand some of the concepts above, I recommend you checking out my other article that covers basic statistic concepts:", "The image below can be super helpful in understanding how the normal distribution works.", "Just like binomial distribution, the normal distribution also has a formula to calculate probability of x, but I\u2019m not sure how helpful that is in the real world\u2026 If you really want, go ahead and watch this video, but I really believe that all readers need to know is that in a normal distribution:", "Many corporations utilize the two standard deviation mark to say a value is statistically significant. I will go over in the next article an example of a z-test or t-test which will utilize a standardized normal distribution formula.", "Your home for data science.
