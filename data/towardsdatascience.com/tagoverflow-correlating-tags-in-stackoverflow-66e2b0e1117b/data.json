I was not aware of this. The similarity in names incidental we just chose that team-name randomly during the hackathon.", "In this post I want to show how to use the Jaccard procedure in the Neo4j-Graph-Algorithms library to achieve that. We imported the whole dump of StackOverflow into Neo4j, ran the algorithms and then visualized the results using Neo4j Browser and the large graph visualization tool Graphistry.", "Note: I updated the server URL, so you might need to update yours too.", "In September we had the opportunity of running the GraphConnect \u201cBuzzword-Bingo\u201d GraphHack in the offices of StackOverflow in New York which was really cool. I was impressed that the folks there really went through with what Joel Spolsky published many years ago as a better office layout for software companies (and probably other companies too). Lots of open space and rooms to discuss but a private, hexagon, glass-walled office for every team member, an individualized thinking and working place.", "For the hackathon we chose the project and team name \u201cTagOverflow\u201d.", "The StackOverflow data model is pretty straightforward, Users posting Questions and Answers, one of which is accepted. Each question is also tagged with one or more Tags.", "Then the Neo4j Graph Database of StackOverflow was ready to be used.", "The import steps are all documented in the GitHub repository, we already covered the process a while ago at the 10M question celebration.", "Our test instance is currently available as a Neo4j Cloud instance:", "We used Google\u2019s Colab Notebooks to work within the Hackathon team which worked really well. It\u2019s like Google docs for Python Notebooks, i.e. you have customizable sharing settings and everyone can edit and run cells from their own computer. Thanks to Leo from Graphistry for reminding me of that really cool tool.", "We connected to Neo4j using the py2neo library which builds upon the Neo4j Python driver and has some nice support for Pandas and Numpy. To use it on the 4.0 database, you need to use py2neo 5.x.", "For data exploration we first ran a query that showed how much data of each type we had in our graph.", "Today we\u2019re not interested in users, questions and answers, just their tags. So we have 52445 Tags, that\u2019s quite a bit, more than I expected.", "Of course their use is a power law distribution, our top 20 tags have way more use than the next ones combined.", "And render it the same way to a chart.", "Similar to people and other things in preferential attached networks, Tags cluster as well. Often, you have a main category like javascript, ruby or neo4j and then a lot of related tags. Some only valid within that main category like cypher is part of neo4j, some from other, parallel areas, e.g. neo4j and javascript.", "If we ran a co-ocurrence query for the ruby tag ordered by frequency.", "You\u2019d see that the results make sense, many of those tags are either major ruby projects or libraries.", "We could also render these correlations as virtual relationships in Neo4j Browser, by using the apoc.create.vRelationship function on our aggregated data to represent a SIMILAR relationship with the count as a property.", "Next we wanted to see how frequently are those other tags used, by looking at their degrees.", "It turned out that rails,arrays and javascript have really high usage. Rails showed its popularity, the other two tags are also used independently of Ruby for other programming language questions.", "Then we looked at the similarity computation of tags based on the questions they were attached to.", "We started with the Jaccard Similarity which is based on the intersection and the total size of two sets:", "We could run it in Neo4j either as a function, like", "Or as a procedure for larger data volumes. There we would pass in a list of maps/dictionaries where each entry has an item value and a categories list, e.g. [{item:1, categories:[1,2,3]},{item:2, categories:[2,3,4]}]. The procedure then computes the intersections and similarities of all pairs in parallel. We can pass in additional parameters like cutoffs for minimal similarity or degree of a node (relevancy), the details are documented in the documentation linked above.", "We were running this on a small sample of our data to show that it worked.", "We then ran the similarity computation on the whole dataset, limited to relevant tags that have at least 100 questions, in total 17000 tag-nodes, i.e. 292 Million comparisons (17k\u00b2).", "On our contended shared test machine back then ran for 13 minutes to compute the data, on dedicated hardware it would be faster.", "With the quite high min-similarity of 0.1 and writing only the 5 most similar neighbours, we create 2864 SIMILAR relationships that we can then use to run other graph algorithms on top.", "In the visualization we saw that we only created \u201cvery tight\u201d groups of similarities, like scheme<->racket or sed<->awk, or some small clusters around each of rdf, hadoop, flash and quickbooks!", "So we re-ran the computation with a lower similarity cutoff of 0.01, which resulted in a total of 44728 SIMILAR relationships.", "We only persisted the top 5 neighbours of each node, so some similarities that you might expect could be missing, because they didn\u2019t make the cut.", "Now we used the newly created relationships to run other algorithms, for instance something straightforward as shortest path. I.e. how were correlated tags connected transitively.", "Or this 4th degree neighbourhood of \u201cjavascript\u201d.", "Besides that we also quickly ran other graph algorithms on our inferred graph and wrote the results back to our database.", "Now our tags also carried pagerank, partition, centrality attributes that captured their relevance and place in our graph.", "Now that the nodes of our graph were enriched with graph metrics, we could visualize them, e.g. with our NeoVis.js Javascript library.", "For instance the similarity graph surrounding the javascript tag.", "You can try it live here and find the source on GitHub.", "Fortunately Leo Meyerovich, the CEO and Founder of Graphistry, a high performance, GPU-based graph visualization toolkit was at the Hackathon as well. While we were looking at the similarities, Leo build a small wrapper around the Neo4j Python driver to pull nodes and relationships from a Cypher query into a DataFrame for Graphistry and bind its columns as required.", "Now the Neo4j connector hasbeen properly integrated into Graphistry, so you can use it out of the box. There are also a number of demos as Jupyter Notebooks available.", "You\u2019ll need a Graphistry Key though, so ping Leo for that.", "Below you see the Graphistry UI and a visualization of the network around \u2018kubernetes\u2019, with this query:", "In graphistry you can configure some of the visualization settings directly with bindings, see above for the name. Others are easier controlled via the UI, via Add Histogram for \u2026\u200b and select a property, then you can use that distribution to color or size nodes and relationships.", "This only touched the surface of what\u2019s possible with a graph model, graph algorithms and visualization for the StackOverflow data.", "I hope I inspired you to play around with the data and dataset, the instance and the notebook are publicly accessible, so please try it out. I gonna write an additional post on interesting graph queries you can do on this dataset.", "For the buzzwords-hackathon it was definitely worth it \u2014 we won in the \u201cmost buzzwords\u201d category :) Thanks a lot to my collaborators for the engaging discussions and fun hours of working with this cool dataset. Here you can read about another cool entry in the hackathon, the Spatial Graph App.", "Please let me know what else you\u2019d love to do with this, I definitely have a lot more ideas.
