I listen to as much as I can get my hands on. Not only do I listen, but I write, record, perform, produce, and essentially live and breathe music. One of the things I used to pay much attention to was music reviews. Pitchfork Music was a major player in that arena, and I wanted to find out if I could build a model that predicted Pitchfork Music\u2019s \u201cBest New Music\u201d distinction. I\u2019m also studying Data Science, so I decided to let those two worlds merge a little bit.", "A little background: Pitchfork rates submissions on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being the highest score possible. Multiple employees all submit what they feel is the score and they take an average of all employee reviews and that becomes the score. They also vote on whether or not it should get \u2018Best New Music\u2019 distinction. The details of how these are actually determined are unknown, at least to me. You can read more about it here in this subreddit.", "I downloaded the data, cleaned it up, wrangled the data, created the model, and ran some predictions and was able to reasonably predict \u201cBest New Music\u201d with fairly high accuracy. Despite all of that predictive modeling, that\u2019s not what was the most interesting about the whole process. It\u2019s what I discovered in the data.", "Let\u2019s start with the score distribution first. What you see here is how approximately 26,000 scores spanning over roughly 17 years. You can see that scores are generally concentrated between 6 and 8 (is there some selection bias going on here?) and that most BNM (I will be abbreviating \u2018Best New Music\u2019 from here on) labels were above an 8, which isn\u2019t surprising.", "You can also see the relationship between score and BNM distinction on this Partial Dependency Plot, which is essentially a plot that shows how important a feature (in this case, \u2018score\u2019) is to the outcome of a classification, which is BNM.", "I tested that dependency with other features as well and found numerous relationships. The most notable were genre, artist, and label. That may make sense superficially, but I\u2019ll tell you why that\u2019s so interesting, but to do so, I want to start by talking about the relationship with \u2018author\u2019. It seemed, according to the data, that some authors were more likely to give higher scores and/or the BNM label than others as seen here:", "Here is the same data in list form:", "You can also start to see the skew in the genres here as well.", "What is most interesting about the data for \u2018genre\u2019 is the distribution of them. Take a look at this table:", "Rock is easily the most commonly reviewed genre and global is the least reviewed genre, but that isn\u2019t necessarily important. It\u2019s the distribution of BNM that is most interesting. It\u2019s Pop and R&B that have the highest proportion of BNM with Experimental and Rock close behind.", "And here is the quite striking skew when it comes to Record Labels\u2026 some just have more fun than others, it seems!", "It sure seems that it matters who you sign with as an artist, though I do want to point out that there are 21 self-released albums listed, which speaks to the modern methods of disseminating music.", "We see the exact same thing happen with artists:", "This graph may seem a little strange, but it is organized by total BNM values per label. Here\u2019s a closeup on that top left corner of the graph:", "Now let\u2019s look at \u2018artists\u2019 in the same way.", "Again, the top left corner zoomed in for clarity.", "BNM is concentrated in a small proportion of the overall \u2018artist\u2019 field. Either some artists are favored more than others or are just plain better than others.", "So, what does this all mean? In every feature (genre, artist, author, and label), the Best New Music distinction is concentrated in a relatively small amount of each compared to the overall data. Is it that one label picks better artists than others? Is it that one artist is consistently better than others? And what about authors? Are some more prescient or more perceiving than others of what truly is the best new music?", "Not in my opinion, at least. What I believe we are seeing here is that music is incredibly subjective. It always has been. Despite trying to be objective, or at least claiming as much, Pitchfork tends to favor specific genres, specific artists, and specific labels, and authors themselves tend to have specific leanings themselves.", "Now, this is just one website, albeit an influential one in the music review world. What would change if I pulled data from other large review sites? Would we see the same skew or would it vary from site to site? I think it\u2019s fair to say that it would be an interesting experiment, maybe something that I will tackle in the future!", "Note: I will be putting together an article on how I came to my code displaying my data cleaning, model, and feature engineering and will update accordingly with a link here. In the meantime, here is my Github repository for your enjoyment.", "Your home for data science.
