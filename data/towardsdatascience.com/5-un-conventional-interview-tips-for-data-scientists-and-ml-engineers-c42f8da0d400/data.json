What I mean is that when questions are asked, there tends to be little to no ambiguity to answers that could be given.", "You either know what you are talking about or you don\u2019t.", "In some interview scenarios, there\u2019s little to no room to have an extended discussion around ML topics, especially when an interview feels like an interrogation with the several \u201cWhat is\u201d and \u201cHow Do I\u201d type questions.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with having direct answers when asked questions such as \u201cWhat is a neural network\u201d or \u201cHow do you prevent a network from overfitting\u201d.", "Although, direct answers can showcase your knowledge and in some cases, expertise; they fail to showcase your personality, experience and creativity.", "Well prepared interviewers have other questions or methods of gauging your personality and other social factors.", "But for those who don\u2019t, you might come across as typical or nothing out of the ordinary.", "One approach that has worked for me is having a conversation around a topic that\u2019s asked within questions.", "To give an example of how you can initiate conversations around interview questions, take a look at the two scenarios described.", "Interviewer: Could you explain what overfitting is and how you would prevent it?", "Candidate 1: Overfitting occurs when the machine learning model does not generalise accurately to unseen data. This usually happens when the model learns predominantly patterns, including noise, that are present within the training data. Overfitting is fixed by reducing the number of features in the training data or reducing the complexity of the network through various regularisation techniques.", "Interviewer: Could you explain what overfitting is and how you would prevent it?", "Candidate 2: Overfitting occurs when the machine learning model does not generalise accurately to unseen data.

I\u2019m indicating that they might not have a clue of the technical jargon you use during discussions.", "Currently, I work with app designers and developers, and I don\u2019t expect them to understand why the performance of an object detection model might degrade under bad lightings or darker environment.", "But it is my responsibility to be able to communicate areas involved in my domain in layman terms so that non-technical team members can understand the reasons behind decisions or technological limitations.", "Having the skill and intuition to realise when to switch between detailed and simple explanations is a bonus skill interviewers and employers will appreciate within candidates and potential hires.", "One tip I would suggest cultivating this skills is to practise mock interviews with individuals with minimal to no knowledge on the machine learning domain and try to explain terms and terminologies to a level where they come out with a decent understanding.", "Before you start attending Data Science interviews, why not write at least three articles that are published on the biggest Data Science publication on Medium.", "Publishing articles on Medium is not a standard interview tip, but hear me out.", "Machine Learning is a broad field that encompasses several disciplines, algorithms, techniques, and more.", "Several talking points are available for ML practitioners to pick and write an article on.", "When applying for computer vision roles in late 2019, I wrote articles explaining several topics associated with computer vision and deep learning.", "I had written more than five articles before my first interview.", "Here are the benefits I found from writing articles that were related to jobs(Computer Vision Engineer) I was applying for:", "All of these benefits are not unique to me and even you can realise these benefits if you begin writing today and remain consistent.", "Just remember to keep writing, even after getting a machine learning role.", "There are a large number of articles on the internet you can read that will help you prepare for data science interviews, but very little of them touch on the psychological and social aspects of taking an interview. The main focus tends to be technical, and that\u2019s fair.", "Like I alluded earlier to in this article, to not be an ordinary job candidate, we have to take extraordinary steps to stand out from the crowd.", "Supplementing the information provided in this article with your typical technical interview tips and advice will place you in a strong position within many candidate pools.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
