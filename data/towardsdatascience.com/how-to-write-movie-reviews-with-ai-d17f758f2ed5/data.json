It could surface inspiring quotes you could include and remind you to mention an odd thought you saved on your smartphone while waiting in line at the DMV three years ago.", "Artificial intelligence won\u2019t replace writers. It will enhance your writing process, giving you a customized reader and editor precisely calibrated to work improve your style, voice, and themes.", "I can\u2019t wait for this world to arrive. I taught myself enough coding to generate fiction with AI tools, but at my heart, I\u2019m a journalist \u2014 a nonfiction storyteller.", "I wanted to see how AI could help my nonfiction writing right now. So using the super-powered language model GPT-2, I trained an AI to generate movie reviews for Film Threat magazine.", "This short-form nonfiction experiment gave me an early glimpse of future writing tools we will use someday while writing for Medium.", "When OpenAI unveiled the GPT-2 language model last year, the creators worried about how bad actors could abuse the tool. The company slowly released different strength versions of its model, watching carefully for abuses of GPT-2\u2019s power.", "They worried that it could be used to:", "\u201cGenerate misleading news articlesImpersonate others onlineAutomate the production of abusive or faked content to post on social mediaAutomate the production of spam/phishing content\u201d", "One year later, GPT-2 is fully available for civilians to use, powering amazing games, creative writing experiments, and recipe generation. So far, we haven\u2019t seen the large-scale generation of fake nonfiction.", "I believe the most interesting (and potentially dangerous) applications of GPT-2 will come from short-form nonfiction. Amazon reviews, book blurbs, and movie reactions already consume so much of our online attention, sometimes swaying people\u2019s opinions about a product or work of art.", "When starting this project, I chose movie reviews for my base materials, because a vast collection of user-generated reviews exist online \u2014 some of it collected in publicly available datasets. You could easily build a dataset with book reviews, news articles, sports coverage, or your nonfiction writing.", "Working with the editorial team at Film Threat last year, I started developing an AI capable of writing movie reviews. We\u2019ve published a few pieces together, and I\u2019d like to share how we trained our model.", "The project began simply, before I had access to tools capable of fine-tuning GPT-2. Even so, the regular model worked pretty well for film criticism.", "In the first article at Film Threat, I started by generating moving reviews with Talk To Transformer. This website gives you instant access to GPT-2. All you have to do is enter a question about a movie, and click \u201cComplete.\u201d No coding necessary!", "I asked GPT-2 a leading question: \u201cWho was the first artificial intelligence to write movie reviews?\u201d We got this most excellent computer-generated response (completely unedited):", "GPT-2 gave me the name of our computer-generated film critic. Using that name and some leading questions, I generated enough material for an entire Film Threat article with this simple interface.", "But I wanted to make something more sophisticated. For the next article, I upgraded Artificial Intelligence Reviewer \u2014 making a language model capable of churning out endless movie reviews. On demand.", "Using a machine learning technique called \u201cfine-tuning,\u201d I retrained the GPT-2 language model that powered Artificial Intelligence Reviewer with a MASSIVE dataset of movie criticism. I fed the hungry bot a huge movie review dataset, giving AI Reviewer a whole new vocabulary for critiquing movies.", "You can read the results in my second Film Threat article, matching readers\u2019 favorite movies with a computer-generated review.", "Here\u2019s how I trained the AI for Film Threat\u2026", "First, you need to find samples of your nonfiction \u2014 book reviews, Amazon user feedback, footnotes, Twitter posts, or whatever short-form nonfiction you want to computer generate. There are lots of movie review datasets online. Here\u2019s one dataset I found at the Stanford AI Lab website:", "\u201cThis is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.\u201d", "Fine-tuning both my language models took a few days. Max Woolf created an amazing Google Colab notebook that makes this step painless and free. I used the medium-sized 355M version of GPT-2 because it was large enough to handle my data set but small enough to run on Google Colab\u2019s cloud servers. I trained my model 23,000 steps each.", "I broke the training sequence into three smaller sections, because Google Colab won\u2019t run more than 12,000 steps.", "Once my language model was trained, I began generating hundreds of generic movie reviews. These were interesting, but a little unfocused. For each run, I set a length of 200 characters, the temperature at .7, and the output at 10 samples.", "The real magic happens when you start to load new prefixes into the model. It can be as simple as naming a movie. Here\u2019s the first test I ever tried:", "We immediately tested our supercharged AI on a review of Star Wars. In a few seconds, Artificial Intelligence Reviewer had generated a few zinging take-downs like this:", "But then, AI Reviewer followed up with gushing reviews of Star Wars, like this:", "I kept hitting \u201crun,\u201d over and over again, until I filled up a blank document with thousands of reviews. It took lots of human reading to find the best reviews out of this potentially endless stream of Star Wars reviews.", "Once I had some interesting material focused on single title prefixes, I started focusing on different directors and actors to get more specific film criticism. THIS is where things start to get interesting, when you start playing with the limits of the model.", "That prefix got us a crazy review of one of my favorite foreign language films of 2019. That final mash-up of movie genres still makes me laugh.", "I also introduced some new verbs like \u201cwin\u201d and \u201close\u201d into my prefixes, as we neared award season.", "Those prefixes will get you a whole load of Oscar predictions! Like this:", "Nonfiction generated by artificial intelligence will always require a human editor. To find a single good movie review, I had to read hundreds and hundreds of pages of boring, strange or even normal-sounding prose. It\u2019s a lot of work. But I never said AI would replace writers. It will just help us write better.", "Just like I could build Artificial Intelligence Reviewer to make hilarious and strange movie criticism, I could train my GPT-2 writing partner with all my collected digital writing. I have at least a decade of digital text, including notes, research, drafts, and highlights from my eBook reading. I could make a true writing partner, reshaping and refreshing my thoughts whenever I need a creative boost.", "Max Woolf\u2019s work has always inspired me, and his recent essay, \u201cHow To Build a Twitter Text Generating AI Bot with GPT-2,\u201d shows us how these language models trained on short-form nonfiction can live a whole life online.", "He also offered some caution about the size of your dataset. If you want to generate unique text with a smaller dataset, you\u2019ll need to follow this advice:", "Note that without a lot of tweets, the model might easily overfit and output existing tweets verbatim; if that\u2019s the case, you may want to train for fewer steps (e.g. 200\u2013500). Additionally, I recommend only using the 124M \u201csmall\u201d and 355M \u201cmedium\u201d GPT-2 models; larger GPT-2 models finetune poorly on small text documents and low amounts of input data.", "With that tool alone, you could create a Twitter bot to post for you or create a new bot that posts about your favorite topics. Who knows what other tools will be available by the end of the year as GPT-2 and other language models get placed inside new frameworks?", "Author and creative programmer Darius Kazemi once compared these language model advancements to the early days of Photoshop for graphic artists:", "\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in the future of writing, this is definitely worth keeping an eye on. It\u2019s like being a photographer at the advent of Photoshop, because it could be game-changing for the medium.\u201d", "Someday, I hope, these tools will help us craft new stories we can\u2019t even imagine yet.", "Your home for data science.
