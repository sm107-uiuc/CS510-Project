Think of an artificial intelligence system that can process huge amounts of data and stop crime in the city? Yes, you have guessed it right, POI or Person of Interest is a strong example of how data can be worth more than all the gold in Fort Knox (If there is actually gold located which the US government always denies)!", "Hadoop is one of the most powerful open-source frameworks for data processing. But, it has security concerns, which we are going to reduce with a federation access broker. Before we start exploring the new framework for Hadoop Access Control, let\u2019s first understand the Hadoop framework.", "Hadoop is an open-source framework developed by Apache. It is based on data clustering and parallel processing. There is no denying to the fact that a large open-source community has been backing up Hadoop\u2019s presence in the BigData applications. They have contributed to creating a more powerful stack for enterprise-grade data applications.", "The capabilities to store and process huge amounts of data has been vital to the acceptance of Hadoop on a larger scale. Hadoop is good at computing resources management with both structured and unstructured data. But, this modern data architecture has some challenges, especially in the security of data.", "Let\u2019s understand the Hadoop application for BigData for knowing the security challenges.", "We know that Hadoop is designed on parallel processing and distributed computing mechanisms. A Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS is provided with the platform. HDFS supports hardware commodities and accommodation of different processing frameworks.", "The IAM or Identification Authentication Management system with HDFS is used to define a set of protocols that can help end-users to access the data through an application. These sets of protocols are called APIs or Application Programming Interface, which can be developed by business for data access.", "As the data clustering increases there is a lot of pressure on the Hadoop framework. To tackle this problem, it has introduced two federations", "The HDFS Federation uses multiple NameNodes. These NameNodes are independent and manage a subset of the whole NameSpace.Here, NameNodes maintains the filesystem called a namespace. They maintain a hierarchy of the files through name grouping. The tree-like file structure is managed in a container called NameSpace.", "Layer1: It is the namespace in NameNodes that controls the storage of data related to directories, files, and blocks.", "Layer2: It is the block storage that supports low-level operations with two parts- block management and physical storage of data.", "The physical storage can be scaled easily by adding horizontal DataNodes, which is not the same with NameNodes. There is a limitation of scaling the NameNodes as it can be done vertically only, which is hard due to single-node architecture. But, with the federation of HDFS, namespace layers of NameNodes can be scaled horizontally.", "It has an architecture to make BigData storage and access management more efficient. The HDFS structure has two major components.", "The NameNodes run namespace layers to manage the data related to the file system. It regulates access to files and uses a hierarchical system. It also tracks the location of blocks and maintains the log files for auditing whenever necessary. These files are separated into multiple blocks internally. Blocks are placed in the DataNodes stored into the local storage disks.", "If a client wants to access any data that is stored in the HDFS system, there is a call placed for it. After receiving the call, HDFS uses NameNodes to provide access to data stored in the DataNodes at local disks.", "Once the data is written it can\u2019t be edited without a high-level IAM protocol. HDFS does not allow any other access to clients without appropriate protocol. So, the access provided is write-once-read-many.", "Here, there are several challenges that HDFS architecture presents.", "Federation brokers are not new. Many businesses use such a solution for data access control. Such an architecture introduces an intermediate layer that redirects the client\u2019s traffic to a proxy server or a gateway for authentication. An access broker is an authorization enforcer point across the cloud-based system or an on-premise data centre.", "Here, we are discovering a federation access broker that can abstract the management of the remote access calls. These calls are often made by clients to Hadoop federation services for data access.", "The architecture executes two basic functions.", "Here, the clients need to get authenticated at the Knox gateway. Next, this ClientID used for authentication is passed on to the Ranger for validation of access to NNs. After validation of the client calls, a secure session is established.", "If the Ranger authorization is successful, it provides a certificate for accessing the NNs. It will assign permissions to clients for interaction with each NameNode. The NN will execute data access through DataNodes assigned to specific NameNode.", "With each attempt to reach the DataNodes for data access, audit logs are created. These logs are stored into a centralized HDFS storage to reduce the complexity of distributed audit logs across the clusters.", "We discovered that use of a federation broker can reduce the complexity of security and client authentications in Hadoop frameworks. As the businesses around the world are investing highly on data aggregation and storage, there is a need for a highly efficient framework like Hadoop. But, as it uses data clustering and parallel processing, the need for federation has been felt.", "The open-source framework has seen a rise of federation frameworks and yet there are issues that need resolutions. A federation broker adds that extra layer of authentication creating more rigorous data security. It also eases access to data without too much time for validations. As the abstract layer has two different authorization and validation gateways to fast forward the process.", "This data access is powered through the protocols. Businesses can use the Application Programming Interface to create data access protocols prior to the federation layer. So, are you willing to take the risk of data theft? Or create secure protocols for data access, validation, and storage.", "Contact us for API development solutions today and create secure protocols!", "Your home for data science.
