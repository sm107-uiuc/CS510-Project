Airborne respirable fibers, such as asbestos are hazardous to health and occupational health and safety guidelines and laws require detection and identification of all the asbestos containing materials. However, detection and identification of asbestos fibers is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. In this work, we present a Deep Learning based Semantic Segmentation model that is able to automate the asbestos analysis process, reducing the turnaround time from hours to minutes. The proposed deep neural network provides end-to-end automation of the analysis process, starting with transforming the input Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, to identifying and counting the number of fibers in the image, to masking the identified fiber regions and re-arranging for efficient processing by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). Finally, we provide implementation details of a U-Net based Semantic Segmentation model that is able to detect and count asbestos fibers (air sample) in SEM images with up to 95% accuracy.", "This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 50th IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition (AIPR), 2021 (paper)", "Asbestos is a naturally occurring silicate, with a fibrous structure, that has often been referred to as the \u201cmiracle mineral\u201d because of its flexibility, abundance, and resistance to fire and corrosion. These technical features and low cost led to asbestos being used in many fields, especially by the construction industry, such as, a component in concrete or resin compounds. Like its useful properties, asbestos is a serious pollutant and can cause lung diseases, such as, asbestosis, mesothelioma and other types of cancers. These pathologies can have long incubation periods.", "Switzerland was one of the first countries to ban Asbestos, in 1990; with most other countries following in the nineties. Asbestos remains, however, present in construction materials of many buildings from the fifties, sixties and seventies. To protect the health of the workers and the population, present Swiss law requires that any building older than 1990 needs to be checked for asbestos prior to demolition or transformation and recycling / disposal of the construction materials [1, 2].", "In the past, the focus was put on major occurrences of asbestos such as spray asbestos or fiber cement. Nowadays, however, materials that contain asbestos in very low concentrations (less than 0.1%) are, nevertheless, considered as a health risk for workers and thus need to be sampled and analyzed. To provide an example, tile cement is being analyzed since 2010 and plaster since 2017 and approximately 20% of these samples contain asbestos.", "Unfortunately, detection and identification of asbestos fibers is a complex and time-consuming process. In case of uncertainty regarding the presence of asbestos, samples (airborne or solid, depending on the case) are collected from the site and analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). Samples are generally collected by using specially designed pumps which force the air through gold-coated filters and particles and fibers are collected using electrostatic interactions. Before analysis, the organic constituents of the sample are removed using oxygen plasma etching. A randomly selected portion of the filter is then analyzed under SEM to search for asbestos fibers as thin as 3 \u00b5m and as short as 5 \u00b5m. The individual fibers are also counted according to defined fiber counting rules and classified according to the fiber type. Classification is performed by analyzing the chemical compositions of the fibers by using EDS. Finally, the concentration of the asbestos fiber is evaluated and compared to standard values defined by norms (which vary from country to country). In case the evaluated asbestos concentration is over a certain value, further processing is required according to the guidelines.", "SEM images along with EDS results are used for different types of materials\u2019 morphological and chemical analysis in various fields, such as, medical technology [3, 4], forensic science [5], construction industry [6, 7], etc. However, the analysis process is generally time consuming as the operator, after obtaining an electron image of the sample, needs to manually identify the objects of interest by eye and then select a location from which to obtain EDS spectra. As a result, this method is not only time consuming, but also laborious and potentially open to bias.", "In this work, we present a Deep Learning (DL) based Semantic Segmentation model to automate the analysis process. The proposed model is able to identify and count the number of fibers, with the neural network masking the identified fiber regions and re-arranging them such that they can be provided as input to energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).", "The automated process is illustrated in Fig. 1.", "The automated process has the potential of reducing the asbestos analysis turnaround time to a few minutes, instead of the current manual processing time to 1\u20132 hours; with an estimated cost reduction of upto 25%.", "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we expand Fig. 1 to provide details of each step, with sub-sections corresponding to the image capture and image analysis (Semantic Segmentation and Fibers Count) phases. Section 3 provides implementation details, including training specifications and accuracy results of the Semantic Segmentation model. Section 4 concludes the paper and provides directions for future work.", "In this section, we expand Fig. 1 to provide details of each step. The expanded process is illustrated in Fig. 2.", "SEM images are collected using standard imaging software. Several set of images, each set containing 100 SEM images, are collected. For each set of images, the working distance (WD), the high voltage (HV), magnification, brightness and contrast are set to specific values. All the SEM images can be stored either on the local hard drive of the computer or directly uploaded to the cloud for performing the next step. These SEM images are then provided as input to the Deep Learning based Semantic Segmentation model.", "As outlined in Fig. 2, the overall process consists of Pre-processing, Semantic Segmentation, Fiber Count, followed by a Post-pressing step that is responsible for optimizing the neural network output for EDS processing. We start with the Semantic Segmentation model, which forms the core of the Image Analysis module.", "Semantic Segmentation refers to a type of Image Recognition model that is able to assign a class (label) to each pixel in the image. This allows a Semantic Segmentation model to output where an object is located in the image, the shape of that object, which pixel belongs to which object, etc. A Deep Learning based Semantic Segmentation model thus consists of training a neural network to output a pixelwise mask of the input image.", "Different neural networks have been proposed for Semantic Segmentation in the literature, e.g. FCN [8], SegNet [9] and U-Net [10]. In this work, we focus on the UNet architecture which seems to work efficiently for our problem domain.", "U-Net is an end-to-end semantic segmentation model, which builds on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Image Classification models; by stacking a bunch of convolutional layers in encoder-decoder fashion. The encoder downsamples the image giving a compressed feature representation of the image, and the decoder upsamples the image using methods e.g. transpose convolution to give the segmented output (unlike other approaches using mathematical interpolations). Intuitively, an encoder consisting of a stack of traditional convolutional and max pooling layers (on the lines of an Image Classification model). As such, it is able to capture the \u2018what\u2019 information of an image. As the \u2018where\u2019 information is equally important in Semantic Segmentation, the decoder is able to recover the \u2018where\u2019 information (precise localization) by gradually applying up-sampling.", "We follow the original U-Net architecture outlined in [10], with a slight adaptation to accept input images of 1024 x 768 x 3 (the size of input images in [10] is 572x572x3). The good thing about U-Net is that it does not contain any dense layer because of which it can accept image of any size.", "The purpose of this module is to validate the quality of all the SEM images before providing them as input for Semantic Segmentation. If any SEM image is determined to be unsuitable for processing with respect to sharpness, brightness, contrast, or magnification; the layer attempts to rectify this by performing the necessary image transformations. If unsuccessful, it returns the image to the \u2018Image Capture\u2019 layer highlighting the issues and providing recommendation to address the issue during the SEM image capture process.", "Recall that in some specific cases of SEM image analysis, such as for asbestos (air sample) analysis, it is required to calculate the length, width and aspect ratio of fibers present in an image. In addition, we also need to determine the number of fibers visible in the field of view of the image. This determines the asbestos fiber concentration in the image, which mandates further processing if the asbestos concentration is found to be over a certain threshold according to guidelines.", "Given a Semantic Segmentation output where the pixels of (classified) fibers in the image have been masked, we use the OpenCV HoughLines() function [11] to compute the length and count of images . The corresponding python code snippet is provided below:", "The goal of this step is to prepare the output for EDS Processing. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is an analytical technique, generally integrated with SEM, used for the analysis of elemental composition or chemical characterization of a sample. To perform EDS, generally, at first SEM images are collected on the sample surface and then the specific locations are marked on the images manually for chemical analysis of the object of interest. Once all the locations of interest are identified on the images these XY co-ordinates are manually transferred to the user interface of the EDS program to perform chemical analysis on these locations. This manual process is very time consuming.", "In the automated process, the (x, y) coordinates of the identified fibers are provided as output by the get_fiber_details function. Post-processing then consists of sorting the fibers in such a way that during the EDS process the sample stage inside SEM needs to travel the shortest distance (with respect to the electron beam) between two specified locations specified. The output of this step is thus an optimized map of (x, y) coordinates of fibers detected in the image that helps in reducing the EDS processing further leading to a more efficient analysis. This location map is uploaded directly to the EDS user interface for performing EDS on the objects.", "The Semantic Segmentation model was trained using 100 amosite asbestos (air samples), with a 80\u201320 split of the training / validation sets. All the 100 SEM images will be taken with the same imaging parameters, that is, size, resolution, brightness, contrast, HV, WD, every parameter is same for all the images. In principle, these images may be collected on the same sample at different locations or on a different sample with same objects. Fig. 3 shows a sample annotated image used from training the Semantic Segmentation model.", "Fig. 4 shows the corresponding output of the U-Net Semantic Segmentation model with the detected fibers masked. As can be observed, we achieve > 95% accuracy (precision) with our model, only trained with 100 images.", "Given the health hazards of asbestos, we proposed a Deep Learning based Semantic Segmentation neural network to automate the asbestos analysis process. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works to report on the practicality of using Semantic Segmentation for asbestos analysis. As outlined in the Implementation section, the results are quite promising at least for air-sample images where we were able to obtain > 95% accuracy based on a model trained on 100 annotated images.", "In future, we plan to extend the model to accommodate bulk asbestos samples, where asbestos fibers may form huge agglomerates and only few single fibers are visible. It is difficult and time consuming to identify these single fibers in the image among the agglomerates. We hope that a multi-class semantic segmentation model will be successful here as it will be able to detect and classify both fibers and agglomerates of fibers as objects in the images.", "[6] B. R.
