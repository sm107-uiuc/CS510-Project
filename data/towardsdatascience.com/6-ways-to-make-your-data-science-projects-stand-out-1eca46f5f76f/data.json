With everyone applying to jobs, how can you make sure that yours stand out? Read on to find out.", "Iris, Galton, Titanic, Northwind Traders, Superstore, Go Data Warehouse. While you were studying data science in school, you no doubt came across at least one of these data sets. There is a reason for that, they help demonstrate concepts like clustering, regression, logistic regression, database structures, data visualization, or building reports. Each data set is clean and small, but that isn\u2019t all they have in common: everyone has worked with these data sets. There are no new or exciting projects being built on the training data sets. No recruiter is going to look at your Titanic project (one of the most popular data sets on Kaggle) and say, we need this person on our team.", "There are no new or exciting projects being built on the training data sets", "We live in the data age and that means that there is no shortage of data sets that are easily available for download. Get your data from somewhere more exciting than Kaggle or the data you learned machine learning on. A good place to branch out is to Data.gov. In 2013 President Obama signed an executive order making open and machine readable data the new default for government information. This means that there is a wealth of searchable information ready to download right from Data.gov. Federal student loan program data, federal aid to states data, and accidental drug related deaths are just a few of the over 200,000 data sets available for your use. Just make sure to look at the metadata provided with the file so you understand what you are working with.", "Want to make things a little more personal? Use your own data! Anything you do can be turned into data. Many gyms are closed during stay at home orders, maybe you\u2019re working out from home. All of those exercises you are doing can be tracked. Look at how many reps you are doing, which muscle groups you are working on, and what days you are working out on. The best part about using your own data is that you are the subject matter expert. You may end up with some smaller data sets to work with, but you will have a much deeper understanding of how it was captured and have control over adding new variables or dimensions to it.", "None of these sounding advanced enough? Take a look at web scraping. Web scraping is the automated process of collecting unstructured data from the internet. You will have to write the code in a language such as R or python to capture the data. You will have to do your own research about the values you capture and how the website you are scraping got those values. The end result will be much more unique, but it will also create more work to learn about the data and clean your collected data.", "Speaking of data cleaning, real world data is disgusting, be sure to wear your face mask while working with it. Jokes aside, when someone asks for a model that uses data to predict customer churn, there is almost never a clean, ready to use data source to build that model from. Most classes will not prepare you to handle the sorts of dirty data that organizations have available. This is a critical skill that you need to showcase in at least one of your projects.", "Speaking of data cleaning, real world data is disgusting", "There are many tasks that can be associated with cleaning data. A good place to start is understanding the data. Government and publicly available data will often have a data dictionary containing descriptions of each dimension, measure, observation, and table in the data. This will help you understand what data was collected, when it was collected, and who collected it.", "Understanding what you are looking at is a key to data validation. Once you know what a variable is you may be able to use the data dictionary, common sense, or a subject matter expert to determine which values don\u2019t make sense. For example temperatures should fall in a certain range of values. If it is temperature data and the data dictionary specifies the units of measurement as Kelvin, any 0 or negative values would be suspect. If it is temperature data from Bermuda, warmer temperatures would make sense. Here, anything too hot or too cold would be suspect. For something like manufacturing welding temperatures, you may want to look to a professor or engineering student to give you more guidance. The key in this step is to find values that don\u2019t look right.", "Another area to look into is how to handle missing values. Like data validation, context matters when handling missing values. If you are looking at financial loan data for cars and a loan is in good standing and has a missing value for repossession status, you won\u2019t be worried about that value being missing. If your project involves psychological assessments and you are missing answers to a lot of questions, you may take a different course of action, like eliminating the observation. Sometimes missing values make sense in your context. As with data validation, work with your subject matter experts and peers to understand what to do with missing values.", "Sometimes missing values make sense in your context", "When doing data science projects, you likely spend a lot of time working with others, and this is just one of the many reasons to use version control. If you are not familiar with version control, it keeps all of the code in one place and allows multiple people to work on it at the same time. Everyone can add their contributions and review others\u2019 code. If someone leaves the company, there isn\u2019t a fight with the IT department to move the most recent codes to someone else\u2019s machine. All code lives in a central, organized repository.", "All code lives in a central, organized repository", "Another issue that plagues students is naming versions of files. Never again will you have 20 versions of \u201cproject_02_final.py\u201d is different than \u201cproject_12_final_done_finished.py.\u201d With version control, every version has comments and you can do a line by line comparison with any other version of your code to see what was deleted and added to it. You don\u2019t even have to worry about an old version getting deleted, you can always roll back to an older version of the code.", "The best part about version control software is that it is easy to use once you get started. It can come as a standalone program, be integrated into your favorite integrated development environment (IDE), or be used through a command line interface. Many systems have additional features that allow you to create a website based on your repository, test builds of your code, and share your code by embedding it in other places. It is not only a method to keep your project organized, but it can also be used to start presenting your projects.", "The term data scientist is still relatively new, and it isn\u2019t uncommon for executives to not fully understand data concepts. Regardless of whether or not they have a deep understanding of data science and machine learning, they need a way to quickly get the most important information your projects have to offer. This is your presentation layer.", "Most aspiring data scientists don\u2019t focus enough on communication skills. Explaining how you used parallel computing in the cloud to train and test a model that you then deployed using a custom API for someone else to use won\u2019t hold anyone\u2019s attention. Management won\u2019t always be as interested in how you do it, but why you did it. That isn\u2019t to say the technical aspects are unimportant, but keep your audience in mind. The business side will want to see how the bottom line is impacted by your model, the IT side will care more about the actual implementation of it.", "Most aspiring data scientists don\u2019t focus enough on communication skills", "Your presentation layer can take many different forms. Once again, keep your audience in mind. Some people only want spreadsheets and tables while others want graphs and colors. Some expect it to be delivered by email and others want to see all of their figures from different areas on the same page. Take the tools you have access to and create different presentation layers with different audiences in mind.", "One of the most difficult things I experienced right out of college was seeing job openings for companies I wanted to work for and not having any relevant technology skills from the positing. A lot of companies struggle with on boarding and internal training. It is so much easier for them to hire someone who already knows what they need. Being familiar with a broader range of technologies will help in your search. Many organizations will even use multiple technologies together to piece together their data pipelines and data science environments.", "There is the old joke that data science is 80% prepping data and 20% building models. There is truth to this. I have worked with data scientists who spent the vast majority of time on a project getting code to run correctly on a server instead of their desktop. I have interviewed at smaller companies where data scientists are expected to work very closely with the data engineers to build the data structures to gather data and support their models. There is a huge benefit to using multiple languages and software packages to build different parts of you data science projects.", "Data science is 80% prepping data and 20% building models", "There are a wealth of resources out there, and learning a new technology or programming language doesn\u2019t have to be difficult or expensive. Sure there are professionally led trainings that can cost upwards of $1,500, but there are also free videos for almost anything, and students enjoy licenses and training for many expensive software packages for free just for having a .edu email address. Search on their website to see what is available. Once you learn one type of software or language, it usually isn\u2019t too hard to get into another similar one. If you can use Power BI, Tableau isn\u2019t too difficult to use.", "Speaking of multiple tools, why not use a bunch of them together? As a student there are many times you get your data in a simple format, a .csv for example. It isn\u2019t impossible to get .csv files when working for an organization, but data isn\u2019t typically stored that way. Data will come from multiple sources, have multiple layers for transformation and storage, and touch many different technologies along the way. A small pipeline for your project shows that you understand how these parts work together.", "Everyone knows how to read a .csv file", "A pipeline can be as simple as loading files into a database, selecting the data to bring it into your analysis tool, and sending the results to your presentation layer. It doesn\u2019t have to be pretty or fully automated, it just needs to demonstrate your understanding of how data pipelines work. Everyone knows how to read a .csv file, but not everyone can integrate the data, analysis, and presentation processes into a coherent project that reflects how organizations do it.", "This is by no means a comprehensive list, but gives you ideas about how to get your data science projects noticed! Keep in mind that the data science projects are a direct reflection of you skills. Showcase what you are good at by applying those skills to projects that reflect the complexity of real world data science. Be sure to use interesting data, clean it up, use version control to stay organized, effectively communicate your message, use varied technologies, and combine everything together for a truly rounded data science project.", "Your home for data science.
