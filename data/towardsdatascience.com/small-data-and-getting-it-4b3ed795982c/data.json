We don\u2019t visualize the correct-sized pile of hundred dollar bills while pricing something expensive, we just compare with the market price (essentially just a symbol, not even a number we can conceptualize) of other similar things. We understand deltas. We feeble beings have to abstract large (sets of) numbers away to external apparatuses in order to manipulate, and especially to derive meaning. We reduce dimensions, we bin, and we plot data to bring it down to a scale we can digest and act upon. We make Big Data small, to see it and its implicit patterns.", "McDonalds stopped publishing the number after they sold their 99 Billionth burger. Nobody cares anymore.

Just because we can\u2019t run the most advanced, sample-hungry machine learning models on a dataset doesn\u2019t make it meaningless!

What emerges is a case for the beauty of small data and its deliberate interpretation, analog visualization, and slow transmission \u2014 a celebration of the infinitesimal, incomplete, imperfect, yet marvelously human details through which we wrest meaning out of the incomprehensible vastness of all possible experience that is life.", "Some of my Data Science bootcamp classmates and I have Jaime Cheng to thank for bringing us all to hear Lupi speak about Dear Data, and Small Data more generally, at Columbia University, in conjunction with The Pudding.", "As a recovering film industry worker and lover of low-budget independent films, I hold that there is magic in the mundane: Some of the most profound and relatable truths about human nature and society can only be seen at the individual, normal human scale, which is, like, why I can\u2019t stand superhero films.

Data scrounged from the nether regions of the interweb doesn\u2019t always inspire confidence regarding its methods of collection and organization. Maybe it\u2019s old and crusty. Data provided by an employer might be incomplete, unusable, or simply non-existent.", "Maybe we\u2019ve been inspired by the creators of Dear Data, and we want to try our hand at collecting our own, you know, for fun and sport.

If you\u2019re as talented as Giorgia you can leverage that analog charm to sell a fortune\u2019s worth of coffee table books, but I\u2019m not that talented.

(I filed a bug report relating to location services, and was met with an invitation to fix it myself..! Open source indeed. I\u2019ll make it happen as soon as I find a free week to learn the Android development environment.)", "Here\u2019s a quick-start in ODK for Small-Data collecting:", "The nice thing about ODK Collect is that you can hook it up to Google Docs: By setting the submission_url in your blank form spreadsheet\u2019s settings tab, you can have every form submission auto-populate to a row in a google sheet. We can rest easy that our data is backed up in the cloud, and later it will be trivial to download/import this as an xls or csv in Pandas.", "Here are some screengrabs of my form as I fill it out in ODK Collect:", "I submit my filled-out form, and my google sheet is configured to auto-populate, so the data appears\u2014complete with lat/long coordinates, boolean values, floats, timestamps, and a uid. You can really trick out your forms.", "Then we can bring it full circle, downloading the spreadsheet data as a .csv or .xls and importing into pandas (in a jupyter notebook):", "Much smoother than pen and clipboard, and sustainable! Any number of fully trained, qualified data collectors could be out surveying with this form, all populating the same spreadsheet. I should mention that ODK is geared towards data collection off-the-grid: You can use this tool with or without cel data, in remote locations, wherever there are important humanitarian projects to undertake.", "Another way to go about collecting survey data, which might be more obvious, would be to crowdsource it by sending out a google form. These are very easy to create and send out en masse. The responses roll in, there are nice little visualizations right in the web app, and you can of course coerce the data into spreadsheet form with the click of a button for download and further investigation.", "One drawback of sending out an email or web survey is that you\u2019re then trusting respondents to submit accurate information, which may not always be the case: You might substitute quality for quantity, which is not in the spirit of Small Data!", "Volumes and volumes have been written about how to collect data properly. Know that there is a wrong way to survey. As in so many arenas, even if you have the technology to do it efficiently, you might be doing it wrong efficiently. Don\u2019t do that.
