To be good at them, there is a necessity of strong fundamentals in the domain of Data Mining.", "Understanding of Data Science comes from understanding what Data is conceptually, how to handle the data we are given (data will always be different for every problem), and how to efficiently preprocess the data before handing it over to the Machine Learning Algorithms. I am currently working on code examples, I will add them as soon as I am done.", "Please bear with me for the conceptual part, I know it can be a bit boring but if you have strong fundamentals, then nothing can stop you from being a great Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.", "Let\u2019s kick off with asking ourselves a question, What is Data?", "\u2192 In simpler terms, Data is a collection of objects and their attributes. Other names for a data object are record, point, vector, pattern, event, case, sample, observation, or entity.", "Now, we must know what are Attributes?", "\u2192 It is a property or characteristic of an object. Example: Eye colour of a person. This is also known by other names such as variable, field, characteristic, dimension, feature etc.", "However, to discuss and more precisely analyse the characteristics of objects, we assign numbers or symbols to them. To do this in a well-defined way, we need a measurement scale. Now, what the hell is a measurement scale?", "\u2192 Well, it is a rule (function) that associates a numerical or symbolic value(attribute values) with an attribute of an object. For instance, we classify someone as male or female.", "From the above discussion, it is evident that the values used to represent an attribute may have properties that are not properties of the attribute itself, and vice versa. This can be understood with the help of an example: Employee Age and ID number, these two attributes are defined using integer values but they have distinct significance. It makes sense to talk about the average employee age but not about the average employee ID.", "This calls for the distribution of attributes into different types based on their characteristics. The following properties (operations) of numbers are typically used to describe attributes.", "Given these properties, we can define four types of attributes: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. I am presenting two tables below to explain these attribute types and their transformation.", "Nominal and ordinal attributes are collectively referred to as categorical or qualitative attributes. As the name suggests, qualitative attributes, such as employee ID, lack most of the properties of numbers. Even if they are represented by numbers, i.e., integers, they should be treated more like symbols.", "The remaining two types of attributes, interval and ratio, are collectively referred to as quantitative or numeric attributes. Quantitative attributes are represented by numbers and have most of the properties of numbers. Note that quantitative attributes can be integer-valued or continuous.", "The different types of attributes adhere to different properties mentioned above. Nominal adheres to Distinctness. Ordinal adheres to Distinctness and Order. Interval adheres to Distinctness, Order and meaningful difference. Ratio adheres to all the four properties (Distinctness, Order, Addition and Multiplication).", "Lastly, before concluding this post, I would like to talk about Continuous, Discrete and Asymmetric attributes. They are a crucial part of understanding the real-life data as most of the data sets consist of a combination of them, the differentiation becomes rather important.", "\u2192 It has only a finite or countably infinite set of values. Example: Zip codes", "\u2192 These are often represented as integer values.", "\u2192 It has real numbers as attribute values. Example: Temperature, height etc.", "\u2192 These values can only be measured and represented practically by using only a finite number of digits. It means they are represented as floating-point variables.", "\u2192 Only non-zero values are important in this.", "For Instance, consider a data set where each object is a student and each attribute records whether or not a student took a particular course at a university. For a specific student, an attribute has a value of 1 if the student took the course associated with that attribute and a value of 0 otherwise. Because students take only a small fraction of all available courses, most of the values in such a data set would be 0. Therefore, it is more meaningful and more efficient to focus on non-zero values.
