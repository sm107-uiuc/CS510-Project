Since its inception in 2006, AWS evolved over the years, now offering over 175 fully-featured services from data centers globally.", "In this article, I would go over the basics of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a web service that allows one to launch instances, which offer secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud.", "Later we will learn to deploy EC2 instances for ML/DL model training purposes.", "3. Configurable CPUs, memory storage, and networking capacity are called the instance types, to run your applications or software on the instance.", "4. Public and private key pairs for secure login into instances.", "5. Instance store volumes for temporary data that are deleted when you stop or terminate your instance.", "6. Access to Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for persistent storage volumes.", "7. Static IPv4 addresses called Elastic IP addresses for dynamic cloud computing.", "8. Deploy Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that are logically isolated from the AWS cloud.", "9. It is an on-demand service and you are charged as per usage until termination of the instance.", "10. When the instance restarts, it moves to a new host computer. It is important to note that you cannot restart a terminated instance but you can make copies of your instance called images and launch new instances from that image.", "11. Amazon EC2 infrastructure is programmable and you can use scripts to automate the deployment process, install and configure.", "12. If you are concerned about sensitive and confidential data on your Amazon EC2 instance, you better encrypt the data before uploading it.", "In order to use EC2 instances, we need to use Amazon Machine Image to create a virtual machine. These virtual computing environments are called instances.", "AMI is a template that holds all the information required to launch an EC2 instance. You can think of AMI as a box that has an operating system, an application server, and applications.", "You can launch instances that are copies of AMIs running as virtual servers in the cloud.", "One can access preconfigured AMIs and customize them as well.", "Multiples instances can be launched from a single AMI, whose hardware is determined by the instance types.", "AWS EC2 instances are available worldwide. The locations have Regions, Availability Zones, Local Zones, and Wavelength Zones.", "Regions are distant and separate geographical areas.", "Each Region has multiple Availability Zones that are isolated locations.", "These isolated locations have Local Zones where you place resources, such as compute and storage, in multiple locations closer to your end-users.", "Wavelength zones deploy AWS with ultra-low latencies to 5G devices and end-users.", "AWS EC2 supports AWS EC2 instance store, AWS EBS, and AWS S3.", "AWS EC2 instance store is temporary, block-level storage. It is located on the disks of the host computer. Since it is temporary storage, data doesn\u2019t persist when the associated instance is stopped or terminated. Thus EC2 Instance store is not meant for long-term data storage. One must opt for EBS or S3 in such cases.", "AWS EC2 instance store is not portable. This means you cannot detach from one instance and attach it to a different instance.", "AWS Elastic Block Store (AWS EBS) is the recommended storage option. It is persistent storage.", "A single instance can have multiple EBS volumes.", "AWS Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) is essentially a storage bucket. You can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.", "One can copy data from EBS, called a snapshot, and save it in S3. This can later be used to create a new EBS volume which can be attached to another EC2 instance. Thus you can detach a volume from an instance and attach it to a different instance.", "The Root Device Volume contains the image used to boot the EC2 instance. This volume is deleted when the instance terminates (the DeleteOnTermination attribute is true). However, this behavior can be changed as well.", "EC2 instances by default have IPv4 addresses when launched into default VPC. In the case of non-default VPC, one should specifically assign IPv4 addresses at the launch.When an instance fails, the replaced instance has a different IPv4 address than the original. If your application needs a static IPv4 address, Amazon EC2 offers Elastic IP addresses.", "Security groups can be used to control access to instances. A single instance can be assigned to multiple groups with specific rules.", "IAM allows you to add users and groups to your AWS account with specific security credentials assigned to each user. Resources can be shared amongst the users in the same account as well as another AWS account. One can control each user's permissions to perform tasks using AWS resources.", "By using IAM with Amazon EC2, you have full control over the users performing tasks with Amazon EC2 and specific AWS resources.", "I hope you have registered an account on AWS. If not do the same. Now head over to the AWS management console.", "After you log in to your AWS console, select EC2 from the drop-down menu labeled Services.", "Before using any AWS service we need to check and if necessary modify the AWS service limit for that particular resource we are planning to use. So let us look into that.", "AWS resources have a default quota know as \u201climits\u201d. These limits are according to the region of your AWS account. For now, I will talk specifically about EC2 instances only.", "1. We first need to select the appropriate AWS region which supports the GPU instances we are choosing to use. We will be using p2.xlarge. P2 are powerful and scalable parallel processing GPU instances.", "2 . Make sure your AWS region supports that particular instance. You can cross-check here.", "3. Now that your region is set, we need to view your EC2 Service Limit report at this link and find your \u201cCurrent Limit\u201d for P2. (Alternatively head over to the EC2 dashboard and click limits and see P2 limit).", "4. Your limit will be 0. What does this mean? AWS sets a limit of 0 on the number of p2.xlarge instances a user can run, which effectively prevents you from launching this instance.", "5. If your limit of p2.xlarge instances is 0, you\u2019ll need to increase the limit before you can launch an instance.", "6. Click on Calculate vCPU limit to make a limit increase request. The limit calculator is used to calculate how many vCPUs (virtual central processing unit) you need to launch your On-Demand Instances, in our case P2.", "7. Click on the add instance type and select p2.xlarge. Make sure the instance count is 1. Verify the New limit is showing 4 vCPUs and then click on the Request limit increase. Requesting for limit increase will not charge your card unless you launch an instance. This will open the following screen. Click on the Service limit increase if it is not already selected.", "8. Your limit type in case details would be EC2 instances. Now, under Requests, select your region of AWS account, then select Primary Instance Type as All P instances. Set the New limit value to greater than 4.", "9. Scroll down fill the Case description your case for the limit increase and click on submit. You will be sent a mail with the corresponding Case ID. You must wait for AWS to approve your Limit Increase Request. AWS typically approves these requests within 48 hours.", "Note: If you have never launched an instance of any type on AWS, you might receive an email from AWS Support asking you to initialize your account by creating an instance before they approve the limit increase.", "Once AWS approves your GPU Limit Increase Request, you can start the process of launching your instance.", "Steps to launch your EC2 GPU instance:", "NOTE: Shutdown any unused instance or other AWS resources or you will be charged by the hour. AWS charges for running instances unitl you stop the instance. However, there are smaller storage charges that continue to accrue until you \u201cterminate\u201d (i.e. delete) the instance.", "There is no way to limit AWS to only a certain budget and have it auto-shutdown when it hits that threshold. However, you can set AWS Billing Alarms.", "9. Access the Jupyter notebook index from your web browser by visiting: X.X.X.X:8888/?token=... (where X.X.X.X is the IP address of your EC2 instance and everything starting with :8888/?token= is what you just copied). HURRAY. There you go. Your Jupyter notebook is up and running on your EC2 instance. Congrats.", "10. To close the notebook, press ctrl-c twice and to exit instance terminal type exit.", "You can activate conda on startup by typing conda config \u2014 set auto_activate_base true", "At times your instance might not have the required packages, just pip install the same.", "If you have a requirements.txt file, just type sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.tx", "Stop and terminate your instances when not in use. You need to understand that AWS charges you even if the instance is not in use. Thus, instances that are On and idle would also burn your pockets. This is one drawback of AWS. Google Cloud on the other hand does not charge you if the instances are idle.", "Congrats! Now you know what is Amazon EC2 and how to use it. AWS is the most used cloud service thus being familiar with 1 or 2 technologies is useful. Amazon EC2 has many more features. Open the EC2 dashboard and learn more. I hope you understood how to deploy a GPU instance. See you at the next one. Cheers!", "Your home for data science.
