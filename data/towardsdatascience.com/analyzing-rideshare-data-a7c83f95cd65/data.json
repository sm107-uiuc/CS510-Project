However, profitability for drivers varies across all these platforms in complicated ways. Drivers are forced to make mental calculations based on the time of day, surge rate, wait time to pick up a rider, etc. for each driving service, and choose to ride for a given service at any point based on the optimization of such factors. As a result of this difficult optimization problem \u2014 given the number of potential factors as well as the many unknowns \u2014 the driver has no certainty that they have chosen the most profitable service with which to ride. Ride King eliminates such uncertainty by pooling historical and to-date data for each driving service based on the driver\u2019s location as well as the time at which the driver is looking to drive. The ultimate goal with Ride King is to eventually extend this optimization service to riders, such that they may be able to select the cheapest rideshare company with which to ride at any given point. The convergence of the respective optimizations for riders and drivers will hopefully detract enough from each rideshare service to engender a better sense of transparency and/or greater payouts for drivers.", "A look at the raw data", "The data collection for this app idea was by no means straightforward. To avoid having their information used for competitive purposes, most rideshare companies will do everything in their power to protect their data. However, with some deliberation, we can actually discover a couple backdoor methods to access these data. All rideshare apps in NYC are under the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and are required by law to submit data on every ride that occurs. With some investigation, the keen observer will find that TLC is part of the NYC Open Data initiative, which was established to increase transparency in state and city affairs. While the data these rideshare companies do provide are incredibly shallow (minimal information per ride), we can still pull quite a bit of information from them. To start us off, however, I\u2018m using Uber data from April 2014 (provided generously by the company, fivethirtyeight) that have a slightly different format to the TLC dataset.", "From a quick glance, we can see that each row in this set provides the date, time, location of pickup (in geographic coordinates), and \u2018base\u2019. We will get to the last column a bit later\u2014for now, let\u2019s just look at the raw data. Please note that, while we could just plot the raw geographic coordinates, I\u2019ve actually overlaid NYC neighborhood boundary data that was generously made public by Zillow. This now has added another dimension to our data!", "Okay, cool. So we can now see all the Uber pickups from April 2014 in Manhattan (zoomed, for readability) with neighborhood boundaries and all! Since the goal of this project is to try and predict the profitability of a rideshare service based on the time of day and location, we\u2019ve only scratched the surface so far, but we can already see that rides are definitely not distributed evenly!", "Now let\u2019s look at the actual data uploaded to TLC by these rideshare services.", "Let\u2019s start by revisiting that last column (\u2019base\u2019 in our first dataset, now \u2018Dispatching_base_number\u2019). The last column of these data is a code corresponding to the base to which each driver reports. Each of these bases is owned by a specific rideshare app, but the current format convolutes the analysis as we aren\u2019t sure which base corresponds to which company. After spending some time searching through government documents on the ownerships of each base code, we are able to create a dictionary that easily converts the confusing base codes with names we are familiar with (e.g. Uber, Lyft, Gett, Via, Juno, Ola, Didi, etc.). Once we map the pickup and drop-off IDs to the actual neighborhoods we can start to do some interesting things\u2026", "As part of my analysis for this app idea, I actually spent months asking rideshare drivers about this problem, and the overwhelming majority told me that the best way to maximize their profits is to minimize the duration of each ride. I did some supplementary analysis to explore this further and, based on the pricing models of each rideshare app, minimizing ride duration actually seems to be the best way to maximize profits. Let\u2019s continue the analysis, again keeping in mind that our goal is now to predict profitability by seeking rides with the shortest duration based on the location and time of day.", "Using the pickup and drop-off times from our TLC dataset, we can readily calculate the ride duration for each row in our data. Aggregating the data by neighborhood, we can analyze the average ride duration as a function of time for each hour of the day and for each rideshare service. What we\u2019re hoping for here is to see a significant dip in the duration of one service compared to the others.", "Just looking at the traces, there is very little separation between the ride duration of each service, and with such high variance, we\u2019d be crazy to think we could reliably predict the duration from the neighborhood or time of day.", "Argh! Still the same issue\u2026 And herein lies the problem of my app idea: location and time of day are insufficient predictors of ride duration. This totally makes sense\u2014would you be comfortable betting your friend $100 on the trip duration of some random Uber you see on the street? It\u2019s a shame that the data show such variance, because this was a really exciting concept. I am sure there are ways to creatively add features to the data to allow for better predictions, but as it stands, I\u2019m not fully convinced that historical data are sufficient to predict the future when it comes to rideshare services.", "While I ultimately did not pursue this app further (data first, always!), this was a really fun experience and was the first time I had run large-scale analysis on millions of rows of data, where efficiency of code becomes a serious factor.", "Your home for data science.
