These studies are mostly conducted in unsupervised manner, since labelling the data in real life projects is a very tough process in terms of requiring a deep retrospective analyses if you already don\u2019t have label information. Keep in mind that outlier detection and anomaly detection are used interchangeably most of the time.", "There is not a magical silver bullet that performs well in all anomaly detection use cases. In this writing, I touch on fundamental methodologies which are mainly utilized while detecting anomalies on time series in an unsupervised way, and mention about simple working principles of them. In this sense, this writing can be thought as an overview about anomaly detection on time series including real life experiences.", "Using Z-score is one of the most straightforward methodology. Z-score basically stands for the number of standart deviation that sample value is below or above the mean of the distribution. It assumes that each features fits a normal distribution, and calculating the z-score of each features of a sample give an insight in order to detect anomalies. Samples which have much features whose values are located far from the means are likely to be an anomaly.", "While estimating the z-scores, you should take into account the several factors that affect the pattern to get more robust inferences. Let me give you an example, you aim detecting anomalies in traffic values on devices in telco domain. Hour information, weekday information, device information(if multiple device exist in dataset) are likely to shape the pattern of traffic values. For this reason, z-score should be estimated by considering each device, hour and weekday for this example. For instance, if you expect 2.5 mbps average traffic on device A at 8 p.m. at weekends, you should take into consideration that value while making a decision for corresponding device and time information.", "One of the drawbacks of this approach is that it assumes that features fit a normal distribution which is not true all the time. Another one can be counted that it ignores the correlations between features in the above mentioned solution. One important point is that z-scores can be used as inputs for other anomaly detection models as well.", "Quartiles-based solution implements a very similar idea to Z-score, differently it takes into account median instead of mean in a simple manner. Sometimes, it achieves better results compared to the z-score depending on distribution of the data.", "Elliptic Envelope is another option for outlier detection, which fits multivariate Gaussian distribution on data. However, it might not perform well with high dimensional data.", "In this methodology, a prediction is performed with a forecasting model for the next time period and if forecasted value is out of confidence interval, the sample is flagged as anomaly. As a forecasting model, LSTM and ARIMA models can be used. The advantage of these methods are that they are well-performing models on time series and can be applied directly on time series without feature engineering step most of the time. On the other hand, estimating the confidence interval is not a trivial and easy task. Furthermore, the accuracy of the forecasting model directly affects the success of anomaly detection. Good news is that you are able to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting model in a supervised manner, even if you are performing anomaly detection without any label info.", "Prophet is also worth to take a look, it is basically a forecasting algorithm designed for time series and developed by Facebook, but I encounter many implementation of this algortihm in anomaly detection use cases.", "Autoencoder is an unsupervised type neural networks, and mainly used for feature extraction and dimension reduction. At the same time, it is a good option for anomaly detection problems. Autoencoder consists of encoding and decoding parts. In encoding part, main features are extracted which represents the patterns in the data, and then each samples is reconstructed in the decoding part. The reconstruction error will be minumum for normal samples. On the other hand, the model is not able to reconstruct a sample that behaves abnormal, resulting a high reconstruction error. So, basically, the higher reconstruction error a sample has, the more likely it is to be an anomaly.", "Autoencoder is very convenient for time series, so it can also be considered among preferential alternatives for anomaly detection on time series. Note that, layers of autoencoders can be composed of LSTMs at the same time. Thus, dependencies in sequential data just like in time series can be captured.", "Self Organizing Maps (SOM) is also another unsupervised neural network based implementation, and it has simpler working principle compared to other neural network models. Although, it does not have a widespread usage in anomaly detection use cases, it is good to keep in mind that it is also an alternative.", "The idea behind usage of clustering in anomaly detection is that outliers don\u2019t belong to any cluster or has their own clusters. k-means is one of the most known clustering algorithms and easy to implement. However, it brings some limitations like picking an appropriate k value. Moreover, it forms spherical clusters which is not correct for all cases. Another drawback is that it is not able to supply a probability while assigning samples to clusters especially considering that clusters can overlap in some situations.", "Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) focus on the abovementioned weaknesses of k-means and present a probabilistic approach. It attemps to find a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions inside the dataset.", "DBSCAN is a density based clustering algorithm. It determines the core points in the dataset which contains at least min_samples around it within epsilon distance, and creates clusters from these samples. After that, it finds all points which are densely reachable(within epsilon distance) from any sample in the cluster and add them to the cluster. And then, iteratively, it performs the same procedure for the newly added samples and extend the cluster. DBSCAN determines the cluster number by itself, and outliers samples will be assigned as -1. In other words, it directly serves for anomaly detection. Note that, it might suffer from perfromance issues with large sized datasets.", "The first algorithm that come to mind is k-nearest neighbor(k-NN) algorithm. The simple logic behind is that outliers are far away from the rest of samples in the data plane. The distances to nearest negihbors of all samples are estimated and the samples located far from the other samples can be flagged as outlier. k-NN can use different distance metrics like Eucledian, Manhattan, Minkowski, Hamming distance etc.", "Another alternative algorithm is Local Outlier Factor (LOF) which identifies the local outliers with respect to local neighbors rather than global data distribution. It utilizes a metric named as local reachability density(lrd) in order to represents density level of each points. LOF of a sample is simply the ratio of average lrd values of the sample\u2019s neighbours to lrd value of the sample itself. If the density of a point is much smaller than average density of its neighbors, then it is likely to be an anomaly.", "Isolation Forest is a tree based, very effective algorithm for detecting anomalies. It builds multiple trees. To build a tree, it randomly picks a feature and a split value within the minimums and maximums values of the corresponding feature. This procedure is applied to all samples in the dataset. And finally, a tree ensemble is composed by averaging all trees in the forest.", "The idea behind the Isolation Forest is that outliers are easy to diverge from rest of the samples in dataset. For this reason, we expect shorter paths from root to a leaf node in a tree(the number of splittings required to isolate the sample) for abnormal samples compared to rest of the samples in dataset.", "Extended Isolation Forest comes with an imporvement to splitting process of Isolation Forest. In Isolation Forest, splitting is performed parallel to the axes, in other saying, in horizontal or vertical manner resulting too much redundant regions in the domain, and similarly over construction of many trees. Extended Isolation Forest remedies these shortcomings by allowing splitting process to happen in every direction, instead of selecting a random feature with a random splitting value, it selects a random normal vector along with a random intercept point.", "Principal Component Analyses (PCA) is mainly used as a dimension reduction method for high dimensional data. In a basic manner, it helps to cover most of the variance in data with a smaller dimension by extracting eigenvectors that have largest eigenvalues. Therefore, it is able to keep most of the information in the data with a very smaller dimension.", "While using PCA in anomaly detection, it follows a very similar approach like Autoencoders. Firstly, it decomposes data into a smaller dimension and then it reconstructs data from the decomposed version of data again. Abnormal samples tend to have a high reconstruction error regarding that they have different behaviors from other observations in data, so it is diffucult to obtain same observation from the decomposed version. PCA can be a good option for multivariate anomaly detection scenarios.", "Your home for data science.
