I feel the current epidemic brings the perfect opportunity for me to make my long-awaited comeback. Let\u2019s dive right into it.", "The Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is heading every global newspaper headline of early 2020. The notorious virus has affected 84,124 people while killing as many as 2,867 people as of 28/02/2020. The epicenter of the virus is the city of Wuhan, located in the Hubei province of Mainland China. China did respond quicker this time as compared to the SARS outbreak in order to restrict the spread of the disease to other regions. However, in spite of their best efforts, there have been a number of suspected and confirmed cases in a lot of other countries. This blog post will serve as a concrete look at the outbreak of the virus.", "The dataset used can be found here on Github. It is published by The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The data is updated twice on a daily basis.", "The data source has three types of data, Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered, available in three separate files. Let\u2019s have a look at it.", "On observing the structure of our data, we see that it has the usual suspects (State, Country, Lat, Long) for a geographical data set. The granularity for each row is available only up till State. On inspecting the State column, we see that it has missing values. Let\u2019s investigate this.", "We see that there is a difference in the number of unique countries when null values in the State column are dropped. The majority of the State data comes from Mainland China followed by the USA. Let\u2019s move onto looking at summary stats.", "There aren\u2019t too many surprises here. Our data has 4332 rows. Everything seems pretty straightforward. Let\u2019s dive deeper into some analysis and visualizations.", "We know that the Coronavirus outbreak originated in China. Hence, it should be our first pick. Let\u2019s try looking at how districts in China have been affected.", "We see the Hubei district clearly has the highest accounts of the virus. As mentioned earlier, the Wuhan city is the capital of the Hubei district. No wonder we see a massive number of confirmed cases in Hubei. The exact number is 65,914. This is particularly fascinating because the total number of confirmed cases worldwide is 84,124. This means that the Hubei district alone accounts for 78.35% of the total number of confirmed cases!", "Let\u2019s try to see what the situation looks like outside of Hubei in China.", "Guangdong has the highest number of confirmed cases(1,348) after Hubei. It is followed by the Henan province(1272).", "From the deaths and recoveries graphs, we can see that the Henan district has the maximum number of deaths and recoveries. A quick Google search shows us that Henan is in fact much closer to Hubei as compared to Guangdong. Perhaps, proximity could be a contributing factor to these high numbers? It would be interesting to perform statistical tests on these assumptions. Maybe we shall revisit this in a later blog post.", "This graph is a time series plot of Coronavirus cases in China. We can see a sudden surge in the number of confirmed cases between Feb 12th and Feb 13th followed by a flattening of the slope. Perhaps information regarding diagnosis and treatment improved around this time? This assumption is supported by the fact that the slope of the red recovery line gets steeper towards the latter part of the graph indicating a rise in the number of cases recovered. \ud83d\ude42", "Let\u2019s slowly shift our attention from China to the rest of the world.", "South Korea has the largest number of confirmed cases outside China. There are 2,337 cases of Coronavirus in the country.", "A very interesting number to note is that after South Korea, Italy has the most number of confirmed cases at 888. A few hours ago, I received news that a big Italian league football game is postponed due to efforts to tackle the virus. A professor of infectious diseases in Milan, Italy said that the virus might have been inside the European country for weeks before the first few cases were detected. It looks like Italy may have a long road ahead of it.", "Let\u2019s look at how many cases have proved to be fatal outside China.", "Iran (34) followed by Italy (21) have the most casualties due to the virus outside China. An Iranian MP has died due to the virus according to reports from the Middle Eastern Country. Subsequently, a number of countries have decided to ban flights to and from Iran.", "Although South Korea has the highest number of cases outside China, the mortality rate of the virus in the country is fairly low.", "We have only looked at deaths around the world so far. Let\u2019s look at how well countries around the world have fought against the virus.", "We can see that a number of countries seemingly have a 100% recovery rate from the virus. At first glance, it may seem that Vietnam, Belgium, India, etc. have demonstrated a phenomenal response to the outbreak. However, percentage relies a great deal on the denominator which, in this case, happens to be the number of confirmed cases. Let\u2019s see what happens when we filter out countries with top recovery percentages.", "All of the countries with a 100% recovery percentage have the number of confirmed cases less than 20. In comparison, Singapore (93) and Thailand (41) both have significantly higher cases. Singapore has a recovery rate of 68% while Thailand\u2019s is 66%. The two neighboring Asian countries seem to be doing a really good job of treating the virus. Great news! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "Let\u2019s now replicate the time-series graph we used for China for the rest of the world.", "We can see that there is a steep increase in the number of confirmed cases post-February 23. There have been recent news reports that mention the rapid growth of the number of cases around the world.", "Finally, here is an animated Geoplot showing the spread of the virus worldwide.", "Initially, we see blobs only in China and the surrounding regions. At the turn of around 20th February, Europe sees a big rise in the number of cases. This is consistent with the aforementioned observations on this blog post.", "Coronavirus is one of the most trending topics in today\u2019s media. Journalists are calling it deadly. Global markets have seen $7 trillion wiped out due to fear of the outbreak. Epidemiologists are unsure about the deadliness of the virus.", "In spite of all the insights provided in this post, there might be many more undetected cases all around the world.", "\u201cAbsence of evidence is not evidence of absence\u201d \u2014 Carl Sagan", "If you are in an area affected by the virus or traveling to China, be sure to follow these instructions to stay safe.", "I hope all of you enjoyed this post.
