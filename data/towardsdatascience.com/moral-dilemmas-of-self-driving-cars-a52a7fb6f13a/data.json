I mean, who wouldn\u2019t?", "But they\u2019re not perfect. If you think about it, self-driving cars have to make decisions like you and I. They don\u2019t eliminate the possibility of collisions (yet)\u2026 just decrease the chances of it happening in the first place.", "During an accident, they\u2019re not exactly choosing who to kill, but they are choosing who not to kill. Cars don\u2019t go out murdering people on purpose, but in case of a collision they specifically avoid whatever they are told to. If the choice is between two different groups of people, then choosing not to kill one would be deadly to the other. So it\u2019s all about priorities and values. This is a fundamental consideration that programmers take into account because they decide what the computer does, what course of action the car takes during its course. So who, what, and how does someone decide?", "If you have watched Circle (2015) on Netflix, you know a bit about how it goes. If you haven\u2019t, watch it! It really gets you thinking about the future of humanity, and the psychological decisions we make on a day-to-day basis \u2014 an hour an a half of pure \u201cLiving in the Present\u201d, or whatever they say. The premise of the movie is simple: 50 people are in a room, and only 1 can make it out alive \u2014 sort of like an \u2018ultimate goal\u2019. But they choose as a collective (although not always) who deserves to die. Each person has a different story, and could be worthy of getting out alive. So they choose.", "What you think is the \u2018right\u2019 moral choice is going to be different than what the people around you think. Because there is morality is subjective \u2014 and every single person\u2019s values differ. We are also all very flawed, whether you like it or not: we make decisions from prejudgements and bias from our past experiences.", "It\u2019s also really hard to debate on whether you should save Person A or Person B in an accident because you\u2019re judging the value of a human being based on some abstract criteria that you\u2019ve made up and what is socially accepted.", "To my teachers\u2026 where was the mark scheme for what constitutes a good human being?", "So instead of universal morality, there is a generally accepted consensus of what is \u2018more important to society\u2019. Doctors, pregnant women, and children are common people to value, and it\u2019s not hard to figure out why (I elaborate on this later below). Even in the Titanic, women and children were the first to leave on the safety boats. Obviously, other things played into that\u2026but still.", "It\u2019s actually interesting to see who would pick what. It says a lot about their character, just like the classic trolley problem. At the end of the \u201cCircle\u201d, you can see who the other groups in different rooms decided to save. The same \u2018themes of life\u2019 return: which do we value: the group or the individual?", "When you think about a collision either protecting your pregnant sister and her husband, who\u2019s a doctor or a random stranger, I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and guess that you\u2019d save your sister and brother-in-law.", "But what if it was the random stranger that was in the vehicle? Say that in order to save your family, the stranger would have to die. You\u2019d probably still want to go through with that. Say the stranger was in the self-driving vehicle too \u2014 you\u2019d probably still pick to save your sister, her husband and her baby. And I get it, because people don\u2019t always want to save the passengers \u2014 it\u2019s more about how many and what types of people are killed.", "Cars can be programmed to do the \u2018best case scenario\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s easy. The hard part is that nobody wants to buy a car that would sacrifice its passengers in case of an accident. So that\u2019s bad for businesses: how do they market or sell their product? Should they be programmed to avoid intervention and collision at all costs? And what if the pregnant mother, and husband were breaking the law by jaywalking? There are no definitive answers.", "My inspiration for this article came from personal intrigue, but also because I took an MIT quiz that made you choose on a course of action (and who not to kill) in different scenarios with a self-driving car.", "At the end of the quiz, they give you a summary of results. Surprisingly, my \u2018Most Saved Character\u2019 was a female doctor while my \u2018Most Killed Character\u2019 was an elderly man. I felt pretty bad about this\u2026but it makes sense as to why in terms of their practical, functional value and based on my personal bias and past experiences.", "Note also that this isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate indicator of what you would do when you were placed in that exact situation. Obviously, everything is different in theory versus in practice.", "Take the ultimate ethical test: The Moral Machine \u2014 MIT", "When you see your results, you\u2019ll also see how you compare to the other people who have taken the test. Overall, people had a tendency to save girls over boys. This goes back to some old biological reasoning since women are the ones who reproduce and have children, but it isn\u2019t be the only one. There\u2019s still a stereotype that women are \u2018caregivers\u2019 and display maternal behaviours, which makes killing them all the more cruel.", "It\u2019s interesting to think that people in today\u2019s world would save a woman over a man. Obviously this small sample size isn\u2019t a definitive statistic, but it does provide a suggestive tendency. If you think about gender roles and the past masculine superiority, you can see how things have progressed. I\u2019m not saying that the underlying bias doesn\u2019t exist anymore, either \u2014 just take a look at the gender discrepancy in the STEM field!", "Not only do people save girls over boys, but they will save humans over animals, time and time again. There\u2019s a species preference, simply because we are human and have basic instincts of self-preservation. It\u2019s slightly different if you have a personal connection with that animal, like if it\u2019s your pet. We are inherently selfish.", "I told you before that my \u2018Most Killed Character\u2019 was an old man. I don\u2019t know if I consciously agree with this, because I really do think there\u2019s value in the elder population.", "There is no denying that there is wisdom and knowledge to be gained from older generations based on their past experiences. While they might not concretely contribute to the society in the most typical way, who is to say that their knowledge and/or wisdom is invalid?", "Granted, times change. Apparent wisdom of the 10th century doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to all generations that follow. Basically, take everything with a grain of salt.", "For young people, there\u2019s a gamble. You might be inclined to save them, because they have a whole life ahead of them. I know that\u2019s what I did. What that means is that they have the potential to be great, do incredible things, and change the world. That could very well be the next Elon Musk! On the flip side, that also means young children have the potential to be really really bad people\u2026 Not to name examples, but you get the idea. Sorry. But it\u2019s the truth, whether you like it or not.", "When making decisions, I found myself picking the doctor over the homeless person, time and time again. And I\u2019m not the only one, based on the average. I honestly don\u2019t think this is a good way of thinking, because social status should not be the determining factor of whether you live or die.", "All countries showed a disturbing preference for saving people of higher status [for example, executives over homeless people]. We found this is quite strongly linked to the level of economic inequality in a country. Where there was greater inequality, there was greater preference to sacrifice the homeless.", "- Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bonnefon, Toulouse School of Economics", "We value doctors because we see their work as being essential to the survival of humankind \u2014 and honestly, it is. Not everyone can do the job, and you need lots of education to be able to practice medicine. What people don\u2019t look at is the fact that it isn\u2019t the only role that someone needs to live a healthy and fulfilling life. No farmers? Can\u2019t eat. No engineers? Don\u2019t have computers, bridges, factories, you name it. No educators? How will you learn?", "I\u2019ve realized that the quiz in itself is flawed because the information given about the different choices is limited \u2014 they only give gender and occasionally a job \u2014 but there are still questions to be raised.", "Is it an inherent societal flaw that we how much we value a person is based on what they contribute to society? The answer is yes.", "Thinking about this problem as \u2018choosing who not to kill\u2019 is harsh. But it\u2019s the reality of our situation, and we all know it.", "So what\u2019s the answer? You just slam on the car brakes\u2026before the accident occurs! Haha, no \u2014 I\u2019m just kidding \u2014 but while that is a possibility, creating self-driving cars has to account for a ton of different scenarios, including the situation where you can\u2019t slam the brakes and the car has to make an ethical decision on who to kill. It might be rare (or we hope), but the consideration is inevitable.", "The point is, there is no real answer. And that\u2019s a problem because there is no recipe for what is \u2018right\u2019 and what is \u2018wrong\u2019. Each and every one of us would save different people, so who\u2019s ethics are the self-driving cars programmed to follow?", "It\u2019s not about 0.001% chance of this particular scenario with self-driving cars deciding who to kill, but rather how risk factors are being distributed. I don\u2019t have the be-all-end-all answers to any of these questions, but I hope I gave you something to think about.", "Let me know what you think!", "Follow me on Linkedin and Medium for more.", "Your home for data science.
