Wrangling means a round-up or to take charge of livestock like horses and wrangler is a person who takes charge of livestock, rounds them up, and organizes them in a group. The exact same concept applies to data wrangling. So before proceeding with further analysis, you should wrangle your data for better insights.", "In this story, I offer a simple 3-word explanation of data wrangling for you.", "Data wrangling is the process of gathering the data, assessing it for quality, and cleaning the data.", "Raw data collected for a project from various sources are usually in different formats and not suitable for further analysis and modeling. Sometimes, this gathered data is not really clean and well structured. This makes working with such data difficult which leads to making mistakes, getting misleading insights, and wasting your valuable time.", "It is often said, data wrangling costs 70% to 80% of entire project time leaving only 20% to 30% time for exploration and modeling.", "The data obtained at the end of the data wrangling process is then used for further analysis, visualization, or building models using machine learning.", "Data wrangling transforms the raw data into a cleaned, well structured data", "Below three easy-to-understand pictures will give you an idea about the entire data wrangling process.", "Depending on your data science project, the required data can be acquired from a single file or it can be spread over several resources and different formats.", "Sometimes data gathering can be a challenging task.", "Python comes for your help. With its libraries, python provides many useful functions to extract the data out of different resources. Depending on the data resources and its format, data gathering can have different steps. If data is in a file, then gathering is downloading the file and reading it into your project. For this Python, pandas provide a wide range of read_ functions as shown in the below picture.", "Another way is collecting data from databases, scraping the data from a website, or gather it with the help of API. API stands for Application Programming Interface, which helps you to get the data from applications like Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, and so on.", "API is an application specific ready-made code", "Data can also be collected through experiments and data loggers. If you use any application for your experiment and data logging, search for its APIs. At my work, I usually experiment with heat chambers and use PicoLog data logger API to collect the required data.", "Curious about how data can be gathered directly from the web page?? Here is an interesting 4-minute read about web scraping.", "After gathering, it is time to assess your collected data. But wait...what you are going to assess?? And the answer is,", "This is not data exploration, but you will be checking how dirty and messy your data is. The poor quality data has issues with its contents and such data is dirty data. Usually observed quality-related issues are, missing values, inconsistent data, incorrect data types, and duplicates. On the other hand, messy data has issues with its structure i.e. tidiness issues. As said by Hadley Wickham in his paper Tidy Data, the data is tidy when,", "Further, the data can be assessed visually and programmatically.", "Visual assessment is simple, just open the data with any application you like, scroll it, and look for quality, tidiness issues. In Jupyter Notebook data can be viewed using head(), tail() and sample() methods.", "The programmatic assessment uses small code snippets and Python functions to check the data quality. Pandas offer a wide range of methods to check the data quality.", "Now it is time to clean and organize your data. The data cleaning step is always focused on solving the quality and tidiness issues found in the data assessment stage. Being a wrangler, until now, you have just collected the data and looked at its problems. Now it is time to act, round up, and organize it well for getting better outcomes.", "Depending on the problem and data type, different data cleaning techniques are used.", "One of the thing which can be quickly checked is the correlation between different variables using seaborn.pairplot(). With such a plot, you will get a partial idea about which variables are unimportant for your analysis and will help you to decide which columns to drop.", "If you have multiple similar types of datasets in the same project then it is a good idea to combine this data in a single dataset. When such data merging is performed then there is the possibility of duplicate or repeated data points in the final dataset. These duplicate entries can be simply removed.", "Here is an interesting 5-minute read about merging the datasets,", "Another often observed problem is, having incorrect datatypes. While data cleaning, you should ensure that the numbers are stored as numeric values, date and time values should be stored as andatetime object, and so on. Python functions such as pandas.to_numeric(), pandas.to_datetime(), pandas.to_timedelta() and pandas.DataFrame.astype() are always available for your help.", "Ultimately, dirty and messy data gets corrected by removing or replacing incorrect entries, removing irrelevant variables, and adding new variables.", "The quality and structure of the data are the two important aspects to get better insights into data. Even after the data is cleaned, it is always a good idea to reassess the data to ensure the required quality and tidiness. That\u2019s why data wrangling is viewed as an iterative process in the first graphic. Remember, good quality and well-organized data powers further analysis, visualization, and modeling.", "Thank you for your time and for reading!!", "I hope you enjoyed this 3-word explanation of data wrangling.
