Recent, initiatives include identifying patients who are at high risk of an extended length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and creating personalized interventions to reduce their time in the hospital and exposure to HCAIs.\u00b2", "For this project, I leveraged linear regression to predict patient length of stays upon admission, and to identify key factors that contribute to extended stays.", "Inspired by Daniel Cummings\u2019 article on using machine learning to predict LOS, I leveraged MIT\u2019s MIMIC-III open source database which consists of de-identified information from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston. Within the database, I merged tables that included patient demographic and diagnoses information.", "Shown in figure 1a below, patient LOS ranged from 0\u2013294 days. I realized however, that the accuracy of my prediction would have different significance at different scales. For example, if a patient is staying for 100 days, the accuracy of the prediction is less important than if a patient is only staying for 3 days. With this in mind, I decided to focus on short-term patients who are staying at the hospital for at most 30 days. Figure 1b shows the LOS distribution.", "MIMIC, which includes data from 2001\u20132012, tracks patients through multiple visits. To reduce the autocorrelation error from patients who are returning to the hospital after recent visits, I leveraged only first-time admissions in my analysis.", "With only categorical features, the best way to explore the data was to look at each individual feature\u2019s relationship with LOS to identify patterns. Below are a few highlights from my exploration.", "Age: My first step was to create a new column that included the age of the patients. As part of the de-identification process, all dates associated with a given patient were adjusted a random number of years. However, the number of years within a single patient was consistent which meant that date_of_birth (DOB) and addmission_date could be used to calculate the patient\u2019s age. Shown in figure 2, older patients tended to stay in the hospital for longer time periods than younger patients.", "Admission Type: At BIDMC patient admission type is categorized into four groups. Emergency indicates that a patient came in needing immediate intervention to address a life threatening condition. Urgent indicate the need for immediate care to address a physical or mental condition that is not considered life threatening. Elective is used for patients with pre-planned medical attention and newborn indicates the admission event pertains to a birth. Figure 3 below shows that patients in need of urgent and emergency care generally spent longer times in the hospital. I speculate that urgent patients generally spend the longest time in the hospital because they require intensive medical care but they might be a lower priority of attendance than emergency patients.", "ICD9 Codes: The greatest challenge I faced came in the form of over 6,000 unique ICD9 codes which are used to indicate diagnoses. The dataset documentation outlined a method for interpreting the ICD9 codes that includes looking at the first three numbers for the general diagnoses and then leveraging the last two numbers to identify the specific condition. From there, the ICD9 codes were able to be grouped into 18 broader categories which I scraped from Wikipedia.", "Using a Linear Regression model with cross-validation I was able to predict a given patient\u2019s length of stay with a mean absolute error of 3.75 days. Within the 20% of my data that was withheld for testing, figure 4 visualizes the actual patient LOS and the predicted LOS.", "From this model, I was able to see which factors have the greatest influence on LOS which would be central to hospital\u2019s identifying high-risk patients. Figure 5 below shows the features that most significantly contributed to the model. The coefficients can be directly compared to understand the relative weight of each factor in the model\u2019s prediction.", "Because I only used data that is available at patient intake, the dataset was limited to mostly categorical features which limited predictability. A way to enhance the model would be to include information that is obtained shortly after admission including vital signs and patient history. Additionally, further analysis is needed to identify which features contribute most significantly on shorter and longer time scales. From there, a categorization model could be used to separate patients into non-overnight, short-term, and long term stay candidates before a regression is used to predict LOS.", "Your home for data science.
