I wanted to do computer vision for cars, and the professor I wanted to work with had left the university. So I went to the Computer Vision Research Lab (CVRL), and I asked what research they had available. Most of their work at the time was biometrics, and 3D face sounded interesting. It could pay the bills and give me experience that would translate to autonomous vehicles. Little did I know, I would still be in biometrics 13 years later.", "For my dissertation project, I built a 3D face scanner that the subject would walk through. Data sets were small; the biggest data set was FRGCv2 at 4,006 images of a few hundred subjects. I went through a few prototypes, and I got to a point where I did small scale data collection.", "I was bent on quantity at the time, and if I did it all over again, I would have spent more time improving the quality before scaling up. So I scaled up from ~300 face scans to ~4,500. I encountered major drop frame issues for a quarter of the data, calibration issues for another chunk of data, and I found getting people to comply with protocol to be difficult (i.e. they walked far too fast through the setup).", "For all the mistakes, I learned. A Ph.D. is a vehicle to make mistakes doing research to help form your character towards the research process. I also fell in love with 3D face recognition, and I saw the problem in the same realm of difficulty as autonomous vehicles.", "I did not want to do biometrics because at the time, most biometric research was government funded, and I could only imagine the bad scenarios coming out of the research. However, it was an interesting problem, and I thought one day, it would be used for non-government entities. My thinking was \u201cOne day, 15 to 20 years from now, every phone will use 3D face to authenticate because it has more potential and raw data to do comparisons.\u201d", "I went to work for Digital Signal Corp (DSC) doing 3D face recognition research. I did move out of sensor design, but I stayed in my sliver of expertise in the realm of biometrics and computer vision. I was excited that I could hit the ground running and push the pearls of my research into a product.", "I solved some interesting problems there like handling sunglasses, assessing quality, greatly improving recognition performance, and fixing bad quality data. However, two elements held us back from reaching true greatness for our algorithms:", "In my time there, I did DOE for only 4 large collections in 4 years, or they were large by our standards. One was for glasses, one was for pose, one was miscellaneous, and one was system validation for a customer. They involved between 10 and 50 subjects with a total of 1,000 scans between all four.", "I had pushed for more data collection, but to get more data required pulling time from people there or going external. Both cost time and money, and people didn\u2019t quite see the benefit. We were working with FGRCv2 and a few other research sets. The mindset was not yet there for us or our managers that the algorithm was the data. The reality is that everyone wanted a quick solution to a very challenging problem.", "3D face recognition works fantastic for frontal images and one aggressor, but to get to the real world, one has to work with data across multiple aggressors and environments plus the intrinsic variables like ethnicity, age, and gender.", "Again, the technology was cool but also creepy. DSC\u2019s sensor was for surveillance for building security. Their scanner worked at 15 to 25 meters away even while the subject was walking. That\u2019s a whole new level of creepy if in the wrong hands. It was worth considering who their main financial backer was at the time.", "When I started at Apple, I thought I was out of biometrics. I was sad, but the Watch work didn\u2019t have the downsides of face recognition. Then I found out about Face ID, and I just had to work on it. I switched over, and I was surprised at how well it worked as well as how the aggressors were being addressed.", "Face ID was a huge project. On initial launch, about 1,000 engineers were working on the entire hardware module, software, and infrastructure. Everyone was driving hard, so the amount of motivation and ambition was very intriguing. Just being in that environment changed how I looked at problems, and I had to figure out how to get my work done more efficiently. We knew this would make a huge impact, and so it was exciting knowing this new user experience was coming.", "We collected an amazing amount of data. 1,000,000,000 images were collected as announced in the Keynote. That\u2019s a number difficult to imagine and not just the collection, but the infrastructure and processing requirements to even train an algorithm on such a set of data.", "We all learned very quickly that data would solve almost any issue. Find the troublesome areas, collect a bunch of data, add it to training, and the problems got lessened. Upper management was not timid about paying to collect data. They always wanted justifications, but they believed us and trusted us. It was a great feeling. We weren\u2019t asked to limit our thinking to what was affordable or possible but to expand our thinking to what was necessary to drive innovation.", "Face ID was scary too because we were all in. There was no backup plan. Face ID just had to work. It was also scary because until a few months before announce, nobody had lived on phones with Face ID because they didn\u2019t exist. We weren\u2019t sure we had accounted for everything, and we all were digging deep to make sure we didn\u2019t leave anything unturned. The trick was always prioritizing which aggressors were more important. I really enjoyed it.", "Of course, the project has changed, and I still like it, but it doesn\u2019t have the new edge as before. It doesn\u2019t have the same bang. It\u2019s just another problem crushed by the power of CNN\u2019s.", "For me, my dissertation and previous work in 3D face recognition meant I had been in this niche field for a decade from research to mass consumer product. CNN\u2019s and data solved this huge problem much faster than I had expected. It\u2019s really amazing to have seen 3D face recognition from its infancy to impacting millions of people every day.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
