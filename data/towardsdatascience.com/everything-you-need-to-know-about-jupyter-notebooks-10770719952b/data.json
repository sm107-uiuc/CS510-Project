The ipython kernel, referenced in this guide, executes python code. Kernels for many other languages exist (official kernels).", "When you open a Notebook document, the associated kernel is automatically launched. When the notebook is executed (either cell-by-cell or with menu Cell -> Run All), the kernel performs the computation and produces the results. Depending on the type of computations, the kernel may consume significant CPU and RAM. Note that the RAM is not released until the kernel is shut-down.", "Let us proceed to analyze the various functions in the Kernel menu icon that will be useful for Data Science projects.", "Since we have already discussed the \u201cFile\u201d and \u201cKernel options in the main menu bar in detail, let us briefly look at the other options and the functionalities they offer us.", "We will discuss this icon palette starting from the first icon, which is the save option, until the end. This command palette will be useful for quickly completing the majority of your tasks.", "You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing crtl + enter for running the particular cell or shift + enter to run the current cell as well create a new cell below it. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.", "The above image is a representation of how each of these cells can run as separate code blocks. In the first code cell you can notice that we have used the print statement for printing a basic \u201cHello World!\u201d program.", "However, similar to a command prompt or python shell, the variables defined, assigned, or obtained can be run at the end of the code cell or in a new code cell to receive the held value. The code cells [2] and [3] are a representation of the same.", "Finally, the code cells can also be used as a calculator to perform a variety of tasks ranging from addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power (**), and many more functions. You can also utilize these code blocks for programming your python or Data Science projects.", "Text can be added to Jupyter Notebooks using Markdown cells. You can change the cell type to Markdown by using the Cell menu, the toolbar, or the key shortcut m. Markdown is a popular markup language that is a superset of HTML.", "Markdowns are a way to make your Jupyter Notebooks more presentable and help to make the viewers or readers a more concise understanding of your code. You can add headers, images, widgets, bullet points, ordered lists, hyperlinks, and so much more.", "More details about its specifications can be found here. To learn more about Markdowns visit the official documentation here.", "Below is a image representation of most of the essential shortcut commands of the Jupyter Notebook.", "I have discussed most of the necessary shortcuts throughout the course of this article. However, if you want to learn and explore more about the various shortcut options available, then click on the help and open shortcut command options for a more detailed guide to these shortcut choices in the Jupyter Notebook.", "We have understood some of the details and in-depth mechanisms of Jupyter Notebooks.
