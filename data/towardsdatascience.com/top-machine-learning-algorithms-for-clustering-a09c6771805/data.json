Therefore, clustering algorithms look for similarities or dissimilarities among data points. Clustering is an unsupervised learning method so there is no label associated with data points. Clustering algorithms try to find the underlying structure of the data.", "There are different approaches and algorithms to perform clustering tasks which can be divided into three sub-categories:", "All of these approaches aim to group data into clusters. The methods they use slightly differ. I will explain each approach in detail with a common algorithm of each approach. Before starting on the topic, I would like point out the difference between clustering and classification.", "Partition-based clustering techniques try to create partitions of data based on a distance measurement applied to data points. The most common algorithm of this approach is k-means clustering.", "K-means clustering aims to partition data into k clusters in a way that data points in the same cluster are similar and data points in the different clusters are farther apart.", "Similarity of two points is determined by the distance between them.", "There are many methods to measure the distance. Euclidean distance (minkowski distance with p=2) is one of most commonly used distance measurements.", "K-means clustering tries to minimize distances within a cluster and maximize the distance between different clusters. K-means algorithm is not capable of determining the number of clusters. We need to define it when creating the KMeans object which may be a challenging task.", "K-means is an iterative process. It is built on expectation-maximization algorithm. After number of clusters are determined, it works by executing the following steps:", "Note: Initial centroids are chosen randomly which may cause final clusters to be somewhat different. To overcome this issue, scikit learn provides n_init parameter. The k-means algorithm run \u201cn_init\u201d times with different initial centroids and final results will be determined according to n_init consecutive runs.", "This approach works by building a hierarchy of clusters. Hierarchical clustering means creating a tree of clusters by iteratively grouping or separating data points. There are two types of hierarchical clustering:", "One of the advantages of hierarchical clustering is that we do not have to specify the number of clusters (but we can).", "Agglomerative clustering is kind of a bottom-up approach. Each data point is assumed to be a separate cluster at first. Then the similar clusters are iteratively combined. Let\u2019s go over an example to explain the concept clearly.", "We have a dataset consists of 9 samples. I choose numbers associated with these samples to demonstrate the concept of similarity. At each iteration (or level), the closest numbers (i.e. samples) are combined together. As you can see in the figure below, we start with 9 clusters. The closest ones are combined at the first level and then we have 7 clusters. The number of black lines that intersect with blue lines represents the number of clusters.", "The figure above is called dendrogram which is a diagram representing tree-based approach. In hierarchical clustering, dendrograms are used to visualize the relationship among clusters.", "As we go up, the number of clusters decreases as more samples are combined. After level 6, all samples are combined under one big cluster.", "One of the advantages of hierarchical clustering is that we do not have to specify the number of clusters beforehand. However, it is not wise to combine all data points into one cluster. We should stop combining clusters at some point. Scikit-learn provides two options for this:", "Divisive clustering is not commonly used in real life so I will mention it briefly. Simple yet clear explanation is that divisive clustering is the opposite of agglomerative clustering. We start with one giant cluster including all data points. Then data points are separated into different clusters. It is an up to bottom approach.", "Hierarchical clustering is useful and gives better results if the underlying data has some sort of hierarchy.", "Some common use cases of hierarchical clustering:", "Partition-based and hierarchical clustering techniques are highly efficient with normal shaped clusters. However, when it comes to arbitrary shaped clusters or detecting outliers, density-based techniques are more efficient.", "The data points in these figures are grouped in arbitrary shapes or include outliers. Density-based clustering algorithms are very effienct at finding high-density regions and outliers. It is very important to detect outliers for some task, e.g. anomaly detection. One of the most commonly used algorithm of this approach is DBSCAN.", "DBSCAN stands for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise. It is able to find arbitrary shaped clusters and clusters with noise (i.e. outliers).", "The main idea behind DBSCAN is that a point belongs to a cluster if it is close to many points from that cluster.", "There are two key parameters of DBSCAN:", "Based on these two parameters, points are classified as core point, border point, or outlier:", "These points may be better explained with visualizations. The following figure is taken from Wikipedia:", "In this case, minPts is 4. Red points are core points because there are at least 4 points within their surrounding area with radius eps. This area is shown with the circles in the figure. The yellow points are border points because they are reachable from a core point and have less than 4 points within their neighborhood. Reachable means being in the surrounding area of a core point. The points B and C have two points (including the point itself) within their neigborhood (i.e. the surrounding area with a radius of eps). Finally N is an outlier because it is not a core point and cannot be reached from a core point.", "We have learned the definitions of parameters and different type points. Now we can talk about how the algoritm works. It is actually quite simple:", "Note: A point that is marked as noise may be revisited and be part of a cluster.", "The distance between points is determined using a distance measurement method as in k-means algorithm. The most commonly used method is euclidean distance.", "By applying these steps, DBSCAN algorithm is able to find high density regions and separate them from low density regions.", "A cluster includes core points that are neighbors (i.e. reachable from one another) and all the border points of these core points. The required condition to form a cluster is to have at least one core point. Although very unlikely, we may have a cluster with only one core point and its border points.", "Thanks for reading.
