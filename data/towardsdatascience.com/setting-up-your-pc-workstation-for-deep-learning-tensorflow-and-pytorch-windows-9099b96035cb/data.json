Surprisingly, even setting up the environment for doing Deep Learning isn\u2019t that easy. Chances of you breaking something during this process is actually pretty high. I have experienced setting up everything required for Deep Learning from scratch quite a few times, albeit in a different more programmer-friendly OS in Linux. (a guide on that is next in line)", "There are very few articles explaining the same process for Windows at the moment. So I decided to give it a shot. Recently, after breaking things a few times, I finally found a proper solution to this problem. Not only this method results in a successful setup but it is also much easier than what I\u2019ve seen most others do.", "Who this tutorial is for and more importantly why Windows?", "Trust me I am also not a big fan of playing with CUDA on Windows. But more often than not, as developers, we end up working on a laptop or on a powerful rig that\u2019s not only utilized for Deep Learning or programming. In that case, you can\u2019t afford to completely get rid of Windows. If you\u2019re one of those people or just another casual reader owning a Windows machine who\u2019s not that comfortable with Linux in general, this guide is for you.", "Here are a few things we\u2019ll be covering in this article,", "You definitely need an Nvidia GPU to follow along if you\u2019re planning to set it up with GPU support.", "Developing Deep Learning applications involves training neural networks, which are compute-hungry by nature. It is also by nature more and more parallelization friendly which takes us more and more towards GPUs which are good at exactly that. That is why GPUs come in handy, the vast majority of the deep learning frameworks support GPU-acceleration out of the box so developers and researchers can get productive in minutes without doing any GPU programming which can tend to hold them back.", "Most of these frameworks (only) support something called CUDA \u2014 which can only work with Nvidia GPUs, that\u2019s why you specifically need one from Nvidia. However, it is not impossible on AMD\u2019s cards, for more information visit this page.", "If you\u2019re not going to set up for GPU, no problem you can still follow along.", "But of course, you should have a decent CPU, RAM and Storage to be able to do some Deep Learning.", "My hardware \u2014 I set this up on my personal laptop which has the following configuration,", "For anyone who is interested in knowing about the configurations, I recommend a decent CPU with a minimum of 4 cores and at 2.6GHz, at least 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia GPU with at least of 6GB VRAM.", "For this tutorial, you obviously need to be on Windows 10. I assume some basic knowledge of Python packages and environments. Nonetheless, it will all be explained.", "It is recommended that you\u2019re in the latest stable build of 64-bit Windows 10.", "This tutorial also assumes that you start the installation process on a freshly installed Operating System. If not you can still follow along if you really know what you\u2019re doing.", "The first step is, of course, to install Python. I recommend installing Python through Mini-Conda. For absolute beginners, I will briefly explain why.", "Conda is a package manager that helps you with installing, managing and removing all your different packages. It is not the only one though, there is pip \u2014 python\u2019s default package manager which I really like. Here we go with conda as it is much more straight-forward and simple to set up in Windows.", "Anaconda and Mini-Conda are software distributions that come with some very useful Data Science/ML packages preinstalled to save some of your time. Anaconda contains over 150 packages that help in doing Data Science and Machine Learning, which includes everything you might ever need whereas Mini-Conda only comes with a handful of really necessary tools and packages.", "I recommend going with Mini-Conda because I like to have (almost) complete control over what packages get installed. Keeping things light is indeed not a bad thing at all. It can save you some storage space and of course, you\u2019ll not have some 50 odd packages that you probably never use.", "To install Mini-Conda, go to this link below, https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html", "Download the Python3 installers for Windows 64-bit and install it as you\u2019d install any other Windows software. Make sure to tick the checkbox which asks if you want conda and python to be added to PATH.", "Now you can check if you have python and conda installed by running the following commands. They should display the version numbers otherwise you might need to correctly install mini-conda and add it to PATH.", "Next step is to install jupyter-notebook, paste the following command in your command-line interface,", "You can verify your installation by running the jupyter notebook, which opens up jupyter notebook for you on the browser.", "This is an important step often missed by many people. It is understandable to use something that contains every known package like Anaconda but to work on your projects and actually build stuff you probably need a custom environment specific to that project or the nature of the work you\u2019re doing. Another great advantage of using a dedicated virtual environment is you can isolate your packages from interacting with global settings which means if by any chance you mess up the packages in your environment you can always throw it away without affecting any of the global packages.", "It also gives you the flexibility to create environments with any python version backwards in time. So you can stay away from all the new unstable stuff for a while and upgrade later based on support.", "Creating a conda environment is fairly simple, I am creating it with the name tensorflow for the sake of explainability, you can set it to whatever you want. I am going with python 3.7 because I know it is well supported by Tensorflow. You can verify this through their documentation.

By the way, you don\u2019t have to worry about your card\u2019s title exactly matching what\u2019s listed in the webpage, Max-Q and Super are all just designs sharing the same underlying architecture with some differences in TDP, number of CUDA cores and Tensor cores.", "For instance, if you own an RTX 2080 Super or 2080 Max-Q or even a 2080 Super Max-Q \u2014 it is completely fine if you can just find RTX 2080 in that list. But if your own an RTX 2080Ti or something with Ti at the end, it just means you own the highest-end variant from that particular series, so most probably you\u2019ll find it up there with more capability in terms of VRAM and number of CUDA and Tensor cores.", "To be able to use Tensorflow 2.0 your card\u2019s compute capability must be higher than 3.5 but it is recommended that you have atleast 6 for a better experience. Tensorflow 2.0 also needs CUDA version 10 which in turn requires your driver version to be 418.x or higher.", "PyTorch requires your CUDA version to be atleast 9.2 or higher, it supports 10.1 and 10.2 as well. The compute capability must be atleast higher than 3.0", "CuDNN \u2014 CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization, and activation layers.", "(Optional) TensorRT \u2014 NVIDIA TensorRT is an SDK for high-performance deep learning inference.

Imagine this version of CUDA toolkit messing up your global system\u2019s CUDA versions and PyTorch requiring a completely different version of CUDA to even run.

It has been a couple of weeks and so far everything has been functioning as expected in this setup. However, I have tried several other methods before and broke things up quite badly.", "One such method I tried was this here, it involves enabling CUDA and Nvidia drivers inside WSL to utilize the GPU for Deep Learning. This, at the moment, is still in preview phase but once this comes out officially this is going to be a real game-changer for DL practitioners. It brings together the amazing WSL2 and the CUDA/GPU drivers.", "But as always there is a catch. It is required that you are part of the Windows Insider Program to make use of this feature. And of course, the Insider Preview builds tend to be buggy at best from my experience. For me, it caused a complete failure of all Windows applications at times, GSOD (Green Screen of Death) errors, not booting up properly and driver failures to name a few. I personally don\u2019t like being in an unstable environment, so it was only a matter of time before I decided to opt-out for once and for all.", "You could still use a Preview Build with all those features without any problems, it is just that my experience is bad enough with Preview builds to not recommend anyone.", "Another alternative is to completely move away from Windows and opt for a Linux based operating system to make things much smoother. It is just that you do not get the fancy GUI installers that take care of everything like in Windows.", "In my next post, I\u2019ll discuss how to set up your Deep Learning environment in Linux from scratch without conda.", "In this post, I have only covered the installation of Tensorflow, PyTorch and Jupyter tools.
