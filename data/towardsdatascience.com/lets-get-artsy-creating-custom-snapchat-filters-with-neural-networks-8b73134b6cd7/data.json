I learned to get better and developed a sort of half-smile like Barney from \u201cHow I met your Mother\u201d. Recently, I wanted to try to be more photogenic, so I searched through my social media to see how others did it. Then something hit me, most of these photos had some kind of filtering on them, mainly from Snapchat. This threw me for a loop for a while, until I tried them out for myself. These filters were wacky and silly and did make me look better on camera!", "That\u2019s when I wondered, \u201cwhat if we could make our own filters\u201d? After some research, I learned that Snapchat creates these augmented reality filters from a number of computer vision techniques. Finally, after a few hours of research, I landed on an interesting paper called \u201cA Neural Algorithm for Artistic Style\u201d by Leon A. Gatsy and colleagues. They used a neural network to create a \u201cstylized image\u201d from a photo and a piece of artwork. Then, after a sudden realization, wanted to explore if we could use this technique to create custom filters, like those on Snap chat. So here is my journey on implementing it in Python!", "Side Note: This technique has been a hot topic of research for a couple of years, and there is a number of great online resources and videos that explain the concepts very well. This article is mainly to provide a high-level overview of this technique as best as I can. Alright, let's get started!", "So what is this algorithm trying to accomplish? Essentially we want to produce an image that resembles our content image (the image we want stylized), with the artistic style of our style image.", "In the original paper, he first used the VGG19 model to achieve this result. VGG19 is a popular neural network for image recognition, but we\u2019re mainly going to focus on how it extracts features from a photograph. The feature extraction is done through a number of sequential layers that can detect small patterns. The features it initially picks up are very simple but gets more complex as more feature layers are added. we can then use these features, to recreate our original image!", "In this step, we want to try to recreate, more or less the essence of our content image. To achieve this, we\u2019ll first start off by creating an image full of random noise. We\u2019ll then shape this image to look like our content image, using the extracted features from our network as a guide. The distance between the random image features and the content features is called our \u201ccontent loss\u201d. To get the best stylized image, we want to minimize this loss function through back-propagation. We\u2019ll finally loop through this whole thing and optimize on each step to get a pretty good recreation of our image.", "For this step, we\u2019ll want to recreate the core artistic direction of our style image. Gatsy solves this in an interesting way! Instead of comparing our style features to another image, we\u2019ll compare each feature map to itself. We\u2019ll first transform the style features into a gram matrix, which is basically the inner product of a matrix. The \u201cstyle loss\u201d was is basically the sum of losses for all feature maps in the model network. We\u2019ll do a similar looping process and optimize on each step.", "Our final step in this process is to calculate our final loss as the weighted sum of our content loss and style loss. we\u2019ll also optimize this loss at each step of our training loop.", "Gatsy Method for Style Transfer was the first of its kind, but it did have some problems. The major problem is that it\u2019s very slow. This is because Since the optimization is done every cycle in the training loop, the algorithm takes some time to produce anything. Secondly, sometimes changing the weights will greatly destabilize the photo. There is a fix by adding a total loss variation which aligns the mean and variance of the content and style images. From my research, it looks like Neural Style Transfer is still a hot topic, with applications being applied to video processing, simulations, and designs.", "I used Ayush Chaurasia: Artistic Neural Style Transfer From Scratch on Youtube to create the code. Like I mentioned in the beginning of this article, there are plenty of great resources you can find online. If you wanted to get started with computer vision problems, I think that building neural style transfer application can be very fun and exciting! So I hoped this helped and I wish you luck if you try to pursue this!", "Here are some cool results that I\u2019ve taken, I can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll create!", "Full Code can be found on my Google Colab:", "You can check out my GitHub for more resources!", "Your home for data science.
