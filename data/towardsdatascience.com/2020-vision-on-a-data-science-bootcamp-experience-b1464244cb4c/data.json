Each dot represents 500 people. I had a key on the drawing originally, but was encouraged to remove it by my professors at the time \u2014 which was a bad choice! This viz eventually led me to the design of a mobile school-house for migrating farm-workers\u2019 families.", "This is a story of how an architect/urban designer/researcher transitioned to data science. Most people I\u2019ve encountered think that an architect has no business becoming a data scientist, but I believe it is a completely natural transition for someone like me. There are two reasons why:", "I can go into more depth here-maybe this is for a different article- but my main motivation for entering the Data Science profession was to steer my career more towards science than art, and to fill a gap that I see between AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industries and artificial intelligence. To be honest, I was inspired by the generative design work of Harvard GSD grad, Stanislas Chaillou, which opened the door for me to the number of paths I could take to fill this gap.", "My brother is also a data scientist, and he got me to start thinking about data visualization while I was pursuing a Ph.D. in urbanism and societal change in Denmark. I discussed with him that I was thinking about doing a data science Bootcamp, and he suggested that I should start learning to program and educating myself first so that when I went to the Bootcamp, it would not be the first time I saw the material. This is generally the advice I got from multiple sources as I was thinking about transitioning. This turned out to be extremely sage advice.", "Harvard\u2019s CS50 course from David Malan was my starter course into programming which was excellent in terms of breaking down the theory into bits of code. I took a look at Insight\u2019s Fellows\u2019 career transition prep materials and just started following that along with some selections of my own. I learned to program in python from some professors in Toronto as well as the Google Python class, the basics of machine learning from Andrew Ng, and SQL from Mode Analytics. I also listened to OCDevel\u2019s Machine Learning Guide podcast and some other more theoretical AI books. I looked at some refresher material for calculus, statistics, and probability which was not too challenging since my high school education was designed for those obsessed with math. I felt super excited about the power of these tools, their potential, and my ability to use them. However, I felt that I would benefit from an accelerated Bootcamp experience because:", "I applied and got accepted to General Assembly and METIS for their first live online cohort. I spoke with both GA and Metis grads, and honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like there was a huge difference in the programs except for the fact that at Metis, you do more projects end to end, which is what I was looking for. I\u2019m located in LA but would have to drive daily probably 1 hour each way to go to General Assembly\u2019s campus, so I opted for the METIS program. I also heard very good things about Metis, and honestly liked their admissions process and the steep discount they offered because it was the first live online format of their program they were offering. I had a few concerns about doing the remote program:", "You can read about the curriculum and the schedule on Metis\u2019 website, so I won\u2019t bore you with that here. Throughout the Bootcamp, my top three concerns were mostly assuaged. I think #2 is pretty much true but I knew at the outset that Metis\u2019 LA connections would be limited.", "The live online cohort consisted of about 10 people but we were connected to the in-person cohort in Chicago. Our live online group members were based in for the most part in California and New York. I was surprised that I was able to build strong relationships with my cohort and my instructors. I think the key to this was the daily pair programming exercises, as well as afternoon stand-ups where we updated each other on progress and sought help for roadblocks. I made lasting connections with both live online and in-person folks. I liked the degree of autonomy that the online learning experience had, as I felt like I could focus on my take on the tools and projects.", "We had three instructors and throughout the Bootcamp, it became clear that each of them had their special interest and experience in data science \u2014 one was into NLP, another into statistics, and another into recommenders and neural nets \u2014 but they were all interested in teaching us what they knew and how they knew it. During the Bootcamp and after reflecting on the senior data scientists that were teaching us, I felt calmed by the fact that I did not need to know everything in depth and that data science in practice can have very different specializations \u2014 each with their expertise and talent.", "Surprisingly, instructors did not review your code unless you requested it, but rather you were graded on your presentation for the most part. I was surprised how much the presentation was emphasized but I think it makes sense because the code, modeling, and metrics are just tools for you to make a story about the business use case of your model and through presentations \u2014 that story becomes more clear. I found it surprising how much detective work and thinking about the problem would improve the performance of models \u2014 often more than model tuning. I also found that even the most simple models were pretty effective at performing well. The focus of the projects was not to have the best model with the best score but to construct an application for a machine learning model, understand the model\u2019s inner-workings, and be able to evaluate the metrics concerning the business problem you were solving.", "During the Bootcamp, I excelled at conceptualizing the application of machine learning tools onto business use cases and was the master of producing clean graphically appealing presentations. My cohort consisted of pros at storytelling with tableau, programmers with beautiful code, or mathematicians excelling at brain teasers. We all helped each other out in whatever areas we needed to improve on. I think the breadth of experience that was represented in our cohort was important for each of our successes. Every person had something to offer and something to learn.", "You can take a look at the projects I built during the Bootcamp here:", "A few things allowed me to excel at Bootcamp:", "The free online courses I took on programming and machine learning and the research I did on the discipline gave me a leg up. It was not the first time I heard most of the terms and concepts when they were discussed in class. I think the preparation allowed me to take each week in stride and spend max 50 hours a week on the projects and lectures. I know others worked a lot more, but I know my limits, and I\u2019m interested in quality over quantity.", "I made a point of thinking deeply about any questions I had on the material and asking them.", "Communicating regularly with instructors and my cohort on progress and challenges. I often would get assistance or at least a sounding board from my cohort and that allowed me to make progress faster than I would alone in my head. I also like to communicate visually and verbally, which is an important skill to have as a data scientist.", "I am a mid-career transitioner and I am further along in life than I would say most of the cohort, so I needed to make the commitment and focus much more, which I did. My instructors helped me with strategies like time-boxing and prioritizing different parts of my workflow, creating an MVP, and then building off of that.", "In the beginning, I had a regular bike ride before class (which started at 7 am PST!), and that gave me a lot of energy and attention during the lecture. As the course progressed, I didn\u2019t have the time to do that, but I still got a few rides in a week.", "It has been less than a month since boot-camp ended so I will definitely have more to say later. However, I do feel like there is a big void in my life, not having that daily structure, and not mastering a completely new technology on the daily!", "The last weeks of my course were during the COVID-19 lockdown, so industry (aside from internet media companies) are taking a breather in this uncertain time. It is not an ideal time to look for a job, but some members of my cohort have found data science/engineering positions. The job search is a larger task than I would have imagined, especially since most of my connections are in a field that is just starting to use AI. One thing I wish I did before Bootcamp or during it, was start fostering those connections with the local data science industry \u2014 attending meetups, and hackathons \u2014 especially before the shelter-in-place protocol. However, the upside is that there are a plethora of meetups available online. For me, I am interested in bringing AI to the AEC industry and plan on using this uncertain period to build technical skills in that realm and connections with like-minded folks locally in LA.", "I feel empowered by my experience at METIS, and not afraid to take on new technology or career ambitions. It was a beautiful experience unlike any other educational experience I\u2019ve had (and I\u2019ve had a few \u2014 B.Arch., M.S.A.A.D., Ph.D.). I think everyone in my cohort left the Bootcamp with a better idea of what sorts of data science interested them, where their strengths lie, and how to take advantage of those strengths. I would recommend the experience to anyone who has a unique interest in the profession, the time, and the money of course.", "Your home for data science.
