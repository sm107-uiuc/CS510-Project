For those of you from outside the realm of finance, VIX stands for the CBOE (Chicago Board of Options Exchange) Volatility Index. In the news, you might hear it referred to as the \u201cFear Index\u201d.", "Prior to February 2018, the VIX was well known for two main reasons:", "And then February 2018 rolled around and this happened to investors in XIV, SVXY, and other short VIX funds over the course of just a few trading days (XIV was the most popular ETF, or exchanged traded fund, that shorted VIX futures) \u2014 GG.", "Over just a few days, investors in XIV (which was forced to liquidate), SVXY, and other short VIX investment funds lost pretty much everything (meanwhile SPY, a fund that tracks the S&P 500, lost a mere 5.5%). In today\u2019s post we will explore why funds like XIV flamed out so spectacularly and how it offers a cautionary tale for not putting all your eggs in one strategy (especially if you don\u2019t understand all the risks involved).", "Check out the chart below. The dark blue line is SVXY, an ETF that shorts VIX futures (that is still alive and kicking today unlike XIV). The light blue line (that pretty much looks horizontal) is the S&P 500.", "From the start of 2013 to the end of 2017, the S&P 500 earned a handsome 86% return, nearly doubling your money. Over the same timeframe, shorting the VIX via SVXY earned an incredible 565% return, nearly septupling (from 1 to 7) your money! These ridiculous returns over relatively short timeframes are why people keep visiting the VIX casino.", "So what is this VIX that I keep talking about? The technical definition of the VIX is the implied volatility of S&P 500 options. But how it is calculated is way less important than what it represents.", "Simply put, the VIX measures stock market fear and investor uncertainty.", "When things are going well, the VIX tends to trend lower and lower. When markets crash, the VIX spikes.", "Being long the VIX is equivalent to buying insurance against a market crash, while shorting the VIX is equivalent to selling crash insurance.", "Two factors drive returns for those shorting the VIX:", "Point 2 is pretty important. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at the VIX futures curve. First what is a futures curve? A futures contract is a promise to buy an asset at a predetermined price at some point in the future.", "The plot below shows a hypothetical VIX curve. Each blue dot is a futures contract with a specified expiration date \u2014 for example, the first blue dot is the VIX futures contract expiring in exactly one month from today. Now because the VIX is not directly investible at the market price (in finance this is called the spot price), managers of a VIX focused ETF like XIV are forced to use futures contracts to get their exposure.", "So like I depict in the chart above, managers will buy the VIX futures contract expiring in two months (the green \u201cBuy Here\u201d) and hold that to get long exposure to the VIX. But after a month goes by, that futures contract that started as a two month contract is now a one month contract (the red \u201cSell Here\u201d). And in order to maintain constant exposure to the VIX, the manager sells the contract he owns, now a one month contract, and buys a new two month contract (this transaction is depicted by the dashed line labeled \u201cRepeat\u201d).", "Now recall that the VIX curve is generally upward sloping. This means that every month the manager is selling low at the red in order to buy high at the green, a process called \u201crolling down the VIX curve\u201d. Some numbers might make this easier to visualize:", "So being long the VIX in a rising or stable stock market is equivalent to bleeding money month after month. So why not turn this around, short VIX futures instead, and earn all that money that investors long the VIX are bleeding? And that\u2019s what plenty of people did.", "By simply flipping the direction of the trade, investors put themselves in a position to sell high (red \u201cShort Here\u201d) and buy back low (\u201cBuy Back Here\u201d) month after month:", "Earlier we pointed out that shorting the VIX is the same thing as selling insurance against the stock market crashing.", "Selling insurance is an asymmetric risk reward strategy \u2014 most of the time you make a little bit and once in a while you lose everything.", "That\u2019s why insurance companies employ armies of actuaries to figure out how to accurate charge you and me in return for taking certain risks off of our hands (and even then, they still offload some of these risks to reinsurers just in case).", "Let\u2019s run with this insurance analogy some more. If an insurance company finds a particularly profitable niche and starts making boatloads of money, what happens? Competitors would catch on and pile in flooding the market with supply, which pushes the price each company can charge for insurance down.", "When the thing you are insuring against is a stock market crash, this is even more dangerous.", "As more investors rush to supply stock market crash insurance, not only is each investor forced to charge a lower price, but also the risk that each investor takes on is increased.", "That\u2019s because by the time most investors are aware of this trade, the stock market will have already increased by a significant amount (the more the market goes up, the more VIX declines and VIX shorts profit). So the stock market that investors are rushing to insure is more likely than not to be an overvalued one. Additionally, each incremental investor that shorts the VIX also pushes the market up a bit more \u2014 as the price of crash insurance declines (a.k.a. the cost of hedging), investors buy more stocks pushing up prices.", "So investors shorting the VIX in a crowded market get hit by an invisible double whammy \u2014 their actions concurrently push up the risks they face while pushing down the expected return they can collect as compensation for taking on those risks.", "This is a recipe for disaster. And the sad thing is that FOMO (fear of missing out) causes investors to be oblivious to this danger. Honestly, it\u2019s hard not to FOMO when you see SVXY\u2019s (and XIV\u2019s which are pretty much the same) six month returns leading up to its implosion. Unfortunately, this FOMO would cause many investors to lose almost everything.", "Let\u2019s review the situation we had on our hands as we headed towards February of 2018:", "In markets, there is rarely a linear cause and effect. Many times, seemingly insignificant events can, through a series of nonlinear and unanticipated relationships, trigger a market crash.", "Prior to February 2018, stock markets had been so incredibly calm (and VIX so low) that even a small decline could cause investors to panic. And that is exactly what happened \u2014 what should have been a routine decline in the S&P 500 caused the VIX (and VIX futures contracts) to shoot up like a rocket (rising almost 50% in just a few minutes).", "This forced the managers of short VIX ETFs like XIV and SVXY to cover their shorts in order to cap their losses. But what do you think happens when everyone simultaneously tries to escape through the same tiny door?", "The amount of bets that everyone was trying to escape was greater than the market could bear and thus each trade was executed at incrementally higher prices. That is, each trade to cancel a short bet (equivalent to going long the VIX) had the painful effect of pushing VIX up even further. And sensing the desperation of the ETF managers, traders on the opposite side, like sharks smelling blood in the water, were determined to extract their pound of flesh.", "By the time everyone was done trading, the VIX had nearly doubled, and investors holding large short VIX positions had lost nearly everything.", "Here are a few Reddit comments that highlight the damage and bitterness that this financial disaster left investors with:", "\u201cI\u2019ve lost 4million USD, 3 years worth of work, and other people\u2019s money.\u201d \u2014 u/Lilkanna", "\u201cI feel you as I\u2019ve lost 1/2 of my net worth today T_T prob 5 years on my life\u201d \u2014 u/asianhere", "\u201cIs this right!??? Or some system glitch?\u201d \u2014 u/cheapdvds", "\u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong but my biggest takeaway from the XIV debacle is that if I want to start a ponzi scheme and put a disclaimer that \u2018you might lose everything\u2019 then it will be okay right? \u201c\u2014 u/mauimikes", "It\u2019s too easy to look back and say that shorting the VIX was a mistake. Things always look obvious in retrospect but as they occur they are anything but. However, there are still a few things we should keep in mind when we are confronted by investments that could be bubbles:", "Thanks for reading, best of luck, and cheers!", "More posts by me on investing and finance:", "The Anatomy of a Stock Market Downturn", "Do I have Enough Money to Retire?", "Your home for data science.
