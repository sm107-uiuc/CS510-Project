We use PSCs as a time to gather feedback on our impact, skills, and development areas, and I re-discovered that the most important skills were the same ones tested during the interview process \u2014 as you might hope!", "Those skills aren\u2019t unique to Facebook interviews either. All of my Data Science interviews focused on the same short set of skills to evaluate my ability to drive impact.", "So I thought it would be useful to share those skills for other people that are looking for jobs in Data Science.", "Of course, I can\u2019t share the exact questions I received during my Facebook interview, and they\u2019ve changed by now anyway. But the skills themselves are not confidential, and they certainly haven\u2019t changed in just a year.", "So in no particular order, here they are.", "If you\u2019ve been writing SQL on the job, you\u2019ll appreciate that the fundamentals will cover 90% of the problems you\u2019ll handle in practice.", "The most important concept is how the various types of JOIN statements work. For example, you\u2019ll certainly need to understand the fact that INNER JOIN will drop records that don\u2019t appear in both tables, while LEFT JOIN will preserve all the ones that appear in the left table.", "You\u2019ll also need to be comfortable using WHERE clauses to filter your data and GROUP BY clauses to aggregate your data using functions like sum.", "So that\u2019s actually all it takes to get 90% of the way there: master SQL joins, filters, and aggregates.", "But the remaining 10% of the way is what made it much easier for me to pass the SQL tests during the interview.", "The SQL fundamentals will get you 90% of the way there, but the last 10% is what you need to pass", "That 10% includes understanding less used techniques, such as a subquery like this one.", "I used several more \u201cadvanced\u201d concepts during my SQL coding tests, including window functions, named subqueries, self JOINs, and conditionals in a join\u2019s ON clause.", "Using the more advanced SQL features will likely make it much easier for you to pass the SQL problems.", "I had never experienced an interview that assessed my intuition for probability, but my onsite featured a case study that went fairly deep.", "Luckily I wasn\u2019t required to write down any formulas, as I\u2019d forgotten all of them after graduating college.", "But I did need to have a strong understanding of the key concepts that I had learned: things like the central limit theorem, independence of events, and the ability to choose a sensible probability space to model a problem.", "Practice explaining the key concepts of probability, like the Central Limit Theorem, without using any technical words", "I was also asked to evaluate the outputs of a probabilistic model and provide a recommendation for the business based on those outputs.", "Ultimately I was able to give a sensible recommendation because I had built a practical intuition for the concepts, even if I didn\u2019t remember exactly the formulas for quantifying a model\u2019s fit.", "Your ability to explain technical concepts without any technical words is a key skill needed to pass the technical portions of the interview.", "Communication skills mattered more, in my opinion, than the technical skills like SQL or probability theory.", "Like the technical skills, communication is not something you can level up in the week before getting a phone screen.", "But there are some easy things you can do before the interview that will have an outsized impact on landing a job offer.", "Having well-rehearsed answers to the generic interview questions will make the biggest difference for your interview results.", "One of the standard interview questions most companies ask Data Scientist candidates is: \u201cHow would you measure X\u201d?", "Facebook asked the question in an indirect way, but answering it still required the same two skills:", "Think about how you\u2019d assess the value of your model for the business, not just how well it fits the data", "It was thanks to those four skills that I was able to land a job offer from Facebook just over a year ago. They certainly weren\u2019t easy to develop: I\u2019d worked for nearly four years in various analytics jobs before I had improved to the level that landed me the offer.", "But I don\u2019t think developing those skills required any special talent or brilliance on my part. I\u2019m certain that anyone else who puts in the time to improve those 4 skills can land a job in data science.", "Thanks for reading!
