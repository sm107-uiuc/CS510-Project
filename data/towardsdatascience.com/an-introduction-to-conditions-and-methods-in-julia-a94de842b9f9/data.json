If you have not seen that tutorial, you can check it out here:", "Today we are going to take a look at actually writing functions to deal with our types, as well as a broad overview of how conditionals work inside the Julia language. On top of that, we will go a bit further into the world of types and look at a few more types that we have at our disposal. Here is a link to today\u2019s notebook and Github repo, as well:", "In Julia, most functions are also going to be methods. This is because essentially every function we call is likely going to need to be provided parameters. This is of course a quality of the functional programming paradigm that Julia holds, but there are ways to get around this which we will get into so take this statement with a grain of salt. In Julia, we can create a function by using the \u201c function\u201d key-word.", "We will also end it by using the \u201c end\u201d key-word. Functions take parameters, which are arguments that will be provided when we go to use the function in the future. They will also be the variables that we will potentially be working with inside of our code.", "As with most other languages, a conditional in Julia needs an operator that will return a boolean type, rather than a number, or assignment. The boolean operator for \u201c is equal\u201d is ==, for example. If we were to use this operator with 5 and 5, we wouldn\u2019t be setting 5 equal to 5, but instead we would be returning whether or not the two are equal.", "There are three different types of conditions that you can run in Julia:", "Of course, you don\u2019t want to use statements like elseif when another if is what is required, because the code ran inside of that check will be ignored if a prior condition is met.", "Types are a pretty enormous staple in the Julia language: they are incredibly important to how the language works. Methods themselves are considered types, as well as all of the default data-types that we have looked at so far. A lot of data-types in Julia have their own delimiters or expressions that identify their types. An example of this would be strings, which use quotation marks to mark their beginning and end.", "Another example of this is in chars, which use an apostrophe to mark their beginning and their end. Furthermore, symbols and arrays also have their own identifiers that make it relatively straightforward for the language to analyze what type we are trying to create in each scenario.", "Although it might seem like we are in the basic throws of the Julia language right now, I am confident that those keeping up with these tutorials will be Julian masters in no time! Julia is a great language for both scientific and software-engineering applications, and I think it will be a great addition to your arsenal! On top of that, it is rather beginner friendly and easy to learn, so I think even with relatively speedy teaching, it will be simple to pick up on. That being said, I do appreciate feedback on whether there is too much speed, too many details, or if I am going too slow! Thank you for reading!", "Your home for data science.
