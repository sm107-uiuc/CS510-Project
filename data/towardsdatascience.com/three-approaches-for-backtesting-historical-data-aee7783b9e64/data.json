Historical data is needed in order to backtest or train:", "Each need comes from different goals.", "There are many reasons to incorporate backtesting and statistical analysis to trading, and they can come from very different trading styles and methodologies:", "While each approach to markets is really different, the need to perform calculations on the available data is shared across all of them.", "There are three main different approaches to deal with historical data analysis:", "You can find strong opinions about which is the best approach. But as with anything in technology and business, trade-offs are in place and the context will promote one solution over the rest.", "If you are doing algorithmic trading and your plan is to stick with price and standard indicators, leveraging a software chart trading tool such as Metatrader might be probably the best option, and it will have the benefit of being easier to later put the actual algorithmic strategy in the market.", "A more comprehensive approach to backtesting is using a specific backtesting software. This brings additional benefits as you can leverage on the extended analysis and capabilities of the tool. The learning curve will be probably similar than with a trading/charting software and you will have the extra step of figuring out how to turn the analysis into something actionable. It will also pose an additional cost although there are affordable options.", "If you are doing uncommon analysis there is a chance that a custom software might save time and pain, as existing tools and frameworks will force you to follow certain lines of analysis/strategy.", "In this case, the choice of the programming language is also relevant. This is probably the most serious and flexible approach but it is also the most demanding in terms of resources and time. It must be seen as a bad choice if you do not plan to allocate required commitment, skills, time or resources.", "You can also always mix them as these options are not mutually exclusive ones. You might use a backtesting platform for the more common analysis and profiling and use custom software for very specific analysis that might be difficult to implement within the existing frameworks.", "Being free and being the charting and trading software I use for CFDs, I seriously considered using Metatrader.", "Being a commercial framework, it poses the usual weaknesses that come along with this type of product:", "The main advantages are that you can usually get productive results quickly and that it is usually easier to get support from the community.", "When I became interested in statistical analysis, I had the opportunity to have a conversation with a trader who does this as part of his job. He made very good points on why he was using Metatrader, but one of his comments made me think:", "Metatrader is probably the best way to go as you can actually see the data and have all indicators already there. Despite that, I do not like it at all.", "When someone who has spent enough time to master a software tool is not 100% happy with it, that should trigger a red flag.", "This colleague already and successfully went through the learning curve required by Metatrader. He managed to overcome all limitations of a commercial framework, and he was wisely leveraging on his past effort and actual benefits and capabilities of Metatrader (which are relevant once you cope with the initial learning curve).", "I also realized that this person might not be willing to develop a custom tool and that the final goal was to get a working trading robot. In this scenario, Metatrader was probably the best option.", "After this conversation, I went through Metatrader documentation and tried to identify how to get basic statistical outputs. I was not capable of understanding how to do basic and simple analysis easily and I found that there were no actual data models in place for the data. I simply did not like what I saw -and this is obviously a personal opinion based on my previous experience in technology frameworks-. I think that any backtesting tool shall be able to easily import data and provide basic stats with a minimum effort from a committed user.", "I felt Metatrader was not for me and therefore I decided to keep looking and evaluating the custom software option. Although it is not the option I have chosen, it is worth mentioning that Metatrader is probably the fastest and safest way to get quick results.", "Jane Fox, from Quantitrader, is serious about the quantitative approach. She does not use anything else but algorithms backed up statistically, and while listening to her in an interview I discovered she was using Amibroker and become interested in the software package itself and in the abstract concept of using a specific backtesting software package.", "Being a pure quantitative trader, a specific backtesting software approach is probably best suited for this task. Backtesting is the DNA of her strategy. It is also relevant that Jane seems to trade swing positions on stocks, and will probably lack the need to process minute candle bars or do an out-of-the-box analysis.", "In this scenario, being able to easily incorporate all the relevant indicators and tools to backtest saves time and money.", "As in the Metatrader case, I am sure that learning to use them is not as straightforward as vendors and enthusiasts promote.", "At the beginning of this article, I used opening gaps as an example. I did mention that on purpose because I developed my interest in the statistical analysis of financial markets when I attended a seminar by Jose Codina.", "Jose Codina is a well-known trader in Spain who has been using statistical analysis during the past 20 years. The seminar was about DAX opening gaps and it was an outstanding introduction on how to analyze a particular aspect of the market. The analysis was so specific that he was using a custom platform (If I guess correctly he was using a custom C# software). I was surprised by the speed of the analysis (which involved analyzing 1-minute candles for several years of DAX futures) and by the overall analytical process used to address the issue.", "I am interested mainly in intraday operations, and specifically on the correlation between short-term price action and the statistical nature of the market. Being that so specific, I finally decided that a custom software would be the way to go in my case.", "It does not give you results so quickly but it allows you to build a custom and familiar framework tailored to your needs. Several aspects like graphics capabilities and user interface can be easily addressed if you are not picky about usability (writing a commercial software is a different history, but that is not my goal) and if you use a UNIX/Linux environment you can leverage on existing packages.", "It is true that more time and resources need to be put in place but it is not less true that commercial tools impose a tight environment and have their own learning curve. Using a standard programming language will not pose any challenge because the commercial tool is not properly documented, as procedures are well known and understood and issues can be solved with time but without any drama.", "Anyway out of the three different options, I consider that a specific backtesting tool might be a good choice and I plan to test one extensively in the near future.", "Disclaimer: products and people mentioned in the post are by no means endorsed by the author nor do they endorse the author\u2019s opinion.
