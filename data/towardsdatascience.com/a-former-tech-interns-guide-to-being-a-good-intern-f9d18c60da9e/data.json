My first internship out of college? \u201cCustomer Data Intelligence\u201d. I had no idea what I was doing. A month after we\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["I did my best to nod convincingly, all the while thinking \u201cpython\u2026 why are we talking about snakes?\u201d", "I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in International Business Administration. My first internship out of college? \u201cCustomer Data Intelligence\u201d. I had no idea what I was doing.", "A month after we joined the company, a senior employee handed over one of his projects to us. In his first email to us, he wrote:", "\u201cHere\u2019s the Gitlab link. I mostly used Pandas for the data processing, but some of the data comes from our data warehouse, so I just used an SQL query for those. If you have any questions on the 60 lines so far, let me know. Otherwise, you can get started on development.\u201d", "I did a bit of quick Googling to come up with some answers. I learned that :", "Clearing those introductory questions up was a start. A month later, we had a minimum viable product ready to go. Five months later, the other intern and I had turned those 60 lines of code into a 600-line monster with expanded functionality and adjustments based on user feedback. All of it came a lot of learning by doing, as neither of us had touched Python before. When our internships ended, we handed the project over and felt a bit of deja vu. We had gone from student to master. Or maybe just intermediate students. (That\u2019s a HIMYM reference.)", "Getting thrown in the deep end gave me a unique opportunity to rapidly pick up a new skill. I know I\u2019m still miles away from being a competent developer. Looking back at that project alone, I could think of a thousand things I would have done differently. But that half year of experience allowed me to build enough interest to want to pursue this kind of work further.", "During my internship, I was also exposed to SQL, Tableau, Splunk and AWS along the way. I never would have imagined that I\u2019d be working with these tools, let alone that I enjoyed learning about them. Whenever we had any kind of data related tasks in university, I would shy away from them. I preferred to take writing related roles in the team instead. Now, my full-time job involves development work every day!", "I still feel unqualified. The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s daunting because people expect me to deliver. So far, I\u2019m learning enough to keep up, but I\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t last forever.", "My experience now parallels how I felt as an intern. Every day I kept learning and learning so I would be able to prove to everyone that I was more than just talk. At the end of my internship, one of my teammates planned a farewell session with the team for me and the other intern. Before we dug into the cake, he said (paraphrased):", "\u201cYou guys have really shown what interns should be like. You ended up making a tangible impact on the company.\u201d", "It meant a lot to me because I felt like all the hours spent learning new things and watching code break and learning more new things and debugging code actually amounted to something. His words chipped away at my mentality of \u201cCoding is too hard for me\u201d that I\u2019d kept for so long.", "I\u2019m incredibly grateful for my internship experience because of that. What keeps me going now is that my internship proved that I can learn and adapt to new demands at work. And with that, I\u2019d like to share stuff I did during my internship that everyone could do (even if you\u2019re not an intern).", "It\u2019s not enough to absorb what your colleagues teach you. Being an intern is a job where you\u2019re being paid to learn new things. I made it a goal to try and learn at least one new thing on my own every day. You never know when a random tidbit you picked up will allow you to help out a colleague in need. The more you know, the more you\u2019re able to do.", "People are always impressed when someone can do something they can\u2019t, or when someone can do something they can do but quicker. It\u2019s even more impressive because you\u2019re a (young?) intern. Be that intern!", "I was fortunate enough to have a manager that told me to explore other projects besides the one in my job description. I took that to heart and ended up with a long list of stuff I did that had nothing to do with \u201cCustomer Data Intelligence\u201d.", "Part of that was just messaging random people on Slack to see if they needed help with things. I also turned my desk chair around a lot to ask if the guy who always needed Excel help needed anything else from me (I\u2019m exaggerating, but only a little).", "If you want people to take you seriously, you need to show them you\u2019re willing to work.", "Communicating as frequently as possible meant that everyone I was working with knew what I was up to. Again, I was blessed with a manager that reminded me to speak up. I built a habit of always talking to my project supervisor, manager, teammates and ping-pong buddies about what work I was doing and what problems I was facing. People heard about the good and offered to help with the bad.", "For once, instead of being treated to coffee, I offered to buy my desk mates a round. As one, they stood up, leaped out of their seats and sprinted to the canteen (I\u2019m exaggerating, but only a little). As we waited in line, the CEO came and stood behind us.", "We spoke with him for a bit before placing our orders. One of my colleagues told the barista that I was buying the round, jokingly saying that I could pay for the CEO as well. Mr. CEO laughed and said that he could buy his own coffee.", "As I paid for our order, I noticed that it was about a euro more expensive than it should have been. Then I realized that the barista did include the CEO\u2019s order.", "I blinked a couple times as I realized that I had (accidentally) just bought the CEO coffee.", "He laughed, chatted with us for a bit longer and then said to me \u201cthanks for the coffee\u201d before heading off.", "Maybe you don\u2019t have to buy the CEO coffee, but a large part of making the most out of your experience is having fun with it. Playing ping pong at lunch, referring to a senior employee\u2019s code fixes as \u201choly text\u201d and XXX were all definitely not advertised as part of the job. But they\u2019re the some of the parts I\u2019ll remember most.", "A couple months before my final university exam, I thought to myself that I couldn\u2019t wait to finish. At the same time, I was afraid of leaving the safe bubble of school. Being out in the \u201creal world\u201d meant that I would have to find a job, pay the bills and do all the other adult stuff that school keeps at bay. Besides that, I had no idea what kind of job I even wanted.", "Interning was life changing for me, not only because it provided me with some much-needed work experience. It exposed me to tools meant for data analysis beyond Excel, what \u201ccloud computing\u201d was and why this comic made sense:", "My internship opened an entirely different career path than what I had imagined for myself. It was pivotal in helping me land my first full-time job, in a field and function that I actually enjoy. If you\u2019re struggling to figure out what you want to do right out of university, try an internship in something unfamiliar.", "It might help you more than you think.", "P.S. Someone still hasn\u2019t bought me a coffee back.", "P.P.S. Here\u2019s one more joke for you:", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Medium has become a place to store my \u201chow to do tech stuff\u201d type guides.
