It helps to understand the data better and highlight its main characteristics that may help to make predictions and forecasts that can have a bearing on the future.", "Understanding data is core to data science. Hence EDA is imperative to generating accurate machine learning models. Consider Haberman\u2019s Survival Data set to perform various EDA processes on it using Python. The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago\u2019s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.", "The various attributes of the data set are:", "Just like the medical diagnosis of patients plays a key role in the patient\u2019s treatment lifecycle, EDA plays a vital role in data assessment and the creation of accurate models.", "Python was chosen due to its best AI packages and Machine Learning libraries. Here we import libraries required to perform data analysis and plotting:", "The Haberman\u2019s Survival Data Set is a comma-separated values(csv) file. The read_csv() function of Pandas is used to read the csv file(haberman.csv) into DataFrame named haberman. Dataframe is a two-dimensional structure that is size-mutable and has potentially heterogeneous tabular data.", "Let\u2019s get acquainted with the data set by doing some preliminary analysis of data. First of all, let\u2019s see how the data set looks like. In the following code snippet, iterrows() is used to iterate through each row of the DataFrame.", "All the attributes of the data set are self-explanatory. Age of the Patient implies the age of the patient. Year of Operation mentions the year in which the operation is performed. Positive Axillary Nodes denotes the number(presence or absence) of positive axillary nodes(Lymph nodes) in a patient. Positive Axillary Nodes are the lymph nodes affected by cancer cells. Finally, Survival Status provides information about the patients\u2019 survival for 5 years or longer.", "The first five rows of data set can be seen by the head() function.", "Now let\u2019s find the total number of data points and features(attributes) of data set by using Pandas shape property. A data point is a collection of attributes or features. Hence it is a complete record. In the given data set, a data point comprises of data involving the four attributes(row of DataFrame). The shape attribute returns a tuple representing the dimensionality of the DataFrame(DataFrame stores number of rows and columns as a tuple).", "The data set has 306 data points(rows) and 4 attributes(columns). The attributes of the data set can be known by the column property of Pandas.", "Here dtype refers to the data types of Pandas. The object data type in Pandas is equivalent to the string data type in Python.", "Survival Status attribute(dependent variable) contains integer data types that are not categorical type. Hence it is required to convert to categorical type.", "Let\u2019s verify whether the conversion has occurred.", "We can see now that the Survival Status has fields marked as Survived or Died.", "A concise summary of the data set can be displayed by the info method. This method prints information about a DataFrame including the index dtype and column dtypes, non-null values and memory usage.", "Pandas describe method generates descriptive statistics that include information that summarizes the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a dataset\u2019s distribution, excluding NaN values. It analyzes both numeric and object series, as well as DataFrame column sets of mixed data types. The output will vary depending on what is provided.", "4. For object data type(Survival Status), the result will include unique, top and freq(frequency). The variables with numerical data type will be given NaN in corresponding fields. Survival Status has two unique values(Survived and Died). The top is the most common value. Hence Survived is the most common survival status. freq is the most common value\u2019s frequency and its value here is 225. So the total number of patients survived is 225.", "We can ascertain the total number of patients survived by value_counts() method.", "Hence we can conclude that more patients survived (225) breast cancer than the ones who died of it(81). Hence the data set is imbalanced.", "The main objective of EDA is to determine whether a patient will survive for 5 years or longer based on the attributes Age of Patient, Year of Operation and Positive Axillary Nodes.", "Now let\u2019s dive deeper into the data set. For that, it\u2019s imperative to consider the different levels of analysis that exist. They are:", "The selection of the data analysis technique ultimately dependents on the number of variables, data type, and focus of the statistical inquiry.", "Univariate analysis is the simplest data analysis technique that deals with only one variable. Being a single variable process, it does not give insights on the cause or effect relationships. The primary objective of the univariate analysis is to simply describe the data to find patterns within the data. The univariate analysis methods being considered are:", "Bivariate analysis is the process to establish a correlation between two variables. Bivariate analysis is more analytical than univariate analysis. If the data seems to fit a line or curve, then there is a relationship or correlation between the two variables. The bivariate analysis methods being considered are:", "Multivariate analysis is a more complex statistical analysis. It is the analysis involving three or more variables and is implemented in a scenario where there is a need to understand the relationship between them. The multivariate analysis method being considered is:", "The analysis will start with the bivariant analysis. 2-D scatter plot will be plotted first and will make observations of it. Then we will move over to pair plot to see both the distribution of single variables and the relationship between two variables. Afterward, the univariate and multivariate analysis will be conducted.", "The two-dimensional scatter plot helps to visualize a correlation between two variables using Cartesian coordinates. The values of one variable will be plotted along the x-axis and the other variable on the y-axis. The data will be plotted in the resultant quadrant as an ordered pair(x, y) in which x relates to value on x-axis and y relates to y-axis value.", "FacetGrid is a multi-plot grid for plotting conditional relationships. FacetGrid object takes a DataFrame as input and the names of the variables that will form the row, column, or hue dimensions of the grid. The variables should be categorical and the data at each level of the variable will be used for a facet along that axis. The map() method is responsible for repeating the same plot on each space of the grid. It applies a plotting function to each facet\u2019s subset of the data. The add_legend() method creates the legend of the plot.", "Ascertaining Observations:We can ascertain the observation no. 1 by carrying out the following operation on the haberman DataFrame.", "The output verified the observation no. 1.", "We can ascertain the value 25(assumed by the blue dot at the midpoint of 20 and 30) mentioned in the observation no. 2 by:", "The list has value 25. So we can safely assume that the blue dot is at value 25.", "We can ascertain observation no. 4 by the following operation:", "Hence there is only a patient whose age is greater than or equal to 80. The orange dot after 80 must be representing this patient.", "Pair plot plots pairwise relationships in a dataset. It will create a grid of Axes such that each numeric variable in data will be shared in the y-axis across a single row and in the x-axis across a single column. The diagonal axes are different from the rest of the grid of Axes, and they show the univariate distribution of the data for the variable in that column.", "In the data set, there are 3 quantitative variables(Age of Patient, Year of Operation, Positive Axillary Nodes) and 1 categorical variable(Survival Status). Only numeric(integer or float) continuous values will be plotted in pair plot. Hence in the pair plot shown above, we have 3C2 plots (i.e. 3 unique plots). There is an equal number of plots on either side of the diagonal, and they are the mirror image of each other. The diagonal plots(plot 1, plot 5 and plot 9) demonstrate histograms that showcase the distribution of a single variable.", "Ascertaining Observations:We can ascertain the observation no. 3 of plot 2 by carrying out the following operations on the haberman DataFrame:", "The scatter plot in which a single variable is used to make inferences is a 1-D scatter plot. Here the variable will be on the x-axis and the y-axis will have zeros(as it is impossible to make a plot without two axes). Obviously, it is a univariate analysis.", "In the code above, haberman.loc[ ] was used to pick the data points from haberman DataFrame that are associated with the specific indexes, which in turn is stored in another DataFrame. np.zeros_like() method will create an array of zeros. \u2018o\u2019 is the small letter of alphabet O to make dots on plot bigger and visible.", "A histogram is an accurate representation of numerical data distribution that was first introduced by Karl Pearson. It gives an estimate of continuous variables\u2019 probability distribution. The histogram is a univariate analysis as it relates to only one variable.", "The very first step to constructing a histogram is to \u2018bin\u2019(or bucket) the range of values. To bin means to divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals, and then count the number of values that belong to each interval. The bins are usually consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins must be adjacent and are of equal size(not required). All but the last bin(right hand most) is half-open.", "For equal-sized bins, a rectangle is erected over the bin with height proportional to a number of cases in each bin(frequency or count).", "Matplotlib is used to plot histogram and Numpy is used to calculate count and bin edges.", "Matplotlib plots histogram using plt.hist() that takes a DataFrame as input. The bin_edges give bin edges(left edge of the first bin and right edge of the last bin). The color parameter sets the color of the bar and the alpha parameter sets the transparency of the bar. plt.xlabel and plt.y-label are used to set the labels of the x-axis and y-axis respectively.", "PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values. It is the probability function used to describe a continuous probability distribution. PDF is used to deal with the probabilities of random variables that have continuous outcomes. The height of a person arbitrarily chosen from a population is a typical example.", "PDF is a smoothed version of the histogram. The smoothing of the histogram is done using Kernel Density Estimation(KDE). The area under the PDF(curve) always sum up to 1. PDF is a univariate analysis.", "The code snippet shown below will plot PDF.", "PDF based on Age of Patient", "The bars(orange and blue) are the histograms, and the curves represent the PDF.", "PDF based on Year of Operation", "PDF based on Positive Axillary Nodes", "Ascertaining Observations:We can ascertain the observations by carrying out the following operation on the haberman DataFrame:", "The output has ascertained the observations.

The probability that X lies in the semi-closed interval (a,b], where a<b, is therefore:P(a < X <= b) = F(b) \u2014 F(a)", "The integration of Probability Density Function(PDF) gives CDF. CDF is also a univariate analysis.", "CDF is plotted using the selected variable \u2018Positive Axillary Nodes\u2019.", "Matplotlib is used to plot the histogram and Numpy is used to calculate count and bin edges. Matplotlib plots histogram using plt.hist() that takes a DataFrame as input.

These five numbers are minimum or smallest number, first quartile(Q1) or 25th percentile, median(Q2) or 50th percentile, third quartile(Q3) or 75th percentile and maximum or largest number. Q1 is the middle number between the minimum and median. Q3 is the middle value between the median and the maximum. InterQuartile Range(IQR) is the difference between the first quartile and the third quartile.IQR = Q3 \u2014 Q2The height of the box plot represents IQR. The top line and bottom line of the box represent the first quartile and the third quartile respectively. The line between the top line and bottom line of the box represents the median. The lines extending parallel from the boxes are known as the \u2018whiskers\u2019, which are used to indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. Outliers are sometimes plotted as individual dots that are in-line with whiskers. An outlier is the data point that differs significantly from the other observations. It lies outside the overall pattern of distribution.", "The Box and Whisker Plot was first introduced by mathematician John Tukey in 1969. Box Plots can be drawn either vertically or horizontally. Although Box Plots may seem primitive in comparison to a Histogram or Density Plot, they have the advantage of taking up less space, which is useful when comparing distributions between many groups or datasets.", "Python Statistical Data Visualization Library Seaborn is used to plot the box plot.", "A Violin Plot is used to visualize the distribution of the data and its probability density. It is a combination of the box plot with a rotated kernel density plot on either side to show the distribution shape of the data. The white dot in the middle is the median value and the thick black bar at the center represents the interquartile range. The thin black line extended from it represents the maximum and minimum values in the data. Violin plots are similar to box plots except that they also show the probability density of the data at different values, usually smoothed by Kernel Density Estimator. Combining the best of both worlds (Histogram and PDF, Box Plot) gives the violin plot. The violin plot is a univariate analysis.", "A contour plot is a multivariate analysis. A contour plot is not a normalization technique, rather it is a graphical technique for representing a three-dimensional surface by plotting constant z slice called contours, in a two-dimensional format. Seaborn is used to plotting the contour plot.", "Ascertaining Observation:We can ascertain the observation by carrying out the following operations on the haberman DataFrame:", "So 20.30% of all the patients with positive axillary nodes less than or equal to two falls in the age group of 50\u201356.", "Let\u2019s summarize the important observations we made during Exploratory Data Analysis.", "Your home for data science.
