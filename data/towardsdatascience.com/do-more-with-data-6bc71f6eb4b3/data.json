The more customers a company retains, the more chances it has in maximizing ROI.", "Today, marketers primarily focus on the needs of the customers and try to come up with the best ways to fulfill them, not only through their product or service under the offering but also by offering better customer experience. However, to get a holistic view of customers\u2019 needs, one must strive to understand the behavior of the customers first. Every interaction a customer makes with a brand must be taken into account to understand why the customer purchased a specific product or preferred a particular service in the past.", "There are several ways to study these behavioral patterns of the customers, such as by using market research, online & offline surveys, company\u2019s past sales, and recent demand trends. They help to accumulate enormous amounts of data, which, due to its complexity, can\u2019t be interpreted through traditional analytical methods. This data can be referred to as \u201cBig Data.\u201d", "Big data is typically challenging to interpret due to its high volume and intricacy. However, if analyzed properly, it can provide valuable insights to businesses which, in turn, can help marketers make calculated decisions and devise smarter strategies through which the company can engage with the right customers at the right time.", "Making good use of data can also aid the business deal with the market uncertainties and cope with turbulent market conditions. All of this can be achieved by making customers the focal point of the business. One may wonder how customer data can help a company achieve so much. So here\u2019s how big data is helping out companies perceive their customers and their behavior.", "With the use of data analytics, big data can provide essential information about the customers related to their socio-economic status. By examining the purchasing patterns of the buyer, companies can figure out what kind of products the customer likes or how frequently does he/she buy a particular product? According to Forbes,", "\u201cA vast majority of executives who have been overseeing predictive marketing efforts for at least two years (86%) report increased return on investment (ROI) as a result of their predictive marketing.\u201d", "With big data, marketers can also segment their target audience in terms of their demographics and psychographics with some non-identifiable personal information like personal goals, interests, ambitions, lifestyle, habits, and routine. Therefore, segmentation is the first step forward in acquiring the right customers within a short period. After segmentation, the business can target the groups which allow operational feasibility for them. Targeting can help companies to work with efficiency and enable them to focus on only those customers who are actually interested in their product.", "Every customer is not loyal to a brand and therefore there have to be different business strategies for the potential customers, the customers who are indifferent about the brand, the ones that might switch to other brands, and the ones who have already built a lasting relationship with the brand and are the evangelists of the business\u2019 brand.", "It was a common belief amongst the marketers that the Most Valuable Customers (MVCs) are the ones who spend a lot of money on your products; but, that\u2019s not true, as customers do not always remain loyal and may switch to other brands if they get an opportunity, in terms of price, quality, or even experience.", "Big Data helps businesses decide upon their loyal customers and in identifying the MVCs by calculating several attributes of the buyers. Following are a few of the many metrics which can be used to spot loyal customers from the customer database.", "1. Customer Lifetime Value: CLV indicates the kind of relationship the company has with its customers. It tells the business how much money the customers spend on your product.", "2. Purchase Order: Calculates the average amount a customer spends on a typical purchase. Moreover, it can help marketers make investment decisions about the products which are high in demand or are preferred more by the audience.", "3. Customer Satisfaction: The customer happiness tells a marketer about how satisfied a customer is with the product or service. It aids in discovering groups of unhappy customers and awares marketers of the flaws in the product or process to be mitigated to deliver excellent customer experience and ebb the number of dissatisfied customers.", "These metrics can help the business focalize its efforts on key points which can be improved to ensue with a loyal customer base.", "Big data gives alignment to the business as in where and how to position its brand in the market. It can tell the marketer where to advertise and when to. It was found that customers don\u2019t engage with the brand when they\u2019re exposed to a TVC or an online ad on Facebook or other media.", "Across all ad formats and placements display ad CTR is just 0.05%", "The click-through rate of 0.05% means that only 5 out of 100 people engage with the online display of advertisements. Data can provide answers to questions such as \u201cCustomers from which locale are interested in my product?\u201d. By knowing the psychographics of the customers, businesses can decide on whether they should give discounts if customers are price conscious; or should focus on value game, by improving their product. Such information can help businesses decide on \u201cHow\u201d and \u201cWhere\u201d to position their brand to provide the best customer experience by capitalizing over the insights they gather from the data.", "With big data, the horizons of possibilities seem endless for enterprises of today and tomorrow; nevertheless, only its proper analysis can lead the way for businesses to extrapolate information from past trends and use it to predict future patterns and trends in the market. Tools like Google Analytics, are primarily being used by many marketers to gauge their company\u2019s online presence and to know their digital stand. Data has proven to be particularly useful for businesses, and that means that more and more businesses are now gaining competition in this Data War.", "For businesses today, data offers enormous scope for capitalization.
