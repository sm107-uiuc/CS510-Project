Would you tell it to the person who has been known to gossip and constantly lets things slip or the person who sees your secret as more than a juicy detail and is very responsible regarding the safekeeping of this information? Would you tell the person you hardly know, but you\u2019ve heard is trustworthy, or the person who you\u2019ve known for a while and has earned your trust? Would you tell the person who, upon hearing this sensitive information, asks ten different follow-up questions or the person who values the information you\u2019ve given them and doesn\u2019t press you for more information?", "Hopefully these questions have helped you formulate the kind of person you would deem trustworthy with regards to sensitive information.", "As governments deal with the current COVID-19 pandemic, privacy has taken a back seat to the greater good, a trend in we\u2019ve already seen in medical data well before the current crisis (see this article for a discussion of the usage of medical data, and this followup on how we\u2019re starting to see this play out in the pandemic). Recently, I watched this video from Vox about Korea\u2019s fairly successful response to COVID-19, and one quote that particularly interested me was the one pictured below from the Korean director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "The fact of the matter is, right now we will probably have to give up some amount of privacy in the interest of public health, especially if we want to have a response as effective as that of South Korea. However, giving up some privacy is not the same as giving up all our rights to privacy ever for the rest of our digital existence. At least, it doesn\u2019t have to mean that. As described in this New York Times article, in January, South Korean authorities posted a wealth of information about people who contracted COVID-19. As South Korea is such a plugged-in society, these people were tracked down pretty quickly and publicly shamed. In response, health officials announced this month that, \u201cthey would refine their data-sharing guidelines to minimize patient risk.\u201d By doing this, they are proving themselves to be more thoughtful and more trustworthy stewards of sensitive personal data. In fact the director of South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jung Eun-kyeong, recently said:", "\u201cWe will balance the value of protecting individual human rights and privacy and the value of upholding public interest in preventing mass infections\u201d", "Remember at the beginning of this article, when I asked you to imagine the kind of person you would share sensitive personal information with? From those questions, you\u2019ve probably formulated a person who has a proven track record of valuing sensitive information and respecting you and the sensitivity of the information. In short, they\u2019ve proven themselves to be trustworthy with regards to data. The statement above, along with the steps being taken by South Korean health officials, proves that the South Korean government is actively working towards being trustworthy stewards of public data.", "Of course, this acquisition and use of sensitive data is happening far beyond South Korea. We\u2019re seeing technology being used to track people in places like Poland, Israel, and France, among many others. As Americans know from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, once these permissions have been granted, it can be a lot harder to take them away. Additionally, as we enter into a more data-driven age, whether we like it or not, our personal data will likely become more and more accessible. This is why it\u2019s even more important that we develop concrete ways to ensure that the people who have our data are trustworthy stewards. If a body such as the government wants to have access to our data we need to be sure that they\u2019re trustworthy, and the best way to ensure that they remain trustworthy is to clearly define what \u201ctrustworthy\u201d means. Of course, that\u2019s a difficult task because that definition will likely vary depending on who you talk to. However, thinking back to that hypothetical trustworthy person I asked about at the beginning, I think we do generally agree on certain traits that make one trustworthy, such as acting in such a way that one doesn\u2019t take more information than they need and ensuring that the sensitive information doesn\u2019t inadvertently spread to other parties.", "In my post last week, I discuss how a culture that trivializes personal privacy can lead to disastrous results, as demonstrated in the recent Zoom security issues. While last week, I pointed out the negatives of a culture that trivializes privacy, this week, I want to point out the positives of a culture that takes personal privacy seriously, a culture like the one being fostered in the South Korean healthcare response to COVID-19. Yes, they definitely majorly misstepped when they released sensitive information back in January, but they took that opportunity to work to gain the public\u2019s trust and are much more careful when handling data. The loss of a certain amount of privacy doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing, if that loss is to a trustworthy, secure party that will responsibly handle data, will not ask for more than they need, and has demonstrated that they actively value human rights and privacy.", "No science is apolitical, and data science is no exception. This is especially true in this data-heavy reality we live in. In view of that, data scientists should not limit their goals to getting the best accuracy or precision score. Especially as we deal with more and more sensitive information, our goal should not always be \u201cget more data.\u201d Our goal should be, \u201cmake the most of what we have.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s limiting at times, but some of the best innovations come from adapting to limitations.", "Your home for data science.
