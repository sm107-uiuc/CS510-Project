LinkedIn is one of the conventional methods of reaching me.", "I am more than happy to answer any questions and give any advice on topics that falls within areas of my technical expertise. To date, I have approximately answered 50+ questions from individuals who have contacted me through LinkedIn. I\u2019ve also taken some time out to have video conference calls with individuals. Some questions I receive require more extensive answers.", "Most of the questions I get asked are around the best methods of learning machine learning, or which career paths to take.

Now, the amount I\u2019ve been paid is not life-changing, and I won\u2019t become a full-time consultant anytime soon. But the fact that individuals place a monetary value on just my expertise is still crazy to me.", "In addition to consultancy work, I was recently invited to be a Technical Author for a Computer Vision book that is to be released in the future. Again, the opportunity seemed too good to be true, but here I am today, a few chapters into the unreleased book.", "Apart from my learning and career, I can\u2019t predict what opportunities I might come across. Every month is different.", "I admire AI/ML YouTube channels, where the host teaches machine learning related topics or explain and implement techniques presented in research papers.", "And of course, I\u2019m a fan of Alex Fridman\u2019s podcasts and YouTube channel.", "On YouTube, I\u2019m a consumer, and I follow ML related channels such as Two Minutes Paper, Daniel Bourke, Sentdex, Deep Lizard, 3Blue1Brown, Yannic Kilcher, Abhishek Thakur etc.", "I\u2019ve decided to start building on the YouTube platform.
