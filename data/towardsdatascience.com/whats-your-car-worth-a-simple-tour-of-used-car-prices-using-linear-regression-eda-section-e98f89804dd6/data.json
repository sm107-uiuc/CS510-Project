Linear Regression is one of the most frequently used tools in the world of data analysis today. The results are clean, easy to compile (usually), and easily translatable. What it does is plot data points and attempt to determine factors that may or may not affect each data point\u2019s ability to fall along a certain baseline. It can also be used to determine trends and projections on practically anything. This is by no means a groundbreaking project, but more of a fun exercise in using linear regression on a practical problem faced by everyday car owners. What\u2019s my used car worth?", "So let\u2019s talk about used cars eh? I\u2019ll admit, this isn\u2019t going to be a long discussion as I know very little about cars. So this is going to be an analysis of cars and their features from someone who has very little domain knowledge of cars. Let\u2019s get into it!", "The first step is to gather data. My partner Omar and I went to Cars.com to scrape for cars. In an attempt to avoid being blocked and sabotaging our project, we scraped 3055 used car listings from their site. All listings were located within 10 miles of zip code 10004, and we were open to all makes and models. The model years were restricted from 2014 to 2018. We assumed that cars older than that would wander into truly beater territory, or that those listings would wander into unique or antique listings, so we wanted to avoid contaminating our data. Our scraping gave us the following categories:", "Now, that appears to be a lot of information. We immediately dropped interior color, stock, VIN, and trim, as we felt the first three were largely irrelevant to the resale value of the car, and the last had way too many Nans. It\u2019s easy to imagine that someone may be motivated to buy a RED car, but so long as the interior is not too egregious, no one really cares if the interior is beige or black. Stock consisted of an alphanumeric code that we felt was specific to the make, and we considered relevant to the brand, but not so much with respect to other cars, unless there were some obvious issues with the particular stock. Bear in mind, I know almost nothing about cars, so if any of you out there think I\u2019m wrong, please, by all means, let me know.", "Now that we have our freshly trimmed data, the next step was to clean it up a bit. We started by dropping out any major data issues. Someone, for example, listed a Tesla with a city_mpg of 102, and a highway_mpg of 105. We were not prepared to evaluate their particular metric on mpg, nor did we think it would be an appropriate comparison against our 3000 other gasoline cars. We next removed entries where the year was not listed, turned the year into number of years past 2019, and ensured all our numbers were integers for proper modeling. In the end, we were left with 2677 entries with 13 features, 4 continuous and 9 categorical.", "Let\u2019s take a peek and what we\u2019ve got shall we? First we examined the makes that we had pulled, to see what cars were most frequently seen on the secondary market:", "To me, this pie chart makes a great deal of sense. We see a lot of mid-range cars, for some reason, led by Nissan, but also encompassing the rest of the Japanese manufacturers. Interestingly, Mercedes were 6.0% of our used car market, before Ford or Hyundai. It's interesting if this has anything to do with the overall market capture rate of these cars, or if there\u2019s something about the Mercedes or their owners which encourages resale within the first 4 years. For example, maybe people who purchase Mercedes are obsessed with image and always want a newer shinier car. Or maybe Mercedes regularly produces cars with new upgrades that are compelling enough for people to want to get the newest model. Other interesting visualizations include examining the distribution of city_mpg, highway_mpg, and price seen below:", "I\u2019m pretty sure despite our small sample size, this is a pretty accurate snapshot of current industry trends, when it comes to mpg. If you\u2019re curious what cars are the outliers when it comes to mpg, the ones with over 40 MPG on both city and highway are exclusively hybrids. Those that fall below 20 MPG on city consist mostly of SUV\u2019s and the Hyundai Genesis. Those that fall below 20 MPG on highway are SUVs, but excluding the Hyundai Genesis. I think that warrants a LOL.", "There\u2019s some gems to mine from this initial analysis. Visualization of data helps us separate the wheat from some of the chaff. I don\u2019t need to scroll through data to find weird numbers, the graphs tell me a lot of where I need to focus on. I also know, maybe the Hyundai Genesis isn\u2019t the proper tradeoff for someone like me who wants value over luxury perks.", "Here are some more interesting graphs, showing the price distribution of a few of the brands we are working with:", "Wow, this really shines an interesting light on the future value of your car. Hondas average around 16\u201330k for their sedans, and edge into the 40k territory when you look at their SUV\u2019s and trucks. This distribution looks pretty promising. The same goes for Nissans. It\u2019s when we get into the luxury category of cars that the distributions start to look absolutely hilarious. Look at the Maseratis for example. All 5 listings are for the Maserati Ghibli, 2016\u20132017:", "Now Google tells me that these cars in 2020 retail for about $101k. In 3 years time, you can now find these cars for the price of a Honda Accord. At its best resale, that\u2019s a drop of 59%. Now let\u2019s take a look at the Porsche.", "The Porsche Cayenne S retails today for $116k fully loaded. In that same time frame, the 2016 Cayenne S retails for $48,594, still out of Honda range at a drop of 58%. Let\u2019s take a look at the Mercedes!", "The Mercedes S550 apparently isn\u2019t being manufactured anymore, so let\u2019s do a comparison to the more expensive 2020 S560 4matic. This car retails for about $120k. Entry 2031 selling for $72,901 shows a loss in value of only 39% over 4 years! I mean, this isn\u2019t exactly apple to apples, but it's not totally apples to oranges either.", "Ok, I think I\u2019m going to stop here. EDA is so much fun I could go on for hours looking at visualizations and crunching data looking for new relationships. I know I promised linear regression, but I think I\u2019ve captured enough of your attention for today. Besides, we want to use regression to predict the price of our used cars, not do the math on cars with the best resell potential. Next week we\u2019ll go into the linear regression and some of the interesting coefficients we discovered! Also, if someone who knows things about cars could weigh in on their observations, I\u2019d love to learn more about how this all works!", "Continued in What\u2019s Your Car Worth Part 2!", "Your home for data science.
