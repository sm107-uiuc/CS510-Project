To begin I would say clearly that climate is not mentioned specifically in China\u2019s A New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u89c4\u5212), AI Policy from 2017. On the other hand \u2018sustainable\u2019 is mentioned four times. There was two mentions of environmental protection. I will discuss these four mentions of sustainable; two of environmental protection; and the context within which they are mentioned. I have found six focal points that can be linked to addressing the climate crisis within China\u2019s AI strategy from 2017.", "\u201cWe shall develop intelligent economy, construct intelligent society, safeguard national security, build the ecosystem with cluster integration of knowledge, technology, industry and mutual support of talent, system, culture, foresee the risks and challenges, propel sustainable development as the center of the intelligent, and as a result comprehensively enhance the social productive forces, national strength and national competitiveness for the purpose to speed up the construction of innovative countries and the science and technology power of the world, to achieve \u201ctwo hundred years\u201d goals and to provide strong support for the great rejuvenation of the nation.\u201d", "The first mention of sustainable is mentioned in the second section called \u2018Overall Requirements\u2019 within the first point \u2018(A) Guiding Thought\u2019. Towards the end the 200 year goals are mentioned. The Two Centenaries (Chinese: \u4e24\u4e2a\u4e00\u767e\u5e74) is a set of goals advanced by General Secretary Xi Jinping following the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2012. It is said to be the basic foundation for achieving the \u201cChinese Dream\u201d, another ideology advanced by Xi. They were formed back in the 80\u2019s. The goal for 2020 is the elimination of extreme poverty in China, linking it to GDP.", "\u2018Can hold continued nature\u2019, as such this relates perhaps to ecology as well as the other notion of ability to sustain.", "Sustainability has been a great part of China\u2019s current strategies, however linking it partly to GDP may be unfortunate as this has been shown increasingly to be an indicator which can have adverse effects. Exchanging this measurement tool could be fortunate, however then it may not be an easy way to retrospectively track.", "\u201cThe development of artificial intelligence is a complex systemic project related to the overall situation. In accordance with the layout of \u201cbuild a system, grasp the dual attributes, adhere to the Trinity, strengthen the four support\u201d , we shall form the strategic path for an healthy and sustainable developments of artificial intelligence.\u201d", "The Trinity mentioned here is dubious, and I may be wrong. However Carl von Clausewitz, who sought to illuminate the \u201ctrinity\u201d of strategy by connecting the relationship between the people, the military, and the government, Sun Tzu looked at the interdependencies between these actors while accounting for the role of nature, terrain, and laws in shaping strategy. Granted I may be wrong.", "On the other hand it is more likely that it refers to the goal of (1) a stable yuan, (2) open borders and (3) control of its own interest rates. This has been dubbed the impossible trinity.", "This section talks not only of the goal, and that sustainability is at the center, it also insists that the path to the goal must be healthy and sustainable.", "\u201cWe shall focus on the major scientific frontier issues of artificial intelligence, take into account the current needs and long-term development, break through the basic theory of artificial intelligence bottlenecks as the focus, and ensure that advanced layout may lead to artificial intelligence paradigm transformation of basic research, promote crossintegration of disciplines for sustainable development and depth applications of artificial intelligence and provide strong scientific reserves.\u201d", "In the translated document crossintegration is mentioned, and I have chosen to translate it to trandisciplinary.", "It is unsure in what way this will be ensured, and which \u2018type\u2019 of disciplines that should be involved. The focus on integrating disciplines is an interesting thought as this has proven challenging in many setting. It is certainly necessary in an academic, business or government environment that there are strong scientific reserves to help facilitate this collaboration as well.", "\u201cHigh performance computing infrastructure. Continue to strengthen the supercomputing infrastructure, distributed computing infrastructure and cloud computing center construction. Build a sustainable ecosystem for the consistent development of highperformance computing applications. Promote the next generation of supercomputer research and development applications.\u201d", "Since the pathway to AI must be \u2018sustainable\u2019 it makes sense that there needs to be a sustainable ecosystem for development. Sustainable and consistent may of course be open for interpretation, and the speed at which the development is outlined may be a challenge to the sustainability of the projects that occur.", "\u201cArtificial intelligence brings new opportunities for social construction. China is in a comprehensive stage of building a well-off society, population aging, resource environment constraints and other challenges are still grim and the application of artificial intelligence in education, medical care, pension, environmental protection, urban operation, judicial services and other fields will greatly improve the precision level of public service, comprehensively enhancing the quality of life of the people.\u201d", "This goal is too general to say much in specific, and yet specifically mentioning AI to be opportunities in a set of different areas. The main point to drive home here is that there is a wish to increase precision in public service. There has been a want from governments to be more accurate and specific operating in an ambiguous world with large population. China is the most populous country in the world with 1,379,302,771 people estimated in 2017. It is hard to equate quantitative understanding to quality of life, however with this large number it is clear that making sense of this data or making decisions is likely to involve a large degree of automation.", "\u201cIntelligent environmental protection. Establish big data platform for smart monitoring in the atmosphere, water, soil and other environmental areas. Build land and sea interaction, land and earth interaction, and information-sharing intelligent environment monitoring network and service platform. Research and develop intelligent forecasting models and early warning programs for resource energy consumption and environmental pollutant discharge. Strengthen the environmental protection and intelligent prevention and control systems for sudden environmental events in BeijingTianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Economic Zone and other major national strategic regions.\u201d", "This relates both to ensuring the protection of environmental sites and predicting sudden changes in the environment. Sudden changes are expected to occur more often going forward, and therefore it is important to be able to use more accurate models to predict or understand what is happening across a large area. Forecasting would necessarily have to be a collaboration which has been the case across the world for weather data, however the will to measure and forecast is nothing new \u2014 adding artificial intelligence to the mix is not a strange course of events.", "We can see six focal points that can be linked to addressing the climate crisis within China\u2019s AI strategy from 2017. I would argue it is addressed within the strategy and there can be initiatives developed on the basis of these points, or arguments made to bring projects to life within these focal points. I have added one question to each point.", "As a final remark I realise there are controversies about China that do not make these points unproblematic. I am not blind to these, however it is important to understand how we can work together to address the climate crisis \u2014 because it is a dire crisis and China has the largest population on the planet, we are all dependant on how China as well handles this pervasive issue.", "This is #500daysofAI and you are reading article 155. I write one new article about or related to artificial intelligence every day for 500 days.", "Your home for data science.
