I can help with that. Here\u2019s another one of my weekly writings on the data industry. This week, we will be talking about data visualizations yet again. Find a comfortable spot, grab a cup of coffee and prepare to do some code.", "Last week, we talked about how important data visualizations are. We learnt how Plotly is insanely useful in explaining and exploring data compared to the classic Matplotlib and Seaborn. We also learnt to plot basic visualizations like bar charts, pie charts and bubble plots with Plotly. We talked about that in the first article I wrote about Plotly.", "After we got our feet wet with Plotly, it\u2019s time to tap into the true potential of it by using the interactive tools it provides. When we visualize data with Plotly, we are able to add certain tools to allow us to customize the visualization experience. This can prove to be essential when presenting data to business owners since it is able to convey your point much more clearer.", "Here\u2019s an example with the titanic dataset,Say that we want to show the distribution of Fares for both females and males together as well as able to show them separately. We can add a dropdown for that and Plotly will do the rest for us.", "By using plotly, we can customize what to show and not to show on the chart interactively. We do this by adding dropdowns, sliders, buttons and other options. It might look simple here with the male and female option, but we will see how useful this is in this article.", "In this guide, I will cover comprehensively how to add and customize your own dropdowns, sliders and buttons to improve your plotly visualizations.", "Obviously, we will be working with Plotly a lot in this guide. Hence, please make sure you have a solid understanding on the basics of Plotly before continuing on this advance guide. You can do that by referring to the article I wrote about the Basics of Plotly here.", "By having to work with Plotly, you should be comfortable working with Pandas as well. What a coincidence.I happen to have written A Guide to Pandas as well. Please do refresh your memory on it.", "Plotly, Pandas, Etc. Come on now, you know I got you.", "As usual, we will be working with Jupyter Notebook.", "Let\u2019s work with the option I had first shown in this article, A dropdown Menu.", "Dropdowns are useful if you want to allow a range of options while conserving space on your plot. We don\u2019t want to overwhelm whoever is looking at your chart with a bunch of options. Hence, we keep them hidden in a dropdown and allow them to access these options if they want to.", "If you had not already read my article on the Basics of Plotly, we need to define 3 important parameters in Plotly. The data, layout and figure parameter.The way we add a dropdown menu in our plot is by adding this command in the layout parameter of Plotly.", "That will set up the dropdown menu for us. However, we need to define what to display on the dropdown menu itself, as well as the changes to apply while selecting these options. We can achieve all of the above by defining the list_updatemenus parameter.", "Special Note: Dropdown Menus in Plotly have the power to change not only data, it can also change your layout and perform animations as well.In this article, we will only cover interactions with data.You can research about it more here, perhaps one day I might write on this topic. Hmm.. food for thought.", "Back to the matter at hand, the list_updatemenus is a list of dictionaries. For each dictionary, an option is generated in the dropdown menu. We define the functionalities of these options in each of the dictionaries.", "That sounds confusing when I say it, but it is actually much simpler when you go through it in code.Let\u2019s get started.", "For each dictionary in list_updatemenus, we can call each of this dictionary an option. For each option, we need to define at least 3 parameters:", "For the args parameter, we should have at least 2 parameters in the list:", "Here\u2019s a graph to help you understand what\u2019s going on.", "The \u2018Visible\u2019 in Args defines what gets shown in our plot.It is a list of boolean values corresponding to the data parameter we had defined in plotly.", "Again, our data parameter is a list of graph objects we had defined to plot our chart. By defining the visible parameter, we can choose which graph object/objects to display interactively.", "Here\u2019s an example, say our data is", "We can choose to only show any combinations of graph objects within the list by using the visible parameter here.", "Now that you understand what does everything mean,here\u2019s a template to define your dropdown menus.", "Here\u2019s an example with the titanic dataset.We want to show the Distribution of Fares by Pclass and Gender.We can do it by:", "From this plot, we can interact with it to show the distribution of fares by Gender or Pclass. We can then show each Pclass or Gender separately or collectively by clicking on the legends as well. By now, you should realize how powerful this is.", "We are only using histograms for this example. You can have other plots as your options as well, visualizing the same metric in different ways.At this point, it is totally up to your imagination on how you want to present your data.", "Custom Buttons serve the same purpose as dropdown menus. The only difference is that custom buttons display all the options upfront on the plot for the world to see. Use this to your advantage if you want your audience to know all your options upfront, it may or may not help them understand what you are trying to present better.", "The syntax to add custom buttons is extremely similar to dropdowns as well. The only difference is that you add \u201ctype = buttons\u201d in the layout.", "Thats pretty much it. Let\u2019s head on to another example.", "For this example, we are trying to show the Distribution of Age by Pclass for Survived and Non-Survived passengers.", "Observing the plot, we can see that majority of non-survivors purchased 3rd class on the titanic. Majority of these 3rd Class non-survivors age between 15 and 35. This lead me to believe that the Pclass column definitely plays a role in determining if a survivor survives or not.", "With custom buttons, it is more obvious to the audience that you are filtering for survived and non-survived passengers. In certain situations, this will make your presentation look more professional and easier to understand.", "While buttons and dropdowns are good at displaying different plots, I find that sliders are good at showing plots while changing the value of certain variables. It is even more obvious if said variable is a continuous numeric variable. Age can be a perfect example here.", "Sliders work the same way as dropdowns and buttons. The difference is that sliders allow you to display a huge amount of options while interacting with the slider. The slider itself also gives an illusion of increasing and decreasing a certain value, but that may not have to be the case.", "We can use a slider the same way we used for dropdowns and buttons, which is showing different type of plots by slicing through the data from different perspectives. However, I prefer displaying a certain plot while being able to manipulate a variable to better tell a story.", "Just like dropdowns and buttons, the way we add a slider in our plot is by adding a simple parameter in our layout.", "We define what to display on the slider and changes applied by defining the sliders and steps parameter, just like how we defined our list_updatemenus for dropdowns.", "Similarly, the sliders parameter is a list of dictionaries. For each dictionary, a slider is generated on the plot.", "The sliders hold parameters that define default values like:", "The steps parameter is equivalent to the list_updatemenus of dropdowns.It is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary generates an option on the slider. We define the functionalities of these options by defining:", "Here\u2019s a graph to help you understand what\u2019s going on.", "Let\u2019s head on to an example to help you understand this better. For this, we intend to show the Changes in Survivability as Age increases for the passengers on Titanic.", "In my mind, I\u2019m picturing a bar chart showing the count of 0s and 1s of survived changing while we manipulate the slider. Since we are manipulating Age, we should have our slider set up for Age. We will also have to create a graph object for each step of Age we increase. Here is how we do it.", "For this block of code, we are creating a graph object (bar chart) for every 2 step increase from age 0 to age 80. Hence, we essentially have 40 steps and graph objects here. The slider will be able to navigate through these steps and graph objects effectively.", "Next, we define our sliders and steps parameter.", "In this block of code, we are creating and appending a dictionary to the steps parameter for each increase of 2 years in age, while including all the changes to be made for each step.", "Lastly, we define our layout and plot our graph.", "Voila, what a beautiful plot.We see that the non-survivor count starts to surpass the survivor count once we hit Age 18. We can also safely say that for all passengers under 18, majority of them survived. This may provide useful information to our analysis.", "If you had not caught up yet, the sliders is incredibly effective in showing changes of values. It also plays a huge role if you are trying to display data against time. It is an incredibly powerful tool and I hope you start to use it more in your analysis.", "Here\u2019s the full code for everything we had just run through this article:", "Rejoice. You have made it till the end.It\u2019s a lot to take in. I get it.", "In this guide, you\u2019ve learnt 3 main interactive tools for Plotly which are:", "These tools will definitely give you an edge in trying to understand your dataset, performing valuable analysis and presenting to stakeholders.", "We are not done yet with our data journey. I am working on more stories, writings and guides on the data industry. You can absolutely expect more posts like this. In the meantime, feel free to check out my other articles to temporary fill your hunger for data.", "Now go on my friends, show the world how powerful we data practitioners are. As usual, I end with a quote.", "Without big data, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway. \u2014 Geoffrey Moore", "You can also support me by signing up for a medium membership through my link. You will be able to read an unlimited amount of stories from me and other incredible writers!", "I am working on more stories, writings, and guides in the data industry.
