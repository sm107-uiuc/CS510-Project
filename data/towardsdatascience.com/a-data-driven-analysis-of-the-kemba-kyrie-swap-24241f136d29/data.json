It seems like ages ago now that Kyrie Irving left town for Brooklyn to team up with Kevin Durant. This was less than a year after Kyrie claimed to love Boston and that he was here for the long haul. Unlike other Boston fans however, I have a hard time holding hate for Kyrie in my heart because I like him so much as a player \u2014 that\u2019s besides the point of this article.", "Now the surprise for us Boston fans was that Kemba Walker of the Charlotte Hornets was interested in coming to play for the Celtics. This was weird because 1) It seemed like Walker was intent on staying with the Hornets, and 2) Boston really seemed like it came out of nowhere for his desired playing destination. We all know what he did at the University Connecticut when he hit the shot of shots in the March Madness tournament, eventually leading the Huskies to winning the Men\u2019s College Basketball championship.m", "So anyways, getting to the point of this article. Let\u2019s try to dissect who won this \u201cswap\u201d, who\u2019s the better player, and what we might be able to expect going forward. We\u2019re only analyzing the tangibles here, so we aren\u2019t going to be able to account for intangibles such as chemistry and player\u2019s responsiveness to coaching.", "Let\u2019s take a look at some basic stats before we really break it down (all statistics are from basketball-reference.com). I\u2019ll be using Python (and it\u2019s matplotlib module in particular) to generate some graphs. Let\u2019s get started.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the stats that pertain the most to the point guard position. Traditionally and historically, the point guard position is the one who controls the tempo of the game with their play making. Naturally two stats come to mind: points, and assists. Kyrie is a 22.2 PPG in his career, while Kemba is 19.8 PPG.", "If we look in to assists, the numbers are far more similar, with Kemba at 5.5 APG, and Kyrie at 5.7 APG. Both the points and assists averages over their careers are pretty similar. Kyrie is the more naturally talented player, so we can attribute the higher PPG to that. Though Kyrie has benefited from better teammates over his career, he still only averages .2 more assists per game, which may indicate that Kemba can service better on a team. Even when Kyrie played on the Celtics, an arguably more talented roster, he only averaged 6.1 APG, just .6 APG higher than his average with the Cavaliers, and only .4 APG higher than his career average.", "Since we compared the standard statistics of a conventional point guard, let\u2019s look at something very important in the modern day NBA \u2014 the 3 point shot.", "Before we go further ahead, its worth noting that while Kyrie and Kemba have both played 8 seasons \u2014 both were drafted in the 2011 draft, going at selections 1 and 9 respectively, Kemba has played 97 more games, though Kyrie has started in all the 508 games he has played. Let\u2019s take a look at three point percentage and totals:", "Both Kyrie and Kemba have averaged 2.1 3 point shot makes per game. However, Kyrie makes them at a higher clip, averaging 5.4 attempts per game compared to Kemba\u2019s 5.9 attempts per game. While that doesn\u2019t seem like a huge difference, it\u2019s actually Kemba shooting 35% from three in contrast to Kyrie\u2019s nearly 39%.", "The totals once again paint a similar picture. The 3 point percentage made is obviously the same as above. The higher number of attempts (and therefore misses) on Kemba\u2019s part can be attributed to more games played. However, that being said, Kemba has made 1283 3-point shots in his career 605 games, compared to Kryie\u2019s 1063 in 508 games. If we were to hypothetically keep everything linear and fit Kyrie to 605 games, he would have made 1266 3-pointers, which is somewhat comparable.", "Two things to note so far \u2014 this data has essentially led us to no realistic conclusion of better fit; that is, we\u2019re just seeing head to head averages over the course of two great point guards\u2019 careers. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to include per 36 minute statistics because both players play starter level minutes (Kemba plays 34.1 MPG, compared to Kyrie\u2019s 33.8 MPG). I think something which will be far more telling though, is looking at recent seasons, along with some more advanced metrics.", "So let\u2019s think about why we should look at recent seasons. It\u2019s for a couple of reasons. First, we want to see who is the better fit for the Boston Celtics as a whole. This means we would want to look at Kyrie\u2019s last two seasons only and compare them to Kemba\u2019s. We can double down on this notion because Kemba has only become an All-Star since the 2017 season. Whether or not you think that he should have been an All-Star before then really won\u2019t help us, so let\u2019s dive in to stats and advanced metrics for only the last two seasons. Let\u2019s get the basics out of the way.", "The PPG, APG, and 3PT% are what we want to look at again.", "Once again, this data comes to be a bit inconclusive, as Kemba has averaged 23.85 PPG compared to 24.1 PPG for Kyrie over the last two seasons. The same can be said for APG, with Kemba and Kyrie at 5.75 and 6 APG respectively \u2014 though Kyrie did average a career high 6.9 APG last season, which can be attributed to better teammates, we\u2019ll get to that really soon.", "Over the last two seasons, Kyrie has been a fantastic 3 point scorer percentage wise, making 40.4% compared to Kemba\u2019s 37%. Kyrie\u2019s ability to attempt and make tough (three point) shots off the dribble cannot be looked over; there might not be another player in the league better at creating their own shot *LeBron fans anger towards me intensifies*", "One thing worth noting though is that Kemba has played nearly all the possible games over the past two seasons, only missing two games. Kemba has played 162 games compared to Kyrie\u2019s 127 games. Kemba\u2019s longevity is a huge plus point, but in each of Kemba\u2019s three All-Star seasons, the Hornets failed to qualify for the postseason. Once again we can attribute this to the team around him to some extent, and we\u2019ll look in to some advanced metrics to see who\u2019s the better fit.", "As mentioned before, the Charlotte Hornets did not qualify for the post season in each of Kemba\u2019s All-Star seasons. Kyrie had arguably the best supporting cast of his career last season, but as a squad, the Celtics only finished 49\u201333, underperforming from the previous year. The Hornets finished 39\u201343. To get a better snapshot of supporting casts, let\u2019s dive deeper into the metrics.", "The Hornets starting lineup that played the most games together at 37 games, was Nic Batum-Jeremy Lamb-Kemba Walker-Marvin Williams-Cody Zeller. This lineup went 19\u201318, the best win percentage (51.4%) amongs all other starting lineups they played. On the other hand, the Boston Celtics\u2019 starting lineup that played 33 games together, went 19\u201314 at a 57.6% win percentage. The lineup in question was Al Horford-Kyrie Irving-Marcus Morris-Marcus Smart-Jayson Tatum. This might come as a shock to certain people considering that 1) We are paying Gordon Hayward a lot and expected a lot from him and 2) Jaylen Brown seemingly showed signs of regression. If we look deeper though, we see that there were actually two 5 game sets which had starting lineups which were far superior. The Aron Baynes-Al Horford-Kyrie Irving-Marcus Smart-Jayson Tatum lineup went 4\u20131 at an 80% win rate, and the Al Horford-Marcus Morris-Terry Rozier-Marcus Smart-Jayson Tatum starting lineup went a whopping 5\u20130 with an obvious 100% win rate.", "Al Horford, Marcus Morris, and Aron Baynes are no longer on the team anymore. So this is going to have an obvious influence on how we put together Kemba\u2019s fit on the Celtics. Before we try to put that together, let\u2019s take a look at win share related metrics for just the 2018\u20132019 season. We\u2019ll be looking at VORP (Value Over Replacement Player). If we multiply a player\u2019s VORP by 2.7, we get their WAR (Wins Above Replacement). Since the scale is linear (2.7x) it doesn\u2019t really matter in terms of data visualization, so let\u2019s look at the VORP for the 2018\u20132019 season.", "Here we have the VORP for the Celtics starting lineup which played 33 games together. Kyrie Irving counts for the lions share in terms of having the highest VORP at 4.7, taking up 41.6% of the starting lineups total VORP. Irving is benefited by having Al Horford\u2019s help who comes in at 3.4.", "If we look at the Hornets VORP chart, we see that Kemba actually counts for a higher percentage of the overall VORP at 41.9%. Kemba\u2019s individual VORP is 3.9, but isn\u2019t bolstered by an Al Horford type to help him out. The next highest VORP on the entire squad is Nic Batum at 1.7. So it\u2019s clear that Kyrie did have the better supporting cast.", "In order to get an even better visual of supporting cast, let\u2019s look at the WAR (Wins Above Replacement) for those lineups without Kemba and Kyrie.", "Clearly the Celtics teammates have the better WAR last season than the Hornets teammates, coming in at 17.82 compared to 14.58.", "Taking what we know about the Celtics lineup, let\u2019s see what would happen if we put Kemba into a best case lineup of Kemba-Marcus Smart-Jayson Tatum-Jaylen Brown-Enes Kanter. I\u2019ll admit that this one isn\u2019t going to be perfect because 1) Enes Kanter\u2019s VORP last season isn\u2019t going to be great given that he was playing in place of Nurkic who was having a career season (so we\u2019ll use his career average VORP) and 2) We don\u2019t know what the starting lineup will be, meaning we can\u2019t really hedge bets on Jaylen Brown or Gordon Hayward.", "As it turns out Jaylen Brown actually had a VORP of 0.0. Hayward actually had a VORP of 1.2, to my, and probably everyone else\u2019s surprise. We should expect Brown and Hayward to take a step forward this season without Kyrie.", "I would put up another graphic of the aforementioned squads comparing VORP/WAR with Kyrie/Kemba, but it\u2019s really not that telling because Kyrie has a VORP of 4.7 compared to Kemba\u2019s 3.9, so it\u2019s just going to be 0.8 more consistently.", "So what the numbers show us is that there isn\u2019t a huge gap in terms of pure production between Kyrie Irving and Kemba Walker. As I mentioned before, I only took into account tangibles. I\u2019m trying to be unbiased, but based off the numbers its not out of the question for the Celtics to be better in win total than the previous season. Honestly, the VORP/WAR numbers tell us that Horford is the bigger loss, seeing as his VORP of 3.4 last season far and beyond outweighs projected center Enes Kanter\u2019s who comes in with a VORP of 0.6 from last season (but with a career VORP of 2.1, still a downgrade though).", "Obviously this isn\u2019t a perfect article and analysis of the roster and the two players in question. There was a few reasons I did this:", "I would gladly appreciate any feedback! I know other tools already exist online to do the type of breakdown I did, but I just did it for fun seeing it combines the two things I like the most: Basketball and Coding (especially Python). I fully intend to put something else like this together, possibly looking at the new Los Angeles Clippers lineups with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Going forward I would like to:", "Lastly, on the off chance that Kyrie or Kemba see this: This is just a software engineer having fun and trying to learn. I got nothing but love for y\u2019all and what you\u2019ve done/will do for the Celtics.", "Software Engineer from Boston.
