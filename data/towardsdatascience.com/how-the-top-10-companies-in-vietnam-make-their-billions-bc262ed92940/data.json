Looking at the break down of revenue from each of the companies, by product/service lines and geographic region, I wonder how the picture would look like for top companies in my country \u2014 Vietnam.", "With that question in mind, I focus on the top 10 private companies in Vietnam to analyze how their revenue breakdown. For the rest of this article, I will describe the process and exciting findings from this analysis step by step:", "For this analysis, I use the list of top 10 private companies in Vietnam for 2019 ranked by VNR500.", "Why VNR500? I choose to use this list since revenue was the first criterion in the compiling of this list according to their ranking method.", "Why top 10 private companies, not the \u201ctop 10\u201d largest companies in Vietnam? VNR500 does provide a list of top 10 largest companies in Vietnam, but I decided not to use this list for two main reasons: (1) 8 out of 10 companies in this list are state-owned companies in, considered by the government, critical industries (i.e., energy, telecommunication, and financial service); and (2) 9 out of 10 companies in this list do not public its financial report, leading to difficulties in collecting data and only unofficial number are available from different news outlets.", "With that, the top 10 private companies in Vietnam that we will \u201cdissect\u201d their 2019 revenue, are:", "How big are these ten companies? To put things in perspective, I looked at the combined 2019 revenue from this group of companies as a percentage of Vietnam GDP in the same year (WorldBank data).", "Is that a lot? Considering the big five tech companies (Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft) make $990B revenue, which equivalent to 4% of USA GDP ($21.43 trillion) in 2019, what do you think?", "This is how the revenue breakdown of the top 10 private companies in Vietnam by industry (product/service type):", "Please note that for the DOJI group, the consolidated financial statement of the group was not shared with the public. For this analysis, I assumed all revenues of the group are related to its core business line \u2014 Gold, silver, and gem trading. However, it\u2019s known that the DOJI group had started a business in real estate since 2019, even though no further information regarding the revenue of this business line can be found.", "If we look at 2019 revenue combined by the top 10 companies breakdown by industry, retail, and manufacturing are the leading industry with the contribution of ~130 trillion VND each. Looking at this chart, I wonder how this breakdown looks like five years ago, for the top 10 companies, and that\u2019s what we will explore in the next section.", "Looking back five years ago, the year of 2014, how things are different from 2019:", "As a result, you can see how the breakdown of the combined revenue from the top 10 has changed during these 5 years.", "Retail took over the 1st place, growing ~6x within five years (note that FPT \u2014 one of the dominant players in electronic device retailer made the list in 2014 but dropped out by 2019). Financial service, ranking 1st place in 2014, dropped to 5th place since only two commercial banks are on the list in 2019, instead of four in 2014. Real estate has held its position as well as the percentage of combined revenue throughout the years. Telecommunication and technology solutions are no longer in the mix for 2019 due to the exit of FPT Group from the top 10.", "Here are my predictions for 2020 top 10 list:", "Vietjet \u2014 Aviation: since the pandemic profoundly impacts the airline industry, it will not be surprising if Vietjet\u2019 s position drops, or event out of the list.", "VinGroup, MWG, and Masan Group \u2014 Retails: in 2019, Masan acquired the retail business from VinGroup, and this will impact the position of not just two but three companies in the list.", "What do you think?
