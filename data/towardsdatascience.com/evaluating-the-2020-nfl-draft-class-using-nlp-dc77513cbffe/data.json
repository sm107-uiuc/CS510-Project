Hours and hours of work are put in for this one night to ensure teams draft the right players that are needed. The NFL draft is very unpredictable, with teams drafting players that no one saw coming to teams making trades to move up in the draft to try to get that one athlete who will become the steal of the draft. In 2017 the Chicago Bears took this chance and gave the San Francisco 49ers 4 draft picks to move up to the 2nd overall pick in the draft where they took Mitchell Trubisky (the player they thought would be the steal). A few picks later a quarterback by the name of Patrick Mahomes was taken. Going back to present day, Patrick Mahomes is an MVP, and super bowl winning quarterback while Trubisky is competing for a starting position in Chicago. The draft can be very cruel at times.", "The college players in the draft are viewed under a microscope and analyzed by scouting departments all the way until the night of the draft. Because this is one of the biggest nights in football many football analysts write their reviews on these players, and create mock drafts to simulate how they think the draft will go. Analysts often have conflicting views, so which one do you trust to evaluate a certain player? How about using all of them. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) we are going to evaluate the top draft prospects using all the analysis reviews and mock drafts that could be found.", "Each athlete in the draft have qualities that make them unique. These qualities when demonstrated on the field are often raved about by analysts. Therefore using the combination of analyst reviews and mock drafts were going to find the qualities that make each athlete standout. To do this, NLP is gonna be used to find the qualities that appear the most in the reviews.", "Natural Language Processing is typically used on speech and text for data science purposes. It has become increasingly popular, most knowingly in the form of Siri, Google Homes, and Amazon Echoes. This has caused the creation of many libraries that we can use to make NLP easier to code. One very important library is the NLTK library. This library has the ability to read a sentence and determine which words are nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. This is important to us because we don\u2019t want just any words, we want the words that describe each athlete and their playing style. This is the reason only adjectives and verbs will be kept in the reviews.", "To figure out which of these words appear the most, a simple dictionary is used for each athlete. The key values in the dictionary are all the unique words in all of the reviews, and the values are the count of how often those words appear. Word Clouds will be used to visualize these qualities where the bigger the size of the word the more frequent that word came up.", "Chase Young is easily the best defensive player in the draft. Just some of the qualities that make him the best are seen in the word cloud. Young is a powerful edge rusher. He explodes of the ball and is a great combination player that plays the run and pass very well. The analysts see this too as those key words are often used to describe Young in their analysis, resulting in those key words being some of his top qualities that make him standout.", "Coming off perhaps the greatest season by a quarterback in college football history. Joe Burrow is the unanimous projected 1st overall pick in the draft. The qualities he posses that made him into a elite passer include his superb accuracy, great pocket presence, and his ability to face pressure in tough situations during games. This was previously seen in the National Championship Game where Burrow would lead LSU to win the National Title.", "By finding the features that are most common in a players analysis, you can get a pretty good idea about the strengths of the player without even watching them. For example, below is a list of the most frequent words that were used to describe some of the top prospects in the draft. Just by viewing the one or two words that describe each player, you get a view of what that player is like.", "Each analysis on a collegiate athlete includes their indicated strengths and weaknesses. This gives a good assessment on whether the athlete is more of a asset than a liability on the field, and is how we will evaluate these athletes even further.", "Sentiment analysis refers to the use of Natural Language Processing, and text analysis to identify subjective information. A widely used example of sentiment analysis is spam detection. When you receive an e-mail with key words that associate with spam mail, spam detection will classify that e-mail as spam and will put it into a spam folder. This basic understanding of sentiment analysis is how were going evaluate these athletes. Given their reviews were going to create a model that outputs the probability that the reviews on the athletes are positive rather than negative. Higher the probability the more highly the athlete is talked about.", "The model will be a logistic regression model used for classification. The inputs into this model are all the reviews for each athlete. To determine how positive or how negative the reviews are, the model will be trained on multiple Pros/Cons reviews in football. Essentially what will happen is that all the positive sentences will be indicated with a 1 and the negative sentences with a 0. The model will then evaluate which words respond the most to a positive review and which ones respond the most to a negative review. The list of words below are the biggest word indicators of a positive/negative review. Higher the number the more influence that word has.", "After the model is trained we can now input our athletes and their reviews into the model to see truly if their strengths outweigh their weaknesses.", "20 athletes who are projected to go in the first round of the draft were inputted into the model. The output is their respective probability that the reviews are more positive compared to negative. The results are what we would assume from some of the best collegiate athletes. Most probabilities are very high since these athletes are at the top of their class their strengths heavily outweigh their weaknesses. However there are a few surprises on this list. Firstly the athlete who ranked the highest in probability was not Chase Young or Joe Burrow but in fact Tristan Wirfs, an offensive tackle who played at the University of Iowa. Looking back on some of his reviews he is highly spoken of with very little criticism for an offensive tackle. Secondly and maybe the most surprising is the fact that Joe Burrow isn\u2019t even the highest rated quarterback on this list. Tua Tagovailoa, the quarterback at Alabama is. Tua has been NFL ready for a while now, and being the leader on the powerhouse that Alabama is, is a major reason he\u2019s very positively talked about. Burrow on the other hand has had one incredible year, not years. And with him being the projected 1st overall pick it\u2019s natural for those to talk about what he lacks, resulting him to have a lower probability than Tua. In my opinion Burrow is better than Tua but maybe the gap is much closer than people think, as evidence is seen through the model.", "Kenneth Murray is a linebacker for the Oklahoma Sooners. He is a dynamic blitzer and has the athleticism to cover in the secondary. In many occurring mock drafts Murray is predicted to be the 3rd linebacker drafted overall. Many place him in the high 20\u2019s in the first round. I believe he can be the steal of the draft. When our model was run Murray was the highest rated linebacker, meaning he has the highest upside compared to his flaws. The main quality that analysts talked about was his athleticism. Linebackers today are asked to do more and more especially in coverage with how the NFL has transitioned to a major pass league. I believe this is where Murray will shine and become a dominant interior linebacker like Luke Kuechly.", "Kristian Fulton is a cornerback for LSU. Fulton is predicted to be drafted in the first round, however I believe he can become the bust of the draft. When the model was run for Fulton the output was only 0.68, the lowest for all the athletes that were tested. This indicates he is positively talked about but his flaws often come up in his analysis. These flaws indicate that he is not a tough/physical player. I believe the fact that since he is a starting corner on the National winning team that may have boost his stock. He may have appeared like he was playing great since LSU was blowing out all their competitors. But when it came to the National Championship game between Clemson (a very close game), Fulton struggled in coverage against top competition.", "The hours spent evaluating these athletes could be in the 100s. So much goes into finding the right athlete to fill the right hole on any team. With so many opinions on who that athlete should be, Natural Language Processing gave us a solution to hear everyone\u2019s. It is just one more evaluation we can do to further analyze these athletes to hopefully find who the next star of the NFL will be.", "7-Figure Agency Owner | Join my FREE email list to learn how to
