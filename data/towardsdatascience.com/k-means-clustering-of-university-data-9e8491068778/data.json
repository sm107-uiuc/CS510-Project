For this project, I want to introduce K-means clustering, one of the most common clustering algorithms in machine learning. Along the way, we\u2019ll do some exploratory data analysis to understand more about a dataset about universities.", "For those of you who may be new to machine learning, clustering is an example of an unsupervised learning model, when we feed uncategorized training data into a model and have our model attempt to categorize that data in some way according to its features.", "The alternative is a supervised learning model, where we assign labels to our training data in advance indicating which category each data point belongs to, and the model attempts to predict which category a new data point belongs to.", "I worked in education in China for almost 4 years, and my work involved using data analytics to estimate students\u2019 likelihood of admission to universities on their school list given their profile. Just for fun, I\u2019ll create a model in Python using K-means clustering to cluster universities into two groups: private and public. In reality, a student who does at least cursory research on a university website can find out in under a minute whether a school is private or public, but we\u2019ll see if a model can correctly categorize schools based on features that may seem very relevant (out-of-state tuition, graduation rate) and others that might not seem relevant at all (percentage of alumni who donate).", "NOTE: we actually have the labels for this data set, but we will NOT use them for the K-means clustering algorithm, since that is an unsupervised learning algorithm. At the end, I\u2019ll compare K-means to a supervised learning algorithm to compare the performance of the two models.", "Here are the features in this dataset \u2014 feel free to glance at them and think about how well or poorly they might predict a school being public or private:", "A good way to start any analysis is to use Pandas.DataFrame.describe() to get some basic statistics about your data.", "Purely by looking at the max value of some of these columns, a few things stand out:", "Feel free to poke around the mean, median, and other statistics to see what sticks out to you! That\u2019s what makes it exploratory data analysis.", "Let\u2019s figure out which college had the highest number of applicants.", "Turns out Rutgers has the highest number of applicants and acceptances, but not the highest number of enrollments. Another major bragging point for high schools and universities alike is their student-faculty ratio: the lower the better.", "The winner here is University of Charleston, with a very low ratio of 2.5, which is practically as intimate a teaching environment as homeschooling or private tutoring. Considering that the 25th percentile of the student-faculty ratio is 11.5, U of C is a major outlier.", "Now let\u2019s talk money: which university has the highest alumni donation rate?", "Hardly surprising that Williams takes the prize as it\u2019s a small liberal arts college (~2000 students total) that caters to largely wealthy families with a strong network. Calling .describe() earlier told us that the median donation percentage was a measly 21%, hence the abundance of on-campus job opportunities as student callers.", "Now here\u2019s the juicy stuff: let\u2019s see who\u2019s really getting their dollar\u2019s worth from their university education by looking at the ratio of a school\u2019s expenditure on each student to out-of-state tuition.", "WOAH! The fact that the mean is less than 1 tells me that the average school is losing money on its students when considering tuition as the only source of income. In fact, ~69% of universities are investing more money in their students than they\u2019re charging, which does not bode well for the future of most universities. The school with the highest ratio is probably some Ivy League school, right?", "WRONG! The best \u201cBang for Your Buck\u201d award goes to\u2026*drum roll*\u2026University of Alabama at Birmingham with an expense ratio of 3.68! However, a more cynical way of looking at it is if UAB\u2019s spending nearly 4x the out-of-state tuition on every student, then it might not be in business much longer\u2026so if you\u2019re in the HS class of 2021, get in while they\u2019re still afloat, but hold tight to your wallet because those student callers will be working overtime to snag your donation dollars!", "For anyone who was wondering, the biggest thief (the college with the lowest expense ratio) is Lindenwood College with a ratio of 0.378. Yikes!", "It\u2019s time to create some data visualizations!", "Let\u2019s investigate how tuition varies with the number of students and by whether a school is public or private. I suspect that tuition is higher for private schools because they don\u2019t receive government funding like public schools. The number of full-time students could push the needle either way, as more students means more staff and more buildings, but it\u2019s possible that a university could benefit from economies of scale for construction projects for such a large number of students.", "Hmmm\u2026very interesting how the school\u2019s undergrad population is almost completely uncorrelated with tuition, which begs the question: where is that money going? Let\u2019s zoom in on out-of-state tuition and take a look at graduation rate as well.", "As expected, out-of-state tuition is higher for private schools, and so is graduation rate \u2014 perhaps because if a student is investing that much money into their education, their parents are thinking, \u201cYou better finish\u2026or else!\u201d", "Now back to that school with a graduation rate of higher than 100%\u2026turns out the culprit is Cazenovia College. Maybe this school pulled a fast one and counted double majors as having graduated twice? In reality, this makes no sense, so I\u2019m going to change this graduation rate to 100%.", "Now on to the moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for: K-means clustering!", "First we\u2019ll import KMeans from Scikit-learn, the most popular package for machine learning in Python. The way K-means works is the following:", "Here\u2019s a great image to help illustrate:", "Coding a K-means model in Python is very simple, as shown below, and the clusters that are generated by the model can be referenced with km.labels_ (don\u2019t forget the underscore at the end!).", "There is no perfect way to evaluate clustering if you don\u2019t have the labels. However, in this case, the colleges data set told us whether each school was public or private, so we can cross-validate our K-means model with these labels to compare the performance of supervised and unsupervised models in general.", "Two quick ways to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model is to look at a confusion matrix and a classification report.", "If you\u2019re used to supervised learning algorithms, you may look at these results and think, \u201c22% accuracy?! This model is garbage! What are unsupervised models good for anyway?\u201d But remember the definition of unsupervised: the model is aiming to make sense out of the mess of 18 features that we\u2019ve given it, with no labels. This is not an easy task, so let\u2019s give credit to K-means where credit is due.", "Let\u2019s actually compare the results we just got to that of a supervised learning model to evaluate their performance (or at the very least, set our expectations to the proper low level for unsupervised learning \ud83d\ude09). Let\u2019s just go for a classic logistic regression.", "Behold the power of labeling, folks. Using a simple logistic regression, a supervised learning model, the accuracy shot up from 22% to 91%, which probably could be improved upon with another model choice.", "Hopefully you can begin to see how K Means is useful for making sense out of messy data! Feel free to explore other areas using Exploratory Data Analysis and see what you find!", "Your home for data science.
