That platform is YouTube, which houses thousands, if not more, videos on data science and machine learning best practices. There are various useful YouTube videos, for example, ranging from the data science interview processes to say, specific L1 vs L2 regularization techniques. Online learning seems to become more and more prevalent each year, so rising creators are reaching more audiences, and the material ultimately improves. I will be talking about three videos and channels that pertain to data science down below. Keep in mind these are not the only videos on YouTube for data science, but when searching, rank above most, and have specifically helped me out in my data science learning process.", "I will be including the video itself embedded in this article so that you can either get a sneak peek as you read along, or watch the entire video on your own time.", "Not only is Jonathan Ma of Joma Tech [2] entertaining, but he is also honest and intelligent with his data science and machine learning material. The most popular data science interview video that Joma has on his YouTube right now is titled:", "\u201c3 Types of Data Science Interview Questions\u201d [3].", "This video indeed motivated me to improve myself as a data scientist and apply to more and more companies. I will not go into the specifics here, because that is for his video. However, he mainly discusses the specific programming language that you may be tested on, data science theory, and a practical assessment that you can expect from most data science interviews. He outlines those three main interview types of questions with awesome examples as well.", "After interviewing with several companies, I can attest and agree with his material. It is always great practicing these types of questions rather than memorizing them. If you can generally answer them with work to back up your answer, and ask questions to the interviewer along the way, it will show how much you are interested in the company and the question itself. More importantly, how you solve a problem that you do not know the answer to right away is the most impressive you be in an interview, especially in data science. The goal is to problem solve and engage with the interviewer, just like you would at the job once you land it.", "There is a YouTube channel named freeCodeCamp.org [4] that has over 2 million subscribers including an abundance of videos on not only data science, but other coding languages and concepts as well. If you are new to data science or want to freshen up on your skills, this video is all-encompassing of everything data science. The title of the video is:", "\u201cLearn Data Science Tutorial \u2014 Full Course for Beginners\u201d [5].", "The video is over five hours long with no ads and is completely free of course. It is broken up into several main sections with subsections, here are the main parts:", "I personally like how there is focus on not just data science and coding, but also mathematics and statistics, which can sometimes be forgotten, especially when you resort to black-box machine learning, and that can allow you to lose a sense of what is actually happening with the model you are building.", "The next YouTube channel, edureka! [6], includes an advanced tutorial (in regards to it being an advanced topic), but an introduction to that topic. The topic is over natural language processing, or otherwise known as NLP. Even though it seems as if this facet of data science is fairly new, it is not, think of the Google search function or autocorrect, both using word prediction and correction, stemming from NLP.", "The title of the next YouTube video is [7]:", "\u201cNatural Language Processing (NLP) & Text Mining Tutorial Using NLTK | NLP Training | Edureka\u201d", "The main topics of the video cover the following:", "A unique approach this video includes is referring to the human language and how that applies to NLP, as well as specific applications and demos of NLP that can be helpful in real-world settings and not just in academia.", "There are countless academic sources on YouTube, and data science sources are no exception. We have covered videos that go over the best of data science interviews, general data science for beginners, and advanced/specific tutorials over NLP. Of course, there are more than three videos, and some may be better than those that I described above. However, I do think they are exceptionally useful materials on everything data science. They include great summary material along with unique and specific approaches to their respective data science topics.", "Feel free to comment down below which YouTube videos for data science are your favorite.
