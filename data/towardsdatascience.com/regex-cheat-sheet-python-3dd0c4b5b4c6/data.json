I should admit that it is similar to \u201cfinding a needle in a haystack\u201d, unless you know regex!", "Say that you want to extract the phone number of your company customers from a database log.txt that looks like this:", "It will be a lot of work to iterate through all of the sentences and locate the numbers between the brackets. This is true indeed, until the arrival of our savior regular expressions (regex)!", "Regular Expression is an advanced string searching method that allows users to search for something in a text. This is done by creating a pattern that matches the information that we want to retrieve. Regular Expression has such power that it has been incorporated in many programming languages like Python, Pearl, JavaScript, PHP, and Java.", "So, let\u2019s come back to our problem!", "We can get the users\u2019 phone numbers by first creating a pattern. Observe that the phone numbers are located between the brackets \u201c( )\u201d. It\u2019s a useful information and we can use it to our advantage. To access the goodness of Regular Expressions in Python, we will need to import the re library.", "I will go through this code one by one:", "There are many useful functions and characters in the re library, yet learning everything might be overwhelming. Therefore, I have selected the most useful functions and characters that will help you to start implementing RegEx in your Python script.", "Let\u2019s start diving in the re library!", "Are you wondering why should we type an \u201cr\u201d before the string? \u201cr\u201d here stands for the raw string. Python RegEx use a backslash(\\)to indicate a special sequence or as an escape character. This collides with Python\u2019s usage of the backslash(\\) for the same purpose in string lateral. Thus, the raw string here is used to avoid confusion between the two. Besides that, it also helps us in making our pattern shorter. Without typing \u201cr\u201d, one might need to type \u201c\\\\\\\\\u201d just for indicating a backslash(\\).", "We\u2019ll start off with the simplest syntax in RegEx, the special sequences. Special sequences in RegEx starts with a backslash(\\). So if you meet a backslash in the RegEx pattern, chances are it is the syntax for a special sequence.", "The negations of these sequences are also available by using the capital letter. For example, \\D is the negation of \\d.", "We\u2019ll then go through the meta characters which will assist us in reaching our goal. Each one of these characters has its special meaning.", "Sets can be used to match one of the characters inside the square brackets.", "You can also use the special sequences that we have discussed earlier here. Besides that, there is also the dash character that we\u2019ll get to shortly.", "The caret character(^) stands for except.", "To include characters that have special meaning in the set like backslash (\\) and dash(-), you will need to use add a backslash in the front (\\\\) and (\\-)-the first backslash stands as an escaping character. Escaping character makes characters that have special meaning to be taken literally.", "However, characters that don\u2019t have any special meaning like ?_+*.|()${} can be used directly.", "Lastly, we\u2019ll go through the things that we can do with RegEx by using the functions available!", "In all these functions, the arguments are all the same, which are <pattern> and <string>.", "The capturing group is very useful when we want to extract information from a match, like in our example, log.txt.", "Here, we are using the capturing group just to extract the phone number without including the parentheses character.", "The phone number that we want to extract can be accessed with result.group(1).", "Understanding the capturing group will be easier through examples.", "\u201c\\1\u201d and \u201c\\2\u201d stand for the first and second capturing group respectively.", "RegEx will be a powerful tool to be had in your programming toolbox, especially in Python. You might have realized by now that the potential of RegEx is endless. It is definitely worth the time and hustle to learn RegEx. It will pay off more than you imagine. Remember :", "Hard work will never disappoint you. \u2014 Anonymous", "Don\u2019t worry if these concepts do not sink in the first place, we all have gone through that and you can do it! You will get a grip on it after a few practices. If you want to know more about RegEx, I recommend you to take a look at this Data Camp Course.", "Don\u2019t waste any time.
