We are going to focus on the GPU since it is the fastest way we have to train a deep neural network.", "The key features that make TensorFlow the most popular Deep Learning library are:", "Although tensors were invented by physicists to be able to describe interactions, in the field of Artificial Intelligence they can be understood simply as containers of numbers.", "Let\u2019s put all this now into practice. We will use code some tensors in python in order to understand better what they are and how they work.", "Let\u2019s imagine that we want to store the average grade of a student. We will use a 0D tensor, which is just a simple number or scalar.", "Let\u2019s try now to store the grade of every subject that this student courses. We can use a 1D tensor to do so:", "But wait\u2026 What if we want to store each grade of every exam the student took on each subject? How could we do this if each subject had 3 exams?", "By using a 2D tensor! Which, as we have seen before, is a matrix.", "We want now to store the grades of the subjects (which are annual) for four quarters, so it will be easier to access them if necessary in a future, don\u2019t you think? How do you think we could organize them?", "What if we add a dimension to our 2D tensor that indicates the quarter?", "We would get a 3D tensor (3D matrix or cube).", "What if we add a dimension to our tensor, so that we can have the grades per term of each subject for each student?", "It will be a 4D tensor (3D matrix vector or cube vector).", "And so we could go on to infinity adding dimensions to our tensors, to be able to store more data.", "To give you an idea of how often tensors are used in the world of Deep Learning, the most common types of tensors are:", "Normally, one of the dimensions will be used to store the samples of each type of data. For example, with images:", "If we want to store 64 RGB images of 224x224 pixels, we will need a 3D matrix vector, or what is the same, a 4D tensor. How many dimensions do we need?", "If you want to go deeper into tensors or more examples, here is a very good resource for it: Tensors illustrated with cats", "We said before that in TensorFlow, first you define the operations to be carried out and then you execute them. To do this, you use a graph.", "A simple example of a sum of a + b.", "And here is a more complex example, for now, you do not have to understand completely, but this is just a snippet of how intricate they can get.", "First of all, we need to define and understand some basic concepts of TensorFlow (from now on TF):", "In the beginning, tf.Graph is transparent to us, because there is one default graph where are added all our defined operations. It is called tf.get_default_graph().", "Let\u2019s start with something very simple, just a simple multiplication in Tensorflow.", "As you can see, it didn\u2019t give us back the result. What it has done so far is create the network.", "To give you an example, it\u2019s like riding in a car. Now we have it assembled, but it still doesn\u2019t do what it was designed to do, move. To do that, we should turn it on. To do so, we will use tf.Session().", "To be able to visualize the graph, we should define a couple of functions.", "And now we will show the previously defined graph:", "As we can see, the graph consist of 2 nodes of constant type and one of operator type (multiplication). However, their names are not quite indicatives.

Its formula is:", "There will be times when we don\u2019t know the dimensions of a variable until the operation that returns its value is executed. For these cases, we can use tf.shape(variable), which returns a Tensor that will calculate at run time the dimensions of our result.", "This is known as \u2018static shape\u2019 and \u2018dynamic shape\u2019, where static is calculated taking into account the dimensions of the Tensors and Operations involved, and the dynamics at execution time.", "What happens if we define x as a \u2018placeholder\u2019? A placeholder is like a reserve, it indicates that there will be a tensor there, but it is not necessary to define it at that moment. For example, by defining:", "We know that x will hold a 1D 5 dimensional tensor, as confirmed by x.get_shape():", "But we don\u2019t know what values will form it until we tell it.", "They are used to accommodate parameters that are learned during training.", "Therefore, the values are derived from training \u2014 They require an initial value to be assigned (can be random)", "Reserve space for data (e.g. for the pixels in an image)", "They do not require a value to be assigned to start (although they can)", "The obtained value, 5, it is the static value of the x dimensions. But, what happens if we apply a tf.unique() to x?", "What happens is that tf.unique() returns the unique values of x, which are not known at first, since x is defined as a placeholder, and a placeholder does not have to be defined until the moment of execution, as we said before. In fact, let\u2019s see what happens if we feed \u201cx\u201d with two different values:", "Look at that! The size of y changes depending on what tf.unique() returns. This is called \u201cdynamic shape\u201d, and it is always defined, it will never return a question by answer. Because of this, TensorFlow supports operations like tf.unique() which can have variable size results.", "So, now you know, every time that you use operations with output variables, you will need to use tf.shape(variable) to calculate the dynamic shape of a tensor.", "Now we can perform the operations after taking into account the size of the output of the operation, which we do not know in the first instance.", "Let\u2019s see now a Gaussian distribution in 2D", "To see the list of the operations included in our tf.Graph", "As always, I hope you enjoyed the post, and that you have learned the basics of Tensors and TensorFlow and how they are used.", "If you liked this post then you can take a look at my other posts on Data Science and Machine Learning here .", "If you want to learn more about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence follow me on Medium, and stay tuned for my next posts!", "Your home for data science.
