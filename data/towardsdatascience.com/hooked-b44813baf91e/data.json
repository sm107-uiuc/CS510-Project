Triggers fail when you have low ability, low motivation (C++ coding).", "The possibility of performing a behavior is contingent upon whether your motivation, ability, and trigger are all fulfilled.", "As social creatures, we need to form social bonds and derive a sense of belonging. At times when we cannot get emotional support in real life, we resort to the virtual social network to seek mood relief. The sudden rush of oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine while being on social media makes us happy.", "Researchers observe a spike in dopamine levels when the brain expects a reward. The nucleus accumbens helps the brain form memories of salient environmental stimuli. The nucleus accumbens was not activated at the moment you receive rewards, but when you anticipate it.", "In an experiment done by Robert Sapolsky\u2074, monkeys were given food treats (reward) when they pressed a bar ten times (work) after seeing the light (signal). Dopamine is released right away when the monkeys saw the signal, even before they had worked for it.", "Anticipation makes you happier than immediate gratification. Contrary to preconceived notions, Sapolsky\u2019s experiment found that unpredictability increases our anticipation. A single finger swipe to pull up unexpected videos on Netflix is somewhat analogous to playing the casino slot machine\u2076.", "Ten years ago, it was not as easy as today to share your opinions online. First, you have to purchase a domain name and host a web server. Then you need to set up a blogging platform with WordPress or Blogger. On a side note, you have to install plugins, fiddle with admin settings, before you can actually write. Traffic is not guaranteed on a self-hosted blog. You might need to do search engine optimization to monetize your blog.", "Twitter has disproportionately lowered the entry barrier to the blogosphere. When Twitter first launched, only 140 characters are permitted per status. Now Twitter has relaxed the word limit to 280 characters. On Twitter, anyone can type a few words, share a quirky photo or viral video and click \u2018post\u2019. Simple. Easy.", "Google reduces the cognitive effort and time required to search for something mundane on the web. Google autocorrects spelling, saves passwords and autocompletes forms. It even suggests predictive results based on your search history. People are more engaged when the surfing speed is faster\u2077.", "To make searching a keyword like \u201cweather\u201d faster and easier, Google indexes terabytes of information from web pages, adding more clickable Os to Goooooooooogle.

Paid triggers are ads that pop up on the news website or social media news feed. They are attention-grabbing, but are still less effective than relationship triggers (seeing friends using TikTok prompts you to join) and even to a lesser degree than owned triggers (subscribing to an email newsletter voluntarily).", "When a user submits an answer to Quora or Stack Overflow, other members cast votes on the response. Responses upvoted as the best answers will help authors win points. When points are accumulated to a certain level, members earn badges that confer special privileges.", "Trolls on League of Legends (LoL), Call of Duty (CoD) and Warcraft were rampant and abusive, yet obscured by anonymity. League of Legends had to curb the trolls from abuse. An honor system was implemented. Players were given the ability to award karma points to amiable, honorable players. In doing so, they become cooperative as well.", "IKEA sells pre-assembled furniture to customers. Customers who assemble their own bookshelves valued their creation five times higher than shelves installed by a repairman. The more we invest time and effort into making a product or service, the more we cherish it. We love the fruits of labor, be it ours or others.", "Your desk lamp is broken. You need a desk lamp urgently. After scouring on the Amazon website, you have four choices of desk lamps that look almost indistinguishable from one another. Which one will you buy?", "You would be tempted to choose lamp D out of the scarcity effect. You are also influenced by the anchoring effect since the price comparison information anchored your shopping decision. There might be a cheaper desk lamp elsewhere on Craigslist, eBay or at your local electronic store. However, by choosing D, you would feel as if you have won a bargain.", "People get motivated to work harder when they believe they are close to completion as a result of the endowed progress effect.", "EdX offers step-by-step instructions on learning a new programming language. You can save your progress, leave and come back whenever you like.

All resources are free of charge, except for the final examination and certificate of participation. Free open-source materials are endowed to you so that you feel less overwhelmed to start learning.", "Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube store incredulous amounts of your messages, photos, videos and connections in their repository. The mere thought of transferring a lofty volume of data across platforms is appalling enough to repel most people. The more photos and videos you share on your existing social network, the stronger your incentive to not quit.", "Sunk cost fallacy is irrational. The more emotionally invested you are in an endeavor, the more effort and time you will continue to invest in it even if it is no longer profitable or meaningful.", "If you create content on social media, you might get a higher chance to reach more people and garner social validation in the form of likes, comments, shares, and a loyal following. If you are lucky, your videos might go viral and garner millions of views. But those are big IFs.", "If you keep pursuing a losing plan on the slightest chance that you could turn the table, you risk suffering far greater losses (time, effort, money, well-being) in the long term. Social network apps could engage, engross and drag you further into the infinity pool, demanding more of your time and attention in the future.", "Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger\u00b9\u00b9suggested that as consumers grow more accustomed to using a product habitually, they tend to pay less attention to the price. If the price of a product increases by a fraction, consumers would barely notice it.", "Video games, software or applications often give free trial or limited access to stimulate buying behavior. Audible and Spotify offer newcomers a free 30-day trial, which can be canceled at any time with no cost. When the trial period is over, free trial users who have input their credit card information are automatically converted into paid subscribers. Due to reciprocity bias, we feel obligated to return Audible\u2019s favor by paying the subscription fee.", "If you are presented with these two seemingly alike ads, which one sounds more convincing?", "\u201cIf you buy this Masterclass online course before next Monday, you will save 20% of the original price.\u201d", "\u201cIf you buy this Masterclass online course before next Monday, you will get a 20% discount.\u201d", "Framing effect influences your perception of gain and loss. We seek to maintain the status quo by preventing loss. We tend to assign greater priority to loss aversion than potential gain in the future. The endowment effect makes us overvalue what we already own.", "Christopher Carpenter\u00b9\u00b2 found a psychological hack to influence how much money people gave to a stranger asking for bus fare.

People were happy to oblige and gave twice as much money. What\u2019s more, it works magically in emails as well as fundraising platforms like Patreon, Indiegogo and GoFundMe.", "User psychology can be employed and leveraged to influence human behavior. Nevertheless, it is probably best not to misuse knowledge to create apps out of nefarious intentions.
