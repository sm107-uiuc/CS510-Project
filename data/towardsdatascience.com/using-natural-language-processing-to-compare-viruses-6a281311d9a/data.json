The images provided are screenshots of my personal computer. I want to thank Nikhil Malhotra and Akshit Kothari for this opportunity to work on this research project.", "This article aims to provide a simple possible comparison between two viruses with their protein structures and provides a probable foundation to speed up the analysis of viruses.", "Data is the most important entity in AI!", "But the data of viruses would mostly be an array of chemical compounds which will go right above my, the computer guy, head ;). So I spent some of my internet data to build a basic foundation of virology.", "So yeah\u2026 these were some of the main questions I had. I had to start somewhere, so I started with Vector Space Mapping.", "Briefly speaking, vector space mapping in Natural Language Processing is the processing of text into \u2018vectors\u2019 (yeah\u2026 literally). The simpler term is Word Embedding. In word embedding, words are converted in numbers by assigning tokens to them. In my case, I had atoms like C, O, N (Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen), so I tokenized each atom.", "Coming to the accomplishing the vectorizing part\u2026", "I needed the protein structure of a virus in a text format or any readable format. Protein Data Bank (PDB) solves this problem by creating a huge database of various protein structures of different viruses in \u2018.pdb\u2019 format.", "This is how a .pdb file looks like\u2026", "What I was interested in were the float point numbers in the three columns. Those numbers represent the \u2018x\u2019, \u2018y\u2019, \u2018z\u2019 coordinates of the corresponding atom that is a part of the first peptide chain \u20181\u2019, and so on.", "To get those coordinates (mentioned above), I needed some package or any reader which can read every column. I came across with Biopython, a python module to deal with PDB files.", "I started with getting the coordinates of each atom of a protein structure from their PDB files and plotted it by appending the data into a DataFrame. I got something like this\u2026", "Now the most important part \u2014 Vector Space Mapping\u2026", "PDB files contain sequences of residues containing atoms differently positioned in a 3D space. I combined each atom in a single residue and then converted it into a NumPy array.", "The store_residue() is a function defined to get the coordinates of the atoms in a vector form by \u2014", "It seemed I was good to go, but I pondered upon a thought that what if some protein structures are smaller or larger than the other, so one more step was needed to solve this problem\u2026 Padding!", "So I decided to add zero paddings and match the shapes of the vectors and used np.ravel() to get a contiguous flattened 1D NumPy array.", "To compare, I decided to use cosine similarity\u2026", "As a guy with a computational background, I did not have any background in Virology and the methods used by the virologists to compare two viruses. So to build a foundation, I went with Cosine Similarity. I know this is not the most optimal method, but it took me to a point where I can present some conclusions not accurate though\u2026 but based on some calculations.", "Below are the stats of some protein structures of different viruses I compared with protein structures of Coronavirus using Matplotlib\u2026", "By observing the stats above, I was astonished by the result of comparison between SARS and COVID-19 to be 57.95%, as the similarity was expected to be quite high, as they are from the same family. But Ebola and Rotavirus which also causes some respiratory diseases like breathlessness, cough, chest pain like COVID-19 had 91.03% and 84.71% similar chains respectively. Hence, comparing only the protein chains could be the starting point to speed up the development of vaccines.", "Disclaimer: The results need to be validated by the labs and the practitioners.", "Below is a link for a different approach towards the problem \u2014", "\u201cThe beginning is the most important part of the work!\u201c", "Thank you for going through the article, I would be most happy to respond to your feedbacks", "Your home for data science.
