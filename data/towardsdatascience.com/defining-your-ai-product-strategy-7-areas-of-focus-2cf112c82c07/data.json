The underlying technology keeps evolving, requiring organizations to constantly be on their toes \u2026 and the rulebook on what makes for successful and profitable products is still being written, making for uncertain outcomes.", "Over 5+ years of working with machine learning enabled products, we at Semantics3 have had to deal with many challenges stemming from the nascency of the industry. In this article, I\u2019ve drawn from these experiences to distill a set of considerations for proactively anticipating and dealing with these vagaries. Being deliberate about these considerations has helped us align our products for long-term success.", "The ideas below cover general trends; there will, of course, always be exceptions to norms.", "You\u2019re selling a black box ML model, where customers determine how best to utilize the intelligence on offer (e.g. transcription services like Amazon Transcribe or Google Speech-To-Text).", "If your product falls into this category, carefully think through the quirks of all the inputs that customers may send your way. Your model is likely to have been trained with a specific context, represented in your training dataset \u2014 you need to protect against the scenario in which customers test an edge-case, receive poor outputs and conclude that your service isn\u2019t up to the mark.", "At Semantics3, we went up against this challenge when we released our Ecommerce Categorization API \u2026 while our systems were trained to ingest product names (\u201cApple iPhone X \u2014 64GB Black\u201d), customers sent in incompatible generic inputs (\u201ciPhone\u201d, \u201cmobile phone\u201d).", "There are three ways to guard against this.", "Machine learning is at the heart of your offering, and your product can\u2019t function without it, but you\u2019ve packaged it into a broader solution with the intent of solving a specific need (e.g. self-driving cars).", "With such products, you control the degrees of freedom, so you avoid the pitfalls of the black box approach. You can also capture more of the value on the table, and potentially grow your market to service less savvy customers.", "On the flip side though, the reduction in degrees of freedom means that the onus is on you to understand customer needs and engineer the required experience. The needs on your development teams may also be more diverse \u2014 you may need to invest in building supporting hardware, software and data layers as well as customizable components. My experience is that these challenges are more tractable than those of the previous group.", "Machine learning enables a critical feature of your product, but your product has significant utility even without any ML involvement (e.g. Netflix recommendations).", "From a data scientist\u2019s perspective, these products provide the most conducive environments in which to deploy ML models. Since the value-add of machine learning is incremental, and the customer derives utility even without this feature, gradual roll-outs and iterations are possible. The best part \u2014 the product itself often generates the training datasets that you need to build models.", "In these ecosystems, machine learning has the potential to grow the value of the product and build greater defensibility \u2026 but product fundamentals need to be driven by initiatives outside the realm of data science.", "If your product falls into this bucket, you\u2019re reading the wrong article!", "Replacing humans altogether is a very difficult thing to do. Humans have the ability to deal with edge-cases and nuances in a way that is challenging to program into a model. Your model will always be measured against this benchmark and is likely to fall short empirically, if not statistically.", "What\u2019s more, the cost saving angle of reduced human effort is less appealing than you\u2019d think. Customers won\u2019t initiate labour redundancies to realize savings unless they are really compelled to, and are convinced that yours is a solution for the ages, since such drastic measures are tough to roll back. And even if you make it past this hurdle, the ceiling of the revenue that you command will always be framed in terms of costs saved rather than value delivered.", "This strategy usually works best if it allows organizations with limited budgets from executing at scale a task that could otherwise be done only on a subset.", "Enabling human activity is usually a better strategy. With this approach, you can capitalize on the Pareto Principle and tune your model to tackle the most common types of decisions. With the right product workflow, you can set things up such that the human-in-the-loop can step in with overrides when an edge case is encountered. The drawback, once again, is that your value-add will be framed in cost saving terms, and your product will be measured in terms of human labour.", "These problems are more greenfield, and therefore less contentious and more conducive to value capture.", "There are a number of reasons why customers may find value in your product, some more compelling than others.", "Selling to an old industry with slow adoption of tech can help reap early rewards, but this strategy doesn\u2019t provide strong defensibility. If the contract size grows too large, the product begins to get too critical to the customer\u2019s needs or new competitors emerge on the market, then your foothold will begin to get weak. This is also not a mantra for rapid growth, so don\u2019t be fooled by early adoption.", "If you have access to unique datasets, the models that you train may be more potent than those that your competitors bring to the table. You should, however, be cognizant of how unique your dataset really is:", "Sometimes, it may be that your data science team is very capable, eking out far better results on a commonly available dataset than anybody else can. This, however, is almost never a source of long-term defensibility. Due to the open-source DNA of the industry, new innovations proliferate quite rapidly. What\u2019s more, due to the speed of innovation, it doesn\u2019t take long for seemingly path breaking techniques to be altogether subsumed by newer waves.", "Typically, none of these three option alone is sufficient to ensure growth and defensibility. In the long run, what makes the difference is how you bring them all together to craft your process and product. Process refers to how models and datasets are weaved together with humans-in-the-loop, taxonomies, heuristics and analytics to solve the problem at hand. Product refers to how these processes are made accessible to the customer in a way that solves his or her need.", "\u201cWhenever you have ambiguity and errors, you need to think about how you put the human in the loop and escalate to the human to make choices. That to me is the art form of an AI product. If you have ambiguity and error rates, you have to be able to handle exception. But first you have to detect that exception, and luckily enough in AI you have confidence and probability and distribution, so you have to use all of those to get the human in the loop.\u201d \u2014 Satya Nadella", "The irony of AI is that it requires humans to make it usable, whether it be for handling edge cases, building training datasets, generating heuristics or quantifying sample accuracy. Of these human activities, some are of higher leverage and cheaper to access than others. How you design the role of humans into your product workflow will shape both your costs and your user experience. Some perspectives to think about:", "In academia, the quality of an ML system is measured by benchmarking it against a standardized dataset like ImageNet \u2014 the higher the accuracy numbers the better the model.", "In industry though, these standardized benchmarks don\u2019t exist. The datasets that you train on are self-defined, and may not be representative of the problem at hand \u2014 in fact, the hardest challenge is often to build a dataset that accurately models the problem. What\u2019s more, no two customers view the problem space through the same lens, so the idea of a single precision/recall benchmark is symbolic, maybe indicative at best. Tack on phenomena like data drift and concept drift, and you\u2019ll find yourself afloat at sea without an anchor.", "The challenge falls to you to not only find a way to measure quality in each customer\u2019s context, but also to find a way to communicate this number to the customer to manage his or her perception of your product. We use a 5-step approach to handle this issue:", "Educate your customers on the difference between statistical and empirical thinking. No matter what measure you put in place, edge cases and fault lines will always exist. While statistically, perfection is almost never the ask, the trouble is that humans tend to think empirically. It\u2019s not uncommon to have a customer react negatively to individual examples (leading data scientists to vent their statistical ire).", "Statistical education is easier said than done though, even when you have a direct communication line with the customer. My preference is to start from the very first marketing interaction with the customer, and ensure that this thinking pervades through to your sales organization\u2019s pitches. Customers are usually receptive to reasonable arguments, even if competitors promise them the moon and the stars. Depending on the nature of your business, and how hands on you are with your customer, you may have to find innovative ways to do this.", "Find or build a data source that quantitatively captures how your customer is using the product. Usually, this involves tracking and logging customer actions, whether it be inputs into your model, or feedback loops based on reactions. This dataset serves as the representation of the customer\u2019s problem space.", "If the size of the representative dataset is too large to analyze or annotate, decide on a sampling methodology to zoom in to a smaller subset.", "Identify the metrics that best capture customer priorities. If the dataset is to be annotated, enshrine a simple and consistent set of rules to define how this annotation is to be conducted. Also, decide the frequency at which these assessments will be carried out.", "Identify what the minimum thresholds for each of these metrics should be, and what remedial actions are to be taken if these thresholds aren\u2019t reached.", "Here\u2019s the critical part \u2014 to the extent that you can, keep the customer informed about the methodology that you\u2019ve chosen to adopt, and ideally bake their feedback into the process. Then, rigorously volunteer these metrics to the customer on a regular basis to pre-empt any dissatisfaction.", "If you\u2019re in the business of selling enterprise contracts and have significant per customer gross margins, use these metrics as SLAs guaranteed in your contract. While this creates more of a challenge for your team, it ensures that any discussion around quality is streamlined through a common statistical lens.", "Having discussed all of this though \u2026 statistical education is easier said than done. Observer bias can be very hard to overcome, due to a wide variety of reasons. We\u2019ve had many an encounter in which day-to-day users of our product were kosher with our approach, but were led scrambling when a senior executive (and sporadic user of the product) encountered an edge case and rang all alarm bells. To deal with such scenarios, consider building in override mechanisms to symptomatically deal with the issue. The puritans on your data science team may not be happy, but this is a trade-off that you might want to make to ensure that the perception of your product\u2019s efficacy is not left to the vagaries of chance.", "Also, customer specific tuning and measurement is not cheap to do. You\u2019ll have to think through the tradeoffs between quality and costs, and configure your pricing model to pass these \u201csupport\u201d costs on to your customer.", "ML product teams spend a massive amount of time on two kinds of projects that impair user experience and increase operational costs.", "The universe of problems that can be tackled with machine learning is large. This doesn\u2019t, however, mean that all problems that you encounter should be solved with machine learning. While building out your product, you might encounter many a challenge to which the first reaction of the data science team is to use ML. In such moments, it\u2019s worth asking if there are any less elegant, possibly less efficient, but more straightforward solutions on offer.", "Machine learning is often viewed as magic dust that must be sprinkled wherever possible, even by those who understand it. It can be quite easy and exhilarating to train the first set of models to solve a new problem, and even deliver promising results. But as discussed above, deployment to production requires a lot more than just a model with good results. Therefore, in practice, it may not be a bad idea to use as little magic as possible, and resort to less exciting but sure-fire alternatives like heuristics \u2026 or to dropping product features altogether where possible.", "Tensorflow and PyTorch, two of the leading deep learning frameworks, are scarcely 5 years old. Infrastructure tools like Sagemaker and Kubeflow are hardly 2 years old. The ecosystem of open-source tools is only just emerging, and new game changing libraries continue to arrive every few months.", "When you start using these tools, quite often, you\u2019ll find that certain components necessary for your particular development workflow or product feature are missing. For a team of enterprising engineers, this can be a calling to build out new tools to plug the gaps. At Semantics3, we\u2019ve done this a fair few times over the years. We\u2019ve built a parallel processing cum caching layer for dealing with training datasets that require a large amount of pre-processing \u2026 and more recently, we created our own networked database database using Facebook\u2019s FAISS library.", "Such plunges should be carefully considered though, and put through a build vs buy vs wait calculus. If you find that there\u2019s a gaping need in the open-source or cloud ecosystem that needs to be filled, chances are that you\u2019re not the only one, and that someone else is working on it \u2014 it pays to ask around for early access. If you have no alternatives or find that your need is urgent, remember that these tools will require regular maintenance, especially if enmeshed in your stack.", "Once you understand what your product is, you can work backwards to determine what kind of team you need to assemble:", "I\u2019ve seen some products built with armies of ML engineers pre-launch, and others with mini pizza teams of guerrilla operators. One is not the same as the other, and each group will react to challenges differently. Having the right DNA onboard can make a huge difference.", "In sum, the more planned that business owners are about value propositions, defensibility and costs, the greater the predictability of growth. The more thoughtful that product managers are with their approach, the greater the harmony between ML models, humans in the loop and customer workflows. The more deliberate that data science managers are with tool selection and team constitution, the greater the synergy between code and vision. And the more systematic that account owners are with measuring quality and managing perceptions, the lower your churn rates will be.", "The \u201cAI industry\u201d is not a monolith \u2014 there are many ways to build machine learning enabled products. While it\u2019s still early days and the playbook on this continues to be written, if you are setting out to build a product in this space, it helps to be systematic about the various decisions that are likely to influence your success.", "Your home for data science.
