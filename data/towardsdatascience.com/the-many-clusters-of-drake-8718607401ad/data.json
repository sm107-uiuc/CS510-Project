The Canadian rapper-singer dominates both the pop charts and internet meme culture. In the decade since his critically acclaimed mixtape, So Far Gone, Drake has released 7 solo projects and 1 joint mixtape on his way to becoming the most streamed artist of all time.", "In an industry full of one-hit wonders and changing fads, what has allowed this former teen-drama actor to stay atop the game? The answer is versatility. Drake\u2019s biggest strength is that he can seamlessly transition from hip-hop bravado to moody ballads that strike the perfect balance between sensitivity and relatability. From UK grime to dancehall to reggaeton, he\u2019s shown that there\u2019s no sound he can\u2019t adapt to. While many will argue over the authenticity of his approach, its success is undisputed.", "To further analyze his versatility and musical evolution I set out to use machine learning to identify changing patterns within his music and create clusters (groupings) based on metrics of each song.", "The primary dataset was obtained via Spotify\u2019s Web API containing musical attributes from Echo Nest that are defined below:", "(For further information and examples, please refer to this article)", "Additional lyrical data was web-scraped using a python package created by johnwmillr leveraging the web API of popular lyrics website, Genius.", "The final dataset includes 162 Drake songs found on Spotify. These do not include any songs where he was featured on another artist\u2019s song.", "Based on the correlation heatmap above, we see a correlation where songs are growing in popularity and danceability over time. There is also a negative correlation where songs are becoming shorter in length (minutes) over time. This suggests that Drake\u2019s music over time has grown shorter and more rhythmic, and overall more radio friendly.", "Next, I will deep-dive into these attributes and examine how these data points reflect Drake\u2019s stylistic changes in the latter half of his career.", "The plots above show Drake\u2019s music becoming shorter and more danceable over time, which points to a general shift towards pop. This is also due to the rise of streaming applications like Spotify, which incentivize shorter songs since revenue is generated per stream.", "2015 is also when both of these metrics shift significantly. This a pivotal year in Drake\u2019s career; he released two mixtapes, a viral diss record (Back to Back), and his most important single to date, Hotline Bling.", "Despite its lack of marketing \u2014 released on SoundCloud as a b-side filler to his original Meek Mill diss track, Charged Up (the prequel to Back to Back) \u2014 Hotline Bling peaked at 2nd place on the Billboards Hot 100 (his highest mark since his 2009 debut single, Best I Ever Had). The song would epitomize Drake\u2019s transformation into the internet superstar he is today through genre-bending sounds and a music video filled with unabashed corniness and countless dank memes.", "As his songs and overall brand became more mainstream, I wanted to explore how this affected his lyricism as a rapper. To measure this, I used unique word count as the metric to gauge creativity and effort in song writing (influenced by this article on rappers\u2019 vocabulary, and this Machine Learning NLP article on Drake).", "The result here is a bit unclear, but I would argue there is a slight negative trend from 2013 onwards. The increase we see in 2017 is likely due to More Life being a compilation mixtape that featured many different artists. Overall though, I would say his lyricism has been largely unaffected. Rather than writing songs with fewer unique words, he found a sweet spot of between 50 to 55 unique words as evidenced by his 2018 double-album, Scorpion, which had the most songs of any project (25) but smallest variance in word count.", "Clustering is a form of unsupervised machine learning that \u201cidentifies commonalities in the data and reacts based on the presence or absence of such commonalities\u201d. In other words, it groups data points together through observed patterns. Since our dataset contains primarily numerical attributes, machine learning can automatically create clusters of songs", "One common way to determine the optimal number of clusters is to use the elbow method, which looks for an \u201celbow\u201d in the plot where adding an additional cluster (x-axis) results in minimal decrease in distortion (y-axis).", "The elbow plot for our data actually shows the ideal number of clusters being 3. However given Drake\u2019s famed versatility and the scope of this analysis, it would be very boring to only have 3 groups of Drake songs. Instead, I went with the next ideal number, which was 5.", "I used a standard k-means clustering model on the following numerical data attributes: minutes, popularity, danceability, acousticness, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo and unique word count. I dropped year from the model because it has no inherent significance in distinguishing the musical element of a song. The aggregated results for each cluster are below:", "Now let\u2019s dive into each cluster!", "Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go", "Not the flashiest or most popular aspect of Drake\u2019s arsenal, but this collection of songs show his comeup as an artist with introspective topics about chasing his dreams, fleeting happiness and dealing with adversity.", "She say, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d I tell her \u201cOnly partly\u201dI only love my bed and my momma, I\u2019m sorry", "Drake\u2019s biggest cluster both in terms sheer number of songs, but also in terms of versatility and number of hit records. Stylistically there is no true common theme other than they\u2019re all very catchy, easy to listen to and popular.", "Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments", "Stylistically very similar to cluster 0, but these hip-hop songs display more bravado than introspection as Drake works to cement his legacy as the biggest and most successful rapper of his generation, and possibly all-time.", "Got a sneaker deal and I ain\u2019t break a sweat", "This is the most genre-specific cluster captures the popular sub-genre of trap music. In particular, this cluster shows Drizzy\u2019s ability to adapt and change with musical trends by adopting this Atlanta influenced sound of heavy 808-drums, hi-hats and triplet flows.", "I\u2019m just saying you can do better, tell me have you heard that lately?", "This cluster of songs best exemplify his signature style of moody R&B mixed with emotional rapping on top of muddy low-end bass drums. A popular style that\u2019s influenced newer artists like Bryson Tiller, Amir Obe, 6lack and more.", "This analysis not only provided an in-depth look into Drake\u2019s musical evolution, but also showed the power of machine learning. A simple clustering model could accurately cluster a broad set of songs, and serve as the foundation to create personalized playlists and recommendations. Streaming services like Spotify are surely creating much, much more sophisticated models and playlists based on these types of data and more.", "As someone deeply passionate about hip-hop, I want to continue using data from Spotify\u2019s Web API to explore other rappers like Kendrick Lamar and J.Cole, and compare their music against Drake or other pop artists to better understand how they differ both musically through data.", "Your home for data science.
