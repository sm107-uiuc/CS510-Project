Last time we introduced 6 new features in Python 3.8 that even a beginner should take note of. Check out the article if you have not read it.", "Python 3.9 is now in the alpha phase of development where many new features have already been proposed and accepted! It will enter the beta phase in May 2020, where no new features can be proposed beyond this point.", "The first stable release should be available in October 2020. You can find the release schedule here.", "There is a new feature that involves dictionaries.", "Dictionary is a pretty unique data structure in Python. A dictionary contains multiple elements, each element is a key-value pair. For instance, let\u2019s initialise a dictionary d1 with two elements. The key 'name' has a value of 'Tom', whereas the key 'age' has a value of 20.", "We now have a dictionary that stores the information of a 20-year-old Tom.", "Let\u2019s say for some reasons you gathered more information about Tom, say his GPA and his marital status. You now have another dictionary called d2.", "You want to merge these two dictionaries together, since they both contain different information about the same person, Tom.", "The question is\u2014 how can you merge two dictionaries in Python?", "You can insert a new element in an existing dictionary using the assignment operator = with the syntax dict_name[key]= value.", "Therefore, without using any dictionary-specific methods, the first method that comes in mind is to write a for-loop that iterates over each key-value pair using iterable .items(), then insert the pair in the new dictionary dnew.", "Nonetheless, merging dictionaries is supposed to be something really simple and straightforward, and should be done in one line of code.", "We can do better. Much better.", "There is actually a built-in method for \u2018updating\u2019 a dictionary d1 with another dictionary d2.", "One disadvantage is that .update() modifies the dictionary in-place. You would need to create a new dictionary dnew by copying d1 first. This \u2018built-in\u2019 method defeats the purpose of having a handy built-in approach for merging dictionaries.", "Can we do merging in one line of code? Yes!", "Python supports dictionary unpacking ** from version 3.5+. You can create a new \u2018merged\u2019 dictionary by unpacking elements of two dictionaries.", "This unpacking method becomes the de facto approach in merging dictionaries from Python 3.5+. However, this syntax may look ugly to some of you, and certainly does not look intuitive to most of us. Would you be able to guess what that means the first few times you see it?", "There is also another neat way to achieve dictionary merging in one line. It does not look intuitive either.", "Python 3.9 introduces a new and clean(!) way to merge dictionaries using a union operator |. Pretty neat.", "This union operator actually is not new in Python. It can be used for \u2018merging\u2019 two sets. A set is an unordered and unindexed collection, also written with a curly bracket.", "For two lists or two values a and b, a += b is a short form of a = a+b.", "This kind of augmented assignment behaviour works on dictionary union operator as well. That means d1 |= d2 is equivalent to d1 = d1 | d2.", "A set is unordered. A dictionary is insertion ordered (from Python 3.6). In other words, dictionaries remember the order of items inserted.", "This means dictionary union is not commutative. It means that d1 | d2 and d2 | d1 would result in merged dictionaries with different item orders.", "Thank you for reading! There are other new features coming in Python 3.9 as well, including updates on variable annotations. Don\u2019t know what that is? Check out the following articles about static typing and annotations.", "If you want to receive updates on my new articles, you can subscribe to my newsletter using the slider below:", "If you are interested in Python, the following articles might be useful:", "Your home for data science.
