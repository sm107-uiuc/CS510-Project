I\u2019m going to put beginning in 1637 when Descartes published \u201cDiscourse of the Method\u201d. The main result of that book is the distinction between knowledge and truth, and that the discourse of the scientist is related to knowledge (that we later discover to be always incomplete) not to look for the truth.", "That\u2019s a very important point, because it gives us a focus, science wants to know stuff that are not \u201cundisputed truths\u201d.", "Data has been close to science in almost of its history. Sometimes is theory and then get the data, but for the most of what we are going to discuss here and other upcoming articles it\u2019s going to be in the model data -> theory.", "I want to tell you a little story that will make you understand better why data it\u2019s important, but not the most important part of science.", "The story is about a man called Tycho Brahe. He spend almost all his life measuring the positions of the stars, planets, the Moon and Sun. For what? He wanted to learn how to predict elipses, also he was unhappy with the Ptolemaic system and the Copernican theory wasn\u2019t enough for him either. So he wanted to find the best way to describe the skies and its moving parts.", "Sadly he wasn\u2019t that sure how, but he kept on measuring things until his final days. He died in 1601, and someone named Johannes Kepler, that became his assistant a year before, who was a great mathematician, had access to almost all his data. With that data Kepler improved Copernicus theory of the Universe and developed three laws that described the motion of the planets. Kepler\u2019 works served as basis for the later studies of Isaac Newton about the theory of gravity and the motion of bodies.", "The story is much more long and fun, if you want to know more about it please take a look online. But you could be asking yourself at this point, what does this story has to do with data science?", "The biggest learn we have from that story is that having data, and sometimes a lot of data is worthless unless you have a good question to answer. This is still true nowadays, and the start of the modern love of data began with statistics.", "I\u2019m not going to write a lot about statistics here, but I will point to two specific things that changed the world forever. First is an article called \u201cThe Future of Data Analysis\u201d by John Tukey published in 1962 and the other one is a presentation by professor Jeff Wu titled \u201cStatistics = Data Science\u201d given in 1997.", "These are pretty old references I know, but they are very important. Believe me.", "In the article by Tukey he said this:", "For a long time I have thought I was a statistician, interested in inferences from the particular to the general. But as I have watched mathematical statistics evolve, I have had cause to wonder and to doubt. [\u2026] All in all, I have come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis\u2026", "This is a huge statement to make by a statistician. In this time, the words \u201cdata science\u201d did not exist as today, but the way Tukey described data analysis is very close to what we call now data science. He even called data analysis a science, because it passes these three tests:", "Saying also that this \u201cnew science\u201d is defined by an ubiquitous problem rather than a concrete subject. He then goes and talk about how to learn and get started with data analysis, and how to become a data analyst also how to teach it. It\u2019s an amazing article that we all should read if we want to understand the beginnings of our field.", "In the second piece, 35 years later after Tukey\u2019s publication, Jeff Wu said this:", "Where he proposed that statistics should be renamed \u201cdata science\u201d and statisticians should be named \u201cdata scientists\u201d. In today\u2019s standards we now that statistics is a part of data science, but why? Because we say that we also need programming, business understanding, machine learning and more. Maybe it\u2019s just that statistics evolved and now some statisticians became data scientists. But some of them.", "To understand the portion of statistics and statisticians that became data science and data scientists we need to read the article \u201cStatistical Modeling: The Two Cultures\u201d by Leo Breiman published in 2001.", "Here he mentions that there\u2019s some people in the statistical culture that are driven by data modeling and some by algorithmic modeling. Where the first ones assume that we have a stochastic data model that maps input variables x to response variables y. And the second ones consider that the mapping process is both complex and unknown, and their approach is to find a function f(x) that operates on x to predict the responses y.", "He then goes to discuss why the data modeling culture has been bad for statistics for so long leading to irrelevant theories and questionable scientific conclusions keeping statisticians from using more suitable algorithmic models and working on exiting new problems. Also he talks about the wonders of the other part of the spectrum, the algorithmic modeling culture giving examples from his own works and others on how it can solve hard and complex problems.", "Data science is the main focus of most sciences and studies right now, it needs a lot of things like AI, programming, statistics, business understanding, effective presentations skills and much more. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not easy to understand or study. But we can do it, we are doing it.", "Data science has become the standard solving problem framework for the academia and the industry and it\u2019s going to be like that for a while. But we need to remember where we are coming from, who we are and where we are going.", "I\u2019ll be creating more articles in the subject, you can consider this an introduction.", "For more information you can follow me here:", "Your home for data science.
