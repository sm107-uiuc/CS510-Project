In turn, we will analyze the structure of our model and reduce MPC to the maximum matching problem for certain special cases. We will conclude the story with the solution.", "MPC of a graph is a set of vertex-disjoint paths with minimum cardinality such that the union of these paths contains all of the nodes in the graph. In other words, in MPC, we want to cover all nodes with the minimum number of paths that do not share any vertex. Such partitioning is not necessarily unique. MPC has a wide application range from software testing to scheduling [1].", "Let us define a hypothetical scenario as follows. Assume that you are hired by a company that manages the subway lines in a city. The subway has 4 stations in total and each station is reachable from one another. The city council has determined the transports that should be carried out between stations alongside the departure times. Thus, all you are left with is to determine the number of trains you should purchase to realize all of the transports. Surely, you want to minimize this number to maximize the company\u2019s profit.", "The city council provided you the time table of the transports and how many hours it takes to reach from one station to another. The tables are as below:", "Now let us consider a solution. In the worst case, we can assign a train for each transport and purchase 7 trains. However, we can observe from the tables that, some transports can be sequentially realized by the same train such as T2 and T1. If we maximize the number of such transports, then we can minimize the number of purchases. Therefore, we found the objective function to maximize!", "In the best case, each transport is conducted by the same train and a single train will suffice. Yet, we can see that this is not possible since there are transports with conflicting time tables such as T2 and T3. Hence, we defined the constraints we must satisfy. Now we can formulate the problem as:", "How can we maximize the total number of transports carried out by the same train, while still carrying out all of the transports?", "To model our constraints, let us construct a feasibility graph for transports. In this graph, we model each transport by a node and draw a directed edge from one to another, if and only if these two transports can be carried out sequentially by the same train. For instance, there will be a directed edge from T1 to T5 since a train can depart from S1 at 6:00 and arrive at S2 at 8:00. Then it can arrive at S3 at 13:00 and conduct T3 at 16:00. On the other hand, T2 and T3 are non-adjacent since a train cannot depart from S2 and S3 at the same time. The resulting graph is as follows:", "On this graph, a path corresponds to a sequence of transports that can be carried out sequentially by the same train. Thus, if we find the minimum number of paths required to cover all nodes, we find the minimum number of trains required to carry out all transports.", "Therefore, our objective becomes finding an MPC on the constructed feasibility graph.", "For general graphs, finding an MPC converges to finding a Hamiltonian path which makes MPC, unfortunately, an NP-hard problem. Fortunately, we can solve MPC in polynomial time for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) by reducing to bipartite maximum matching, which can be solved in polynomial time.", "Now let us check if our feasibility graph can contain any cycle. We stated that a path corresponds to a sequence of transports that can be conducted by the same train. For a cycle to occur, we should have at least one pair of transports T\u1d62, T\u2c7c such that T\u2c7c can be conducted after T\u1d62 and T\u1d62 can be conducted after T\u2c7c. However, If T\u2c7c can be conducted after T\u1d62, it means that T\u1d62 starts after T\u2c7c. Thus, T\u2c7c cannot be conducted after T\u1d62, unless we can travel back in time!", "Thus, thanks to time constraints our feasibility graph is a DAG and we can solve our problem in polynomial time.", "To solve the problem, we will construct an auxiliary graph G and find a maximum matching on G. To construct G, we will split every node of our original graph into two. One of these nodes will preserve the outgoing edges of the original node and the other will preserve the incoming edges. For instance, consider a node t in the feasibility graph. t will ve split into two as t\u2081 and t\u2082 and we will draw an edge from t\u2081 to the neighbors of t whereas we will draw edges from the nodes that t is neighbor of to t\u2082. Remark that such a graph is always bipartite. G can be drawn as follows for our feasibility graph.", "Finding a maximum matching means minimizing the number of unmatched nodes. If a node in the right part is unmatched in a maximum matching of G, no transport should be conducted before the corresponding transport in a sequence carried out by a train. This means that we need one train for such a node. Thus, minimizing such nodes is equivalent to minimizing the required number of trains and finding a maximum matching on G solves our problem!", "Below we can see a maximum matching of G where the edges and the nodes in the matching are denoted by thicker lines and the rest of the edges are dashed.", "Note that we are guaranteed that a complete matching does not exist since there is always at least one node in the right part with no incoming edge. This node is the one that corresponds to the earliest transport since the earliest transport cannot be carried out after any other transport. Thus, there is always at least one unmatched node and we need at least one train.", "With the maximum matching in hand, we can construct the paths by tracing the matchings from left to right. These paths correspond to the transports that should be carried out by the same train to minimize the number of trains required. For the above graph, we can trace the paths as {{T1, T4, T5}, {T2, T6}, {T3, T7}}. Thus, we need at least 3 trains to carry out all the transports and solved our problem in polynomial time!", "I thank T\u0131naz Ekim for her lecture on MPC that I heard the problem in the first place.", "Your home for data science.
