Sure, you have Python libraries that for example handle requests and it is called requests, but at the other end of the spectrum, you also have mind-blowing names like keras, which\u2026 well, you will have to read on to find out.", "My intention is to keep adding to this list, so if you find anything missing, please let me know! Even if this collection has no immediate practical implications, I think it\u2019s nice to lean back once in a while, and marvel at the multi-disciplinary creativity of the giants on whose shoulders we are ever so proudly standing.", "It would be a shame not to start with this. The name of the whole programming language, Python, comes from the legendary comedy group Monty Python, which is a fact I was personally not aware of for a surprisingly long time. The core underlying philosophy of Python is to keep things fun and light, so it really is a perfect name choice, there is hardly any better representation of universally loved and timeless comedy than that of Monty Python.", "You can read about various references Python documentations make to the group on their Wikipedia page. One funny one I looked up in the official documentation is the widespread use of \u2018spam\u2019 as a generic variable, like so:", "There are two names in this category, first is pandas. I don\u2019t think everyone knows, the name comes from \u2018panel data\u2019, not the animal. At least the Wikipedia page says so, I could not find a confirmation in the official documentation.", "Second one is Scrapy, a package built for web scraping, but it sounds like we are calling it a cute name. It also might be a play on the numerous packages that end with Py for Python (think NumPy, SciPy, etc), but then it would be with a capital \u2018P\u2019. I could not find anything in the documentation.", "Well, points for sounding cute. OK, admittedly these were not the most fascinating examples ever, but I wanted them on the list, and it only gets better from here. Moving on.", "BeautifulSoup is a reference to a poem in Alice in Wonderland. Now, this is not explicitly confirmed in the documentation, but they do mention Alice in an example, and the picture at the top of the page is inexplicably an illustration from the book. So it would be too much of a coincidence.", "The poem in question starts like this:", "Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,Waiting in a hot tureen!Who for such dainties would not stoop?Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!", "and then this goes on for a while. You can read more on this fansite. I think we can agree that the name is quite an odd choice. One can kinda make sense of it, BeautifulSoup helps you navigate in an HTML / XML text, which I guess originally resembles a random soup of words before we bring order to it.", "This one is not Python exclusive, but I say it counts. Selenium, the automated website testing tool, is a bit of a weird one. I could not find any official confirmation (which seems to be kind of a trend here), the only explanation I could find is from a site called guru99. Allegedly, the package is called Selenium because, at the time of its development, they had one big competitor, Mercury Interactive. And selenium is a treatment against mercury poisoning (and other heavy metal poisonings).", "That last bit I managed to confirm. I think it\u2019s weird how this article is the only source that mentions it, still, it\u2019s a too good story to be dismissed.", "Unlike in the previous cases, the origin of the name surprise, a Python package focusing on recommendation engines, is very clear and official. According to their documentation:", "\u201cThe name SurPRISE (roughly :) ) stands for Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine.\u201d", "Which I think is a fair testament to the notion that you can become anything if you set your mind to it: you can abbreviate yourself as \u2018surprise\u2019 even with no \u2018u\u2019 character anywhere in your name, and only half the \u2018r\u2019 characters you would ideally need. I have to agree with the choice, \u2018sprse\u2019 just doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it.", "Next on our list is seaborn, a plotting library that looked at its mathematical plotting library colleague called Matplotlib, and wondered what would happen if it went in the opposite direction when it comes to naming clarity. To this day, I could not find out where the name is coming from. Needless to say, the official documentation is silent on the matter. So if anyone knows where the name is coming from, please tell me!", "What elevates this randomness even further is that the default alias when importing the package: import seaborn as sns, right? All the official examples used this, so people were naturally curious where it came from and asked about it on the project\u2019s GitHub. There, the developer said:", "\u201cAh, it\u2019s a very inside joke that you might find funny if you get the origin of the package name :)\u201d", "But it\u2019s a difficult joke to get with the origin of the package name nowhere to be found. There is one explanation on Stack Overflow, according to the entry, it\u2019s the abbreviation of a fictional character called Samuel Norman Seaborn.", "Now, if we accept both of these pieces of information, we can conclude that the origin of seaborn is this character\u2019s name, but for the life of me I could not find any connection between the character and anything programming-related. Hence the category: The Random One.", "This is my personal favourite. It\u2019s probably the best documented, but let\u2019s be honest, if anyone could come up with such a clever name, they would also proudly display the thought process. The package in question is keras, a Python library helping primarily in working with neural networks.", "It\u2019s important to have a very high-level understanding of neural networks to get the reference. Think of a simple classifier, you have a lot of variables, and have one target that you want to explain. When you use a neural network, you add in hidden layers between your features and the target variable. These hidden layers are famously difficult to display and interpret, meaning it\u2019s kind of a black-box model. You just have to trust that whatever is happening inside makes sense.", "According to the documentation, the name keras is a reference to a literary image from ancient Greek and Latin literature. Basically, there are two types of dream spirits, those whose prophecies are fulfilled, and those who deceive people with false visions. These spirits arrive through different gates, the good ones come through a gate of horn, while the bad ones use a gate of ivory. It\u2019s an untranslatable wordplay, the Greek words for \u2018horn\u2019 and \u2018fulfil\u2019 are close to each other, and so are \u2018ivory\u2019 and \u2018deceive\u2019. The Greek word for \u2018horn\u2019? Keras!", "I think this is a really well-rounded naming decision. In the allegory, the programming package is the gate through which the good predictions come, the ones you can trust but probably not fully understand. If that\u2019s not philosophical, I don\u2019t know what is!", "Oh, and the name of the research team that worked on the package? Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System. Greek word for dream spirit? Oneiros! Yes, it checks out.", "I hope you found at least some of these interesting. I will keep on the lookout for more fun stuff. As mentioned before, please let me know if you think anything is missing from the list!", "Your home for data science.
