Especially if manual data entry is required. In order to clean the data and to resolve unnecessary duplicates, it is necessary to identify and rectify messy data. However, many duplicates are non-matching; meaning there could be duplicate data that contains, for example, spelling errors. It is challenging to identify these duplicates perfectly using the SQL database language because this relies on exact matching (due to the tenets of Relational Database theory). Therefore, it is necessary to look for other methods of identifying non-matching duplicates, which is where Fuzzy Matching is able to be used.", "Fuzzy matching works off the notion of edit distance, which is essentially the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another. One of the most commonly used edit distance metrics is Levenshtein distance, which is essentially, \u201cthe minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.\u201d. Other metrics include the Hamming distance, the Jaccard distance, the Jaro-Winkler distance, the Longest Common Substring distance, or the Cosine distance. For the purposes of this paper, the Optical String Alignment distance (OSA) is used (which is a variant on the Damerau-Levenshtein distance).", "To illustrate OSA, the following example is given:", "As seen, the number of changes needed to transform one string to another is the number of steps taken. This logic will be used to match records in a given database.", "The first step is to load the necessary packages.", "The next step is to load the data. The JohnSmiths data is \u2018dummy data\u2019, used to illustrate the example of fuzzy matching. The original data can be found on Eight2Late.", "Having loaded the spreadsheet, the JohnSmiths data looks as follows:", "Upon reviewing the dataframe, the details appear as follows:", "When using SQL to check the data, the following script was used. Noting that it joins on the FirstName, LastName, AddressPostcode, and CustomerID fields. The results of the query return all the data. Meaning that it was unable to identify any duplicates. Therefore SQL cannot be used for this purpose.", "To find duplicates via Fuzzy Matching, the following steps are followed:", "The first step is to concatenate the strings together. This is done using the paste() function. The resulting vector appears as follows (each element is placed on a new line for convenience).", "Next, the string lengths must be calculated for each record, using the str_length() function from the stringr package.", "Next, the String Distance Matrix is calculated, using the stringdistmatrix() function from the stringdist package. Note the use of the Optimal String Alignment algorithm, via the use of the hyper-parameter method=\"osa\". This function saves the values in a 1-Dimensional array, but when printed it displays the lower triangle of a distance matrix.", "Next, it is necessary to calculate the maximum length of each pair of records. This can be achieved with the combn() function from the utils package. This function takes the following arguments:", "The resulting vector appears as follows.", "Next, the normalised distance matrix is calculated.", "Next, the Normalised Distances are coerced in to a matrix. Once this is created, it is important to ensure that duplicates are not counted twice. To do this, the top-right triangle, and the diagonal line are all made to be zero\u2019s.", "For point of reference, the details of this similarity matrix are printed as follows.", "Next, the values that are above a given threshold are to be identified. In order to achieve this, a custom function is written.", "Therefore, when applied this function will generate a matrix as displayed below.", "Once the matching records have been identified, they then need to be extracted from the original table. For this, again a custom function is written. It takes the original Data Frame, along with the Similarity Matrix, then loops through the matrix to extract the relevant records from the dataframe.", "Lastly, when this function is applied, the data appears as follows.", "Which has a dataframe that appears as follows:", "As seen, this method has identified these duplicates to a reasonable level of accuracy.", "Therefore, when working to identify duplicates within a database, it can be useful to use \u2018Fuzzy Matching\u2019 to identify the similarity between different sets of records.", "However, considering that the data provided in this example is fictitious, it is useful to perform the same process on real-world data.", "Using business addresses scraped from the web, the same method was applied.", "The data was loaded from an Excel spreadsheet AddressData.xlsx.", "The top 10 records appears as follows:", "With the details of the data displayed as follows:", "Then some pre-processing manipulation is performed on the Addresses to reduce the size of the data.", "Lastly, the data must be pasted together in to a single vector, as displayed below. Now the data is ready for Fuzzy Matching.", "The processing for the address data has been combined in to a single chunk, and processed accordingly. The following key call-outs must be listed:", "Resultingly, the records can now be matched. Note that the number of matching records was 2389 (24% of total).", "Once these matching records have been identified, they can be returned. For simplicity, the top 10 matches for each Similarity score have been returned in the below chunk.", "When selecting threshold=0.99, the algorithm has matched nearly perfectly, with only single character differences between the records.", "When selecting threshold=0.98, the algorithm has also matched nearly perfectly, also with only single character differences between the records.", "When selecting threshold>0.9, the algorithm has also matched nearly perfectly, also with only single character differences between the records. However, when selecting threshold=0.8, the algorithm has made false-matches. For example:", "Therefore, discretion is advised when using a threshold value less than 0.9.", "In conclusion, Fuzzy Matching is able to successfully identify duplicates to a reasonable level of accuracy. When matching together strings with a single-character difference, these are given with a nearly perfect matching score (>0.99). However, when the threshold is set to ~0.8, then the logic begins to match different businesses on the same street in the same suburb, or the same business in different streets in the same suburb, etc. This is a risk for implementation, therefore the threshold must be chosen carefully.", "Moreover, due to the substantially large objects created during processing, appropriate data segmentation is appropriate so as to avoid causing computational issues.", "Also note, data input validation is always better than retrospective data cleaning. This solution should be implemented in instances where address data is given by external parties (such as an EDI connection). If the data is identified to be a confidence-interval of >0.99, then it is reasonable to auto-amend the data; however, if it is ~0.8, then it would be better for the data to be flagged for review by an employee.", "Acknowledgements: This report was compiled with some assistance from others.
