However, the way to utilize data up to its full potential is still very difficult. This step\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Young companies soak up Lean Development, Customer Centricity, and Data Driven Design from the beginning. However, the way to utilize data up to its full potential is still very difficult. This step is even more difficult for traditional enterprises. Equipped with multiples of a startup\u2019s ressources, the use of data seems much more difficult. Due to neccessary changes in the company culture and in the technological repertoire, data initiatives get burried without success (This is still the case even though simple data driven decision making has been shown to increase stock value by 5-6% years ago according to Brynjolfsson 2011).", "The biggest thread is that we are overwhelmed by the amount of data and the options of use available, and that the management or business departments are underwhelmed by the tangible results in the short run (Veeramachaneni 2016).", "Building up a Data Science unit in a heavy growth company, I will share some of my personal insights how such struggles can be overcome and how to profit most from data and data science in your company.", "I started as a data scientist by simply querying the database to answer some of the many business questions. I also developed ordinary Excel-models to simulate business behaviours. Whenever possible, I stood up for the use of data driven approaches and statistical methods to support decision making. In the meantime, together with many amazing people, we have put to production several sophisticated machine-learning models and I am on my way to pull together a team that will work together with product managers, developers and our management to leverage on data even more.", "In the following, I will post several stories that will uncover many of the learnings I have had on this journey. First, I will suggest a potential structure and favorable conditions for doing Data Science (Components). In the next story, I will present some result and acceptance driven project patterns for data science projects (Flow). Lastly, I will present some overall learnings and success factors for data science (Grease). To simplify things and because most findings apply to both kind of team focuses, I will use the term data unit/team instead of data science unit/team.", "This is amazing, let\u2019s get started!", "First, we follow this simple pattern to start with a data-driven organization: We integrate data into our strategic core vision and see it as a competitive advantage. At the corporate level, we decide to challenge intuition with data whenever it makes sense. In this way, we can focus on the context, the case, and the customer at hand, avoiding biases resulting from the mechanical use of past experiences and experiences from other areas. Sounds good!", "Then we set up a new data unit in the company as one more business unit to execute the plan we have set ourselves. What could possibly go wrong?", "Clearly, many problems will arise. First, since the newly created unit resides as a silo and is not closely linked to other business units, the acceptance of any analyses, proposed methods, or outcomes will be very small as it is not a joint venture. Second, because the data unit is not involved in the value creation chain, the data unit will not understand the business well enough to become a proactive partner to business units. Thus, solutions that are possible with the toolsets of data are not initiated. Finally, as the business units see the data unit as just another unit they need to coordinate with (this holds even more todos), they will push potential data solutions to the sidelines requiring only reports or analyses needed in their daily routines.", "That sounds unsatisfactory. Is there a better approach? Based on my personal experience, there are a few components that are essential to a successful data-driven organization from a structural perspective. The components are culture, integration, and empowerment. In the following, I will highlight the key ingredients regarding all three facets to make a data driven initiative have better results.", "Let\u2019s start with culture. For a data-driven business to function, the culture must be clearly somewhat data-driven (see Figure 2). Most people in the company should at least embrace and value data-backed insights, even if they can not use them in their own area of influence. However, it will be much easier, if hunger for data is embedded in the corporate culture. This means that people inherently want to better understand markets, customers and measures based on data. Data should be highly regarded in the company, if not even regarded as a kind of mighty advantage for shaping business, because they reflect the beliefs, attitudes and behaviours of the customers.", "The question comes up, \u201chow can a culture be fashioned this way? A culture is something one draws from lived values and actions taken, and it can not be formed directly\u201d. However, there is a known secret to carving a culture. With leading by example, a change can be made. In our example, this means that influencers and executives within the company are demonstrating a serious focus on data and the potential of data products. In order to overcome a primary intertia, a visible and substantial group needs to put data over intuition, seek for data solutions, and desparately seek for measurable outcomes from all measures.", "The second and perhaps most important component is the integration of the data team or the data unit in the company (again, I am subsuming data science). An effective data unit is not simply added to an existing structure (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). If the data unit is placed in a silo, there is a high risk of imbalance and misalignment with other units and business goals. On the contrary, if the data unit is tightly linked and integrated with the business units and most importantly the top-level decision-making, new insights and disruptions become possible that reveal the true value burried in the company\u2019s data. To put it short: the true recipe for data success is the perception of data elsewhere in the organization, not in the data team itself (Newman 2015).", "Any initiative will only be successful if decision makers and product managers understand the full potential of data models, value the insights generated from wrangling data and data solutions. The biggest danger is that the data team is only seen as a reactive team that provides on demand reports or analyses. A team with such a narrow focus will have very limited effect. In addition, the data team must be able to leverage business knowledge to develop working solutions. In the case that the data team can tackle larger issues with the full repertoire of data science methods on the one hand, and full understanding of a given business context on the other hand, new effective solutions can be found. By working closely with stakeholders to create collaborative solutions and to facilitate the exchange of data and business knowledge, the output will become an outcome that is visible in either internal, market-facing, or customer-facing products. And with such an end-to-end outcome, data can have a real business impact.", "After all, the last ingredient for a successful data initiative is empowerment. This includes building the right skills and defining roles accordingly. Let\u2019s start with the skills. Given the point stated above, the most important skills are that data personnel can (and also does) take responsibility, express and communicate complex matters, and is self-organized. Since people with extensive data skills tend to get somewhat mathematical and complicated on a detailed level, this is obviously not an easy-to-fulfill requirement. And with people who love to go into detail, another important skill becomes clear. It\u2019s the ability to be able to take shortcuts and stop at certain point of data-wrangling that is good enough to spur business. This requires a strong degree of result orientation. If you are lucky enough to find players for your team who have these skills, you are ready to roll. If not, one of the most important tasks will be to work on these skills daily.", "That leads us to the last point. To benefit from extraordinary results, the role of people working with data needs to be defined in such a way that they are able to work autonomously from one end to the other. This means that the responsibility for finding and solving tasks or problems must be fully delegated to the responsible person, including the confidence that he or she will do the right thing. In addition, it must be ensured that all necessary and useful ressources are available (e.g. all necessary data and context information). Only by removing barriers (i.e., knowledge, results and data can be easily accessed), are excellent results archieved.", "By the way, I think that most of these success components apply in a similar way to many other types of teams and tasks!", "That\u2019s it for now. Stay tuned for the second part. In the second story, I will address procedural factors (i.e., project flow) that make data-driven initiatives successful:", "Your home for data science.
