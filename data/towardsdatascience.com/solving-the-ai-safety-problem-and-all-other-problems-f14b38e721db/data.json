I don\u2019t know much about viruses, so that\u2019s out. But I do run a small AI company, so I\u2019ve been thinking about AI. It\u2019s a technology with huge potential upsides and downsides. Is there anything we can do to systematically increase the likelihood and magnitude of the upsides, while doing the opposite for the downsides? I think so, I think it\u2019s fairly simple to do, and I think it\u2019s completely different to the approach we\u2019ve all been taking til now.", "Every human need and want is ultimately bottlenecked at intelligence. We seem to be restricted by resources, but actually there are more than enough atoms on earth of every type to do anything we\u2019re ever likely to want to do for centuries, and after that, there are a near-infinite amount of further atoms in space. What we lack is the knowledge of how best to configure them, and the machinery necessary to do the configuring. Intelligence, properly deployed, fixes both of those problems and, ultimately, all other problems too. It\u2019s the biggest upside conceivable.", "The downsides are also unlimited, and we know what many of them are. The big ones come in two categories that kick in when we get close to or beyond the threshold for \u201cStrong\u201d or \u201cGeneral\u201d intelligence: Runaway AI, and Runaway People.", "In the first category, an AI can misunderstand our intentions, and maximise a variable to a greater degree than we anticipated, turning the universe into paperclips or clouds into meatballs. An AI can develop intentions of its own that are radically inconsistent with ours. An initially friendly AI that can reproduce, can create unfriendly children. In all of these cases, the AI is doing something nobody wanted it to do.", "Even if an AI remains in the control of its creator, there\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s creator\u2019s wishes will coincide with those of humanity as a whole. You can still get a runaway effect, but for sociological rather than technical reasons \u2014 it\u2019s the people who run amok. The first team to reach an intelligence explosion could use their advantage to rule the world like Dr Evil from a lair beneath a volcano. Even if they don\u2019t want to do that, they\u2019ll have a permanently impenetrable advantage, as a market leading position begets more customer data, which begets a bigger market lead. Even with the most benevolent of new overlords, a situation in which a small set of people control the world\u2019s most valuable technology and everyone else is excluded, is sub-optimal.", "Regulation has been proposed, but that won\u2019t work, because any feasible set of regulations would either be impossible to enforce or positively counterproductive. You can\u2019t stop a Dr Evil outlaw by changing the law, and the attempt would only hold back law-abiding emerging companies at the expense of anyone with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. All you might plausibly \u201cachieve\u201d with regulation would be to reduce disruption in the labour market, by reducing how useful AI is allowed to be.", "What might a solution look like?", "Everyone\u2019s incentives would have to align. You can\u2019t expect the behaviour you want if there\u2019s a more attractive reason to do the opposite. If you want transparency, it has to pay. And you do want transparency, because it improves the upside and the downside \u2014 if everyone knows what everyone else is doing, they can build on each other\u2019s work, and they can spot if they\u2019re doing anything dangerous, either on purpose or by accident.", "You\u2019d want to open up participation to everyone, both as producers of inputs and consumers of outputs. For consumers, that would mean maximising the number of pre-built AI tools available in one place, minimising the skill hurdles to using pre-existing tools as they are designed to be used, and removing any barriers to modifying those tools, either by the consumer or by other developers that could modify the tools on the consumer\u2019s behalf. For producers, you\u2019d want easy access to the market and to all the customers within it \u2014 to see what people want, to see what tools exist already, and to be able to mix, match, produce and remix constantly to connect supply to demand.", "If this all sounds familiar, then that\u2019s because that\u2019s how markets are supposed to work in the first place. The problem is, economics only predicts consumer behaviour for spherical consumers in a vacuum (and the same goes for producer behaviour, or any of the other factors that go into a nice smooth supply and demand curve). There are all sorts of small reasons that these overly tidy economic models have never quite worked, but there\u2019s also one great big one \u2014 information asymmetry.", "An open, transparent market, with universal availability of data on the behaviour of the market, is the antidote to information asymmetry \u2014 especially given that, since it\u2019s a market for products that deal in the analysis of data already, it contains all the tools for its self-regulation. It then becomes an engine of efficiency \u2014 but not a top-down, vaguely-modelled view of efficiency, a true efficiency that matches genuine needs with scalable means to meet them. AI is powerful, but a free and fair market for AI is a paradigm shift.", "Inevitably, as soon as I realised this, I started figuring out how to build such a market \u2014 something with all the desirable traits of a fully free market, but with all the safety of a curated app store when you want that. There turn out to be lots of small obstacles along the way, and also a lot of surprising incidental upsides. Obstacles to the consumer include dealing with high levels of choice between competing solutions to the same niche problem, especially since ratings systems tend to be gameable. Then, there are the many ways to compile microsolutions into macrosolutions. And all that just leads to the perennial philosophical questions of which aims to pursue, now that the addressable set of potential aims has grown.", "Another set of problems concerns data. Few would argue that it\u2019s a bad thing for, say, epidemiology data to flow to people trying to control a virus. It\u2019s much easier to see how behavioural data going to advertisers could be a problem \u2014 and in many cases this is the exact same data. The answer seems to lie in giving some sort of ownership rights to the originators of such data (often individuals, sometimes organisations) as well as the ability to define usage rights \u2014 something like how copyright licensing (and copyleft) works today. This also opens the intriguing prospect of people being able to get a predictable income from AI companies licensing the right to their aggregated data.", "Some of these problems can be solved in advance with a blueprint, and some need to be navigated along the way. So far, they all seem to be tractable, and hopefully by publishing this I can reach the attention of the people that will end up navigating it with me.", "Your home for data science.
