Part 1 introduces the concept of explainable recommendations, while part 2 covers my implementation of explainable movie recommendations using Python and React.js.", "Recommender systems have seen increased usage over the past decade, and they\u2019re considered an integral part of applications such as YouTube, Netflix and Amazon. While recommendations have helped users find the videos, movies, or items they like in a limitless ocean of options, they\u2019ve not done so without problems. Recently some recommender systems have faced criticism for directing users to a \u201crabbit hole\u201d of increasingly radical content. An example of such system is YouTube\u2019s recommendation system, which recommends videos and channels for a user based on their watch history. When studying right-wing channels, researchers found some evidence that YouTube\u2019s recommendations algorithm radicalised users by recommending increasingly radical channels to them [1]. It\u2019s worth noting that this doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with the recommender system \u2014 in fact, it seems to work exactly as it was designed to, recommending videos accurately to users who would be interested in watching them. This problem can be called the radical content problem, and little academic research has been conducted on solving it.", "As an extension to my dissertation on explainable recommendations, I chose to seek out whether any of the explainability approaches could be used in discouraging the recommendation systems from recommending increasingly radical content, or discovering if the problem exists in the first place. Explainability in recommender systems has previously been mainly concerned with user experience, but perhaps it could help data scientists understand their own models better as well?", "Recommender systems based on latent factor models are highly uninterpretable. So far post-hoc explanation methods such as association rules [2] have been used in explaining individual recommendations. However, since the set of association rules encapsulates the recommender system\u2019s behaviour as a whole, it could be used to discover knowledge about the recommender system as a whole. To do that, the recommender system was mapped as a network using the generated association rules. Since the association rules are of form (X, Z => Y), they can be considered a directed graph where X, Z and Y are nodes of the graph. This graph can then be visualised using standard graph visualisation techniques. The figure below shows a generated graph using the association rules mined from the MovieLens 20m dataset. Note that rules of type (X, Y) => Z are shown in two edges, X => Z and Y => Z.", "The visualised graph can potentially be used to answer many questions about the underlying recommender system, but the most interesting one is whether the system suffers from the extreme content problem, referring to a recommender system that recommends more and more extreme, niche items to users who have rated popular, mild items. This problem is of particular interest to open video platforms like YouTube, which has been accused of promoting more extreme content to viewers of popular, milder \u201cgateway\u201d videos [1]. To analyse the network quantitatively, a proper metric for \u201cextremeness\u201d should be defined. An example of an extremeness score for movies could be its classified age rating. Content in platforms that have no objective age ratings, such as YouTube and Twitter, would likely be far harder to rank in extremeness, but machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis could possibly be used for this.", "Every item could then be assigned an extremeness score, and parts of the network where extremeness increases as one moves closer to the centre of a cluster could be identified automatically. Because extreme content tends to focus on particular communities or groups of users, the analysis should be done on cluster-based association rules rather than ones mined globally (as is done here). This would potentially allow the platform administrators to easily and objectively find the most radical communities, and set appropriate restrictions or age ratings to their content if needed.", "In this case, visual inspection of the network seems to place films such as The Shawshank Redemption, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Godfather to the centre of the network, which seem to be no more extremist than their antecedents. As such, visual inspection of the network suggests that the recommender system described here does not suffer from the extreme content problem. Of course, a more thorough analytical inspection should be conducted to confirm the finding, but this was out of scope for this project.", "This post concludes my series on explainable recommender systems.
