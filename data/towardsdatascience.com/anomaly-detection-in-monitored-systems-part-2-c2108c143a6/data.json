In this part, we will be putting that knowledge to practice and build our very own anomaly detection program.", "To recap, we finished the previous article with the Gaussian function in the graph above, on which two points mark different values a given data sample x might take. We then stated that the farther away x is from the mean, the higher the probability it represents an anomaly.", "The only problem in that statement is that the probability of getting any single value is precisely zero. Why is that? It turns out that the Gaussian function is a member of a group of functions calls \u201cProbability Density Functions\u201d, or PDF\u2019s for short. Without diving too deep into the mathematics behind PDFs, it suffices to understand that they give us the probability of a \u201ccontinuous random variable\u201d yielding a value within a given \u201crange\u201d.", "Now let\u2019s explain that: a range is simply a length between two numbers and is expressed by subtracting them. The common notation for the range between two points a and b is (a, b). A number x is considered \u201cwithin\u201d a range if", "A random variable is a formal term for our output data. While we treat each value as a single data point, when we look at all the values our output has taken over time, we can treat our output as a whole like a random variable. We are going to make a small shortcut - we\u2019re going to assume that for the given range of values our output can take, there isn\u2019t a value that cannot occur. This property, of being able to take any possible value, is what we call \u201ccontinuous\u201d. Therefore, a random variable that exhibits this property is called a continuous random variable. The standard notation being an uppercase X.", "Going back to PDF\u2019s and the Gaussian function, the way in which they express probabilities is by calculating the area beneath the curve, within a given range. The calculation of such areas is done using integrals. If you have a background in calculus, then you know the connection between integrals and areas. For those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with calculus, it is enough to treat them as the tools which allow us to calculate areas bound by functions within a given range.", "You can still gain insight into areas beneath curves by examining a constant straight-line function, such as f(x) = 1 (plotted in red, above). We can calculate the area beneath the function in two different ways: by using an integral and by using the formula for the area of a rectangle. First, we calculate the height and width of the rectangle: we can see that the bottom edge is the range (2, 3), and we obtain its length by subtracting the right point for the left. This gives us 3\u20132 = 1, which makes the width of the rectangle exactly 1.", "Next, we will calculate the length of the left edge of the rectangle. If you don\u2019t know how to do that, have a look at this Wikipedia page about measuring distances. Since I hope you know how to do that if you\u2019ve been reading me up to this point, you can easily verify the length of the left edge (representing the height) is also equal to 1.", "By using the formula for the area of a rectangle, we can calculate its surface area:", "This gives us a geometric insight about measuring areas bounded by functions. Namely, that there is a relationship between the range corresponding with the width of the rectangle and its surface area. It turns out this relationship holds true for every function, which brings us to the following issue: If we extend the definition of a range to a single point x, we can say that any point is a range of the shape (x, x). The length of this range is obtained in the same way - by subtracting the right point from the left. This makes the length x - x = 0.", "But since the width of the rectangle is the length of that range, we would get that W = 0. Plugging the new value back in the area formula, we now get:", "Which is exactly why p(x) for any given value is exactly zero. If this is the case, how can we perform anomaly detection using the properties of the random variable X? It turns out to be simpler than it sounds, and we are going to use our geometric intuition once again.", "For any given value x, we calculate the length of the range (\u03bc, x) and mark that length with the constant t. We then choose two values T1 and T2 using the equations below:", "Where g denotes the Gaussian function. And it turns out the Gaussian has a neat property - it is a symmetric function with respect to its mean. That is, for every value of x, g(\u03bc - x) = g(\u03bc + x). Because every two points only have one line that dissects them both, the fact that g(x) is symmetric means that the line passing through T1 and T2 is perpendicular to the x-axis.", "Another property the Gaussian function has is that the area beneath the curve, when unbounded by the x-axis, is equal to 1. This can be expressed using integrals as:", "Which means that if we calculate the area bounded by the range (T1, T2), we can get the remaining area under the curve by subtracting it from 1:", "What do these results mean geometrically? Remember that the key parameter here is the length we denoted with t: the further away x is from the mean, the longer the range t becomes. For every increase in the size of t, there is a matching increase in area A between T1 and T2. The increase to A naturally means a decrease in the value of 1-A, which is seen as the blue \u201ctails\u201d underneath the edges of the bell curve.", "Now that we have our results, all we need to decide is how abnormal a given value x needs to be for us to classify it as an anomaly. This value is entirely up to you and to the domain of the devices you are trying to monitor. Common values might be 0.1%, 1%, 5%, but of course, you can choose the value which fits you best.", "To recap, we have learned that:", "\u00b7 Random variables are a way to statistically represent our output data.", "\u00b7 Probability density functions, like the Gaussian, give us the probability of our random variable yielding values within a range.", "\u00b7 The way the Gaussian conveys this probability is by the surface area underneath its curve, bounded by the target range.", "Part three in the series is now ready:", "Your home for data science.
