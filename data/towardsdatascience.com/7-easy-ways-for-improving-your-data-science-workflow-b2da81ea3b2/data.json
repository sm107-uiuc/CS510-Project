In this blog, we are going to talk about 7 easy ways that can quickly improve your data science workflow. These are tips that I have learnt the hard way after I have left Uni. Hopefully, this can help you organise your environment, code better, and find a more suitable stack for your data science projects!", "Nothing is worse than having a messy folder with Untitled.ipynb up to Untitled9999.ipynb, data csv scattered everywhere in the folder, and a bunch of cache like .ipynb_checkpoints. A good first step to setting up your project folder would immensely smoother your daily workflow. Some common tools that help set up an organised folder are:", "Most of the data science medium blog post would tell you, create a virtual environment for your project, but rarely do they tell you the important to keeping it clean. Often when you create your development environment, there will be a bunch of IPython related packages installed which are not required for the production environment. To make your workflow smoother, you can either:", "Do not reinvent the wheel! More than often when you feel like there are some clunky code that you need to code, you are recreating some built-in functions that Python provides.", "Example 1: collection.Counter for counting occurrences", "Example 2: itertools.chain.from_iterable for joining list of lists", "Example 3: collections.namedtuple as a replacement of an immutable class", "Example 4: bisect.insort for maintaining a sorted list", "Another common pitfall is using overkilling data structures. For example, if you never change the content of a list once defined, a tuple would save you a lot of memory; or if you only use the first or last element of a list, then go for a deque.", "We all know it ourselves, development notebooks are some of the worst scripts in the world when it comes to readability, scalability and maintainability. There are generally a couple of rules of thumb when it comes to packaging your notebooks into a Python package:", "Object-oriented programming vs functional programming will forever be a debate when it comes to organising your code. But bottom line, using either one is better than using none. When it comes to data science, there are a number of packages that are organised in a OOP manner, e.g. sci-kit learn, nltk, spacy, and more. If you manage to package your script into classes that extend their abstract classes, it would help organise your code better, and allow better integration with your data science pipeline.", "For example, based on my previous snippet of regex expression construction, I would like to construct a tokeniser that returns only the tokens captured by the function. By inheriting nltk\u2019s TokenizerI, my RegexpEntityTokenizer now has the same structure as say nltk\u2019s PunktSentenceTokenizer. This means that I can now pass my custom tokenizer to a sklearn Pipeline for a seamless workflow.", "Yes, I know. Pickling DataFrames and other objects are convenient; you can basically serialise everything in your python script into a .pkl file. However, pickle\u2019s convenience comes with several weak links:", "So remember, pickle is not the only way to saving your data and progress. Below are some of the alternatives:", "Last but never least, this would be a big jump and potentially change your game plan. But trust me, it is worth it after experiencing the conversion myself. Check to see if you have experienced any of the following:", "These are all signs that a database will make your life a lot easier. And once you have a database in place, SQL would help you do a lot of heavy lifting. A lot of the times, I/O is the bottleneck for my Python scripts. By moving the processing just that one step closer to the data, read-write speed has been improved in a different order of magnitude.
