I will discuss when and how to use waiting line models from a business standpoint. In the second part, I will go in-depth into multiple specific queuing theory models, that can be used for specific waiting lines, as well as other applications of queueing theory.", "Waiting line models are mathematical models used to study waiting lines. Another name for the domain is queuing theory.", "Waiting lines can be set up in many ways. In a theme park ride, you generally have one line. In the supermarket, you have multiple cashiers with each their own waiting line. And at a fast-food restaurant, you may encounter situations with multiple servers and a single waiting line.", "The goal of waiting line models is to describe expected result KPIs of a waiting line system, without having to implement them for empirical observation. Result KPIs for waiting lines can be for instance reduction of staffing costs or improvement of guest satisfaction.", "Waiting line models can be used as long as your situation meets the idea of a waiting line. This means that there has to be a specific process for arriving clients (or whatever object you are modeling), and a specific process for the servers (usually with the departure of clients out of the system after having been served).", "Waiting line models need arrival, waiting and service", "This idea may seem very specific to waiting lines, but there are actually many possible applications of waiting line models. For example, waiting line models are very important for:", "Imagine a store with on average two people arriving in the waiting line every minute and two people leaving every minute as well. That seems to be a waiting line in balance, but then why would there even be a waiting line in the first place?", "The answer is variation around the averages. Let\u2019s see an example:", "Imagine a waiting line in equilibrium with 2 people arriving each minute and 2 people being served each minute:", "If at 1 point in time 10 people arrive (without a change in service rate), there may well be a waiting line for the rest of the day:", "To conclude, the benefits of using waiting line models are that they allow for estimating the probability of different scenarios to happen to your waiting line system, depending on the organization of your specific waiting line.", "An interesting business-oriented approach to modeling waiting lines is to analyze at what point your waiting time starts to have a negative financial impact on your sales.", "Some interesting studies have been done on this by digital giants. For example, Amazon has found out that 100 milliseconds increase in waiting time (page loading) costs them 1% of sales (source). This type of study could be done for any specific waiting line to find a ideal waiting line system.", "Tip: find your goal waiting line KPI before modeling your actual waiting line", "The main financial KPIs to follow on a waiting line are:", "A great way to objectively study those costs is to experiment with different service levels and build a graph with the amount of service (or serving staff) on the x-axis and the costs on the y-axis. This gives the following type of graph:", "In this graph, we can see that the total cost is minimized for a service level of 30 to 40. Even though we could serve more clients at a service level of 50, this does not weigh up to the cost of staffing.", "Once we have these cost KPIs all set, we should look into probabilistic KPIs. This means: trying to identify the mathematical definition of our waiting line and use the model to compute the probability of the waiting line system reaching a certain extreme value.", "Examples of such probabilistic questions are:", "Waiting line modeling also makes it possible to simulate longer runs and extreme cases to analyze what-if scenarios for very complicated multi-level waiting line systems.", "The first waiting line we will dive into is the simplest waiting line. It has 1 waiting line and 1 server.", "All KPIs of this waiting line can be mathematically identified as long as we know the probability distribution of the arrival process and the service process.", "This waiting line system is called an M/M/1 queue if it meets the following criteria:", "The Poisson distribution is a famous probability distribution that describes the probability of a certain number of events happening in a fixed time frame, given an average event rate.", "If a prior analysis shows us that our arrivals follow a Poisson distribution (often we will take this as an assumption), we can use the average arrival rate and plug it into the Poisson distribution to obtain the probability of a certain number of arrivals in a fixed time frame.", "The following example shows how likely it is for each number of clients arriving if the arrival rate is 1 per time and the arrivals follow a Poisson distribution.", "The reason that we work with this Poisson distribution is simply that, in practice, the variation of arrivals on waiting lines very often follow this probability. There are alternatives, and we will see an example of this further on.", "The second criterion for an M/M/1 queue is that the duration of service has an Exponential distribution. This means that the duration of service has an average, and a variation around that average that is given by the Exponential distribution formulas.", "An example of an Exponential distribution with an average waiting time of 1 minute can be seen here:", "For analysis of an M/M/1 queue we start with:", "From those inputs, using predefined formulas for the M/M/1 queue, we can find the KPIs for our waiting line model:", "M/M/1 queues are stable as long as \u03bb < \u03bc", "It is often important to know whether our waiting line is stable (meaning that it will stay more or less the same size). For the M/M/1 queue, the stability is simply obtained as long as \u03bb (lambda) stays smaller than \u03bc (mu). This means that service is faster than arrival, which intuitively implies that people the waiting line wouldn\u2019t grow too much.", "A second analysis to do is the computation of the average time that the server will be occupied. This is called utilization. Utilization is called \u03c1 (rho) and it is calculated as:", "It is possible to compute the average number of customers in the system using the following formula:", "The variation around the average number of customers is defined as followed:", "Going even further on the number of customers, we can also put the question the other way around. Rather than asking what the average number of customers is, we can ask the probability of a given number x of customers in the waiting line.", "The response time is the time it takes a client from arriving to leaving. It includes waiting and being served. The average response time can be computed as:", "The average time spent waiting can be computed as follows:", "To give a practical example, let\u2019s apply the analysis on a small store\u2019s waiting line. There is one line and one cashier, the M/M/1 queue applies. Let\u2019s say that the average time for the cashier is 30 seconds and that there are 2 new customers coming in every minute.", "As a solution, the cashier has convinced the owner to buy him a faster cash register, and he is now able to handle a customer in 15 seconds on average. However, at some point, the owner walks into his store and sees 4 people in line. Should the owner be worried about this?", "Now that we have discovered everything about the M/M/1 queue, we move on to some more complicated types of queues. In order to do this, we generally change one of the three parameters in the name. This is called Kendall notation.", "We have generally 3 types of processes:", "The number at the end is the number of servers from 1 to infinity. M/M/1, the queue that was covered before stands for Markovian arrival / Markovian service / 1 server. Models with G can be interesting, but there are little formulas that have been identified for them. Some analyses have been done on G queues but I prefer to focus on more practical and intuitive models with combinations of M and D. Let\u2019s have a look at three well known queues:", "An M/M/c queue is characterized by:", "An example of this is a waiting line in a fast-food drive-through, where everyone stands in the same line, and will be served by one of the multiple servers, as long as arrivals are Poisson and service time is Exponentially distributed.", "An M/D/c queue is characterized by:", "An example of such a situation could be an automated photo booth for security scans in airports. If we take the hypothesis that taking the pictures takes exactly the same amount of time for each passenger, and people arrive following a Poisson distribution, this would match an M/D/c queue.", "In the common, simpler, case where there is only one server, we have the M/D/1 case. The formulas specific for the M/D/1 case are:", "When we have c > 1 we cannot use the above formulas. We need to use the following:", "A D/M/1 queue is characterized by:", "The formulas specific for the D/M/1 queue are:", "In the last part of this article, I want to show that many differences come into practice while modeling waiting lines. In some cases, we can find adapted formulas, while in other situations we may struggle to find the appropriate model.", "Here is an overview of the possible variants you could encounter", "After reading this article, you should have an understanding of different waiting line models that are well-known analytically. Thanks to the research that has been done in queuing theory, it has become relatively easy to apply queuing theory on waiting lines in practice.", "For some, complicated, variants of waiting lines, it can be more difficult to find the solution, as it may require a more theoretical mathematical approach.", "I hope this article gives you a great starting point for getting into waiting line models and queuing theory.
