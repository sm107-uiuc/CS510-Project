But what makes the GAN so magical?", "In fact that there are numerous tutorials that teach how to implement GAN code \u2014 but do not explain GAN simply enough. In this tutorial, I will go through the math behind GANs and will try to cover most of the basics as in the original GAN paper. You might have guessed at this point that this is not a code line-by-line tutorial.", "A Generative Adversarial Network contains not a single network, but a set of at least two networks that are always at \u2018war\u2019 with each other . One network is known as a Generator and the other is the Discriminator. As is quite evident from their names, a generator generates data that is assessed by a discriminator. The adversarial part or the \u2018war\u2019 between the two networks is that the generator tries repeatedly to fool the discriminator while the discriminator is ever determined not to come under the pretense of the generator.", "What the generator does is what our neural networks have been doing for a long time. A generator tries to estimate the data distribution and generates data based on that estimate. Neural networks, in general, are often used to estimate a function based on some parameters. What makes the generator different from a traditional neural network? Where\u2019s the magic? \u2014 The generator works on noise as an input! The fact that a machine can generate human handwriting(say) from noise is what makes GANs magical.", "Since our Generator network works on noise as input, we must define a prior on input noise variables first. Let us represent the prior as \u2014", "In Bayesian statistical inference, a prior probability distribution, often simply called the prior, of an uncertain quantity is the probability distribution that would express one\u2019s beliefs about this quantity before some evidence is taken into account \u2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability", "If we were to represent the Generator network by G, we can say that G maps the noise variables onto a data space as \u2014", "To say it extremely simply, the generator G takes random noise and tries to reconstruct the true data. Let us say that we define the data given by the generator as output by p. It is important to note that we do not optimize p \u2014 we optimize theta so that we get a proper estimate of p. Now , we don\u2019t expect the generator to train and give true data by itself, right? we need something that checks up-to the generator and brings upon it some kind of \u2018punishment\u2019 if its not able to generate the true data from noise.", "This \u2018punisher\u2019 is the Discriminator. The Discriminator (D) is at its most basic form, a classifier that classifies its inputs a real or fake. Thus the discriminator outputs a single scalar. D(x) represents the probability that x came from the true data rather than the generator G. Since we have defined the generator and the discriminator models and how they work, we will now talk about the cost function or the loss function.", "Arguably one of the most important parts of the GAN is the loss function and its design. The loss function defined in the paper that introduced GAN is \u2014", "This is a \u2018min-max\u2019 loss function \u2014 We train the discriminator to maximize this loss function while the generator is trained to minimize the last term of this loss function. There are other loss functions for different types of GANs. Some of those loss functions are modifications on this one. A GAN can even have more than one loss function \u2014 one for the generator and one for the discriminator", "Now that we are done with the loss function, how should we deal with the training? Which network do we train first? For each epoch, the discriminator\u2019s gradients are computed first and its weights are updated first. Then, we train the generator.", "Thus, we have now successfully trained a very primitive and simple GAN network. This is, however, is just an explanation of the GAN paper introduced in 2014. Since then hundreds of types of GAN have been created and each have their own loss functions and their own training algorithms.", "Implementing GANs can turn out to be very interesting indeed.
