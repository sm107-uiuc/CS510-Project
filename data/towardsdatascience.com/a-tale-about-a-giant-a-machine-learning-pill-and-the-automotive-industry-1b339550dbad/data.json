A giant so big and powerful, that everybody knew the giant. Then, the Giant was given a wondrous Machine Learning pill from a friendly Fairy. The pill promised to make the Giant ever more powerful, but also inflicting severe pain upon him. The Giant has swallowed the pill, and the growing pains take off.", "This is the final part of this trilogy about the impact of Machine Learning on the automotive industry. To better illustrate the complexity and challenges, the main points are complemented by this story about the Giant and the Machine Learning pill. The insights are based on my experience in working in the automotive industry and long-standing conversations with automotive experts from around the world. The trilogy is divided into the following parts: importance (I), opportunities (II), and challenges (III) of the automotive industry in implementing the transcendent technology of Machine Learning.", "This part elaborates on the challenges of the automotive industry with Machine Learning. The growing pains occur in the following parts: Data, Infrastructure, and Algorithms. Let\u2019s see how.", "The automotive industry sits on one of the most valuable resources of the future \u2014 data. A single car equipped with modern sensors can produce between 4\u201310 Terabytes of data every day. The biggest data producers are the camera and Lidar sensors. Cameras observe the environment to detect objects or lane markings. Lidar sensors are helpful to get an accurate distance to other objects. Machine Learning helps to interpret the incoming data.", "Let\u2019s put the sheer amount of data produced into perspective. If your smartphone has 256 GB storage, 10 TB of data equals 40 maxed out smartphones every day. Data is the key ingredient to Machine Learning, teaching algorithms what to learn. Thus, having access to a lot of data is a prerequisite for building intelligent systems. But this plethora of data poses new challenges in the automotive industry for storing, filtering, and analyzing.", "Competitors, or Baby Giants, understand the value of data. They race to collect millions of miles driven on the road. In 2019 Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, collected more than two billion miles of data. Waymo, a self-driving car company, has surpassed the ten million miles mark in October 2018. Additionally, the companies have driven billions of miles in simulation. Elon Musk claims that Tesla currently collects 99.5% of all collected automotive data. There are more than 500.000 camera-equipped Tesla driving around today. Yet, The hockey stick curve in collecting miles is most impressive. The Baby Giants own the raw ingredient for creating successful Machine Learning algorithms.", "Yet, the value doesn\u2019t lie in the pure amount of recorded data. Training Machine Learning algorithms requires a diverse data set. Recording data while standing at a red light for hours will produce a lot of data, but with limited value. The key is to collect smart data. Corner case data is especially valuable, e.g. a child suddenly crossing a street while chasing a ball. In these situations, you want to be 100% certain that the algorithms act correctly.", "To test unorthodox situations, Waymo CEO John Krafcik has gone on record to describe how they test uncommon scenarios. John supposedly dresses up as Big Bird from Sesame Street to see if the car would stop! Having Big Bird cross the street is surely a situation the car hasn\u2019t seen before, but it should still stop.", "Having understood the challenges in working with data, let\u2019s move on to the infrastructure necessary to make Machine Learning work.", "Cars with intelligent functions need advanced sensors to perceive the environment. Creating a research vehicle can cost upwards of 250k$, according to Udacity estimates. Equipping trucks with enough sensors for self-driving capabilities costs millions.", "The most expensive sensor is top-shelf Lidar at almost 120k$. The costs are projected to decrease significantly once Lidar sensors are mass-produced. Waymo sells its self-developed Lidar sensor Honeycomb, which they claim reduces the costs by 90%. Most automotive companies consent that Lidar is needed for safe advanced driving functions. Tesla omits the sensor, famously calling it a \u201ccrutch\u201d.", "A major breaking point is the cost-sensitivity of volume-producing car manufacturers. The margin for a new vehicle at companies like Volkswagen or Toyota is only around 5%. So if you buy a vehicle for 25.000$, only 500$ are profit for the company. Inserting new sensors immediately decreases the profitability of the business. Bringing sensor costs down to a level that still enables AI-driven functions remains a challenge.", "Additionally, consider the graphic below. It does not show an ever-evolving organizational chart. The .gif shows the evolution of the electronics architecture in modern vehicles since the 1970s. As you can see, the architecture became increasingly complex and hard to maintain.", "Even if the architecture used micro-services orchestrated with Kubernetes, it\u2019d still be very complex. Remember, cars are never pure software products, they interact with critical hardware. This makes collecting data and integrating Machine Learning algorithms a complex challenge.", "Let\u2019s look at the last puzzle piece of enabling the Giant to grow with the help of Machine Learning.", "Including Machine Learning algorithms in car functions creates new challenges. Traditional programming is considered safe because it works deterministically. Machine Learning is dismissed as unsafe because it operates probabilistically.", "Consider the research study that claimed a neural net can detect if a person is a criminal based on their face. Apart from the moral and ethical hazards of this study, it turned out to be simply wrong.", "Researchers gathered input data from criminals and non-criminals in different ways. They took the face images from government-issued IDs from criminals. On the other hand, they took face images from a public website from non-criminals. Now, who would feel comfortable putting their government ID picture on their profile? I sure look like a criminal on my passport picture! In essence, the algorithm learned to distinguish between a government ID and your LinkedIn profile picture, not between criminal and non-criminal.", "Another cautionary example stems from UC Irvine. A student trained a neural network to distinguish huskies from wolves. The student was happy about achieving 94% accuracy on the task.Then the professor asked the student how he could be certain that the network learned what it was supposed to learn? After analyzing the data, the group found the key differentiator. Most images with huskies had snow in the background, while wolf images had no snow in the background. In essence, the algorithm didn\u2019t learn to distinguish between huskies and wolves, but between \u201csnow\u201d and \u201cno snow\u201d in the background.", "These examples show that understanding what algorithms learn is important to developing safe functions. The function developers have to be sure that their algorithms work as intended when steering a vehicle around humans. The industry needs clear inspections of input data, and a clear process of testing and approving Machine Learning-based functions.", "With this fairytale, I hope you got a better understanding of the current opportunities and challenges of implementing Machine Learning at automotive Giants. This Machine Learning pill could make the Giant so powerful, but also inflict severe pain.", "Thank you for following the Giant along on its journey! Yet, this story is far from over. The Giant needs you to help it deal with the growing pains. Given the importance of the industry, I hope that you consider joining the Giant at this unprecedented cross-road in its story. It\u2019s the most exciting time to join the Giant and help it deal with its pain.", "If you liked this story, you can reread the fairytale trilogy here. Part I discusses the importance of the automotive industry, and Part II explains the opportunities ahead.", "This story was presented at the Data Festival 2019. Find the video of this talk here. If you\u2019d like to hear more about the intersection of Business, Project Management, and Data Science, follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, or Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
