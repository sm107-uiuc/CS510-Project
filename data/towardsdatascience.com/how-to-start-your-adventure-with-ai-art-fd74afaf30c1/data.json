Before I answer that question, two words of introduction. What you see in the picture below is a model that makes text look like a picture. It is an AttnGAN (Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks). It turns descriptive text into synthesized images. AttnGAN is able to synthesize small details in different parts of an image. The natural language descriptions are well managed by thinking about the appropriate words. The text that answers the question \u201cWhat is an AI?\u201d is not a descriptive text, but we want to see what our GAN produces. The answer to the question \u201cwhat is Artificial Intelligence\u201d I asked the most invested party.", "I hope you will guess who it is.", "Yes \u2014 the author of the answer to my question is the GPT-3 algorithm. The latest NLP (Natural Language Processing) model. Which is able to generate text on any topic; not only text, but also code and image.", "I would now like to show you an example of image generation by this model. What you see in the image (below) are fragments of film posters \u2014 you will probably recognise what films they are from, and the model will extrapolate from the image fragment \u2014 the rest is hidden to it \u2014 in order to generate the rest of the poster. Look at the first results. As you can see, the model is able to guess that is the missing parts of the images are a shark, a mouth, or some other element, even an abstract spiral. The number of variations that can be generated is infinite. The final column is the original posters \u2014 everything other than the leftmost and rightmost columns are posters generated by the Image GPT model.", "Here is an example with other pictures. Look out for the second picture from the top \u2014 the cat. The original picture shows only a small part of something white sticking out from the bottom. In response to this, the model has generated pictures of a cat with an object in front \u2014 a piece of paper, even filled out with text. Look at the drops of water, or rather on the waves that appeared on the water surface. The model has perfectly anticipated what can happen on the surface of water based solely on a fragment of the picture. Another image down \u2014 as you can see, there are various arbitrary interpretations, not always perfect. And at the end again is what the original pictures looked like.", "State of the art in machine learning on the YouTube channel below, with content updated daily.", "The GPT model that I showed you at the start is machine learning\u2019s state-of-the-art; it was made available just this summer. In fact, machine learning \u2014 or its foundation, statistics \u2014 started as early as 1763 with Thomas Bayes. Thomas Bayes is the father of statistics. Machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence based on statistical techniques that give computer programs the ability to automatically improve performance through experience, so we are actually talking about statistics on steroids.", "The first machines that generated art had an appearance in the 18th century e.g. work of Pierre Jaquet-Droz, who made three machines The one that interests us most in this case is The Draughtsman \u2014 The Writer and The Musician were the other two. A high-precision programmed machine, which created \u2014 or in this case generated \u2014 drawings. Another important figure in the history of machine learning is Augusta Lovelace \u2014 a mathematician and poet, who for the first time paid attention to the fact that algorithms have a possible use outside of mathematics.", "Let us move on to the 21st century. The year 1955 gave us Jean Tinguely\u2019s drawing machine \u2014 a mechanism that, once spun up, makes drawings. Another example is 1973\u2019s AARON algorithm \u2014 the work of Harold Cohen, the effects of which was, as you can see, the first computer-generated image. Harold Cohen spent two years at Stanford University\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and there he became a pioneer of contemporary machine-generated art. In 2014, Ian G. Goodfellow\u2019s work gave rise to the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). GANs are the main tools of AI artists today. GAN consists \u2014 and this is Ian\u2019s ingenious idea \u2014 of two neural networks \u2014 a generator and a discriminator, which in the generator\u2019s case generates an image, and in the discriminator\u2019s case decides whether the image is close to or distant from the expected effect, and then decides on the generated output, which the end user sees as the GAN\u2019s final result.", "In the spring of 2022, the Diffusion revolution in AI art began. Within a few months, millions of people became artists \u2014 read about it HERE", "It is time for me to bring up the most current examples. In my own project myFATHERintheCLOUD.ai I use many machine learning models, the effects of which I will now present with the example of coming from one of my more recent project \u2014 an event that took place in January 2020, a concert entitled \u201c\u2026descended in the cloud.\u201d In myFATHERintheCLOUD I train ML models to give my late father artistic immortality. The datasets used for this are created on the basis of 60 years of his creative output. During the concert held on 17th January, on the first anniversary of my father\u2019s death, one of the models used was YOLO (You Only Look Once), an algorithm recognizing objects in an image in real time. During the concert it classified objects located in the neo-Baroque basilica on G\u00f3ra \u015bw. Anny. I was fascinated by the clash of a model trained on COCO datasets consisting of 380,000 photos with the interior of a Baroque basilica.Also presented during the event was a visualisation of the first sculptures generated by a model trained on data that consisted of father\u2019s figurative sculptures.", "The music you can hear here is Verdi\u2019s Nabucco as it was interpreted by instruments trained on neural networks and an organ instrument inside the basilica. The sound generated by me of instruments that do not exist in reality combined with a musical interpretation by Pawe\u0142 Hadaschik was the first event of its kind using machine learning.", "The field of AI art is huge, and it is difficult to cover all its aspects in a short article. I have generated more text using the GPT model \u2014 a paragraph on how to start your own adventure with AI art. GPT proposes to make friends with the AI artist, something I strongly encourage you to do. As in the example at the beginning of the article with the question about what AI is, the GPT model can surprise you with its answer.", "Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!", "The image you below see is a screenshot of my work with StyleGAN 2, the model I use to generate my father\u2019s sculptures. This is what it looks like to train a model, which can take up to several weeks. The images generated here are from an initial phase of model training.", "I invite you to read my other articles \u2014 I describe the whole process of creating a workable AI model there. For those who want to start their adventure with machine learning and neural networks today I suggest logging on to the page shown in the image.", "Everything that I produce is open source, and you can follow the process on my Substack feed. ( Codex , GPT 3, GANs )", "There are three pre-trained models on the page you can choose from; all you need to do is upload a .jpg file and the generator will display the effect of its work in literally a few seconds.
