It is an object-oriented, high-level programming language that was released way back in 1991, and it is highly interpretable and efficient.", "I initially started out with languages like C, C++, and Java. When I finally encountered python, I found it to be quite elegant, simple to learn, and easy to use. Python is the best way for anyone, even people with no prior experience with programming or coding languages, to get started with machine learning.", "It offers a wide range of versatility to deal with various problems due to its simplicity of data structures, conditional loops, and functions. The anonymous and advanced functions are the main topic topics that we will deal with today, but the basic question is \u2014 What are functions?", "Functions are a block of code that is written in a program so that they can be recalled multiple times. The main utility of a function is so that it can be repeatedly called numerous times in the same program, and you don\u2019t need to write the same codes over and over again. However, you can also use it to provide more structure and an overall better look to your programs.", "Functions are defined using the keyword \u2018def,\u2019 which can be called with defined or undefined parameters. When you call the particular the particular function, then whatever the value is to be returned is interpreted by the python compiler.", "What if your code takes this block consisting of a few lines of code and performs it in just one or two lines?", "This task can be performed by the anonymous function in python. Let us understand this concept with a bit more depth in the next section.", "In Python, an anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword in Python, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword. Hence, anonymous functions are sometimes also referred to as lambda functions, and they are often used interchangeably.", "The syntax for the function is as follows:", "The main advantage of using the lambda function is executing a lambda function that evaluates its expression and then automatically returns its result. So there\u2019s always an implicit return statement. That\u2019s why some people refer to lambdas as single expression functions. It is very useful in most scenarios to simplify code and is an integral part of the programming language.", "Most times, lambda functions are good, but the times you should consider not using them is if utilizing these functions make the single line code longer than anticipated, and it becomes hard for the user to read. Basically, you should consider not to use lambda functions when the readability of your code decreases.", "Let us understand how to precisely use the code in lambda functions for our benefit. I am going to be listing a few problem statements with their code block solution with normal functions and with lambda functions for a clear conceptual understanding.", "Print the square of a number using functions.", "The above code block and output is a representation of how the following code could be written by just using a normal def function for the computation of the problem statement.", "With the help of the lambda function, the same problem statement can be solved within two lines of code. This is how the lambda function simplifies the problem statements.", "Lambda functions are often used with other functions to solve complex tasks within a few lines rather than a block of code. These functions are namely filter, map, and reduce. Let us analyze each one of them individually with separate problem statements.", "The filter() function, as the name suggests, will create a new list and store only the elements that satisfy a particular condition and will filter out the remaining values.", "The filter() operation takes a function object and an iterable and creates a new list. A successful computation is performed whenever the condition is satisfied and returns true.", "Print only the even numbers for a list of elements.", "In the above code block, the function is taking an input of a list of numbers. We are then looping through the list and using a conditional statement to store only the even numbers from the given list. The function finally returns the list containing all the even numbers.", "In one line of code, we can filter out the even numbers from the iterable list with the help of the above code. The output returned is the exact same as the previous lengthy function.", "The map() function iterates through all items in the given iterable and executes the function we passed as an argument on each of them. This is similar to the filter() function.", "It can be used to obtain Boolean values of true and false on the conditional list or just map each element to its respective output. Let us understand this in more detail with some code.", "Print the squares of each element in a list.", "In the above code block, the function is taking an input of a list of numbers similar to the previous problem. We are then looping through the list and computing the squares of each of the elements stored in the list. The function finally returns the list containing all the squared numbers of each of the elements.", "The map function computes and solves the problem statement in a single code line. Each of the elements in the list is mapped with their respective squares.", "Unlike the previous two functions, namely filter() and map(), the reduce function works slightly different. It goes through the list of iterable numbers and proceeds to return only a single value.", "This function can be useful in performing calculations like addition or multiplication of a list with a simple code rather than a longer code block. The reduce() function computes the list two elements at a time until the completion of the entire iterable.", "Print the product of all the elements in the list.", "In the above code block, the function is taking an input of a list of numbers similar to the previous two problems. We are then looping through the list and computing the product of all the numbers from the given list. The function finally returns the output of the final product obtained after evaluating the list.", "The reduce() function needs to be imported from the functools module in python 3. The code block above performs the sequential multiplication of two elements at a time until the completion of the computation of the entire list.", "In this article, we had a brief introduction to python and a basic understanding of what exactly is the role of functions in the Python programming language.", "Then we had a further discussion on the anonymous function in python and understood each of the advanced function options available in it with some codes and examples.", "If you have any queries concerning the topics covered today, then please do let me know about them in the comments below. I will try to get back to you as soon as possible. Feel free to let me know if I missed out on something. And you would like me to cover that in a future article.", "Check out some of my other articles that you might enjoy reading!", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end. I hope all of you enjoyed reading the article. Wish you all a wonderful day!", "Your home for data science.
