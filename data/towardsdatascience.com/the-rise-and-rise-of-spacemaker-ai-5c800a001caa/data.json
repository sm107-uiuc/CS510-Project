As a teaser let me quote them directly and say:", "Spacemaker AI develops a game changing AI technology that discovers the smartest ways to maximize the value of any building site.", "It is a big promise, right? Indeed and they are building the capacity to deliver. Spacemaker AI is still a small company recently hiring their employee number 100. It was named the hottest place to work by the largest Norwegian business newspaper. A few days ago it was announced that they just closed their series A round with $25 million. As mentioned in TechCrunch their round were led by Atomico and Northzone.", "A series A round is the name typically given to a company\u2019s first significant round of venture capital financing. The name refers to the class of preferred stock sold to investors in exchange for their investment.", "Real estate technology has had a volcanic growth going from $16,99 billion dollars in 1137 companies 2016, to $55 billion dollars in 1659 companies 2019 according to new numbers by Venturescanner as reported by Shifter. That\u2019s numbers, but what does Spacemaker AI do?", "Described as \u201cthe world\u2019s first\u201d AI-assisted design and construction simulation software for the property development sector, Spacemaker claims to enable property development professionals, such as real estate developers, architects and urban planners, to quickly generate and evaluate the optimal environmental design for any multi-building residential development. To achieve this, the Spacemaker software crunches various data, including physical data, regulations, environmental factors and other preferences.-TechCrunch 10th of June 2019", "Let us however backtrack a few years to learn more about the company.", "According to the official company register Spacemaker AI was founded in late 2016 by H\u00e5vard Haukeland and Carl Christensen. H\u00e5vard Haukeland had an educational background as an architect and within technology having worked as an architect and within urban design. Carl Christensen had an educational background as a computer engineer with an additional master\u2019s in business administration and economics.", "In late 2017 there is an article that states their digital solution was part of a 4-year scientific research project with support from amongst others Aspelin Ramm, AF Eiendom, Stor-Oslo Eiendom and SINTEF. Spacemaker AI had then received upwards of 15 million Norwegian kroners ($1,8 million) from The Research Council of Noway, Innovation Norway and Simula Research Laboratory to develop their digital solution.", "In October 2017 they had in one year grown into a small company with 20 employees. They were at the time talking about using artificial intelligence in city planning and for building sites. In September 2017 a group of investors came together to invest 22 million Norwegian kroners ($2,65 million) in the company. In addition to this part of the Norwegian leadership group in CBRE decided to invest with CBRE being one of the largest consultant in commercial property registered in New York. This is what part of their solution looked like in late 2017:", "Only two weeks after their first project they claimed to have been approached by more than 100 clients for collaboration and H\u00e5vard Haukeland was nominated as top leadership talent of the year in Norway.", "At the time in 2017 one of the CEOs of their largest investor was adamant that if they should dare to have success it must be internationally. Their solution became a blend of architecture and the field of AI. They were taking an advanced set of considerations for each property project with a wide range of factors through complex maths. Still they did acknowledge that not all qualities in architecture could be calculated.", "\u201c\u2026we do not believe artificial intelligence will replace the architect. But it might be that architects who use artificial intelligence could replace architects who do not.\u201d- H\u00e5vard Haukeland in an interview with DN September 2017", "At this time in 2017 they had also started working with a research fellow PhD student at Harvard University. A collaboration that later would flourish. Another research project ongoing in Spacemaker was with SINTEF in applied mathematics called OptiSite and had commenced rolling from 2017\u20132021.", "We are the research partner in Spacemaker\u2019s innovation project OptiSite. OptiSite will make Spacemaker a global leader in software tools for building design and site planning. In the project we improve and develop optimisation and AI technology to assist property development.-SINTEF, 8th of March 2016", "Towards the end of 2017 according to co-founder H\u00e5vard Haukeland Spacemaker AI was named as one of the 500 most innovative startups by Hello Tomorrow a leading nonprofit to accelerate startups and tech entrepreneurship. Around this time they had received a rebrand from the agency Racecar. As such both their research capacities and their brand was being developed.", "Research had been at the core in the company from the very beginning, and seems to have been throughout its operations. In the middle of 2018 Spacemaker AI had set up office in the United States with their first full-time employee Jordan Hoffman. His background being in applied mathematics seemingly a fitting addition to the company since the company had posted their makeup earlier the same year.", "From the blog post written by Magnhild Gjestvang at the official Spacemaker AI Medium page it is additionally stated they were having meetings at Harvard and MIT both recruiting as well as learning. They were at the time invited to give a guest lecture at MIT, meeting system designers there who were exploring complex sociotechnical engineering systems.", "They had also held presentations at the other technical universities such as NTNU in Norway. They were recruiting aggressively expanding their team recruiting from universities and some of the best developers from other companies in Oslo. International recruitment seems to have been a strategy for Spacemaker AI from day one and it is clear at least at this current point that it has been to their benefit.", "They were announced as the startup of the year in Norway in the B2B category 2019 and as previously mentioned they just picked up $25 million of Series A funding. In addition to this they have recently seemed to hire design talent to continuously work on their UX with a new update to their brand.", "Stanislas Chaillou, a master\u2019s candidate and Fulbright fellow at Harvard University wrote an article called The Advent of Architectural AI in February 2019 previously in the publication Towards Data Science. He maps out how architecture has gone through inventions and innovations. He splits it into a four-period sequence.", "Thus starting from modular grids for simplicity and affordability towards the the advent of computational design. From modules this was made further possible through computational design.", "Computational Design (1) allows a rigorous control of geometry, boosting design\u2019s reliability, feasibility and cost, (2) facilitates and eases collaboration among designers, and (3) finally enables more design iterations than traditional hand-sketching could afford. More tests & more options for better resulting designs.-Stanislas Chaillou", "Later by defining certain parameters design could be repeated, automating the manual process of implementing repetitions. Later with BIM (building information modelling), every element in a building is the function of parameters. Stanislas however argues that this parametric design ignored cultural and societal factors and proposes that this may be solved with artificial intelligence. He says:", "Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally a statistical approach to architecture. The premise of AI, that blends statistical principles with computation is a new approach that can improve over the drawbacks of parametric architecture.", "February 2019 an article in Shifter mentioned that Carl Christensen the CTO in Spacemaker AI held his lecture at MIT. It also mentioned that Spacemaker AI had five full-time employees from MIT, Harvard or Yale. With some of the foremost researchers and established industry professionals Spacemaker AI is asking whether there is a better way to design our cities.", "This is day 11 of my project #500daysofAI. I hope you enjoyed the article.", "I am challenging myself to write and think about the topic of artificial intelligence for the next 500 days with the #500daysofAI.", "This is inspired by the film 500 Days of Summer where the main character tries to figure out where a love affair went sour, and in doing so, rediscovers his true passions in life.", "If you want to read more check out some of my existing articles:", "2.
