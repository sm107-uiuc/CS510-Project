In particular don\u2019t resell or do anything illegal with Spotify data.", "2nd remark: since Spotify has an API, it\u2019s a bit stupid to get the data from the website. However this is a good exercise and you usually can get more (but slower) out of web scraping than using a restricted API (not sure that\u2019s the case for Spotify though).", "If you have missed the 1st article about Selenium and Python it\u2019s here:", "Open Chrome Developer Tools and dig into the html. Artists\u2019 names and associated url are located into a \u2018div\u2019 markup with a class equals to \u2018Search__content\u2019", "Now you need to scroll down since only 50 artists are shown. I spent quite some time here since the scroll is not on the entire window but just in the artist tab. The idea: take the last artist loaded and scroll to it.", "The login part is simple as seen in the previous article.", "The search part shouldn\u2019t be the hardest: just write something in the search bar and hit enter. There\u2019s a question about scrolling down once the search is done and how may times you\u2019ll have to scroll down. ~OK somehow", "Being exhaustive in the search seems to be the trickiest part. We can\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever get the entire list of artists on Spotify, nothing will tell us that we reached the maximum number of artists on Spotify. From this, it looks like there are between 1M and 2M artists.~OK anyhow", "We\u2019ll set the 2 guidelines for our web scraping robot:", "Another thing you want to do is set the process to execute in parallel. You don\u2019t want to wait 1 python script to do everything, but rather having multiple python scripts to do the job.", "In this case, we can set 2\u03356\u0335 4bots [UPDATE: tried 26 and my computer crashed, and also noticed that the pages stop refreshing after 5 or more windows open; I changed it to 4 bots], each starting with one different letter and trying 26 letters for the second letter. Ex: the bot 1 will try \u2018aa\u2019, \u2018ab\u2019, \u2018ac\u2019,\u2026, \u2018az\u2019. Note that 26 [4] Chrome sessions will be running my Mac (my poor Mac\u2026). Not sure if Spotify will automatically detect multiple active sessions for the same user and disconnect me [UPDATE: it doesn\u2019t care about multiple sessions]. Life is risky, sometimes you just have to go blindly and trust.", "Before creating and running the scripts, you also want to monitor in real-time how the process is going. I\u2019m not sure how to do that but I can think of seeing progress bars for all bots, the expected remaining time for them to finish, the current number of artists collected\u2026 So one more Python script will do the monitoring in real-time.", "Also estimate the time it\u2019ll take. After 1 scroll you\u2019ll wait 1 second for the results to load. So ~2 minutes/search. 26 searches x 2 minutes x 6 runs (4 bots running at the same time), so I can expect in the most optimistic scenario that the entire web scraping scheme will be finished under 3 hours.", "I have to admit I didn\u2019t finish the exercise. My computer was louder than an airport, I knew I could finish it with enough time, but anyway you get the idea.", "In 2 hours I got up to 38174 unique artists, among which AC/DC, Christina Aguilera, Rage Against The Machine, but no Rihanna nor Eminem.", "Your home for data science.
