Regardless of how desirable they appear to be, it is impossible to run experiments for all types of business questions, for various reasons.", "It could be unethical to do so. Let\u2019s say we are interested in the effect of undergraduate education on students\u2019 future earnings. It would be fundamentally wrong to randomly assign some high students to receive the education and not to others.", "Or, it could be expensive, time-consuming, or technically infeasible. Even top companies like Netflix and Airbnb can\u2019t guarantee the internal validity of randomization at the individual user level all the time.", "Under these scenarios, we have to rely on other methods, both observational and quasi-experimental designs, to derive causal effects. As an established quasi-experimental technique, Regress Discontinuity Design, RDD, has been through a long period of dormancy and comes back strong until recently.", "In this post, we elaborate on RDD\u2019s underlying constructs, such as research ideology, statistical assumptions, potential outcomes framework (POF), merits, limitations, and R illustration.", "First off, it is a quasi-experimental method with a pretest-posttest design, implying that researchers administer the measure of interest before and after the intervention (treatment).", "By setting up a \u201ccutoff\u201d point, we select the subjects slightly above the threshold line as the treatment group and the ones slightly below the line as the control group. Since these two groups are geographically close to each other, we can control potential confounding variables and treat it as an as-if random treatment assignment. If there is any difference in the potential outcome, we can attribute it to the treatment\u2019s presence.", "This \u201cas-if\u201d randomization component renders us believe RDD can derive causal inference as accurately as a Randomized Control Trial (RCT).", "Di: whether the subject has received a treatment", "Xi: forcing (aka, score or running) variable", "In plain language, subject i receives the treatment if its Xi value stands above the cutoff value.", "Hypothetically, we are interested in the causal effect of receiving a merit-based scholarship on students\u2019 future success. The main selection criterion is GPA: anyone with a GPA above 3.5 (\u22653.5) receives the scholarship, and anyone below the line doesn\u2019t get it, regardless of how close it is. In other words, there is no significant difference between students with a 3.51 GPA and the ones with a 3.49 GPA.", "Adopting an RDD framework, we can estimate the causal effects via the following steps.", "Let\u2019s look at the graphical illustration.", "D_i = 1: people who receive the scholarship (treatment group)", "D_i = 0: people who do not (control group)", "From plot 2, we can see students with the scholarship in blue and the ones without the scholarship in red.", "After fitting regression lines, we observe a discontinuity in the two regression lines. Thus, we conclude that the scholarship does make a difference.", "The conclusion is: give students more financial support!", "In its POF, RDD has the following representations:", "The estimand is the difference of two regression functions at the cutoff point c. In other words, RDD estimates the local average treatment effect, LATE, at the cutoff point, not at the individual and population levels. Some argue being able to gauge LATE is both a blessing and a shortage of an RDD. Be careful while trying to generalize the findings.", "Potential beneficiaries or any other stakeholders do not influence the assignment process. Say, students with a 3.4 GPA can\u2019t tell the admin to set the cutoff at 3.4, so he/she would be eligible.", "E[Y(0)|X=x] and E[Y(1)|X=x], are continuous in x. Also, the conditional distribution function is smooth in the covariate. This is important because we want to rule out the possibilities that other covariates cause the discontinuity (jump in the regression lines) at the cutoff point.", "This is the regression model for the above example:", "This is a visual representation of the effect as we can see the \u201cjump\u201d at the cutoff point.", "Medium recently evolved its Writer Partner Program, which supports ordinary writers like myself.
