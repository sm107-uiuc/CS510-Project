The title says it all.", "Just kidding, I\u2019ll explain the idea further, why I think it\u2019s a necessary solution to the problem, and why I feel like I needed to write this article in the first place.", "Voice assistants like Alexa, Cortana, and the Google Assistant currently seem to be able to trigger themselves if the sound that they are outputting contains their wake word or at least something close enough, due to audio feedback. I propose solving this by feeding their microphone input through a noise control algorithm that filters out the assistant\u2019s audio output.", "Have you ever been playing a podcast, the news or even music through your assistant device (Google Home, Amazon Echo, etc.) only to have it say those dreaded words \u201cOk Google\u201d/\u201cAlexa\u201d? Then you no doubt have experienced the problem I\u2019m trying to solve. Essentially, these assistants are able to tickle themselves by saying their own wake word, then responding to that wake word. Worse yet is when this happens and the wake word/phrase wasn\u2019t even said.", "Recently Amazon\u2019s Alexa team has come up with a clever approach that could partly help solve this problem, but it\u2019s not foolproof. Essentially, they created a database of fingerprints of known false positive \u201cAlexa\u201d triggers (such as Amazon commercials), then they check new triggers against this database every time it thinks someone said the wake word. If you have an Echo device and watched the recent Superb Owl handegg game, you may have noticed that the Alexa commercial surprisingly didn\u2019t drive your Echo bonkers. Additionally, Amazon created a way to scale this database automatically for 3rd party false positives by flagging wake events from multiple customers with a similar fingerprint to record them as a \u201cmedia event\u201d.", "While this should provide a noticeable improvement, this approach will not be sufficient to solve this problem entirely, especially since most of the media we consume nowadays is streaming and thus non-synchronous, so many false triggers won\u2019t happen at the same time. Furthermore, this approach involves comparing fingerprints in the cloud for all but the most predictable triggers, which increases the processing time and bandwidth used by the assistant. I applaud Amazon for implementing such a novel approach (though it\u2019s not entirely novel as I\u2019m pretty sure Google\u2019s individualized voice recognition model follows similar design patterns) even if not all-encompassing.", "True, most (if not all) voice assistant devices nowadays come with multiple microphones to detect background noise and filter it out, focusing on your voice using a noise control technique called beamforming. However, this problem is only tangential to the problem at hand. For example, the multi-mic setup is great for clearly (more or less) hearing your commands while tuning out the loud TV in the room, but when it comes to the device hearing commands when no humans nearby have said anything, this setup is not the right tool for the task.", "My proposal is simple really, so simple that I used to assume that all the major players in voice assistants were utilizing this approach. However, as I\u2019ve spent more time yelling at robots in my home to tell me the news, I\u2019ve come to realize that they either aren\u2019t doing this or if they are, they aren\u2019t doing it well. And after hearing anecdotes from plenty of other people, I know I\u2019m not the only one who makes sure to listen to my favorite tech podcasts using headphones to avoid giving my overeager AI assistant the wrong idea.", "Okay, so perhaps they\u2019re not doing this with the current generation of voice assistants, but this method has to have been proposed elsewhere by now, right? Maybe, but I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve done several searches using a variety of terms that should be relevant and using a variety of platforms from regular Google search, to Google Scholar searches, to Semantic Scholar searches. If there\u2019s a research paper, patent, blog post, or just about any other publicly accessible resource out there, then I feel like I should have found it; I usually find what I\u2019m looking for. If I missed something key, I\u2019d love to hear about it. I found plenty of resources on Active Noise Control (ANC), and plenty more on AI Voice Assistants, but the closest that I could find for this application was this paper on noise cancellation for voice assistants, but alas, the scope was limited to external noise, as discussed above for multi-mic setups: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e448/5abce7703bace8fdd3ba3e65688e1c60d827.pdf?_ga=2.71900052.669585245.1549069009-41674264.1549069009", "Active Noise Control (ANC), sometimes referred to as Active Noise Cancellation, filters out unwanted noise by recording the unwanted noise then playing back its opposite waveform (basically just the same sound shifted half a phase back in time), thus canceling out the unwanted noise while keeping the wanted noise.", "Our problem effectively boils down to audio feedback, which is where a system is picking up its own audio output within the audio input. In a live sound system like in a theatre, feedback quickly shifts into an ear-splitting screech because of a feedback loop amplifying the high frequencies. Fortunately, our voice assistants don\u2019t succumb to feedback loops because they don\u2019t immediately output their input audio, but whenever your assistant triggers itself, it is reacting to feedback. My background in A/V systems is likely why I previously assumed that this method was already widely used.", "This system should be able to be implemented completely within the software of most voice assistant systems, and thus able to be deployed with an update on current generation voice hardware such as Google Homes and Amazon Echos. Instead of using a separate external microphone as the input to the ANC filter, I propose using the audio feed that is being sent to the speaker. Since the device is generating that audio feed, we can know with 100% certainty that we don\u2019t need to use any of that audio as input. This should not only prevent feedback from accidentally triggering the assistant, but it\u2019d also help the assistant focus on the human\u2019s commands while audio is being outputted, thus making it easier to shout over your music when you want to talk to your assistant. Best of all, this approach doesn\u2019t ever require pinging the cloud for verification, unlike Amazon\u2019s approach, and shouldn\u2019t add undue processing overhead to the assistant device as ANC can be a relatively simple calculation. Just like most people are unable to tickle themselves because our brains know what inputs are being generated by our own actions, this method would make AI assistants unable to trigger themselves.", "While I wasn\u2019t able to find any evidence of this technique used for voice assistant devices, I did find this method utilized in other applications, such as feedback suppression in pro audio sound systems or speakerphones like this expired patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US6212273B1/en", "So if this is already a part of an existing AI assistant\u2019s design, I apologize for restating the obvious, but keep reading because there are a few ways to build on this idea, which I don\u2019t believe are yet developed. To the best of my knowledge, this method or anything similar is not currently being used in any AI assistants.", "One possible issue could be digitally introducing feedback if no significant acoustic feedback is being picked up by the device. Many voice assistant devices have pretty sophisticated microphone arrays and speakers designed to minimize feedback, so a simplistic implementation of this method could theoretically be adding new audio to the input if that same audio is not being picked up by the microphone loudly enough. This is due to how ANC works: simply playing back the same audio out of phase. One way to avoid this problem would be to scale the gain/volume of the output audio sent to the ANC by the level of audio coming in from the microphone input. This scaling could happen dynamically as a function of the ANC algorithm, and a baseline could be set every time that the device is powered on as a way to calibrate it for its specific acoustic environment.", "Another potential downside might be the need to retrain trigger word detection algorithms to account for the filtering of the ANC algorithm. However, from what I understand about the algorithms, they would likely be robust enough to function well under those different parameters. Plus, if they were trained with very clean audio, this filtered audio would likely be much closer to the training data.", "The holy grail of AI voice interfaces is Full Duplex Communication with the AI, where there can be overlap between the AI talking and the human talking and both parties can keep up. Current versions of voice assistants are like walkie-talkies, where if you interrupt it, it has to stop talking; this is referred to as Half Duplex. While the steps to making a voice AI that is convincingly human are much more complex than just avoiding feedback, feedback could definitely be a major stumbling block for the AI. This method should help get us there: by preventing the AI from listening to its own words.", "Additionally, while this method talks about the output from one device digitally being fed through an ANC filter, there\u2019s no reason to limit our thinking to feedback from just the same device. The assistant could potentially receive a feed of audio from any device within earshot. Say for example we didn\u2019t want the audio from a Chromecast or a Smart TV confusing our assistant, you could set up those devices to digitally send their audio feed over to the assistant for it to filter out their signals as being irrelevant or unwanted. Similar to the issue mentioned above if there is a lack of acoustic feedback, it\u2019d be crucial for the devices to all calibrate themselves in their environments. This could be accomplished by whenever one boots up, it plays a quick calibration tone, and then the assistants within earshot use that to set the appropriate levels on the ANC filter. This would solve the problem that Amazon attempts with their Alexa fingerprint database, by simply having the TV tell the assistant to ignore all audio from it, including any potential triggers.", "With the level of detail that I\u2019ve developed for this idea and my research into similar applications, I could probably successfully file for a patent. But I believe in sharing good ideas and as far as I could tell, this idea has never been shared, even though it seemed incredibly obvious to me. Plus, this should count as prior art to preempt anyone else from filing a patent for the application of internal ANC to voice assistants. I don\u2019t have the resources to execute on every idea I have, so why not put them out there and see if anyone else can benefit? I\u2019d love to hear from you if you end up using this idea or if you\u2019d like to work together on something.", "If any experts in ANC, HCI (voice), Conversational AI, or any other related field are reading who would like to explore this deeper, please let me know. I\u2019d be open to researching this further or testing it out. Perhaps I missed some key factor or work already proposing this method. If so, I\u2018d really like to find out about it.", "Also, I have a tangential idea for preventing accidental AI triggers using ultrasonic frequencies. Let me know if anyone would be interested in hearing more about it, and I\u2019d be happy to develop the idea further.", "I look forward to hearing any feedback or questions anyone has on this article or the topics discussed, either in the responses here or on social media.
