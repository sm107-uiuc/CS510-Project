The model is an image CNN that applied transfer learning from an Inception V3 model with weights pre-trained on ImageNet. The source images were scraped from multiple image search engines. The final model is capable of classifying four different cavy breeds.", "The codes and notebooks can be found here.", "This was my third project completed at Metis Data Science Bootcamp. We were learning about classifications, the respective classifiers and metrics at the time. I wanted to give image classification a shot, but not with Dogs vs Cats. Since my wife and myself are avid cavy (guinea pig) lovers, so why not apply my domain knowledge and have some fun while we are at it? And that was how the journey began\u2026", "Guinea pigs (or cavy) are commonly kept as household pets due to their manageable size (0.7\u20131.2kg), friendly nature and extreme cuteness. These cuddlies are rodents the size between a hamster and a chinchilla. They are herbivores and eat pretty much the same food as rabbits: pellets, hay, vegetables and fruits.", "According to Wikipedia, there are many breeds of cavy (13\u201318). Unlike dogs, which come in different size and shape, for cavies, it is all about the hair:", "For this project, I chose to work with four most distinctively identifiable breeds:", "For the rest of this article, you can follow me along with this Google Colab notebook. It is an abridged version of the steps I took to complete the project.", "All you have to do is to make a new subfolder called \u2018cavy_breed_clf\u2019 under your Google Drive\u2019s \u2018Colab Notebooks\u2019 folder. Copy the following notebook and folders into \u2018cavy_breed_clf\u2019 and you should be good to go.", "However, if you would like to see the full picture of how I got there, I have also sorted my scripts and notebooks in numerical order. I hope this will provide a clearer sense of the following processes: data preparation, training (classical ML, then Neural Network) and metrics/predictions.", "This was the first project where I made the effort to organize my codes and documentation based on suggestions from here and here.", "Having a lot of good, clean and the right type of data is very important. It can be the most painful part, but also the most crucial part of your ML project. It will ensure your model will perform what it is set out to do, or at least a presentable MVP. During the bootcamp, we truly learnt this lesson the hard way.", "AFAIK, there were no public cavy image dataset available for machine learning. Fortunately, there are many useful search engines out there based on this article. For me, I relied mostly on Google, Yahoo and Bing.", "I was able to scrape 500 to 1000 raw images for each breed to start off with. I depended heavily on this wonderful Chrome extension Fatkun Batch Download Image to batch download the images.", "Mind you, 1000 images per breed might sound a lot, but it was not. These were just raw and unlabeled. I had to pore through all 4000+ images during and post downloading to filter out unqualified candidates:", "Eventually, I trimmed it down to 1600+ images:", "It was a moderately imbalanced dataset, but I believed it should not impact the training of the models significantly.", "After I have collected the required images, I sorted these into the respective sub-folders. Then, I ran a short script (also as a notebook) to generate these datasets; raw, training, validation and testing. The latter three datasets would become the input data for all future ML training, validation and testing.", "A quick sanity check to ensure the breeds were distributed evenly across the datasets.", "Another check to be sure the features and targets were in good order.", "Each image file will be transformed into ML ready format by resizing it to a specific image shape (150, 150) and then flatten it to an 1-D array. These will be saved as the features (X_train, X_val, X_test).", "The breed of each image will be one-hot-encoded to become the labels (y_train, y_val, y_test).", "A quick visual sanity check to make sure it was all good:", "I decided right from the start that \u2018Random Forest\u2019 classifier would be my baseline model. Nevertheless, I took this as an learning opportunity to see how \u2018well\u2019 other classical classifiers would fare against my baseline model.", "I created a routine (Vanilla_ML_Run) to train these four classifiers together:", "Once the trained classifiers had been saved/reloaded, I compared the performances with the following:", "NB: I highly recommend reading this and this for a good grasp of PR and ROC curves. And also this on Micro-average vs Macro-average.", "Needless to say, Dummy classifier did not do very well and apparently, so was GaussianNB classifier. Precision and recall scores for \u2018Silkie\u2019 and \u2018Skinny\u2019 were pretty low. Let\u2019s take a look at \u2018Skinny\u2019 as an example:", "And the confusion matrix confirmed that understanding.", "This classifier performed much better than GaussianNB, where most precision and recall scores hovered above or near 50.", "However, the PR curve seemed to tell a clearer story that this model did not perform very well for \u2018Skinny\u2019 especially. Its area was way less ideal than others and its curve deviated furthest from the micro-average curve too.", "Random Forest appeared to be a better model than Logistic Regression, albeit just slightly. It looked like the overall higher scores were achieved at the expense of low recall scores for \u2018Silkie\u2019 and \u2018Skinny\u2019.", "The F1 scores and the PR curve indicated strongly that this model did not perform very well for the smaller classes (\u2018Silkie\u2019 and \u2018Skinny).", "Now that we had our baseline model trained and reviewed, we could proceed next with two different DL models, namely:", "Once trained, I would compare the model performances with the same metrics as before.", "The architecture was fairly straightforward for an Image CNN model, of which you could find out more about it from here.", "After training for 100 epochs, the model achieved a training accuracy of 78% and validation accuracy of 67%. It definitely was more accurate than the baseline model, but I believed it was already overfitting.", "Let\u2019s look at the classification report. The overall scores were convincingly better as compared to the baseline model. Surprisingly, \u2018Skinny\u2019 was the best performer against the rest. I didn\u2019t expect that!", "The precision and recall scores for the other breeds were interestingly uneven. The same with the PR and ROC curves too. \u2018Skinny\u2019 stood out very clearly against the other classes. It sure was cool to have trained a model capable of telling apart a hairless cavy from those with hair. :)", "This model is built using transfer learning technique as illustrated here. It uses weights pretrained on ImageNet. For this specific model, I chose to freeze the first 230 layers.", "After training for 100 epochs, the model achieved a 99 % training accuracy and 82% validation accuracy. It was definitely overfitting and the choppy, fluctuating validation curve seemed to support that as well. It could also mean that my data was still not enough.", "When I looked at the classification report, precision and recall scores were extremely good overall, except for three very specific ones. It seemed like the model tended to mislabel \u2018Abyssinian\u2019 and \u2018Silkie\u2019 as \u2018American\u2019.", "The confusion matrix also supported this observation. The model was mislabeling enthusiastically \u2018Abyssinian\u2019 (31) and \u2018Silkie\u2019 (9) as \u2018American\u2019.", "Intuitively, this made some sense. Unlike \u2018Skinny\u2019, \u2018Abyssinian\u2019 being short-haired and \u2018Silkie\u2019 being smooth-coated, both breeds could be mistaken easily for an \u2018American\u2019 when viewed from certain angles.", "NB: Of course, it could also be a simple case of badly labeled raw images. Something I would definitely want to look into to be sure.", "The InceptionV3 transfer learning model had the best scores overall.", "On top of that, it was able to brilliantly classify \u2018Skinny\u2019, where classical classifiers had generally failed (high recall). Notably, none of the models were able to confidently identify \u2018Abyssinian\u2019 as per se (low recall). Seemed like the rosette patterns unique to this breed were not that immediately obvious after all. Might need to get more quality images to improve.", "The deep learning models were able to differentiate ably between most breeds in the predictions (high precision).", "Only \u2018American\u2019 suffered similarly across all models: During predictions, these models often saw other breeds as \u2018American\u2019 (low precision). The DL models were slightly better off, but not by much.", "When we compared the PR curve of all the models together, it became clear that we had a true winner.", "Similarly, the transfer learning model led with the best ROC curve too.", "Hence, the final model trained through transfer learning was clearly the best candidate. Just for fun, I even used it to predict out of scope images kept in the subfolder \u2018/images/new_samples\u2019.", "It had been a fantastic and fun-filled project for sure. Even though I knew that transfer learning would work wonders, seeing it happened right before my eyes truly was exhilarating. This was especially encouraging when I had to work with a small dataset of mostly sub-par quality images. Can you imagine how much better the model will become if we have more data, better images?", "Also, Deep Learning models were especially \u2018clever\u2019 at being able to tell apart \u2018Skinny\u2019 from the other breeds. Something that classical classifiers could not achieve. Then again, I had not tested with other classifiers to be sure, especially XGBoost.", "And this is not the end for me. I would very much like to extend this project with the following goals:", "When the site or app is ready, I will definitely be sharing this with other cavy lovers on social media.", "Thank you for reading this and I hope you have enjoyed as much as I do!", "Your home for data science.
