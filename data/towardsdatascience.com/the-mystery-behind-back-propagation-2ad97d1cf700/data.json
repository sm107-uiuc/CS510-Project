As mentioned in my posts on drug-kinase interaction, fastai is a very useful deep learning library that can get you started in few lines of code. In order to make the most use of its flexibility, however, a deeper understanding of the mathematics behind the scene is necessary. fastai\u2019s deep learning course does a great job demystifying the black box of neural network. It demonstrated how to build a deep learning library from scratch. As an aside, it is also an excellent showcase of good software engineering practices in the context of scientific computation. Coming from a background in science, I am sometimes frustrated by the lack of proper training in software engineering and the scarcity of useful resources adapted for application in science.", "Back to the problem I am trying to discuss here. A neural network is nothing but a model that can be optimized to make predictions. The process of optimization, or learning, is the tuning of the model parameters so that the prediction error is minimized. The optimization process is based on gradient descent. Simply put, if the error goes up when a model parameter increases, we should decreases the model parameter to some extent, and vice versa. So the heart of the problem is to calculate how the error changes with a change in the model parameters.", "Here is a typical depiction of a neural network. It takes an input (a three-element vector in this case), calculates the output (a two-element vector) by first calculating the hidden layer (a four-element vector). The value of each hidden element depends on every input element, and the value of each output element depends on every hidden element.", "There are generally two kinds of relationship involved in modern neural network \u2014 linear and nonlinear. Take the value of a hidden element as an example. First, a \u201cweighted\u201d sum of the values of all elements from the previous layer plus a constant \u201cbias\u201d is calculated. The sum then goes through a nonlinear transformation to provide the value of the hidden element. We need a way to calculate how the output value changes with respect to a change in the \u201cweights\u201d and \u201cbiases\u201d in the linear transformations invoked in all layers. This is the problem.", "Given the complicated connectivity among the \u201cneurons\u201d, a brute-force evaluation of the derivative seems very difficult. People always claim the solution is based on nothing other than the well-known chain rule in calculus. Indeed it takes less than a page to derive it as shown in wikipedia. Its key implementation is also surprisingly simple as shown below (copied from deep learning class). Notice that no external routines are called, so that\u2019s all there is.", "But, at least for me, it\u2019s been very hard to go from the mathematical derivation to the actual code. It\u2019s possible to understand the end result, but not clear how people reached there in the first place. In an attempt to reconstruct the thought process that is accessible to me, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of back propagation. Of course, this is not likely to be the actual mental exercise the pioneers undertook to discover back propagation, but their experience may not be digestible by someone with my background.", "The thought process I will describe below involves three steps. The idea is to decompose the problem so that every step is manageable and also non-trivial. In this way, the hurdle is lowered for every step without compromising its total achievement.", "Let\u2019s consider a three-layer neural network with a single neuron for each layer. Taking an input, the first layer performs a simple linear transformation, the second layer is a commonly used non-linear transformation which outputs zero for anything negative and does nothing otherwise, and a second linear transformation provides the output. The cost of the model is simply the square error between the output and the target value. This process, i.e., calculating output value from input value, is called the forward pass.", "We would like to calculate the change of cost with respective to the model parameters, namely w\u2019s and b\u2019s. Here comes the chain rule. The model parameters affect the cost through the y\u2019s. For example,", "The simplification of the second step is due to the use of linear model. This relation suggests that we need to calculate and keep track of the derivative of the cost with respective to all the y\u2019s. Fortunately, the effect of y on cost is also transmitted in a linear fashion from the input to the output, allowing the consecutive of use of chain rule. For our simple model, the derivatives are summarized below.", "Suppose we want to calculate the derivative with respective to w1, then we need to know the derivative with respect to y1, which depends on the derivative with respect to y2, which depends on the derivative with respect to y3, which is known. To calculate all the derivatives with respect to w\u2019s and b\u2019s, it makes sense to save all the derivatives with respect to y\u2019s because they may be used multiple times. In our simple model, the derivative with respect to y3 is used four times and only one calculation is actually needed. In practice, for each layer of the model, we calculate the derivative with respect to its input variable, and the result is used for the calculation of derivatives in the previous layer. To jump start this recursion in the first place, we start with the derivative with respect to the output. Because we start from the output and go back toward the input, this process is called back propagation or backward pass.", "When calculating the derivatives, we also need to know the y\u2019s which has been obtained during the forward pass.", "Now we can summarized the important tricks that enable the feasible implementation of back propagation.", "It should be noted that ReLu is considered a separate layer to make things more clear. Although it is nonlinear, it is conceptually simpler than the linear layer. Normally, linear layers introduce sophisticated interconnections between neurons of different layers, but ReLu only takes the value of a single neuron as input.", "It\u2019s now straightfoward to propose a pattern of how the various derivatives are calculated for a linear layer. The next step would be to extend it to multiple neurons and then multiple samples.", "It was established above that the derivatives can be calculated in a layer-by-layer fashion. It is also obvious that the nonlinear layer is straightforward to process as long as a well-behaving function such as ReLu or sigmoid is chosen. We only need to consider a single linear layer and figure out the derivatives with respect to input, w\u2019s and b\u2019s, since the derivative with respect to output is already available.", "In particular, we consider an input layer and an output layer with different number of neurons. The value of each neuron in the output layer is determined by the weighted sum of all neurons in the input layer plus a bias. As illustrated below, the relationship is formally similar to the case of a single neuron, but the y\u2019s become vectors, w becomes a matrix and b a vector. As a result, we need a tool to extend the chain rule from single variable to multi-variable. There are multiple ways to do it, and I will use Einstein notation in this post. Einstein notation is widely used in physics when tensors play important roles, such as fluid mechanics and general relativity. It\u2019s amazing for me to see its use in machine learning.", "The linear model, written in component format using Einstein notation, is as follows", "The derivatives can be obtained in a straightforward way using chain rule. Remember we want to take advantage of the fact that the derivative with respect to the output layer is known. The equation might look scary, but it follows well established routines. Our purpose is to write the derivative with respect to the components in a format that can can be cast back to vectors or matrices.", "Going back to the vector format in which the derivative with respect to components is collectively denoted as the gradient vector or tensor,", "In terms of input, output and model parameters, the result is", "Except for the higher dimensions, it follows the same pattern observed in step 1.", "The last step is to consider the case of multiple samples. For each layer, the input and output are a collect of vectors from each sample. The cost function is simply the sum of square error of each sample. This extension can be realized by extending the input/output vectors to matrices. The gradients almost retain the same form after the growth of dimension due to multiple samples. The gradient formula are reproduced below with their dimensions specified as subscripts. Here sample size is denoted as S.", "These expression can be readily converted to actual code.", "At this point, we have accomplished the task \u2014 calculate how the cost function changes with respect to model parameters. By taking three steps, it is now easier to understand how the seemingly simple code implementation could be reached from mathematics.", "It should be emphasized that step 1 contains the most critical insight in back propagation. Step 2 and 3 are routine extension of dimensions. When back propagation was first introduced, its performance deteriorates very quickly with the increase of network depth (number of layers). One of the causes is vanishing or exploding gradient issue. By inspecting the diagram in step 1, this issue can be explained in an intuitive way. In fact, as the depth increases, the derivative with respect to earlier model parameters is the product of many derivatives. It is not surprising that the gradient could be very small or very large, preventing proper training of model parameters.", "At the beginning, I set the goal to be the reconstruction of the thought process of the inventors of back propagation. They probably worked out the problem by skipping the first two steps because of their intimacy with the math tools. But for me I found this 3-step approach very valuable. With more complex network architecture, it is probably still more instructive to work out a simple problem such as the one in step 1 before attempting to tackle the problem in full dimension. This 3-step approach also resembles the code-refactoring process. It could serve as one version of the evolution history of back propagation algorithm. Just as a piece of clever code may have been through quite dramatic refactoring steps, a beautiful equation must have been through multiple refinement steps. Isn\u2019t it more inspirational to follow how it all started from a humble beginning?", "Step 2 and 3 are well-known techniques in vector calculus. In fact, the exercise with Einstein notation in step 2 essentially proves some of the useful formula in vector calculus. Personally I have learnt this at least two times in different settings, but revisiting it still offered me some useful insight I was not aware of. For example, how to make sense of the chain rule in multiple dimensions? Going through the derivation in step 2 every time will undoubtedly distract us from thinking about more important issues. While writing the post, I realized that the growth of dimension comes very naturally. Take a particular layer as an example, the following shows how to grow the dimensions from a scalar to a matrix.", "In order for the dimensions match on both sides of the equation, transpose operation needs to be applied and the order of multiplication may need to be adjusted. Of course, this is not a \u201cproof\u201d, but it surely can speed up our thoughts. The input/output variables were assumed to be row vectors. If they are column vectors, similar reasoning also applies.", "Looking at the steps, one could see a lot of familiar operations from other fields. For example, the linear dependence of an element of the output layer on every element of the input layer is essentially a transformation of coordinate system. Normally, an input layer is transformed to a hidden layer of larger size and probably a few other hidden layers of even greater size. This suggests that we try to decompose the input, which is the tangible part of the problem, into higher dimensional space. The hidden layer is thus similar to the hidden variable theory in quantum mechanics. The higher dimensional space is not a black box after a successful training period; instead, it is expected to reveal subtle relations not captured by the input layer but already buried in the training samples (see my previous posts on the prediction of drug-protein interaction).", "As a final note, I hope this exercise can help someone trying to get a sense of back propagation."],
