Some of the most popular options include limiting data to avoid processing outliers that could throw off your predictions or removing bad features that aren\u2019t consistently effective in predicting your target. The most common and easiest way to increase training accuracy when solving a continuous problem, however, is most likely to scale the features that are used to train the model in the first place. This is because the advantages that come from scaling features also comes with very little overhead, and is incredibly easy to implement. It\u2019s easy to see why so many people choose to utilize a feature scaler for their continuous problems by simply weighing the benefits of doing so:", "Typically, whenever we are discussing continuous scalers, we are talking about using a normal distribution. Also called the Standard Scaler, this is a relatively straightforward, yet effective way of producing simplified data that statistics can better understand by passing samples through a formula. While the Standard Scaler is certainly the most used in machine-learning, it\u2019s important not to forget that there are several different scalers that all have their place in the statistical world. Among the others in the list of scalers is the arbitrary scaler and the mean normalization scaler. While these are all great examples of scalers, they aren\u2019t typically used to boost the accuracy of a machine-learning model.", "With so many great pre-processing methods, encoders, and various options to approach image processing, it seems a little odd that nearly all continuous solutions end up being produced with the exact same Standard Scaler. If there is a handful of scalers that can be used on data-sets, then are any others worth investing in? Is there another way to scale your features that could improve accuracy even further potentially?", "Scientists, data-nerds, and machine-learning enthusiasts; I introduce you to", "The unit length scaler is another feature scaler that can be used in machine-learning. While typically rescalers, arbitrary-rescalers, and mean normalizers take a back-set to standardization, the unit-length scaler stands on its own in the machine-learning world. Thought it might not be nearly as frequently used as the standard scaler, today I wanted to investigate why that is, and as to whether or not we should be using it more.", "A unit length scaler scales your feature\u2019s vector so that the length of said vector is one. That being said, typical applications will include the use of euclidian distance. In some applications, however, it can be more practical to use the L subscript 1 norm. This is especially important if in the following learning steps the scalar metric is used as a distance measure.", "A big reason why a technology may or may not be successful is its implementation. Unfortunately, implementations of a unit-length scaler are not very commonly found, and thus Sklearn surprisingly doesn\u2019t contain one. Most, if not all feature scalers in the Sklearn module are variance, mean, or standard scalers \u2014 which are in a way all the same thing but slightly different. These observations lack the inherently different calculation method of using vector distance, rather than informational statistics about the data.", "On the Julia side of things, as you might have expected, things don\u2019t get very much better. Throughout all of the pre-processing libraries like MLDataUtils and Scalers, there is not even a slight mention of the unit length scaler. Fortunately for Julia-based scientists, however, Lathe 0.1.2 features an implementation of this scaler inside of Lathe.preprocess. Aside from this specific instance, however, if you wanted to use this scaler, then it\u2019s likely that you would be doing it from scratch.", "In order to implement the scaler, we\u2019re first going to need to make a function to calculate the euclidian distance of a vector. To do this, you simply take the norm of two arrays and subtract them. I am going to be using the norm method from Julia\u2019s LinearAlgebra package for this task:", "Due to Julia\u2019s amazing syntax, I was able to use a syntactical expression. In Python you could do essentially the same using numpy.linalg.norm.", "Moving on and following the Lathe standard of syntax and object composition, I created a little function to handle the creation of our type.", "The first thing we are going to need to add to this function is the zeroes of our array. Since the array input in this function is meant to be 1-dimensional, and typical of a regular list instead of a matrix, we can just go about this by writing a for loop.", "Next, we\u2019ll plug the zeroes and our data into the euclidian length function like so:", "Finally, the formula for unit length is", "So we\u2019ll plug that into our for loop, like so:", "And now we will wrap that method into an object and have a completed unit length scaler.", "Feature scaling is one of those essential Data Science things that often gets brushed over because it is relatively basic in most cases. Usually, it is easy to fall into the routine of standardly scaling everything and moving on with your day. Fortunately, like most things in the field, even feature scaling can be developed, experimented with, and improved. I have tested this scaler a little bit, but only to very mixed results. Sometimes losing accuracy, and occasionally resulting in an accuracy just above what I might get with a standard scaler. It seems to be very hit or miss from what I can gather. Regardless, it certainly is a cool thing that I think more people should learn about!", "Your home for data science.
