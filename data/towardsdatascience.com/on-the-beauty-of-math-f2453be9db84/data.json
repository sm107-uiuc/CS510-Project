Euler was one of the greatest mathematicians in history. His prolificness is the stuff of legend, and his collected works fill 92 massive volumes. Pierre-Simon de Laplace asserted Euler\u2019s impact on mathematics when he famously stated:", "\u201cRead Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.\u201d", "The Basel problem, first posed in 1650, by the Italian mathematician Pietro Mengoli, was solved by Euler in 1734, bringing him instant recognition. The problem asks for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers:", "Many influential mathematicians tried to find a formula for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares. Two of the co-inventors of the calculus, John Wallis and the great Gottfried Leibniz, are among those who tried and met with failure. Euler solved it when he was still as a young man (he was 28), and the mathematical nature of his answer surprised the mathematical community. His first proof (he provided several others afterward) was by no means rigorous, but its beauty, simplicity, and originality are astonishing.", "Euler brilliant insight was to write down the sinc(\u03c0x) function", "as a product over its zeros.", "To understand that, consider, for example, the following quartic polynomial written as a product over its zeros:", "Multiplying the expression out we obtain:", "Euler\u2019s strategy was to apply the same kind of expansion to transcendental functions.", "A function of this kind does not satisfy a polynomial equation such as Eq. 4. The exponential function, the trigonometric functions, and the logarithmic function are three well-known examples.", "The sinc(\u03c0x) function has the following roots:", "Euler proceeded to write sinc(x) in the same way as f(x) in Eq. 3. Using the basic mathematical identity", "and since for each root in Eq. 5 there is a corresponding negative one he was able to write:", "The next step was to multiply out the terms in Eq. 6 but focus only on the quadratic one:", "Taylor series are representations of functions as infinite sums of terms. Each term is calculated from the values of the derivatives of the function at one single point (see this link for more details).", "The seven Taylor series shown in Fig. 6 have the following algebraic form:", "The Taylor expansion of the sinc(x) function is:", "One can think of Eq. 8 as a \u201cpseudo-polynomial\u201d with an infinite degree. Such pseudo-polynomial has infinite roots. The roots are given in Eq. 5.", "Comparing Eq. 7 and Eq. 9 we arrive at the result we were aiming for:", "As a bonus, Euler\u2019s derivation gives us the well-known Wallis\u2019s product. Just substitute x = 1/2 in Eq. 6 and invert it. We obtain:", "In this final section, we will see how to obtain a rigorous proof of Euler\u2019s result (the author of this proof is Daniel P. Giesy). Consider the function:", "(which is usually written in a different form). One then defines the number E(n) and calculates it, integrating the expression after the second equality of Eq. 11:", "It is clear that the sum on the right-hand side is zero for k even. Hence one can substitute k by (2k-1) and consider only terms where the subindex of E is odd:", "Now, to finish the proof, one needs to demonstrate that this expression vanishes. Since this demonstration is quite laborious and not very illuminating, it will be omitted.
