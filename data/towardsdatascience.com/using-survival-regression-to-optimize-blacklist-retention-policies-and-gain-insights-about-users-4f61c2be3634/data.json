Luckily, when enough usage data is available, it is usually not too hard to find out that something is strange or out of the ordinary with how a certain user \u201cbehaves\u201d. However, it is often no less of a challenge to decide exactly how to respond to such a find.", "In most scenarios, the best way to go is simply to blacklist or block the suspicious user (either by blocking its IP address, session, device, account, etc). Yet, users sometimes cannot just be blacklisted until further notice, and the next question that the security admin will have to answer is \u201cfor how long should we blacklist suspicious users?\u201d, \u201chow do we make sure we choose the right blocking time duration?\u201d, and \u201chow do we test ourselves?\u201d That is especially true when the attacker is abusing the device or IP address of a legitimate user. Typically, such questions regarding maintenance and retention policies of blacklists, are answered using quite a bit of intuition and assumption-making \u2014 which is perfectly fine when the person that is using her intuition and making assumptions is sufficiently experienced.", "In this post, I shall propose a more robust approach to this problem that requires less reliance on intuition and much more data. My approach is based on a methodology or statistical tool known as survival analysis or \u2018time-to-event\u2019 analysis. Although I shall focus on how survival analysis can help us deal with a very specific problem, I believe that this approach and, more importantly, the tools presented here can be valuable in a variety of contexts and similar problems.", "Survival analysis is mostly used by researchers and scientists in order to estimate the chance of a certain \u201cdeath\u201d event occurring at a given time. It has been traditionally used to compare or determine the survival rate of different populations over time given certain circumstances or to answer questions, such as \u201cwhat are the chances that the patient will survive for 3 more years given a certain treatment\u201d or \u201chow many people are likely to survive 10 years after diagnosed with X\u201d.", "However, survival analysis was also used to estimate the chances of other kinds of death-like events. Survival analysis was used to estimate how much time users are likely to spend on a website before they leave, how long an engine will keep on going after a certain malfunction has been discovered, or how long governments \u201csurvive\u201d under different kinds of political regimes.", "The analysis presented in the chart above, for example, describes a survival curve showing that non-democratic regimes are more likely to \u201csurvive\u201d more than 20 years in power comparing to democratic regimes which on average barely last more than 10.", "Survival analysis is a huge topic but I prefer to cite a few good intro sources below and move on to show how it can help us resolve the problem addressed here. However, before we move on, there is just one concept that is important to explain about survival analysis in this context or, more accurately, about the form data that it is usually based on.", "One of the main problems that drive scientists to use survival analysis is that their data is Censored. Suppose that we are trying to estimate the life duration of a certain kind of tree before it gets too big and collapses. Suppose, also, that we have a dataset that consists of 1000 trees that we are monitoring countrywide. Now, suppose that only 50% of the trees in our data set have collapsed and the rest 500 are still standing. How should we account for these trees? Can we report their life duration before we know its end? Should we exclude these trees from our data set because we don't know anything about their expected lifespan? Our data, in other words, is right-censored \u2014 we know where it begins (on the right side of the chart) but we don't necessarily know where at least some of it ends. I'm not going to get into the theory here (you can use one of the excellent sources cited below for this), but one of the main purposes of survival estimators is exactly to account for this kind of data. Otherwise, survival analysis would have been a simpler task.", "Therefore, any survival analysis estimator requires at least 2 variables or features: (1) Duration (e.g., how long the tree is or was standing before it collapses); and (2) Event (whether the \u201cdeath\u201d event has already occurred \u2014 whether the tree has already collapsed). This will be clearer shortly.", "So suppose that we have a web application that is often the target of bots or automated attacks. Luckily, we know how to identify requests that are generated by non-humans and malicious users and we can easily block the devices or addresses that generate them. However, we also know that these devices or addresses are also used by real users, and therefore we want to block them for as little time as we can. Our security adviser recommends setting the retention policy of our blacklist to 14 days, after which the devices will not be blocked anymore, as this is a pattern that her experience shows to be quite common. Can we test this?", "I believe that we can and that survival analysis is a very good tool for this job. Assuming that we have the required data, we can use survival analysis to estimate how long these devices or addresses will be taken over by evil users before they stop generating non-human malicious requests. If our security expert is right, then after 14 days, we should be safe to reactivate the devices or addresses that we have blacklisted when we detect they generate non-human or malicious requests.", "The data that we have consists of aggregated stats of devices or addresses that were first observed about 25 days ago as behaving in a non-human manner. Two features are of particular interest to us here: days_with_bad_req, which records the number of days that the devices or addresses generated requests that we identify as non-human, and a variable named event, which tells us whether the device or address has stopped generating non-human requests or whether the \u201cattack\u201d still ongoing. We treat an address or device as one that has \u201cdied\u201d or stopped generating non-human requests when it has been more than 10 days since it made any request. So, if someone took over my IP address and generated \u201cbad\u201d requests for 6 days and then disappeared for 14 days, my address will have days_with_bad_req = 6 and event = 1. If he took over my IP yesterday and still using it to attack the site then it will have days_with_bad_req = 2 and event = 0.", "There are 2 more interesting features here that we will use later on: req_day records the numbers of requests that this device or address generates per day which suppose to give us some measurements on the intensity of its activity. bad_req_days_rate is a feature that tells us the % of the time (days) that this device or address creates non-human traffic (i.e. whether or not it is exclusively used to generate malicious requests).", "A first look at the data shows that malicious users actually operate for a much shorter time than 14 days, though remember that some of the numbers that are reported here might be of attacks that are still ongoing.", "We will first confirm this claim using a KaplanMeierFitter. KM is probably the most popular univariate survival analysis estimator and the Lifeline library version is extremely easy to use and has very useful plotting functions that can immediately give us some insights. Note the only 2 variables it requires: the duration variable \u2014 which for us is the number of days in which the device or address created non-human requests, and the event variable \u2014 which in our case is equal to whether the attack by the device or address is ongoing or whether it is considered done (i.e., it has been more than 10 days since its last activity).", "The chart that was plotted by the KM fitter shows that more than half of the malicious users will stop their attacks after 2 days of activity and about 90% of the attackers will be gone by the end of day 5.", "The Lifeline library actually has an extremely useful function named percentile() which can easily help us further interpret the survival curve and determine the required boundaries. The percentile() function can take just one param which is the required the percentile so that, for example, percentile(0.1) will give us the point in time in which 90% of the population will be \u2018dead\u2019 \u2014 recall that we use survival analysis to estimate the \u2018time to death\u2019 event.", "Let\u2019s take a few useful percentiles to get a better idea of how our survival curve looks like.", "Well, that certainly confirms the intuitions of our security expert as the point in time past which no member of the population is likely to reach is 14 days. However, if it is really important for us to remove addresses or devices from our blacklist as soon as possible, then our analysis shows that we can also set the retention time for just 10 days to avoid about 99% of the malicious non-human requests.", "We can also confirm this using the predict() method which takes as a param the number of days for which we want to estimate the survival chances.", "In most cases, it will be sufficient to use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to get the required insight, but sometimes we might need (or want) to make more accurate estimations. For example, suppose that we have good reasons to believe that non-human actors that operate more aggressively are also likely to be gone sooner. As mentioned earlier, we have another feature named bad_req_days_rate which tells us the percentage of the days in which the device or address is used to generate malicious non-human activity. We want to check how a change in this feature (and others) change our survival function.", "The Lifelines library provides another very useful estimator named CoxPHFitter, which is also a very popular estimator that is used for survival regression. Unlike univariate estimators like the KMF, survival regression estimators let us add more covariates into our analysis and regress them against the duration. So let's add the feature bad_req_days_rate into our model together with the feature req_day which records the general pace or velocity in which the user, address, or device operates by counting how many requests (any request) it generates every day.", "This summary tells us a lot of things that it will take a textbook to explain, but note a few important points: Although the p-value of both features is statistically significant (it is smaller than 0.05), the Concordance score of our model is not very impressive, which means that our model (the covariates that we choose) will not predict well the resulting life duration we want to estimate. This usually means that we need to rethink the structure of our model or even our data. However, I will ignore this for now for the sake of explanation.", "The second important thing to note is the values of our two features under the exp(coef) column, which is the main value we use to interpret our model. The variable req_day has an exp(coef) = 0.89, which means that one unit increase in req_day will decrease the \u2018hazard\u2019 of death and thus increase the chance that the device or address will survive over time in about 11%. On the other hand, our second parameter, bad_req_days_rate has a positive (or > 1.0) exp(coef) \u2014 1.04. This means that one unit increase in bad_req_days_rate (e.g. a device that makes bad requests in %51 rather than 50% of its active days) will increase the hazard of death and thus decrease the chance that the user will continue making bad req over time in 4%.", "In other words, as we hypothesized, a more aggressive attack lasts for a shorter period of time. We can actually use the CoxPHFitter to visualize this with the plot_covariate_groups() method.", "This shows us the survival function of users that have bad_req_days_rate of 75% and 100%. As expected, users that launch a much more focused attack \u201csurvive\u201d less or die sooner.", "We can also see this by using the predict_survival_function(). The code below shows this by creating two users that have just one difference in their bad_req_days_rate \u2014 one has 80% and the other has 95%.", "Conclusion: This was aimed to be a rather short and insightful introduction to survival analysis, which I was hoping to present as a powerful tool that enables us to gain interesting insights into important aspects of our data about users\u2019 activity. Although this is just one (interesting) use case, I tried to make this simple enough to be easily used in other contexts.", "[2] SciKit-Survival is a different survival analysis python library than the one I use but a fantastic resource.", "[2] A few more good sources here, here .
