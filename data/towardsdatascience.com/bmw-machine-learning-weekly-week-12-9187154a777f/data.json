The AI system was trained using radio signals and video footage of people moving around. This made it possible to generate stick figures showing what people were doing behind a wall using a neural network. The system can also distinguish between different people reliably. The team says that project \u201cRF-Pose\u201d could be used to monitor diseases like Parkinson\u2019s, multiple sclerosis (MS), and muscular dystrophy, providing a better understanding of disease progression and allowing doctors to adjust medications accordingly. It could also help elderly people live more independently, while providing the added security of monitoring for falls, injuries and changes in activity patterns. The team is currently working with doctors to explore RF-Pose\u2019s applications in health care.", "\u201cEye in the Sky\u201d is a research project from the University of Cambridge and India\u2019s National Institute of Technology and the Institute of Science that uses drones to spot violence in crowds. The drone utilized is a standard Parrot AR 2.0 with its camera providing an AI-infused ScatterNet platform with the requisite live footage to work with. ScatterNet\u2019s deep learning network takes it from there: it can effectively estimate the pose for each detected human. Once it does that, it can distinguish between potentially violent subjects in the frame, and those simply moving normally within the crowd. The project is still very much in its early stages, as the accuracy of detection is reportedly substantially affected with each additional crowd member. While this system claims it can identify a violent individual in a group of 10 with over 94 percent accuracy, that drops to 90.6 percent once there are two such individuals in the crowd, and 84 percent if there are five.", "One of the curious properties of mathematics is its beauty. But exactly what mathematicians mean by beauty is hard to capture. Perhaps the most famous example is Euler\u2019s relation, ei\u03c0 + 1 = 0, which reveals a deep link between seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics. Other fascinating integer sequences include prime numbers, numbers that can be divided only by themselves and 1; or the Fibonacci sequence, in which each term is the sum of the previous two terms. And that points to another component of mathematical beauty: Mathematical patterns must be interesting in some way. Recognizing these interesting patterns has always been a uniquely human capability. But in recent years, machines have become hugely capable pattern-recognition tools. Indeed, they have begun to outperform humans in face recognition, object recognition, and a variety of game-playing roles as well. And that raises an interesting possibility: Can machine-learning algorithms identify interesting or elegant patterns in mathematics? Could they even be arbiters of mathematical beauty?", "The world\u2019s most influential synthetic biologist, George Church of Harvard Medical School, is behind a new company that plans to rejuvenate dogs using gene therapy. If it works, he plans to try the same approach in people, and he might one of the first to volunteer. The company, which has carried out preliminary tests on beagles, claims it will make animals \u201cyounger\u201d by adding new DNA instructions to their bodies. Its age-reversal plans build on tantalizing clues seen in simple organisms like worms and flies. Tweaking their genes can increase their life spans by double or better. Other research has shown that giving old mice blood transfusions from young ones can restore some biomarkers to youthful levels. \u201cWe have already done a bunch of trials in mice and we are doing some in dogs, and then we\u2019ll move on to humans,\u201d Church told the podcaster Rob Reidearlier this year. The company\u2019s other founders, CEO Daniel Oliver and science lead Noah Davidsohn, a postdoc in Church\u2019s sprawling Boston lab, declined to be interviewed for the article.", "Your home for data science.
