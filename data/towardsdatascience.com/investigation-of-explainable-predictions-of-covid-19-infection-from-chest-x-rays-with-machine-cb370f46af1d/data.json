This infectious disease poses serious threats to the public health and economies of nations. The number of cases in Canada and around the world has been growing exponentially. Researchers have accepted the call to action and are attempting to learn more about SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In an attempt to support these efforts, machine learning researchers are using their skill sets to uncover more information about the virus. For example, researchers developed the COVNet framework based on ResNet50 to differentiate CT scans of COVID-19 cases from other types of community acquired pneumonia [1].", "This article chronicles an experiment in applying machine learning methods to search for an interpretable model to distinguish cases of pneumonia related to COVID-19 based on chest X-rays (CXR). Although machine learning may be helpful for this problem, any predictions made by a model (no matter how successful) will be scrutinized by healthcare providers. It is imperative that explanations be provided for the model\u2019s predictions. It is our hope that interpretable machine learning models will positively contribute to the growing body of knowledge on COVID-19.", "Since reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits are in limited supply, there exists a need to explore alternative means of identifying and prioritizing suspected cases of COVID-19. In our City of London, Canada, turnaround time for COVID-19 test results is currently reported as 24 hours [2]. It is possible that this turnaround time is even greater in rural and remote regions. CT scans, despite being used to contribute to the clinical workup of patients suspected for COVID-19, are costly. Therefore, smaller centres may have limited access to CT scanners. X-ray machines are more affordable and can be portable and therefore a viable alternative.", "To be clear, this article does not claim that CXRs should be relied on in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Direction from the Canadian Association of Radiologists recommend following the CDC\u2019s guidelines that state that CXR and CT should not be used to diagnose COVID-19 [3]. The recommendations state that viral testing is currently the only means to diagnose COVID-19, even if a patient has suggestive features on CXR or CT. That being said, some research has suggested that radiological imaging (CT in particular) may be just as sensitive as RT-PCR [4]. Such findings exhibit why we\u2019ve decided to explore this avenue and build open source tools to enable further investigation. It is also important to note that normal imaging does not imply that a patient has not been infected by SARS-CoV-2, only that they aren\u2019t showing signs of COVID-19 respiratory disease.", "For the purpose of this experiment, data was taken from two repositories:", "At the time of writing this article, the first dataset contains 76 posteroanterior (PA) CXR images from patients who have tested positive for COVID-19. It also contains some CXRs of patients with alternative findings (such as SARS). The second dataset was included to increase the amount of data available to improve the discerning capabilities of our classifier. Not only does the second dataset contain normal CXRs, but it also has several CXRs of patients with pneumonias. Care was exercised in selecting only PA CXRs from both of these datasets. Although both datasets also contain anteroposterior (AP) CXRs, we hypothesized that including both may unduly influence model predictions. As described by Bell, Jones et. al., disadvantages of AP CXRs include differences in appearance of structures compared to PA CXRs [7].", "Prior to training, data from both datasets were amalgamated into one large dataset consisting of approximately 1000 images. We would ideally like to train on a larger dataset, but we are wary of creating too heavy of a class imbalance. The dataset consisted of a Pandas DataFrame that contains file names and associated labels. The dataset was then split randomly into training, validation and test sets, taking care to keep the class proportions constant among these sets.", "Prior to training, preprocessing was implemented on the images themselves. ImageDataGenerator (from tensorflow.keras) was employed to perform preprocessing of image batches prior to training. The following transformations were applied to images:", "We first considered a binary classification problem where the goal was to detect whether an X-ray shows evidence of COVID-19 infection. The classifier was to assign X-ray images to either a non-COVID-19 class or a COVID-19 class. A deep convolutional neural network architecture was trained to perform binary classification. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. All training code was written using TensorFlow 2.0.", "After numerous iterations, we arrived at a deep convolutional neural network architecture that employs residual connections. Due to the immediacy of the COVID-19 threat, an exhaustive hyperparameter search will be conducted after the release of this article. Additionally, the size of the network is limited so as to fit within average GPU hardware resources, but improved metrics are expected upon scaling up the size of the network to capitalize on larger compute availability. Future work will endeavour to train a well-known residual network (e.g. ResNet50) and capitalize on transfer learning from pre-trained weights. Figure 2 summarizes the architecture of the binary classifier.", "We applied multiple strategies to combat overfitting, such as L2 weight regularization, dropout regularization and data augmentation (rotation of training set images by up to 10\u00b0).", "Due to the scarcity of publicly available CXRs of severe COVID-19 cases, we were compelled to apply class imbalancing methods to mitigate the effects of having one class outweighing several others. If you are versed in machine learning, you know that accuracy can be misleadingly high in classification problems when a class is underrepresented. We were left with a dilemma, as we also did not want to limit our training data to only 76 non-COVID-19 examples, as there would have been about 150 images total. Consequently, we applied class weighting to penalize the model significantly more when it misclassified a positive example. Class weights were initially calculated solely from proportion in the dataset. The results were not satisfactory. As a result, we gave the user an option in the configuration file of our project to more heavily weigh the underrepresented class (in addition to the calculated weights). This intervention increased our precision and recall metrics to acceptable values for a prototype.", "Training metrics were visualized in TensorBoard once a training experiment was complete. See Figure 3a for an example of the training and validation loss vs. epoch.", "Results on the test set are reported Figure 3b. Note that the test set contains less than 100 images and only 8 of them are in the COVID-19 class. Figures 3c and 3d display a confusion matrix and ROC curve respectively.", "Although binary classification is informative for determining whether COVID-19 CXRs may have any sort of distinguishable pattern, it is more applicable to separate severe cases of COVID-19 from other pneumonias (particularly other viral pneumonias). Our goal here was to develop a model that could sort a CXR image into one of the following classes: normal, pneumonia, or COVID-19 infection. We repeated the same data preprocessing techniques as described earlier in the article. The model architecture was very similar to that of our binary classifier, with the exception of having a fully connected layer with 3 nodes at the end (1 for each class).", "Training metrics were visualized in TensorBoard once a training experiment was complete. See Figure 4a for an example of the training and validation loss vs. epoch.", "Results on the test set are reported Figure 4b. Binary metrics (i.e. precision, recall, F1 Score) are reported for the class corresponding to COVID-19 infection. Figures 4c and 4d display a confusion matrix and ROC curve respectively for the COVID-19 class. Although the model identified most of the COVID-19 cases, one can see that the accuracy of this model was significantly lower. Low overall accuracy implies that the multi-class model learned to distinguish the COVID-19 class from the \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cother pneumonia\u201d classes better than it learned to distinguish the \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cother pneumonia\u201d classes from each other. Future versions of this model must find better balance in class weighting during training to ensure that the other classes remain distinct.", "As mentioned earlier in this article, it is imperative that this model be interpretable. Deep convolutional neural networks are not inherently interpretable; rather, they are considered to be \u201cblack boxes\u201d. According to an international statement on the ethics of artificial intelligence in radiology, \u201ctransparency, interpretability, and explainability are necessary to build patient and provider trust\u201d [8]. Clinicians are not likely to put all their trust in the predictions of an algorithm, nor should they. By providing explanations for why our model predicts COVID-19 infection or lack thereof, any researchers or clinicians interested in improving this system may gain an appreciation of why the model makes a particular decision. For now, we employed the LIME algorithm [9] to generate explanations for model predictions.", "Not only is it ethically responsible to pursue explainable machine learning models, it is also informative to researchers to ensure that there is no data leakage or unintended bias in the model. We are glad that we explored explainability methods, as we noticed multiple sources of possible data leakage in our model and in the approaches of others in the data science community.", "We used Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (i.e. LIME) to explain the predictions of the neural network classifier that we trained [7]. We used the implementation available in the authors\u2019 GitHub repository. LIME perturbs the features in an example and fits a linear model to approximate the neural network at the local region in the feature space surrounding the example. It then uses the linear model to determine which features were most contributory to the model\u2019s prediction for that example. By applying LIME to our trained model, we can conduct informed feature engineering based on any obviously inconsequential features we see or insights from domain experts. We can also tell if the model is learning any unintended bias and eliminate that bias through additional feature engineering.", "For image data, LIME considers features to be superpixels of the image. We used the Quick Shift mode-seeking segmentation algorithm [10] to produce these segmentations. In our project, explanations are visually represented as an overlay of the superpixels deemed by LIME as most contributory to a prediction onto the original image. Superpixels coloured green indicate regions that were most contributory toward the predicted class. Conversely, superpixels coloured red indicate regions that were most contributory against the predicted class.", "See Figures 5a and 5b for visual representations of LIME explanations for a couple of the binary classifier\u2019s predictions of images in the test set. Figures 5c,5d, 5e, and 5f display LIME explanations for a selection of the multi-class classifier\u2019s predictions of images in the test set. It is clear that the model still has a long way to go, as superpixels external to the thoracic cavity continue to appear in explanations.", "Although LIME is an excellent explainability algorithm, we will be applying and comparing alternative model-agnostic explainability algorithms in the near future.", "The project described in this article is an attempt in applying machine learning to distinguish patients with severe cases of COVID-19 infection from their CXR. This work is by no means intended for clinical use; it is purely exploratory. However, it is our hope that this project will continue to improve and potentially offer insight that will contribute toward medical research regarding COVID-19. We believe that explainability is the key to producing an algorithmic system that helps healthcare workers and researchers. This project will continue to grow, and updates will be provided accordingly.", "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to place society under increasing strain, it is crucial that researchers with common goals consolidate their efforts. Please consider this article an open call to individuals or organizations interested in combining or extending this work. We have seen similar projects in progress and would be open to combine efforts.", "This project has been completed by members of the Artificial Intelligence Research and Innovation Lab at the City of London, Canada. We recognize that our work would be greatly enhanced by others. We are in need of individuals with different expertise to advance this project. In particular:", "If you are interested, please reach out to us (see contact info below).", "The lack of publicly available COVID-19-positive CXRs is a crippling barrier to improvements in this prototype model\u2019s performance. With less than 100 PA COVID-19 CXRs, it is challenging to train a generalizable model. A fundamental principle of machine learning is that the more data you train with, the better your model will perform on unseen data.", "If you are able to contribute more deidentified data or are interested in signing a data-sharing agreement, please reach out to us:", "Matt Ross,Manager, Artificial Intelligence, Information Technology Services, City Manager\u2019s Office, The Corporation of the City of Londonmaross@london.ca | 226.449.9113", "Please see the GitHub repository for this project.
