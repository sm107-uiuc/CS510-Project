Before we start , I would like to thank Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas for their efforts to democratize AI.", "First of all, lets import all the required packages.", "In our earlier approach we took a movie embedding and a user embedding and did a cross product to produce a single number which is our predicted rating.", "The same thing can be done via Neural Network approach . In the Neural Network approach , we will take both the embedding , concatenate them and feed it into a neural network to produce a single number i.e the Rating.", "The flow chart is as shown below:-", "Step 1:- Pick up an Embedding Vector from User Embedding Matrix for a particular user and an Embedding Vector from Movie Embedding Matrix for a particular movie.", "Step 2 :- Concatenate both of the vector . Do the same for all the movies and Users, that we want .It will lead to a Embedding matrix where each row is made up of concatenation of Movie and User Embedding vectors .Number of rows will be the same as Number of Users and movies combination. And the column is decided by the number of factors. Same as Embedding dimensionality , that we discussed before. So the dimensions that we have now is (#(Users+Movies)combination, #Factors)", "Step 3 :- Feed it to a 1st Linear Layer where the dimension of the Linear Layer is (#Factors,10). The output will be (#(Users+Movies)combination,10).", "Step 4:- Pass it through a Second Linear Layer with ReLU activation having a dimension of (10,1). The output will be (#(Users+Movies)combination,1).", "Step 5:- This is the output that we wanted. Earlier what we did is for each User and Movie , we did a cross product of their Embeddings which gave us a single number i.e Predicted Rating. Here we are using Neural Network to get that single number i.e Predicted Rating.", "Step 6:- We will then try to minimize the Loss between Predicted Rating and Actual Rating , and in turn will update the model parameters (Embedding values). In this way we can make our predictions more accurate.", "Finally, we optimized our loss function and got a loss of 0.78 and that\u2019s reasonably better than our previous approaches as discussed in 5.1 and 5.2.", "If you are interested in the code , check out my Github repositories.", "If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on the fast.ai forums or on Twitter:@ashiskumarpanda", "P.S. -This blog post will be updated and improved as I further continue with other lessons.
