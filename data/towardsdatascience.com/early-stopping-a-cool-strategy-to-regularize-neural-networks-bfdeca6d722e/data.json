You can get to understand this is happening when your model is doing well on training data, but not able to replicate that performance on test data.", "If you are not too much into reading blogs and want to start coding do check out the Kaggle notebook, alternatively, you can also catch up to our video tutorials.", "In the above figure, we see a binary classification problem (Blue Class and the Green class). The three diagrams represent the decision boundary obtained by three models. The first model is making simpler assumptions, the second one is doing a decent job.", "However, the real culprit is the third model, it is trying to memorize the training data, picking up minor fluctuations in the training data, actually going way too far for a perfect training set accuracy. This tendency of the models is called overfitting, and these models do not learn much, hence can not apply their knowledge further. (Can\u2019t Generalize)", "These seem to be a relation between model parameters and over-fitting. Again let\u2019s look at three alternative models, where we try to predict the Salary of a person, based on his years of experience", "It can be observed that -", "Here, comes the most important part, the model with more number of parameters is more prone to over-fitting and as neural networks have more number of parameters it is more exposed to overfitting.", "The general set of strategies against this curse of overfitting is called regularization and early stopping is one such technique.", "The idea is very simple. The model tries to chase the loss function crazily on the training data, by tuning the parameters. Now, we keep another set of data as the validation set and as we go on training, we keep a record of the loss function on the validation data, and when we see that there is no improvement on the validation set, we stop, rather than going all the epochs. This strategy of stopping early based on the validation set performance is called Early Stopping. This is explained with the below diagram.", "From Figure 3, it can be observed", "Early Stopping, hence does not only protect against overfitting but needs considerably less number of Epoch to train.", "Code excerpt: The below code demonstrates that we have hold-out 20% of the training data as a validation set.", "Some other regularization techniques are loss function regularization, dropout, data augmentation, etc. If interested you can waste some time of your at your own risk in this video tutorial.", "One question that can now come to our mind is how do we monitor what is happening when the model is getting trained and how do keep track? This is where we get help from Keras Callback APIs.", "Callback APIs are like windows, in the Blackbox model training process, allowing us to monitor, the objects we are interested in.", "Of course, we can not see intermediate values at any time, it can be at the starting of the training at the stop of training, at the end of epochs, or at the end of training a batch.", "We do use some callbacks by default, like the metrics and loss function we mention in the model compile. We do not need any callback API or window to be attached in this case. This is called base Callback API. This is shown in the following figure.", "The highlighted portions are the only change that we need to do in the model fit process.", "This was executed on Fashion MNSIT, which is a good testbed to run your experiments.", "Without early stopping, the model runs for all 50 epochs and we get a validation accuracy of 88.8%, with early stopping this runs for 15 epochs and the test set accuracy is 88.1%.", "Well, this is for one of the seed values, overall it clearly shows we achieve an equivalent result with a reduction of 70% of the Epochs.", "Thanks for reading this far.
