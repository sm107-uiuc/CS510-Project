Even today we are trying to build wider and deeper architectures to solve real-world problems. The key aspect of Deep Neural Networks is its non-linearity which is achieved by an activation function. In CNNs, the majority of current State of Art models for object recognition has an activation function either before or after a convolution layer within the network architecture. But how important is it to have an activation function? Do we really need to have an activation function for each convolution that is performed? We are going to discuss some of these questions in this article.", "In recent years, distinct activation functions have been designed. With a lot of experiments focusing on determining the \u201cBEST\u201d activation for a CNN, each paper published claims to perform better than its peers\u2019. Some of the widely known activations are:", "Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU are similar to ReLU for positive values of x but have a small slope for negative values. In Leaky ReLU this slope constant is 0.01.", "ELU and SELU have a smoother curve at x=0 when compared to ReLU.", "Despite such fancy activation functions available, most of the recent CNN models have adopted only ReLU, which probably means that if not best, it performs as good as any other activation function. The probable reason being: it is simple and makes it easier for backpropagation to rectify the weights and maintain fewer parameters. Hence it helps the model to train and converge faster.", "This majorly justifies the preference of ReLU, but we haven\u2019t got the answer to our second question which is: Is there a need to use an activation function after each convolution layer within the network? To answer that, let\u2019s begin our experiment.", "Let us begin with a ResNet18\u00b9 model with a fully pre-activated ResNet\u00b9 block. In this experiment, we will randomly drop some ReLU activation functions starting from 100% and dropping by 10% in each succeeding experiment keeping all other parameters consistent.", "For this experiment, we will be using the CIFAR10\u00b2 dataset.", "SGD with momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of 5e-4 is used. One Cycle Learning Rate Strategy with a gradual drop towards the later epochs which has a MaxLR of 0.4 at 5th epoch.", "The model has 4 ResNet\u00b9 blocks. Unlike traditional ResNet\u00b9, at the end of a ResNet\u00b9 block, we concatenate the input and residual path followed by a pointwise convolution to filter the information being taken ahead. The model has 25 activation layers (24 ReLUs and 1 softMax).", "On the CIFAR10\u00b2 dataset, this model gives a validation accuracy of\u224888% in 24 epochs under 800 secs on Google Colab. This model has \u2248 27M parameters.", "Surprisingly, the best accuracy is achieved where 10% of ReLUs were randomly dropped. The second-best accuracy is when the model uses 80% of total ReLUs in the original network. The accuracy where we have one ReLU for one convolution 100% times is 1.58% behind the best accuracy.", "With these results, we can partially answer our questions", "Does adding ReLU blindly after each convolution is the right way to build a CNN architecture?Probably Not! Is there a better way?Definitely Yes!How to decide if there is a need to add ReLU or not?Grid Search can be one way, but I can\u2019t think of any other optimal way to decide whether to add ReLU after a convolution or not.", "Though we still don\u2019t know the appropriate method for a convolution layer to have a ReLU or not, hopefully, this does help us to understand that there is still a need to question the use of very basic elements when designing a Deep Neural Network.", "The experiment can be found in this Colab Notebook.", "Thank you for reading! Let me know what you think in the comments. Thanks again and keep on learning!", "Your home for data science.
