This curiosity was never overwhelming enough for me to be translated into action. That is until I started my training as a data scientist at Flatiron School. Few weeks into Data Science Bootcamp, I discovered where to even start answering that question. The answer in three words is, Natural Language Processing(NLP). Lo and behold, that old curiosity rekindled and I decided to write my first blog as a newbie on this.", "NLP is an evolving field of computer science that is concerned with computers and human interactions. This blog is my first foray into the world of natural language processing. I will explore the preprocessing of text that begins, before even starting any kind of sophisticated analysis. I will be using a popular NLP library called NLTK. Natural Language Toolkit or NLTK is one of the most powerful and probably the most popular natural language processing libraries today. Not only does it have the most comprehensive library for python based programming, but it also supports the most number of different human languages.", "Before I dive in, I inevitably had to look briefly into the history of NLP.", "Disclaimer: In the following section, I discuss NLP\u2019s evolution by \u2018creatively\u2019 drawing analogies through memes of one very \u2018relevant\u2019 fantasy novel character. You are most welcome to skip this part and move on to the NLTK part.", "Natural language is what we as humans use to communicate verbally with each other. This begets the question (at least in my mind)then, is there an un-natural language? The answer is a resounding YES and it is, Computer language or rather, how computers interact with humans. A layman\u2019s description of Natural language processing would be: It is a field of science which is concerned with deciphering natural language through computers. According to Wikipedia NLP typically involves three main subfields which are briefly described below:", "Speech recognition: Recognition of Spoken words and conversion to conversion. Examples: Siri, Alexa.", "Natural language Interpretation: Understanding natural language and making decisions based off of it. Examples: Classifying emails into spam.", "Natural language generation: Natural language production. Examples: creating summaries of databases or datasets.", "At their basic level computers know how to convert letters to binary numbers, Ones, and Zeroes. For example, the image to the left below is actually the binary representation of the phrase \u201cHello, World!\u201d. Computers translate our language into sequences of binary codes that translate into actionable instructions. Which brings me to my \u2018very creative\u2019 analogy, the second image to the right.", "Arguably one (maybe just me) can find binary language to be very similar to how Hodor, the beloved \u2014 mostly mute \u2014 sidekick of the popular novel Game of Thrones, communicates. Hodor can only say one word, his name. He communicates through the repetitions of Hodor. Or he stays silent. Hodor. Silent. Hodor. Hodor. One. Zero. One. One. Get the picture? So, one could say, Hodor is the perfect representation of binarity!", "Now that I have that out of the way, let\u2019s look back a little. In this age of fast everythings, we rarely get to appreciate how far computers have evolved over their extremely short time since invention compared to the time elapsed since humans first walked this earth. To understand the speed and scale of the development of NLP consider this. Early programmers (only 70 years ago!) used punch cards (pictured below) to talk to computers. A few lines of code would generally require piles and piles of punch cards.", "Today, we can literally talk to machines and don\u2019t even think before getting annoyed at Siri for not picking up our accents!", "So how did we go from this,", "Well, we developed and continue to develop a better way to talk to computers through more sophisticated programming libraries. Here comes the second \u2018creative\u2019 GOT analogy.", "Libraries like NLTK are basically the Bran for modern-day computers (last one, promise.). With built-in pre-written codes, these libraries can perform sophisticated processing of texts in the background, while its users have to only worry about knowing which method accomplishes what. These libraries have enabled text comprehension, interpretation, sentiment analysis through only a few lines of code. The following paragraph aptly summarizes the importance of NLP in today\u2019s context.", "\u201cToday\u2019s machines can analyze more language-based data than humans, without fatigue and in a consistent, unbiased way. Considering the staggering amount of unstructured data that\u2019s generated every day, from medical records to social media, automation will be critical to fully analyze text and speech data efficiently.\u201d", "This next section is where the real work begins!", "So how does one even begin? If you think about it, it\u2019s kind of intuitive. Think about how babies learn to understand language.", "To be able to understand a whole, we first need to be able to decipher something at the elemental level. You cannot connect the dots without first knowing what each dot represents. The first steps in NLP involve breaking down language into words/sentences, A.K.A tokens and then trying to map the dynamics of these tokens in relation to each other and how they form meaning.", "It is important to note that 99% of the work in NLP is preprocessing and organizing the data which involves tokenization and parsing, lemmatization/stemming, part-of-speech tagging, language detection and identification of semantic relationships. Only after these tasks are done, can you then begin to analyze the data. NLTK makes this 99% a lot easier.", "For my first attempt at NLP using NLTK, I chose to process speeches by the incumbent POTUS, Donald Trump. I found a GitHub repository of trump speeches between 2016 and 2017. Which had a total of 73 speeches in the form of text files. I randomly chose one speech to get started and I used the following methods of NLTK to explore the speech.", "a) Tokenizing, c) Removing Stop words, b) Parts of Speech Tagging, c) Concordance", "The first task of any NLP project is tokenizing. It is the process of splitting up a giant string (my raw data as .txt file) into a list of words or sentences. Commonly the string is first tokenized into a list of sentences and then a list of list of words of each of those sentences. Which feels quite intuitive.", "So to get this process started I did the following steps:", "Imported the following libraries in a Jupiter notebook to get the process started and read my text file.", "I tokenized the speech into a list of strings for each sentence. I wrote a function that removes any punctuations from a string using re.sub() method from regular expressions library. For ease of display here, I chose only the first 15 sentences of the speech to work with.", "Stop Words are small words that can be ignored during language processing without changing the meaning of the sentence. Removing them improves efficiency (speed, memory usage) without affecting efficacy. NLTK has a list of stopwords, one for16 different languages. I imported the one for English and wrote the \u2018remove_stopwords()\u2019 function to find and remove stop words from the sentences. After removing stop words the total number of words dropped from 99 to 63, roughly 36% reduction. Consider this in the context of a corpus having thousands of words.", "Ok on to the more exciting work. NLTK has a wonderful method called Part of Speech (POS) tagging (nltk.pos_tag()) which takes in a tokenized sentence and then converts each word into POS according to their grammatical function, i.e. nouns, pronouns, adjective, tense etc. For a list of all tags visit this page.", "To do this, I just used a list comprehension to loop over my filtered speech and tag each word.", "All this with just one line of code.", "For quick exploration another very useful tool is concordance. Concordance can be used to see all usages of a particular word in context. It returns all occurrences of a word and the parts of sentences it was used in. The NLTK version (3.3) has a bug due to which the concordance was by default returning on 25 matches and a width of up to 80 or fewer characters. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see the word \u2018great\u2019 in context (you know why).", "The concordance method takes in a list of tokenized words. So I went back and tokenized the entire speech and called the method on it.", "As you can see this method can be conveniently used in the initial stages to eyeball the use of certain words.", "Lastly to summarize, and it has nothing to do with NLTK, I created word clouds of each of the 70 some speeches. Using the word cloud generator. Not just because they are cool to look at, which they are! However, I found that this can be a really handy way to quickly eyeball the most used words. This lead to some very interesting preliminary observations. For example, at the end of the presidential campaign, the word Hillary begins to pop up more. The clouds are displayed in chronological order at the end. Here\u2019s the code:", "I will continue to explore more methods of NLTK and hopefully will be able to work out some meaningful analysis in the future.", "Following are the speeches by Donal Trump during his presidential speeches in chronological order.", "Your home for data science.
