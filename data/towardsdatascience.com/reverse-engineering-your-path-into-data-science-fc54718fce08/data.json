There is so much to learn and so much to understand And with that, there are no shortage of internet opinions about how to become a Data Scientist. Without some guidance, it\u2019s hard to tell if you\u2019re even progressing in the right direction.", "Well, fear not. The self-taught route is much more manageable than you\u2019d might think. Armed with the proper strategy to build up your skills, you can learn how to become an incredibly sought after Data Scientist and land your dream role.", "In this article, I am going to show you how to reverse engineer a pathway to the Data Science role of your dreams. We all start our journey somewhere, I hope to provide you with the first stepping stones on your path into the industry.", "Reverse Engineering the Path \u2014 Define your goals", "Reverse engineering is the taking apart of an object to see how it works in order to duplicate or enhance said object. The object here is going to be your end objective, defining what your dream role is. What is your dream Data Science role? Consider the following:", "Once you have an idea of the kind of Data Scientist you want to become, it\u2019s much easier to reverse engineer the skills you need to learn to accomplish your goal. Remember that your end goal is subject to change as you progress along your journey. You\u2019ll discover what kinds of data and technologies you enjoy working with as you progress through your studies.", "If you aren\u2019t entirely sure on what your ideal role is just yet, no worries. It might be a better idea for you to outline the kinds of roles you know you don\u2019t want. That way you can focus your energy exploring technologies and industries that you might like.", "The key in all of this is that your journey is an iterative process, it\u2019s never going to be perfect. Once you start and start progressing along, the path gets clearer and clearer.", "Now that you have some semblance of what kind of Data Scientist you want to become, we now need to find real roles you would really like to have one day. We\u2019ll then need to extract the skills needed to earn an interview to be hired for said roles.", "Based on the dream role you just defined for yourself, find 5 job postings that fit what you are looking for. Which 5 jobs would you be absolutely ecstatic about having?", "Once you have your 5, it\u2019s time for us to build out a checklist of skills for you to master on your self-taught journey.This part can be a little tricky because certain job postings are very vague about the skills they want while others are very specific. In any case, read through each posting separately and jot down the specific technical and non-technical skills the employer is looking for.", "Then you are going to compare and contrasts those lists of skills and look for commonalities between them. The commonalities that you see the most often are going to be the \u201cmust-learn\u201d skills, the skills you need to master first. The more frequent the skill appears, the more needed it is for day-to-day operations for the role.", "The skills that are not very common are going to be more \u201cspecialty\u201d skills and these skills you are going to want to prioritize mastering last. These skills are also important, but they are more niche to specific roles and industries.", "Let\u2019s look at a few job postings from LinkedIn and I\u2019ll show you how you can extract the information you need to make a checklist of skills for your journey:", "What information can we extract from this job posting with Company X?", "It appears that a strong candidate for this role would need the following:", "This is a very good list of skills, in fact most of the core Data Scientist skills are listed here in this first list. But let\u2019s check out a second job posting from another company so you can see what I mean :) Note some of the similarities to the first job description as you read along:", "What information can we extract from this job posting with Company Y?", "It appears that a strong candidate for this role would need the following:", "This second role was much more specialized than the first, but do you see all the similarities between the two? Using this reverse engineering strategy removes the guesswork when figuring out what skills you need to learn in order to become a Data Scientist. Employers are literally telling you what they want you to know. Imagine how much additional information you\u2019ll be able to gather with 5 job posts, very exciting.", "Once you have completed aggregating the most common and most niche skills, you have created the \u201ccheckpoints\u201d of where your studying must lead you to in order to be successful. And now we can actually build your own path to follow into the industry", "Now that you know what the stepping stones are, you can begin mapping how you want to go about your studies. There is no right or wrong way to go about it, but ideally, you\u2019ll want to focus on the core skills of a data scientist first, starting with learning Python syntax. I would advise learning stats next before moving onto Pandas, Numpy, and SciPy (or you can learn them all together :))", "Most job postings will require the following skills(I\u2019ve also noted the Python libraries associated with them):", "A great resource to learn the Python packages above is The Python Data Science Handbook as well as googling the specific libraries for the documentation", "As a parting gift to you, I highly recommend checking out this article on Project Based Learning. Because you have so much to learn and so many skills to acquire, you are going to want to practice them in real-world scenarios by creating different projects to develop your skills on real world data.", "By using Project Based Learning, not only can you more easily master each skill individually, you can also develop ways to used multiple skills together to draw powerful insights from your data. If you need access to real-world data resources, check out this article here. As you work through more and more projects and further develop your skills, you can always go back to your older projects and rework them to make them into really tip-top analyses for your resume.", "Alright, that will do it for me. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my article, I hope I was able to provide you a little light on your Data Science journey. Until next time, have a great week!", "My name is Kishen Sharma and I am a Data Scientist based in the Bay Area. I am on a mission to teach and motivate aspiring Data Scientists all across the world.", "Feel free to connect with me on Instagram and check out my additional content here.
