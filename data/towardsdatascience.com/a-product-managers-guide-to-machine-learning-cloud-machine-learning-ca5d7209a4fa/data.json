For a long time, I never quite successfully got to the machine learning components because I was always stuck in the maze of for loops, while loops, comprehensions, containers, and functions. At the time, the lack of progress was demotivating. My many dead python repos silently testify of this.", "To form a good mental model before beginning the long and arduous journey of learning ML, we must first get an overall view and then dig into more detailed objectives. Akin to mapping out a forest, getting the view of the landscape of the forest is the first step, followed by looking at the forest\u2019s trees (i.e. trunk and big branches), and then and only then, you pay attention to the leaves and the twigs of the forest.", "In this maze of learning ML, I felt as though I was dealing with leaves and twigs. I wanted a panoramic view of the forest before I got entangled in the weeds, twigs, and leaves. I found that the AWS ML certification gives you that vantage point for looking at the vast forest of ML. If the views inspire you, then you will have strength and motivation not to abandon the journey. Passing this test was motivating and validating.", "This is not a cheap test. It costs $300 and many months of after-work studying. Before preparing for the test, I googled \u201cIs AWS ML certification worth it?\u201d. I did not find an answer that specifically addressed the question of: \u201cis it worth it?\u201d. Below are some considerations for why this test was worth it and what it offers:", "It\u2019s an easy-to-apply case-based test: What I really enjoyed about this test was that it is a case based. It gives you a scenario and asks how various ML/AWS solutions can be applied to that scenario. When the test presents a variety of situations, it expands your critical thinking and possibilities of what you could do with ML/AWS. At times I found myself saying: \u201cOh wow! Can you do that?\u201d, \u201cmmm, I never thought of that\u201d. It is fun to see the possibilities. You just can\u2019t memorize your way through this test. Similar to the core idea of ML, generalizing the knowledge is the key. This case based approach refines one\u2019s ability to select and justify the appropriate ML approach for a given business problem.", "Provides an excellent framework for understanding Algorithms: Sagemaker has 17 built-in algorithms. You get to see what is underneath the hood of an algorithm, type of a problem that a particular algorithm will solve, its learning type, its hyper-parameters, data input mode, file type (Record-IO, CSV, JSON, Text), types of Instance Class (CPU vs. GPU). Knowing the different features of the algorithms, provides you with the ability to express the intuition behind basic ML algorithms. Additionally, you get to learn about loss functions, optimize the model performance, and learn to evaluate the model output. For a quick read on these three core ideas read this article:", "Gives an excellent bird\u2019s eye view of fundamental backend knowledge: To build, design, and deploy ML, it needs DevOps. While studying for the test, you get to see most of the AWS backend systems and services. You will experience how these services interact with each other to source, train, test, and deploy ML solutions. This exposure gives you the ability to identify appropriate AWS services to implement ML solutions. These services could be Sagemaker, Kinesis, EMR, EC2, Glue, Athena, KMS, S3, Apache spark, etc. With greater exposure (hands-on experience), designing and implementing scalable, cost-optimized, reliable, and secure ML solutions could become an intuition rather than a mystery.", "With the new mental model, I had better discussions with my applied scientists and engineers: Gaining the trust of your colleagues is worth it. As part of the preparation, deploying your own ML model and see it work is worth it.", "This test will also expand your functional skills, which are company/ industry agnostic: The core ideas examined on this test can be applied to various industries such as medical, public policy, financial, etc.", "Finally, the scope and depth of this test is immense. There is so much to learn. I pushed back the test twice because I feared that my preparation wasn\u2019t sufficient. It is a complicated subject and hard test. Because it was hard every step of the journey, the feeling of triumph was real when I passed the test! Knowing that you can do hard things is worth it.", "This test will also expand your functional skills, which are company/ industry agnostic. Below I\u2019ve provide resources that I\u2019ve used.", "What resources has helped me prepare for the exam and how will I rate the value I obtained from the resources (all links to these resources are provided below):", "Your home for data science.
