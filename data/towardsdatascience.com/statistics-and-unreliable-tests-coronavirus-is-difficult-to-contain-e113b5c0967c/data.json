Over the past month, a deadly virus has been spreading throughout China and the world, sending the infected to the ICU and trapping others in their homes. As authorities try to manage this crisis, they face the challenging issue of containment \u2014 sending the infected to quarantine, while allowing the non-infected to go free.", "Here is the scenario. You have a cough and a fever. There is a chance that you have caught COVID-19 \u2014 the virus spreading throughout the world. You don\u2019t know what this chance is, and you don\u2019t want to take chances, so you seek advice from your doctor.", "The issue from the authorities perspective is different. You want treatment, but the authorities need to contain the spread of the virus. From their point of view, there are 4 main outcomes of your visit to the doctor.", "The two mistakes that the authorities can make is scenario 2 and 3. Scenario 2 is a minor inconvenience (if not done too often), but scenario 3 is the major issue which can cascade into a larger outbreak, even if only done once. If an outbreak occurs, they will have to do contact tracing for possibly hundreds of people, given the contagiousness and lethality of coronavirus. This will be extremely costly for them, so their primary interest is in minimizing the probability of the third scenario.", "Thus, the authorities need to make an accurate diagnosis, so that they can avoid releasing the infected and quarantining the non-infected. To achieve this, the authorities first make an initial assessment of all suspected infections, whether they are patients at the medical clinic, or travellers from places with active outbreaks.", "There are clues which will hint at a COVID-19 infection.", "Not all of these clues will be immediately available. Authorities at the airport can only screen people for temperature and identify travel history if needed. A doctor will know about the symptoms disclosed by the patient, but it is on the doctor to take the initiative to find and link the clues together. And an asymptomatic case may not have any clues.", "You go to the doctor, and the doctor asks you a series of questions. You tell the doctor about your cough and fever. The doctor is suspicious and builds their own belief of whether you are infected or not. Their belief is strong enough to justify a coronavirus test, so they order you to take this test.", "After gathering enough clues, a doctor may suspect coronavirus. To confirm this suspicion, the doctor will order a diagnostic test.", "A diagnostic test is performed by collecting samples from your body (eg. mucus in the back of the nose) and looking for presence of the virus in those samples. It seems simple enough, and people have a lot of faith in science. This may lead people into making this first mistake.", "Incorrect interpretation: a positive result means a patient has novel coronavirus, while a negative result means that a patient does not.", "This is not true, because the test is not always reliable. There are many reasons why a test may give a misleading result:", "In general, the people who make the testing kits will specify the reliability of the test.", "Suppose that a company now markets their test as \u201c90% accurate\u201d. This can lead to another common mistake.", "Incorrect interpretation: for a 90% accurate test, a positive result means 90% chance of being infected, and a negative result means 90% chance of not being infected.", "This interpretation is also not true, but is actually surprisingly common in the medical community\u2014 the great psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer shows how doctors misinterpret the results of mammogram results article.", "The correct way to evaluate a diagnostic test requires thinking in terms of Bayesian probability. To put it simply, Bayesian probability involves having a prior probability and then using new information to update it. In terms of diagnostic testing, the prior probability is the doctor\u2019s belief about whether the patient is infected or not. The test result is used as information, and this changes the doctor\u2019s belief.", "We can formulate the reliability question in terms of math equations.", "Posterior probability: how reliable is a positive result?", "Posterior probability: how reliable is a negative result?", "What we need to do now is to connect the doctor\u2019s initial belief with the final belief. To do this, we use Bayes\u2019 rule, which can easily be derived using basic facts about conditional probabilities.", "The denominator is expressed like this.", "We now have two new unknown probabilities.", "These two probabilities are actually measures of a test\u2019s reliability, and they can be expressed in terms of two quantities: sensitivity and specificity.", "I should remind you here that I can express probabilities in terms of complements. Infection and no infection are mutually exclusive. Similarly, a positive and a negative result are also mutually exclusive. This means that our calculations will use these two equations, where A and B are events such as \u201cthe patient is infected\u201d, or \u201cthe test result is positive\u201d.", "We now have all the tools we need to interpret a test result", "We now know how to incorporate the information from a test result to change an initial belief into a final belief. Next, we look at diagnostic tests with different levels of reliability, and see how their results might affect the beliefs of doctors.", "You followed the doctor\u2019s advice and got a diagnostic test. The doctor now receives a positive or negative result for coronavirus and now needs to make a decision:", "1. Prescribe any necessary medication and let you go.", "2. Order you to be quarantined.", "To decide when to treat, the doctor needs to have confidence in a diagnosis.", "In general medical practice, a doctor can make two mistakes:", "In order to avoid these mistakes, the doctor orders a test. They had a prior belief, and the test is used as information to reduce uncertainty. Once the doctor has enough certainty, the doctor can make a recommendation.", "How much uncertainty can be reduced by a test?", "We first look at a reliable test. Consider a test that has sensitivity and specificity at 98%. We show what the prior and posterior probabilities of infection are, given a positive or negative result.", "Diagnostic tests are not perfect \u2014 bad luck exists, decisions are always risks.", "If the doctor has a reliable test, then a prior belief of 50% can be reduced to less than 5%, or some other very low figure. Unfortunately, these tests are not perfect. There is still a non-zero probability of actually being infected, so the doctor can make a mistake out of sheer bad luck.", "Because the doctor ultimately has to make a decision, even under uncertainty, the doctor has to decide what is an acceptable risk.", "Examples of where risk is unacceptable:", "Examples of where risk is more acceptable:", "(From here, we switch focus from general medicine, back to the coronavirus outbreak.)", "We\u2019ve established that a doctor needs to resolve uncertainty using a diagnostic test before they can have the confidence to take an acceptable risk.", "However, what happens if the diagnostic test is not reliable?", "We try to use realistic values. Many flu tests have a specificity of around 90\u201395%. Keeping in line with this, I assume a 90% specificity (feel free to correct me if you have better information).", "I assume a 40% sensitivity. This turns out to be close to the reported sensitivity for COVID-19 coronavirus tests.", "Suppose that a patient lives in an area which recently had an outbreak, and is now presenting to the medical clinic with symptoms of coronavirus. If the doctor deems the probability of a COVID-19 infection to be 50% (likely infection), and orders this unreliable test for the patient:", "Using a single unreliable test, a patient\u2018s probability of infection cannot be reduced to an acceptable level, regardless of a positive or negative result.", "The unreliable test cannot rule out infection.", "Now imagine a scenario where people are quarantined until the authorities are confident that they are not infected. If the test is unreliable, then it cannot prove that there is no infection. In other words, the test has no consequences on decision making \u2014 the patient will remain in quarantine either way.", "With contagion potential, unreliable tests have no influence on decision making.", "What if a doctor does not know the reliability of a test?", "A doctor would understand that COVID-19 is highly contagious and lethal, and thus, their level of acceptable risk would be very low.", "Suppose they mistook an unreliable test for a reliable test. Their initial belief of 50% probability would drop to an actual 40% probability of infection, while in their mind, it would be 2% because they assumed that the test was reliable. If they went on to release the patient, this would potentially have disastrous consequences.", "This is why the tools used in the clinic are backed by research. Doctors need certainty about what their tools are and aren\u2019t capable of.", "If a doctor knows about the unreliability of a test and trusts their own judgement, then a single negative test result will not convince them. The doctor will dismiss the test result as an error.", "How many negative test results does it take to convince the doctor?", "Assume that if the probability is reduced to less than 5%, then the doctor will be sufficiently convinced that there is no infection.", "After a clinical examination, a doctor believes that a patient has 50% probability of having COVID-19. He knows that the diagnostic test is unreliable, with 40% sensitivity and 90% specificity, and so he orders a series of diagnostic tests.", "Every diagnostic test returns a negative result. The initial probability is 50%, and each test decreases the probability.", "In the graph, you can see that the green point has 5.5% prior probability and ends up with 3.7% posterior probability, which is past the grey threshold of acceptable risk.", "It takes 8 consecutive negative results to convince a doctor who starts with a probability of 50%. Note that if it takes X tests starting from probability Y, then it will take at least X tests for any probability greater than Y. Any patient with an initial probability of infection greater than 8% will require at least 2 tests to rule out an infection.", "For the current outbreak of coronavirus, there have been reports of negative results for people who are actually infected \u2014 a false negative.", "On the patients being tested with nucleic acid tests (NATs), used to diagnose COVID-19.", "\u201cNot all of those infected by it return positive NATs\u201d.", "\u201cEven patients who definitely have the disease only come back positive 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the time.\u201d", "\u201cTesting throat swabs (from potentially infected people) also returns a lot of false negatives.\u201d \u2014 Professor Wang Chen, director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (source: Caixin Media, a Feb 8 article.)", "The experts themselves are saying that the tests are not sensitive enough \u2014 the probability of a positive result for an infected patient is too low.", "The tests being described by these experts are similar to the unreliable tests that I have been using as an example.", "How is the containment of COVID-19 progressing?", "\u201cSome patients whose CT scans clearly showed signs of viral infection but whose NATs tested negative were \u201creleased\u201d back into their communities due to a shortage of hospital berths.\u201d \u2014 anonymous doctor in the imaging department of a major Wuhan hospital.", "\u201cThough her doctor was almost certain she was infected with the virus, a throat-swab test she had taken came back negative, which meant the facility wouldn\u2019t take her.\u201d", "While these events are driven more by a lack of resources, it is sad to see patients being rejected from the hospital because of low-sensitivity tests.", "Wuhan\u2019s top Communist Party official, Ma Guoqiang, cast doubt on the swab test on Monday, urging those with negative results to try again to be sure. \u201cOne needs to wait one day later, to get another negative, in order to rule out [the virus],\u201d he said.", "\u201cHer clinical features are very typical of the coronavirus infection.
