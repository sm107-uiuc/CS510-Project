Successively, algorithm after new algorithm were proposed, from logistic regression to support vector machines, but the neural network is, very literally, the algorithm of algorithms and the pinnacle of machine learning. It\u2019s a universal generalization of what machine learning is, instead of one attempt of doing it.", "In this sense, it is more of a framework and a concept than simply an algorithm, and this is evident given the massive amount of freedom in constructing neural networks \u2014 hidden layer & node counts, activation functions, optimizers, loss functions, network types (convolutional, recurrent, etc.), and specialized layers (batch norm, dropout, etc.), to name a few.", "From this perspective of neural networks being a concept rather than a rigid algorithm comes a very interesting corollary: any machine learning algorithm, be it decision trees or k-nearest neighbors, can be represented using a neural network. While instinctively this can be understood with a few examples, this statement can be mathematically proven.", "Let us first define what a neural network is: it is an architecture consisting of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, with connections between the nodes of each layer. Information is transformed from the input layer to the output layer through linear transformations (weights and biases) but also nonlinear transformations (activation functions). There is some method to update the trainable parameters of the model such that\u2026", "Logistic Regression is simply defined as a standard regression with multiplicative coefficients for each input and an additional intercept added, all passed through a sigmoid function. This can be modelled by a neural network with no hidden layers; the result is a multiple regression passed through a sigmoid output neuron.", "Linear Regression can be modelled the same by replacing the output neuron activation function with a linear activation function (which simply maps the output f(x) = x, in other words it doesn\u2019t do anything).", "The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm attempts to project data into a new space with a so-called \u2018kernel trick\u2019 such that the linear separability of the data is optimized. After the data has been transformed, the algorithm draws the hyperplane that best separates the data along class boundaries. The hyperplane is simply defined as a linear combination of existing dimensions, much like a line in 2 dimensions and a plane in 3. In this sense, one can think of the SVM algorithm as a projection of data into a new space, followed by a multiple regression. The output of the neural network can be passed through some kind of bounded output function to achieve a probabilistic outcome.", "Of course, there may be some restrictions that need to be implemented, such as limiting connections between nodes and making certain parameters fixed \u2014 changes which, of course, do not take away from the integrity of the \u2018neural network\u2019 label. Perhaps more layers need to be added to ensure this representation of the Support Vector Machine can perform as well as the real deal.", "Tree-based algorithms like the Decision Tree Algorithm are a little more tricky. The answer as to how one would go about constructing this neural network lies in analyzing how it divvies up its feature space. As a training point traverses through a series of split nodes, the feature space is split into several hypercubes; in the two-dimensional example, vertical and horizontal lines created squares.", "Hence, a similar manner of splitting the feature space along these lines can be emulated with a more rigid activation, like the step function, where an input is either one value or the other \u2014 essentially, a divider line. The weights and biases, which may need to have value restrictions implemented, hence serve only to orient the divider lines through stretching, shrinking, and position. In order to achieve a probabilistic outcome, the result can be passed through an activation function.", "Although there are many technical differences between neural network representations of algorithms and the actual algorithm, the point is that the network expresses the same idea and can approach the problem with the same strategy and performance as the real algorithm.", "But perhaps you aren\u2019t satisfied with rough translations of algorithms into neural network form, or want to see a universal application to even trickier algorithms like k-nearest neighbors or na\u00efve Bayes instead of a case-by-case basis. The answer lies in the Universal Approximation Theorem \u2014 a mathematical explanation behind the wild success of neural networks \u2014 which essentially states that a neural network of sufficient size can model any function to an arbitrary accuracy. Say that there is some function f(x) that represents the data; for each data point (x, y), f(x) always returns a value equal or very close to y.", "The goal of modelling is to find this representative or ground truth function f(x), which we\u2019ll denote p(x) for predictions. All machine learning algorithms approach this task very differently, taking different assumptions as valid and giving their best shot, p(x), as an outcome. If one were to write out ways algorithms approach creating p(x), you may get anything from lists of conditionals to purely mathematical operations. The function that describes how a function maps targets to inputs can really take on any form.", "Sometimes, these functions work. Other times, they don\u2019t \u2014 they have a fixed amount of parameters, and using them is a take-it-or-leave-it matter. Neural networks are a little bit different in how they approach finding f(x), though.", "Any function can be reasonably approximated by many step-like sections \u2014 the more steps, the more accurate the approximation is.", "Each of these steps is represented in a neural network is nodes in the hidden layer with sigmoid activation functions, which are essentially a probabilistic step function. In essence, each node is \u2018assigned\u2019 to part of the function, f(x). Then, through systems of weights and biases, the network can determine the presence of a node, blowing the input of the sigmoid function towards infinity (with an output of 1) if the neuron should be activated for a particular input and towards negative infinity otherwise. This pattern of delegating nodes to look out for a particular part of the data function has not only been observed in numerical data but also in images.", "While the Universal Approximation Theorem has been expanded to be true for other activation functions like ReLU and neural network types, the principle remains true: neural networks were created to be perfect. Instead of relying on complex mathematical systems of equations and relationships, neural networks delegate parts of itself to parts of the data function and brute-force memorize generalizations within their assigned region. When these nodes are aggregated into a massive neural network, the result is a seemingly intelligent model, when they are actually cleverly designed approximators.", "Given that neural networks can construct \u2014 in theory, at least \u2014 a function with essentially as much accuracy as you want (more nodes, the more accurate the approximation gets, of course disregarding technicalities in overfitting), a neural network with the right structure can model the prediction function p(x) of any other algorithm. This cannot be said about any other machine learning algorithm.", "The method that neural networks use is not to optimize a few parameters in an existing model, like a polynomial curve or a system of nodes. The neural network is a certain perspective of modelling data that seeks not to make the best of any standalone system but to directly approximate the data function; the neural network architecture we are so familiar with is simply a model manifestation of what really is an idea.", "With the power of the neural network and continual research into the bottomless field of deep learning, data \u2014 be it videos, sound, epidemiological data, or anything in between \u2014 will be able to be modelled to a degree like never before. The neural network truly is the algorithm of algorithms.", "All images created by author unless stated otherwise.", "Your home for data science.
