However, forecasting house prices is an interesting application for the data scientist, and it gives us a chance to explore forecasting techniques, their strengths, and their limitations.", "Note \u2014 the Github repo containing all the data and analysis in this blog can be found here. I mostly use standard libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.) but there are some more exotic ones, such as Geopandas for the map visuals, and Statsmodels\u2019 ARIMA function, which may be of interest.", "The aim of our analysis is a deceptively simple one \u2014 given historical data of the US housing marking, which five regions would we recommend buying property in now, if the goal is to get as large a return on our investment as possible in, say, ten years?", "We start with a dataset generated using figures from Zillow. This data is relatively granular, covering 14,103 \u2018regions\u2019 across the USA. For each region we get some basic information (city, metro area, state, etc.) as well as the monthly median house price for that region, from April 1996 to April 2018.", "Every state is represented in the dataset, though, as we\u2019d expect, we have more regions from the more populous states (California, Texas, New York, Florida).", "The temptation might be to jump straight in with the forecasting. However, there are properties of the data that will significantly affect how we approach and interpret our results.", "You\u2019d need to have been living in a cave for the last decade or so to not know that the US housing market has been somewhat volatile of late.", "Indeed, during the period of the financial crisis (defined for the purposes of this analysis as the months between April 2007 and April 2012) you may have been better off investing in a cave than in a Arizonan apartment, or Floridian flat. The median price growth of regions in all but three states was negative during this period, with many houses in the worst affected areas losing more than half their value.", "However, if we then look at the same picture since 2012, we see that, quite in contrast to the previous five years, all states grew on average. We also see that the states that suffered most during the crisis (Nevada, Florida, Arizona, and California) have since been amongst the fastest growers.", "This is all very important context for when we come to fit our forecasting models:", "This is a basic example of how blindly throwing models (no matter how sophisticated) at a dataset can only get you so far. A bit of human common sense and critical thinking should always be applied first if possible.", "To this end, we plot all the regions on a scatter, with recent price growth on the horizontal and price growth during the financial crisis on the vertical.", "By looking at regions that are above average in both measures, we can isolate places that both weathered the storm between 2007 and 2012 (demonstrating at least some resilience against economic shocks) and also strong growth potential for future years.", "Therefore, these 1,737 \u2018Growth Regions\u2019 are all areas that we can, in principle, feel comfortable recommending to investors. Indeed, by indexing April 2007 prices in these regions, we see that they have outperformed other regions since at least 1996.", "Interestingly, we also see that their growth leading into the financial crisis (2003 to 2007) was actually slower. This supports the idea that these regions have stronger \u2018fundamentals\u2019, and that their house prices weren\u2019t inflated unduly by subprime lending.", "Now we\u2019ve narrowed down the dataset, both in terms of timeframe, and regions, we can start thinking about modelling the data to generate forecasts. There are several different types of model we could use, and selecting the right one depends on the characteristics of the data.", "In brief, a stationary time series is one whose mean, variance, and covariance (i.e. the regularity of the periods if data is seasonal) remain constant (or, if you prefer, stationary) as you move through time.", "Eyeballing our data suggests that at least one of these conditions is not satisfied \u2014 the average house price is, more or less, increasing over time (it certainly isn\u2019t constant).", "We can prove this mathematically using the Dickey-Fuller test. If we\u2019re working in Python, then we can import a ready-made function from the Statsmodels package.", "Note, Dickey-Fuller is essentially a hypothesis test, where the null hypothesis is that the data is NOT stationary. Therefore, we\u2019d want a p-value below the classic value of below 0.05 to reject this, and show that the data is stationary.", "Clearly, in this case, the p-value is some way off. The lack of stationarity immediately rules out the use of some of the more simple models, such as White Noise, Random Walk, or basic Auto-Regression.", "Seasonality is a simple concept, which states that data values are not only dependent on the overall timeframe of the time series, but also on regular periods within that time frame.", "For example, the number of airline passengers on a monthly basis will be seasonal \u2014 even though the average trend is clearly increasing in the below chart, the number of passengers is also dependant on the season, with numbers increasing in the summer months, and declining again in winter.", "We can test for seasonality by investigating autocorrelation. To do this, we copy the time series, shift it back by x periods, and test the correlation between this shifted data and the original time series. For example, if monthly data is seasonal in an annual context (like, say, the volume of Google searches for \u2018diet\u2019, which tends to be especially popular in January) then twelve-month lags ought to produce high levels of correlation.", "Happily, there\u2019s Statsmodels function that will produce a graph showing the correlation of different lag periods simultaneously.", "As we can see, house prices are strongly autocorrelated with a one period lag, but not at all beyond that. If we had seasonal data, we would expect to see a spike at, for example, x=12. That we do not observe any such spikes tells us that our data is not seasonal, simply that house prices in a given month tend to be pretty similar to prices in the previous month.", "The stationary and seasonality testing above suggests that we are within our rights to use ARIMA models for this exercise. I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail on the mathematics of ARIMA in this blog (look here for a better explanation than I\u2019d be able to give myself).", "To keep it brief, ARIMA models can be broken down into three main components:", "We therefore say an ARIMA model has Order (p,d,q) \u2014 p being the number of autoregressive terms, d being the number of periods that we difference, and q being the number of moving average terms.", "Two ARIMA models with the same order can have different coefficients and thus be totally different models. Indeed, it is desirable to create a bespoke model for each region to maximise the accuracy of our predictions. However, since we have some 1,737 time series (one for each \u2018growth region\u2019), we should create some functions to automate the model building process.", "Firstly, we define a function that, given a region\u2019s time series data, will return the \u2018best\u2019 ARIMA model for that region. This is the model that we will use to predict the region\u2019s future house prices. For that, we can lean on Statsmodels\u2019 ARIMA modelling function, which takes two key inputs:", "It then outputs the model (i.e. the set of coefficients) that best fits the data for the specified order. So we need to work out which order generates the best model for a given region. To do this, we can take a simple \u2018grid search\u2019 approach \u2014 generate a list of potential \u2018orders\u2019\u2026", "\u2026then iterate through them, and compare the models that Statsmodels generates for each.", "There are a couple of ways to make this comparison. In this case, we do a train/test split, fitting each version of the model using the first 90% of the data (say, the prices up to January 2017), and then calculating the Root-Square Mean Error (RSME) of each model\u2019s prediction for the last 10%. We then take the model whose prediction has the lowest (i.e. best) RSME.", "Note \u2014 another way to do this might be to compare the models\u2019 AICs or BICs", "To be clear \u2014 we are optimising two things simultaneously with this function;", "After this, it is fairly trivial to create a second function that iterates through each of our \u2018growth regions\u2019, and uses the above function to output the best model for each. The beauty of having our arima_selection function return the ARIMA model itself as an object is that we can store it and call it later on.", "Indeed, let\u2019s suppose we\u2019ve stored all 1,737 models in the column of a Pandas dataframe (Pandas dataframes being perfectly happy to store pretty much any object you can throw at it).", "Then we can call the model object methods using Pandas\u2019 map function, and store the results as new columns.", "For example, let\u2019s say I want to calculate and store the AIC for each model. Then I can do the following:", "Which generates a new column in the dataframe:", "Of course, we can use this technique to extract lots of information about each model, using the many methods that Statsmodels has in-built. A full list of these methods can be found here, but the key ones we\u2019ll use for this exercise are:", "These extra statistics are useful, since we can use them to further filter our regions (for example, we could exclude any regions whose models\u2019 parameters have statistically insignificant p-values).", "We also notice that some of the forecasts come with very wide range (as defined by the .conf_int() method). For example, our modelling predicts that Pueblo County, CO could have returns of anywhere between 21% and 766% in 10 years.", "Whilst this might be appealing to an investor with a voracious risk appetite, such uncertain returns do not make for sensible recommendations to most people. We need to balance growth potential with growth uncertainty when selecting our final regions for recommendation.", "To do this, we can compare the regions on another scatter plot, showing the forecast price growth on the horizontal, and the width of the forecast range (as a percentage of the forecast value) on the vertical.", "This way we can isolate the regions that have strong potential growth AND a relatively narrow range of forecast values, minimising risk. To do this, we take the five regions furthest to the right in the shaded green area.", "The five regions that we have selected are fairly heterogeneous, and throw up a couple of surprises \u2014 Palo Alto, CA might seem like a relatively obvious property hotspot, but it\u2019s less likely that Plano, TX would have caught an investor\u2019s attention.", "Supposing we were to invest $1m evenly across these five regions, we would expect our portfolio to more than double in value in ten years. We predict with 95% confidence, that the portfolio would be worth between $1.78m and $2.43m.", "See how this \u2018recommended\u2019 portfolio compares against the less nuanced portfolio consisting of the five regions with the highest forecast growth, without accounting for risk (i.e. the \u2018High Growth\u2019 regions).", "Although our forecasts suggest that this \u2018High Growth\u2019 portfolio could be worth $4.54m by 2028 (a return of over 350% \u2014 significantly higher than the \u2018Recommended\u2019 portfolio\u2019s 110%), it also has the potential to lose 86% of its value in this time frame; something that a risk-lover with money to spare might go for, but not a sensible recommendation to the average investor.", "So if you indeed are looking for a new American neighbourhood to move to, why not give Plano, TX a go? By all accounts it\u2019s a highly liveable city. And, if ARIMA modelling is to be believed, you may well make a decent return on your investment.", "Thanks for reading all the way to the end of the blog!
