Computers have gotten very good at a variety of tasks, such as detecting things in images, which were previously only thought possible for human beings. These programs are a major step forward but work well only for the specific tasks which they are built for. There is no real understanding in what they are doing. The dream of a computer that really thinks, really comprehends, remains unrealized.", "There are exceptionally smart people trying to duplicate the capabilities of the human brain in software and specialized hardware. It has not yet been accomplished, likely because we are still working out exactly how the brain works.", "I think there\u2019s another way. We don\u2019t have to design it. We just have to design an artificial environment in which it is encouraged to evolve. Our own brains evolved because intelligence provided an advantage to our ancestors. A properly designed virtual environment, populated with individual software agents which evolved with genetic algorithms, might evolve an artificial general intelligence. It would be expensive, but it might well be feasible with current technology.", "We\u2019d essentially be simulating advanced life evolving on a chunk of an isolated planet. We don\u2019t need to start with unicellular organisms \u2014 something along the lines of crude mammals, with senses and locomotion already installed would be preferred. We get a free jump start that way, and we have a pretty good understanding of how those work.", "Why Did We Evolve To Be Intelligent, Anyway?", "There are several theories as to why hominids developed intelligence. A complex brain is expensive to maintain, in terms of energy. It takes effort to feed it, and the larger head caused challenges during birth. In order to have evolved at all, it must have provided a significant advantage to our earliest descendants.", "Spatial awareness for climbing would have been critical, and the early use of simple tools opened up new food sources. There is a theory that much of our intelligence evolved because there was an advantage in living in larger social groups, and the higher functions were needed to navigate the complexities of surviving and reproducing within such a group. It is also likely that our intelligence may have enabled us to survive in rapidly changing climates and environments.", "Complex neural nets have been successfully learning to play video games via reinforcement learning for several years now. A neural net of fixed architecture plays the game over and over, receiving feedback from the game on how it\u2019s doing in the form of the game score, just as a human player does. The neural net\u2019s weights are adjusted to optimize the score it receives. The human designer lays out the design for the neural net, and lets it run.", "Genetic algorithms, in which parameters of a design solution evolve in the same way as biological systems do, have been proven quite successful for a number of problems. Individual features of the solution are encoded in virtual genes, and then compete against a large, varied population of individuals with different genes. At the end of each run, the most successful individuals go through a virtual round of mutation and mating, and their \u201coffspring\u201d survives to compete again. Recombination and mutation slowly introduce new genes, which are tested in the environment.", "There is tremendous flexibility if we combine those approaches. Instead of a human designing the neural net architecture, we could encode it into a set of genes, allowing the design of the network to change. It should be allowed to vary tremendously in complexity. We don\u2019t know what the optimal solution is, so the available range of options should be large.", "We standardize at least a subset of the inputs to the neural net in order to connect virtual senses. We standardize on those because we\u2019re not interested in evolving new senses, but the brain that uses those senses.", "We must design the system such that the virtual organism incurs an energy cost for a larger, more complex brain \u2014 that doesn\u2019t come for free. The organism must gain a competitive advantage from the brain that outweighs the cost of maintaining it.", "Now \u2014 and this is the expensive part \u2014 we drop thousands or millions of these virtual organisms into a complex virtual environment, and let nature take its course.", "What Does That Virtual Environment Look Like?", "It doesn\u2019t need to be pretty, in terms of graphics. The user interface just needs to provide status information, so graphics rendering could be pretty minimal. The key is in the underlying simulation.", "The environment we use would depend a great deal on what kind of intelligence we wanted to produce. We could use different environments to evolve intelligences with different strengths. For example, an environment that required the solving of complex math problems might generate an AI more geared for abstract thinking. An environment where the primary requirement was governing a simulated city might train an AI for that sort of work in the real world.", "For the purposes of this thought experiment, we\u2019ll stick with what we might need to evolve something sort of like us.", "Our brains evolved as a way to help us survive a complex, hostile world. Our simulated environment would need to be pretty complex. As a starting point, here are the things I can think of that would likely be required. There are almost certainly more.", "We can\u2019t simulate an entire biome down to the individual bacterium, of course. We have to focus on key drivers of natural selection in order to keep the required computation manageable.", "The energy and other resources in the world must be finite, and unevenly distributed, just as they are in the real world. If energy is too easy to come by, there\u2019s no need to compete and nothing to drive evolution. There would need to be natural dangers that could kill an unwary organism, both natural hazards and predators.", "We\u2019d probably want to simulate macronutrients \u2014 proteins, carbs, and fats \u2014 with different ratios in different food sources. We\u2019d want to make our organisms omnivores, to give them the greatest flexibility to collect nutrition. Large prey animals would need to have formidable defenses, which would drive the developments of cooperation and tools in the form of weapons.", "The environment would need to support simple tool making \u2014 some food resources might only be available with the use of tools. Agents would need to be able to interact with fairly small objects in their virtual world. We\u2019ve done stuff like this already at smaller scale though \u2014 the demos for an Occulus Quest, for example, have the user throwing paper airplanes and interacting with other small objects. It would require tremendous computing power to simulate a large world, but no dramatic leaps forward in technology.", "The world would need to respond in realistic ways \u2014 it should be possible to dam a river to build fish traps, and to stack things to assemble crude structures, for example. Falling and injury should provide a significant disadvantage.", "Organisms would need a standard way of communicating with peers at short range. Real organisms use sound and visual communication, but I\u2019m not sure simulating that would be required. It would likely be enough to include a standard communication channel in each organism, much like the sensory inputs were standardized. Our goal isn\u2019t to evolve communication channels \u2014 it\u2019s to evolve the intelligence required to deal with communications with the organisms in the vicinity.", "Because it is thought that social structures drove the development of higher intelligence, there would need to be challenges in the environment that could only provide an advantage if exploited as a group. A combat mechanism should be considered, because like it or not, it is a significant driver of advance. Likewise, organisms must include genetic coding for variable levels of aggression. Uneven distribution of resources in the environment would drive migration and warfare, which would both contribute strong evolutionary pressures.", "A scoring mechanism would track the relative performance of each organism in the environment, and fit individuals would be allowed to mate and reproduce. Sexual reproduction and mutation mechanisms are simulated quite successfully in genetic algorithms, and would be key to generating variation in the population.", "We\u2019d need to ensure some periodic rapid changes to the world \u2014 a significant climate change caused by a volcano or comet strike, perhaps. That would provide evolutionary pressure for adaptability, just as such changes likely did for us.", "In short, we\u2019d need a mashup of current technologies used to build massive online multiplayer games, coupled with some features of VR and reinforcement learning. We\u2019d just need to do it BIG. With a sufficiently complex environment and the right selection pressures, it\u2019s possible an AGI would be evolved.", "The biggest single challenge, I think, is the sheer scale of the required computation. We\u2019d need to simulate a large, complex world, and then many thousands of complex virtual organisms. We\u2019d need to simulate the interactions between the world and those organisms in great detail, and do it for thousands of simulated generations. It wouldn\u2019t be cheap.", "One interesting possibility is allowing people to design the genetics of their own candidate organisms and insert them into the environment, to see how they do. That would add a dimension of gaming to the process, and would have the possibility of speeding the process up. Under no circumstances, of course, would it be a good idea for the humans to interfere with the world itself on behalf of their organism \u2014 the process would need to be allowed to run its course. The Prime Directive from the original Star Trek series would be in full effect.", "Hominids benefit significantly from being able to learn from their parents. It\u2019s not immediately obvious how that would be accomplished in a simulated world. Some basic instincts might have to be hard-coded, too.", "Another open question would be how we would communicate with an AI that we managed to evolve. What channel would they use? Perhaps that would need to be built in to the world from the beginning and evolved along with the organisms.", "Computing power is continually getting cheaper. As specialized neural network hardware becomes available and more configurable, we may reach a point where it becomes very reasonable to try this. It would be a significant amount of time and money, but not out of line with other large scale human endeavors that we really care about. Simpler versions of the world could be created now, with existing software and hardware, to test the idea on a smaller scale. I think it might be worth a serious shot.", "What do you think?
