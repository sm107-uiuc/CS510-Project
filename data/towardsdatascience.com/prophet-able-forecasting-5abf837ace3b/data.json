And with good reason! There are popular options available for performing applying these time-series forecasting methods, both in R and Python. One of the first forecasting tools I started playing around with are the ARIMA and ETS models in the forecast package in R, led by the influential Rob Hyndman.", "One of the most gee-whiz options in forecast is to use auto.arima. The name says it all; it will 'automatically' determine a best-fit ARIMA model, based on the selected information criterion (AIC, BIC, or AICc). Time-series forecasting made easy!", "These days, though, I prefer to use Python. And with another quick google search, I spot a potential Python analog. But for this post, I\u2019d like to spend our time getting to know another forecasting Python library: Prophet.", "Introduced in 2017, Prophet is a forecasting library developed by Facebook, with implementations in R and Python. It was developed with two goals in mind: First, to create scalable, high-quality forecasts for the business, and second, to have a rigorous methodology behind the scenes, but have its parameter levers be intuitive enough for traditional business analysts to adjust.", "For this post we will be doing a brisk stream-of-consciousness-esque quick-start tutorial:", "If some of the following is a little terse for your taste, I simply followed directions on Prophet\u2019s installation guide. Also, I\u2019m on a Mac, so YMMV with the following if you\u2019re on Windows, etc.", "I went to the Installation page on the project\u2019s github.io site and followed the directions for Python. As mentioned there, the library has a major dependency on pystan. On my first attempt, I actually missed the part where it says to pip install pystan first before pip installing fbprophet (the actual name of the Python library). Of course, I DID THE EXACT OPPOSITE, and things were NOT HAPPY.", "I\u2019m also on the Anaconda distribution of Python, so I was able to eventually get everything working by simply following the Anaconda instructions:", "\u2026and then following any prompts accordingly.", "Once that\u2019s done, do the following:install -c conda-forge fbprophet", "Phew! That was close. I was afraid this post was going to end right here.", "The project site also provides a very clear Quick Start that I ran through to sniff-test that everything worked as intended. I\u2019ll leave it up to you, dear reader, to do the same, and highly encourage it. One can never get enough reps. What I will walk through, though, is another dataset of my choosing, to start getting used to the API.", "For this first dataset, we are looking at a dataset on bike share trips in Los Angeles. I pulled down a .csv from Kaggle. Don't tell anyone, but I believe I'm the first person to have ever thought of that. Just kidding! Seriously though, I would have loved to have scraped something, but ran out of time. So Kaggle it is.", "You can find the data here.", "If you have the Kaggle API installed you can just download directly to your folder of choice by copying the API command:", "and then pasting into terminal and running it, like so:kaggle datasets download -d cityofLA/los-angeles-metro-bike-share-trip-data", "Another YMMV-type blocker: I then had issues with the downloaded file\u2019s permissions when I tried to unzip it. But I resolved it by:chmod 600 los-angeles-metro-bike-share-trip-data.zip", "..which gave me full read/write permissions on the file. Then I was able to unzip it:unzip los-angeles-metro-bike-share-trip-data.zip", "OK! Let\u2019s set up the dataframe for running through the Prophet object. Note that the model is expecting very specific column names and types; to quote:", "The input to Prophet is always a dataframe with two columns: ds and y. The ds (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp. The y column must be numeric, and represents the measurement we wish to forecast.", "Full Jupyter notebook of all the code is available at this GitHub repository (complete with all my false starts!) but a cleaned up version is as follows:", "Next, we\u2019ll run through an example of running a forecast:", "First, let\u2019s instantiate our model and fit it on our dataset:", "The object Prophet has many parameters that can be set to tune the model. For example, seasonality settings such as daily_seasonality, weekly_seasonality, and yearly_seasonality are just some of the options that can be tuned. For example, I think there might be some weekly and/or yearly patterns for bike-share rentals. For fun, let\u2019s see what happens if we set weekly_seasonality and yearly_seasonalityto True.", "Next, we can then perform predictions using the model. the Prophet object has a handy method calledmake_future_dataframe that can create a dataframe with a specified number of future dates, relative to the training data (days is the default periods). For example, below we tack on 60 days after our training data\u2019s last day.", "Once, that dataframe is set up, we can then run predictions on that \u2018test\u2019 set:", "We already got a sneak preview into the predictions by looking at the tail of the forecast dataframe we created. Let\u2019s visualize it though to get the big picture.", "It just so happens that our Prophet object also includes a plot method to do just that! Here\u2019s the plot of the fit/forecast (line (y_hat) and shaded area (prediction interval)) versus the actuals (scatter):", "In addition, there are plots for the forecast components as well! For example, since we explicitly set weekly_seasonality and yearly_seasonalityto True, there will be component plots specifically for them:", "We could definitely use more historical data, but if we take these plots at face value, it appears there is a late summer spike in trips, and then it gradually dips over the fall. Furthermore, during the week, peak riding seemed to happen mid to late weekdays. That might not completely pass the sniff-test of my anecdotal observations if these were Seattle bike-shares, but hey, L.A. is probably a completely different market. The point is though we were able to create some decent forecasts in a short amount of time!", "If we had more time to dive in more we could start looking at the aforementioned parameters to further tune the forecasts. These include not only seasonality for different periods, but specific holiday effects, providing specific changepoints for trend (e.g.you don\u2019t have a perfectly linear baseline trend, such as in the example above), accounting for saturation points, and more. Again, details can be found in the documentation, and I would highly encourage reading the white paper to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying methodologies.", "That\u2019s all we have time for, I hope this has been useful.
