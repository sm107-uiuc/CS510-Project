As someone that is early on in their data science journey, it\u2019s easy to lose the forest from the trees. And no, that\u2019s not a pun about decision trees and random forests. What I mean is there is so much to learn, so much to be excited about, but what I think we should all really be focusing on is a detailed understanding of the basics. Deep learning is an incredible step forward in the machine learning domain, it\u2019s definitely an area that piques many people\u2019s interest, even bringing them into this area of study in the first place, but the truth is that few companies are actually applying these techniques. More often than not linear models do just fine solving business problems. My point is you are of more value to a company if you have a solid understanding of the fundamental machine learning algorithms than if you spread yourself too thin focusing on the novel tools.", "I thought I\u2019d add this section here as there are so many definitions that it\u2019s easy to become confused about what is and isn\u2019t machine learning.", "Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly \u2014 Source", "Many definitions can get rather wordy but I think that the quote above sums it up quite nicely. Machine learning is a subsection of AI that aims at giving a system the ability to learn from experience (i.e. learn from data), without being explicitly programmed to behave in a particular way.", "Now this all sounds rather sexy, but a linear regression model does exactly this and therefore it belongs firmly in the machine learning domain. For many, this can be somewhat discouraging.", "We\u2019ve all seen Excel fit a line of best fit to some data, therefore do you mean to tell me Excel is applying machine learning techniques?", "Well, yes, actually it is. But that\u2019s fine. Linear regression has a reputation for being basic and bland but it is an exceptionally powerful tool that is exceptionally undervalued, especially with people relatively new in the field (myself included prior to giving this article thought). I\u2019m using linear regression as an example in this article, but many of the other fundamental algorithms have a similar repute.", "Being a data science related article, let\u2019s take a look at some actual data. The plot below is of data taken from Google Trends showing the relative interest (number of google searches) in machine learning, deep learning and linear regression over the last 15 years.", "Interest in linear regression has remained fairly consistent over this period, which makes sense as its inception was way back in the early 19th century by either Carl Freidrich Gauss or Adrien-Marie Legendre (more can be read about its controversial discovery here). Deep learning on the other hand has only really been popularised over the last 5 years.", "What\u2019s given me \u2018food for thought\u2019 is that despite deep learning being used far less in industry, it\u2019s being looked up online significantly more often. This is understandable as there is a tremendous amount of hype around this topic at the moment, but I\u2019m going to break a data science rule here and suggest the causality of this.", "People are focusing on the wrong things. By all means, it\u2019s okay to have an interest in the most exciting and advanced machine learning techniques. In fact, that\u2019s a great thing as it means you\u2019re broadening your knowledge and demonstrating a keen interest in topics at the forefront of your domain. But this is only okay as long as we are not overlooking the basic algorithms that are the foundations of the data science field.", "A deep learning algorithm is a large neural network with multiple hidden layers. The problem with deep neural nets is that they require huge amounts of data in order to gain an advantage over traditional machine learning algorithms.", "This plot presents the general performance trends we see when comparing machine learning algorithms on data sets of varying size. Traditional methods tend to outperform neural networks when the datasets are on the smaller side, and this is where the problem lies.", "Few companies are sitting on enough data to actually reap the benefits of these brilliant algorithms. Those who are tend to be the tech behemoths \u2014 the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google. The fact is that most companies are still in the early adoption phases of data science and are a long way off from having the resources (data, money and expertise) required for them to exploit the advantages of deep learning.", "Moreover, businesses actually want the simplest solution to a complex problem. Even if a company had the resources for deep learning or any other convoluted algorithm, if the problem can be solved with a simpler model that has comparable performance, you bet they\u2019ll go with that simpler model. Why is this?", "Simple models are quicker to build, easier to implement, more interpretable and relatively painless to update. The importance of this should not be understated. The more straightforward an algorithm is, the more transparent it is. We should always avoid implementing models that are \u2018black boxes\u2019 as this limits the scope of its applications, ultimately reducing its value to us. By using uncomplicated models we can better investigate and comprehend the relationships that exist in the problem we are solving.", "I\u2019ll finish off this section with a quote that summarises the essence of my point in a rather poetic way:", "With sophisticated models there is an awful temptation to squeeze the lemon until it is dry and to present a picture of the future which through its very precision and verisimilitude carries conviction. Yet a man who uses an imaginary map, thinking it is a true one, is likely to be worse off than someone with no map at all; for he will fail to inquire whenever he can, to observe every detail on his way, and to search continuously with all his senses and all his intelligence for indications of where he should go \u2014 From Small is Beautiful by E. F. Schumacher", "Please don\u2019t get me wrong, complex != bad. Sophisticated approaches definitely have their place and we are right to get excited about them. Let\u2019s just make sure that the basics are covered first. Don\u2019t dive into the deep end of the algorithmic swimming pool right away.", "Furthermore, don\u2019t be disheartened if you aren\u2019t implementing the advanced techniques very often in the workplace. How many times on TV do we see lawyers arguing in front of a jury or doctors carrying out emergency life saving surgery?", "Very often. The issue is that these are dramatised representations of reality. Lawyers rarely do this in their day to day work and doctors spend most of their time diagnosing the same routine medical conditions each and every day. The same applies to data scientists.", "We read all the time about exciting developments in the field which can make us think \u2018why does my work seem comparatively mundane?\u2019. Most of our time is spent cleaning and preparing data, then using straightforward models to solve the problem at hand. It\u2019s still an awesome job. Managing expectations is an important thing we should apply in many aspects of our lives, otherwise we could be setting ourselves up for disappointment.", "Thank you for reading this far!
