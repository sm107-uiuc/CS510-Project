In these scenarios, algorithms cannot explicitly access all historical data because the storage capacity needed for this purpose becomes unmanageable. Indeed, data streams are fast and large (potentially, infinite), so information must be extracted from them in real-time, being therefore necessary to learn in an online manner [2].", "Besides, some of these scenarios produce non-stationary data streams which are becoming increasingly prevalent, and where the process generating the data may change over time, producing changes in the patterns to be modeled (concept drift). This causes that predictive models trained over these streaming data become obsolete, and then they are not able to adapt to the new distribution. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new algorithms that detect and/or adapt to these changes as fast as possible, while maintaining good performance scores [3].", "The computational power of bio-inspired systems has attracted increasing attention from research community. Despite the lack of consensus about the information processing involved in brain, biological processes have served asreference for recent computational models. Considered nowadays as the third generation of Artificial Neural Networks, the advent of SNNs was propelled by the need for a better understanding of the information processing skills of themammalian brain, for which the community committed itself to the development of more complex biologically connectionist systems.", "SNNs contain a set of computational units (neurons) interconnected via directed edges (synapses between neurons) which process information according to a specified set of rules and equations (the model of information processing in neural circuits). Different choices for their connectivity or dynamics have given rise to a vast range of different types of models (such as Izhikevich, Hodgkin\u2013Huxley, or Leaky Integrate-and-Fire models) which have been thoroughly studied in computer science over the last decades, and which have enjoyed a revived interest in recent years due to the success ofDeep Learning [5].", "Before presenting the input data to the SNN, it must be encoded into spike trains in order to apply the neuron model. The encoding part aims to generate spiking patterns that represent the input stimuli, and this is still an open issue in neuroscience (what is the information contained in such a spatio-temporal pattern of spikes?, what is the code used by neurons to transmit that information?, or how might other neurons decode the signal?). It becomes crucial to generate spike trains such that the taskrelevant information content of the input stimuli is preserved. Thus, the decision of what information is lost, what is preserved and how effective the encoding was, is not trivial [6].", "Many practical applications of SNNs can be found in the fields of motor control, robotics control based, trajectory tracking, decision making with application to financial market, spatial navigation and path planning, decision making and action selection, rehabilitation, image and odor recognition, spatial navigation and mental exploration of the environment, etc.", "Some SNNs are especially well-known in the SL research community for their ability to learn continuously and incrementally, which account for their continuous adaptability to non-stationary and evolving environments. Besides, they have shown the ability to capture temporal associations between temporal variables in streaming data. In addition, SNNs have optimal characteristics for hardware implementation, which is an interesting topic because online operation can be achieved and embedded hardware systems, enlarging the number of applications where SNNs can be applied (e.g. a custom VLSI chip).", "Data streams may exhibit temporal dependencies between class labels, which can help to determine how the input features relate with each other over time. SNNs leverage spike information representation so as to build spike-time learning rules that have shown the ability to capture temporal associationsbetween temporal variables in streaming data. The use of some SNNs (e.g. evolving SNNs [7]) in SL [8] allows for a very fast real-time and reducing the computational complexity of the learning process, given its locality which lends itself well for parallel implementation. In terms of adaptation to the drift, most off-the-shelf classification models need to be retrained if they are used in changing environments, and fail to scale properly. Some SNNs can overcome this drawback, e.g. the evolving nature of eSNNs (based on the merging process of similar neurons) makes possible the accumulation of knowledge as data become available, without the requirement of storing andretraining the model with past samples.", "SL is a very hot topic in the research community due to the large number of real applications based on stream data, even more in those scenarios where data are affected by non-stationary events, provoking the so-called concept drift. SNNs are considered the third generation of neural networks, and have revealed themselves as one of the most successful approaches to model the behavior and learning potential of the brain, allowing for a very fast real-time simulation of large networks and a low computational cost. They have also shown a very good behavior in drift detection [9] and drift adaptation [8] situations, often present in SL scenarios. All of this leads us to consider both fields in an incredibly interesting intersection. Still, much progress has to be made in both fields for tackling their respective open challenges, but we should be aware of the importance of merging SL and SNNs in order to solve real problems with the computational power of these bio-inspired systems.", "I would like to thank the rest of the research team (Javier Del Ser from TECNALIA, Albert Bifet from T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris and University of Waikato, and Nikola Kasabov from the Auckland University of Technology).", "[4] Gerstner, W., & Kistler, W.
