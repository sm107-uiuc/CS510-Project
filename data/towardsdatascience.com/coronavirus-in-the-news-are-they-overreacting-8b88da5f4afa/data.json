Please try to keep this context in mind while reading. Thank you \u2014 Tom Sharp.]", "With the onset of Coronavirus (COVID-19), many people are turning to the media to assess the severity of the situation. Some are saying that the media is overreacting, portraying a situation that is far worse than reality. Others believe that the media is strictly portraying the facts, i.e., not trying to persuade us one way or another. How can we determine which is actually happening?", "As someone who\u2019s data-driven, I set out on a mission to assess just how well the media has been reacting over the past few months. A week ago, I built a few different web scrapers to collect the links to any article that referenced Coronavirus and then gathered the contents of those articles in a database. Using these articles, I was able to analyze if, and how much, the media is overreacting to COVID-19.", "Before even starting to analyze the article data, I had to determine what I was actually looking for. How do you quantify how well a body of text reacts to a situation? To do so, I settled on a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique \u2014 sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis allows us to infer the view, attitude, or feeling of a body of text towards a particular situation.", "My Python library of choice for sentiment analysis is TextBlob. TextBlob is an NLP package that is highly regarded for its simplistic yet rich sentiment analysis. TextBlob analyzes a body of text and outputs both a subjectivity and polarity score for that text. By evaluating these metrics for a Coronavirus article, we can determine how subjective and/or negative said article is, which can be an indication of the author \u201coverreacting\u201d to the situation.", "With that, let\u2019s get into analyzing some articles!", "Using Python, I was able to pull the Coronavirus articles from two different news sites. These articles range back from the beginning of January 2020, when the virus was starting to be discussed in mainstream media.", "For each of the articles, I stored the metadata (authors, date, link, site, etc.) as well as the actual text in a SQLite database. I constantly update this database every day, pulling in the most recent articles every morning. At the time of writing this article, I have acquired 5,451 articles from CNN and NY Times relating to the Coronavirus.", "As readers and viewers of the news, we want to make sure the content we are consuming is more factual than opinionated. Subjectivity is a great measure for this \u2014 highly opinionated articles will fall on the higher end side of the scale (towards 1), while articles that are more factual and portray reality more closely will fall on the lower end of the scale (towards 0).", "With that said, here\u2019s a few questions I\u2019d like to answer using subjectivity:", "Let\u2019s take a quick look at the subjectivity across all 5,000 articles:", "The histogram above shows the distribution of subjectivity across all of the articles. Key metrics from the distribution are shown in the grey box. Namely, the average subjectivity is 0.39 and the standard deviation (std) of the subjectivity is 0.09. Again, given that subjectivity=1 equates to a completely subjective article, we could say that these articles are 40% subjective on average.", "Not bad! This means that the average article is more objective than subjective. Looks like the content we are getting from these sites is worthwhile. You may be wondering though, \u201cwhile the overall average for articles is 40%, does the average differ between different news sources?\u201d.", "While the above analysis is great at getting an overall glance at the articles, it does not distinguish between news sources. Obviously, different news sites and stations have different political slants and styles, so it would only make sense that their interpretation of the Coronavirus situation is different, right?", "Let\u2019s re-plot the distribution of sentiment, this time highlighting the two news sites, to see if we can determine any difference between the two.", "Notice any difference? It may be hard to tell. Let\u2019s take a look at the metrics to help.", "The mean for both sites is approximately the same, at 40%. However, we can see that the standard deviations are quite different. These metrics seem to be giving us conflicting results. Is there another way to quantify how similar these two distributions are?", "The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) test is a non-parametric test to determine if the distributions from which two samples are drawn are different. For our case, this means: is the distribution of one site the same as the other?", "The Null Hypothesis of the KS Test is: H0 = The distribution of article sentiment from one site is the same as the other.", "Using the KS test I received a test statistic of d=0.089 and by permutation determined a p-value of 0. Therefore, we can conclude that we can reject the null hypothesis: the distribution of the first site is different from that of the second. This is most likely due to the differences in standard deviation (as well as potentially other nuances in the distributions).", "Although the two distributions are different, it\u2019s still a bit hard to see why. Let\u2019s slice the data a different way to see if it reveals anything of interest.", "Looking at the distribution of subjectivity is a great starting point, but it fails to represent something we all know: the situation is evolving every day. The number of COVID-19 cases in the US was 0 in early January and has quickly progressed, especially over the last few days. Does the subjectivity of the articles follow this trend?", "To see, let\u2019s plot the mean daily subjectivity over the past few months, and see if there\u2019s any change as the situation progresses. The mean daily subjectivity is just the average subjectivity of all articles published that day. We can see the results below:", "As shown, the subjectivity remains fairly constant, even as the number of cases starts to pick up at the end of February. For both sites, the mean daily subjectivity hovers around 0.40, consistent with the 40% subjectivity found in the distributions above. Not very exciting\u2026", "Let\u2019s get a bit more granular. We can plot the subjectivity of every article on its corresponding date to see the spread on any given day:", "What we see here is pretty amazing. There is a huge shift in the way NY Times articles are written after February 23rd. This also happens to correspond to a large step in the curve of the confirmed case. Before Feb 23, most articles fell within the 0.2 to 0.6 range on the subjectivity scale. On Feb 24, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US jumped from 15 to 51 (a 3.4x increase!), and from that point on the subjectivity of the articles is extremely variable \u2014 ranging the entire scale on some days.", "The effect on CNN seems to be more subtle, if at all present. Even after Feb 23rd, the subjectivity mostly remains within the 0.2 to 0.6 range. It seems that the authors at CNN are maintaining the same level of objectivity while those at NY Times are reacting to the progressing situation, and in some cases writing completely subjective articles.", "Now, some of the NY Times articles turn out to be more objective after Feb 23rd, but the point here is that depending on which article you read, you won\u2019t be getting the same consistency you were before that date.", "Now that we have a better idea of how subjective these news sources are, let\u2019s turn our attention to polarity. Polarity measures how negative or positive a given block of text is. TextBlob ranks the polarity of any given block of text from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).", "I should preface this section by saying that the polarity of any article regarding Coronavirus is, in itself, a matter of opinion. In other words, if you truly believe the situation at hand is something to be worried about, then a negative article seems on par. However, if you believe the situation is \u201cover-hyped\u201d, then a negative article may seem out of touch with reality. The interpretation of the results is therefore up to your viewpoint.", "Let\u2019s run through the same analyses as before, this time looking at the polarity of the articles.", "On average, the polarity of the articles is fairly neutral. This is what we should expect from a reputable news source. The standard deviation is also small, indicating that the polarity is fairly consistent across articles. It is also smaller than that of the subjectivity, meaning there\u2019s less variance in the polarity than the subjectivity.", "Again, we see approximately the same average across both news sites, and this time the standard deviation is also somewhat similar. We should expect that the polarity distributions between the two sites have a better chance of being the same. Let\u2019s test this with another KS Test.", "This one is a bit closer, but with a p-value of 0.04, we still reject the null hypothesis: the distributions appear to be different.", "We see similar behavior here as we saw with subjectivity: the mean daily polarity is fairly constant over time, and mostly remains between 0 and 0.2 for both sites. Thus, on any given day, the average article is fairly neutral.", "Amazingly, the same behavior is also seen for polarity here. After Feb 23, the NY Times articles have high variance in polarity for any given day. However, the variance seems to be slightly skewed towards the positive end of the range, meaning any given NY Times article published after Feb 23 has a better chance of not being neutral, but has a slightly higher chance of being positive. Again, CNN seems to exhibit much less of this behavior.", "Through the use of web scraping and NLP (sentiment analysis), this analysis shows the media\u2019s reaction to the current Coronavirus situation in the US. We showed that on average, articles are 40% subjective and fairly neutral in polarity. We also showed that the articles between two news stations were, in fact, different and that the NY Times has been reacting to the changes in the situation much more than CNN.", "Hopefully, the next time you open a news article, you\u2019re a bit more confident about how well what you\u2019re about to read is portraying the reality of the Coronavirus situation.", "I hope you enjoyed this article.
