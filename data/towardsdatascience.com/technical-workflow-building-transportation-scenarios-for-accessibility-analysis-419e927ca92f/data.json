I ended up using Conveyal\u2019s Analysis tool. However, even with this specialized software, my analysis required a lot of data wrangling upfront in order to build future scenarios.", "Even the best software tools seem to be designed for large cities \u2014 places like New York and San Francisco, where roadways are more or less fixed, so planning for growth generally means focusing on changes to the city\u2019s transit systems. Several accessibility analysis tools make it easy for users to develop and compare transit scenarios. It\u2019s a huge benefit to be able to leverage these tools for other contexts. But smaller cities have additional needs that aren\u2019t so easily addressed by these tools.", "In places like Bend, planning for growth heavily focuses on new infrastructure: building new roadway, bike, and pedestrian facilities. None of the accessibility tools that I considered had a built-in functionality to add or modify roadways; users could only run scenarios on the current road network*. Moreover, there wasn\u2019t (at the time I looked) functionality to evaluate the bike network based on the level of traffic stress of roadways, in order to get a sense of what connectivity looks like for the average person on a bike. In order to incorporate accessibility analysis into our process, we needed to be able to tackle these kinds of scenarios.", "*Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to more technical, do-it-yourself tools (i.e. anything that exists as code on Github and can\u2019t be accessed through a user-friendly GUI). These may be great but they just aren\u2019t usable for the majority of urban planners working in cities (let alone smaller cities).", "Using a combination of tools, it\u2019s possible to prepare custom road and bike networks for evaluation. This post documents the workflow I used in order to apply Analysis to our particular needs. This approach is essentially about building scenarios with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, so it would also work for other planning tools that use OSM data as an input (which is fairly common, especially for open source tools).", "This post documents the workflow used for Bend \u2014 partly for our own internal reference, and also in case it\u2019s useful for anyone else out there.", "Aside from the technical workflow itself, this process highlighted a few points:", "Without further ado\u2026 here\u2019s the workflow I used:", "A lot of these tools use OpenStreetMap (OSM) as input data for the local road network. I wanted to check how accurate OSM was for my local area and map any roads that were missing.", "A great way to learn about OSM and how to edit it is learnosm.org. For those who are new to OSM, I wouldn\u2019t recommend making big changes (like deleting or moving existing features) across your city\u2019s road network \u2014 it is probably close enough as-is\u2026 and it\u2019s easy to break things. Adding missing roads and paths is probably helpful, though.", "I used the HOT Tasking Manager to grid Bend into reasonable chunks (\u201ctasks\u201d). For each task, I used JOSM (with the shapefile plug-in) to compare the city\u2019s GIS data to what was in OSM and the satellite imagery, and I added in any missing paths, roads, etc. I marked it as \u201cDone\u201d and moved on to the next task. While I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a more technical, GIS-y way to do this comparison, the city is small enough that I could quickly work through it.", "OSM was very accurate for the majority of Bend; I only found a handful of new roads that were not yet mapped, and it contained detailed alleyways and service roads. I did add a lot of footpaths, though. These were particularly important for areas like the local community college, which is on a large land parcel that\u2019s crisscrossed with many footpaths (aka \u201csocial trails\u201d). While not official trails, these are a realistic way that many people access the college. Without tracing these paths into OSM, pedestrian accessibility would be much lower (especially if you\u2019re using a tool that uses a centroid-based approach to locating jobs within a parcel, block, or tract).", "Examining the entire city systematically meant that I was very confident about the accuracy of local OSM data. But it was a lot of time spent (>8 hours of multitasking during meetings) for not a lot of changes. If I were to do this again, I would still manually look at the data but I would only focus on inspecting OSM for areas with very recent development, and areas with large land parcels.", "I saved my changes and uploaded into OSM. Conveyal\u2019s Analysis tool requires that OSM data be provided in PBF format, which is just a compressed version of the OSM data. There are a few ways to get this:", "This is the time to add other projects or links that don\u2019t currently exist, but would be part of a baseline analysis.", "For Bend, this meant new development in large areas of undeveloped land. I was modeling a 20-year scenario with considerable population growth and expansion into new areas that were just added into Bend\u2019s Urban Growth Boundary. New homes and jobs will be located in these areas, and local streets will be constructed. Planning exactly where these streets will go will be done as part of a local area planning process. In the meantime, I needed to add in some local streets in the expansion areas in order to allow \u201cpeople\u201d in the model to connect from the expansion areas into the city, and vice versa. To do this, I used JOSM to draw roads into the expansion areas, and tagged them as highway=residential. These roads aren\u2019t intended to be especially realistic or precise, and I would never show them on a map as \u201cpotential roads\u201d, but they do serve their purpose as a data input.", "In JOSM, I saved these as a separate file baseline_roads.osm. I made several copies of this to use for scenarios. This data should not be uploaded to OSM since the \u201cdummy roads\u201d do not actually exist.", "Conveyal\u2019s Analysis requires OSM data to be in a compressed format called PBF. To do this, I installed osmium as a command line tool, navigated to the directory with the .osm file, and converted it using osmium cat <baseline_roads.osm> -o <baseline_roads.pbf>", "This PBF file is now ready to use for accessibility analysis.", "Other inputs included publicly-available GTFS data, land use data for population and employment, and a boundary for the area of analysis.", "For land use data: Since this modeling focused on 2040 scenarios, I didn\u2019t use the LODES census data that\u2019s accessible through Conveyal\u2019s interface. Instead, I uploaded a shapefile of land parcels with future-state population and employment projections. In GIS, I stripped this data down so that it only contained fields for population and employment, and ensured that it was projected in WGS84.", "I encountered a small hurdle here because the data contained some very, very tiny parcels (smaller than 0.00001 acres) that had to be deleted from the shapefile before the tool would accept them as an input.", "Using this input and the baseline OSM data, I set up a region for analysis that extended beyond my area of interest. I ran the Analysis tool to make sure that these data were viable and that the tool was working as expected.", "Analysis area: I then constrained the results by uploading a shapefile of Bend\u2019s city limits, plus the expansion areas and additional areas that are projected to have future population growth and employment. I checked the results to make sure they made sense, and then moved on to the scenarios.", "This part wasn\u2019t very sophisticated, but it was quick. Based on the data formats I had, the easiest way to build new road scenarios was:", "The road scenarios were then ready to load into Analysis and run.", "Not all roads feel safe and comfortable to the average person on a bike. In order to model accessibility for the average person, I restricted the analysis to only model roads that are LTS 1 or LTS 2, according to ODOT\u2019s classification system. I developed separate scenarios for bikes using this low-stress network.", "We already had in-house GIS data for the level of traffic stress on roadways in Bend. There\u2019s also another source for this info; PeopleForBikes used OpenStreetMap data to generate LTS estimates for roadways in over 500 cities across the USA. These data are freely downloadable from their site (sidenote: it would be great if LTS were added as a tag in OSM so that this info is more available). This won\u2019t be as accurate as having data based on detailed local information and the quality will depend on the completeness of local OSM data; furthermore, it may not follow a particular classification standard for what constitutes LTS 1, etc (in our case, we used ODOT\u2019s guidelines). That said, this data is a really good start and the methods behind it are exceptionally well-documented on the website, so you can tell why things are classified the way they are. I compared the City of Bend\u2019s LTS data to PeopleForBikes\u2019 LTS data, and it was generally a pretty close match \u2014 see below. In some cases, City data was more accurate or more recent. In other cases (like highway on- and off-ramps), PeopleforBikes\u2019 method led to more realistic (high-stress) results.", "This is where I hit a hurdle. I had at least different datasets in two different formats. My city GIS data were not routable and didn\u2019t have the \u201cdummy\u201d roads created in previous steps. My OSM data didn\u2019t have LTS attributes.", "Conflating data from different agencies/sources, in different formats, is a challenge for cities everywhere. In the hopes of avoiding a manual process, I tried a couple of map conflation tools: Hootenanny and SharedStreets. SharedStreets didn\u2019t didn\u2019t meet my needs at the time (but I have high hopes in the future). Hootenanny is currently in use by NGA, and seems designed for OSM and GIS conflation, so I was hopeful. I set up a local version of Hootenanny and tried loading my datasets. I hit a lot of hurdles here and decided that it might just be a giant rabbit hole (and I was on a tight deadline), so I abandoned that effort for now.", "I also tried mashing up my datasets in GIS, converting to OSM format, and loading into JOSM. This involved duplicate features. I inspected these in JOSM and saw a mess of spaghetti-like connections between the paths that should not exist. I ran the results as input data in Analysis just to see what would happen and the results were really strange. This process was a \u201cno\u201d.", "In the end, I had to use a manual and pretty tedious approach:", "This is now ready for input into Analysis.", "To create the new scenarios, I used the baseline_bike.osm file as a base, and traced in any new or modified roadways and bike facilities that were included in the scenario project lists \u2014 this is the same process as Section 5. I tagged these as highway=residential, to ensure that they were considered as usable streets for bicycles.", "In Analysis, I set these up as new regions. Since the road network only includes roads usable for the average cyclist, this should only be analyzed from a bike perspective. I did not run analysis for other modes using this data.", "I also analyzed accessibility for bikes if the whole network (all reasonable facilities) were low-stress. This post explains why, and how it\u2019s helped to shape conversations around the city\u2019s bike network.", "To do this, I used the auto scenario inputs ( baseline_roads.pbf, scenarioA_roads.pbf, etc) to analyze employment accessibility for bikes. This produced results that were about twice as high as the results for the low-stress-only bike scenarios. This indicates that barriers to bikes reduce employment accessibility to about half of what it could be. It also helped to isolate the potential impacts of scenario projects \u2014 new connections had much bigger impacts in a more connected, lower-stress network.", "Your home for data science.
