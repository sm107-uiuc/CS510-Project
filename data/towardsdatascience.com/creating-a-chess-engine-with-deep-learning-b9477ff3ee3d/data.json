The bulk of the programming and most of the \u201cbrains\u201d behind this is the heuristic function.", "What do I mean by heuristic function? Heuristic function refers to a function that takes certain measurements of the chessboard, gives each measurement a certain weightage, and finally calculate a numerical value of the advantage of each player. The heuristic function in chess usually considers basic things such as pawn structure, center control, and King safety, but it can also include more complex calculations such as tempo and opportunities to employ different tactics.", "A well-seasoned chess player with a decent proficiency in programming would be able to construct a good heuristic function. Unfortunately, I am not that well-seasoned chess player. I have decided to use a neural network to create a heuristic function for me.", "The concept of the program uses a neural network to evaluate the board, which is then fitted with the search algorithm, which checks all future position and finds the highest value, sort of like a min-max tree.", "This script extracts the csv file from my computer, and imports the necessary imports for the program to function. Pandas is for csv data extraction, numpy for the manipulation of arrays, chess for a ready-made chess board and empty lists to represent the X and y values for the network.", "This script is able to transform the class board into a one-hot encoded chessboard. This is done by first accessing the epd form of the board, then splitting it into rows, and finally translating all the squares using a dictionary.", "Believe it or not, this is where all of the magic happens. Instead of using pawn structure and development to calculate the advantage of a player, the neural network will skip directly ahead to checkmates. The dataset that I have loaded up includes over 14,000 games of chess, giving detailed information on the openings and the moves played. The data that I will synthesize for the network will try and calculate the heuristic value, by learning the value \u201cHow many more moves until checkmate for player X?\u201d. It learns this pattern through the thousands of games until it has a strong grasp of the player\u2019s advantage.", "This is a basic convolutional neural network, apart from the use of the hyperbolic tangent at the end of the forward propagation loop. The hyperbolic tangent is used in this case, as the values that are attributed to each board can be between -1 and 1, which perfectly fits the range of the hyperbolic tangent.", "This is the simple training setup for machine learning with sequential keras models.", "This step is optional, it is just to see if the evaluations of your network are logical. When the neural network is trained with the above training parameters, these are some of the results:", "This evaluation is correct. White is in a large disadvantage, moving his white queen into a square in which the knight on c6 can take it. This gives black a large material advantage.", "Keep in mind that the scale goes between -1 and 1, -1 being a checkmate for black and 1 being a checkmate for white", "The reason for this exact value is not clear, but the neural network is a black box: It does not have clear, defined rules that it follows to calculate this value", "This evaluation shows that the bot understands the concept of development and how development can lead to checkmates. White has absolute control of the center, with rook support along the e-file.", "The knight has a strong outpost on the center, eyeing the pawn on f7. With the correct support, the attack on the f7 pawn could result in a fork on the queen and the rock. Additionally, no pawns can attack the night, unless the knight on f6 moves away.", "I won\u2019t go into too much depth into how my deep search algorithm works, but it simply just uses the legal moves from the python-chess library and basic list functions to create a tree of possible moves.", "As I am only using a depth of 2, I only need to evaluate the last set of moves. When considering the worst case scenario for each move, check which one has the best worst case scenario, that is therefore the best move in this circumstance.", "In order to evaluate the board without using other complex iterator tools, I came up with an interesting application of the \u201ctry: , except:\u201d structure that indexes itself into the next list, until a chess board is found:", "This final script shows you the best move for the circumstances given.", "I think that this program is an interesting case, where neural networks are not the ultimate solving factor, but a stepping stone to the final solution of the machine learning problem. I believe that people underestimate neural networks\u2019 ability to bypass complex intermediary obstacles, that prevent one from reaching the goal.", "I hope that more people will use Neural networks as the intermediate step in more complicated projects.", "If you want to see more of my content, click this link.", "Your home for data science.
