Infinitely unpredictable. This is what makes them dangerous.\u2019 \u2014 Daniel H. Wilson", "Previously, I talked about how AI could change the human-machine relationship. I posted the following questions:", "Who should be making the decisions in an autonomous car? Should humans always be able to overrule robot decisions? What if you only have a split second to react? And will the answer change if your loved ones are in the car?", "What about this scenario? If you are going to court tomorrow, will you choose an algorithm lacking empathy or a human judge inclined to bias and error to decide your sentence?", "\u2018Even knowing that the human judge might make more errors, the offenders still prefer a human to an algorithm. They want that human touch,\u2019 said Mandeep Dhami, a Professor of Decision Psychology.", "It seems that we don\u2019t trust machines. There are other examples too: While research indicates that autonomous vehicles are safer, nearly half of Americans prefer not to use a self-driving car.", "We are actively looking for ways to address the transparency and fairness issues with AI. But we seem to be less concerned about the fact that human brains also act like a black box that we know little about. Why is that the case?", "Kartik Hosanagar, a professor at Wharton, suggests that the better-than-average effect is one of the reasons. In other words, we know that autonomous cars are safer than human drivers in general but we think that we are better drivers than others.", "In a study that participants were asked to choose among predictions by themselves, other people, and algorithms, researchers found that humans do trust algorithms \u2014 particularly over someone else. We also seem to be more forgiving of our own mistakes than those of the algorithm. And we are less likely to let machines make decisions for us when the stakes are high.", "Machines do make mistakes. And they will probably never be flawless. There will always be edge cases, no matter how many miles the self-driving vehicles have driven. But are we asking the right questions here?", "Why do we have to choose between humans and machines? Machines make mistakes, so do we. Why can\u2019t we work together to make collective decisions more accurate and less biased? Can we help spot weakness in the algorithms or vice versa? Can the hybrid team of humans and machines generate more diversified solutions and make the world a better place?", "Just as user-centered design can help increase the usability of products, if we want to make sure that AI makes our lives better, not worse, we should really put people first!", "Integrate people into the process of developing ML products. This approach is called \u201cHuman-Centered Artificial Intelligence.\u201d Instead of developing the coolest technology that scientists can think of, focus on usability for humans and ensure effective and fulfilling human-machine interactions.", "A rule of thumb is to assess if AI can be used to either automate boring or dangerous tasks or augment tasks that humans enjoy doing.", "Lex Fridman, a research scientist at MIT suggests to deeply integrate humans into ML model training and real-world operation. By incorporating human supervision, we can better ensure that AI is safe, fair, and explainable.", "Stuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley thinks that we should \u201cput purpose into machines.\u201d Instead of assuming that the machine has perfect knowledge of the objective, he proposed to assume that \u201cthe model has imperfect knowledge of the objective.\u201d", "This leads us to my next point: we need to better define objective functions for machines, and more importantly, our society!", "ML models are guided by reward functions (also called objective or loss functions.) Objective functions define the problems. They are mathematical formulas that determine if the predictions of ML models are correct.", "In other words, they define the incentive mechanisms, success or failure. We want to use objective functions to optimize or reinforce the behaviors we want of our systems, e.g. maximizing retention or minimizing errors.", "However, defining objective functions is not a simple and straightforward task. As I mentioned in another article, model accuracy by itself is usually not a good measure. We will need to consider precision and recall tradeoffs. In addition, we need to make sure that the reward functions generate positive experiences for users, not just the main customers, but all of our users.", "Take ride-sharing companies as an example, while passenger satisfaction is important, driver retention is also crucial to the growth of the two-sided platform. Defining a reward function that creates great experiences for all users could be challenging, particularly when there is a conflict of interest but it\u2019s definitely important.", "Reward functions may create unexpected consequences to others than their intended users too. How do we take the potential negative impact of ML models into consideration and try to mitigate it? How do we possibly foresee and track the impact of our reward functions over time?", "A more fundamental question is: how do we make sure that companies will always have the benefit of their users, stakeholders, and the entire society in mind when they design their ML products? With the current reward functions of the capital market, would companies be incentivized to design the right ML system?", "If retaining users can increase companies\u2019 profits, would they care about the negative impact of users spending too much time online? Would they allocate enough resources to help their employees transition to their next roles as more tasks get automated? If the only objective of companies is to maximize their shareholder values, would they still try to mitigate any potential negative impact of their ML models on its employees and society?", "Losing to Deep Blue didn\u2019t make Garry Kasparov despair. Instead, he started to embrace the idea of \u201cCentaur Chess.\u201d By teaming human and machine, chess is played at a higher level than before.", "Ken Goldberg, a Berkeley Professor also used the example of top Go players competing alongside Deepmind\u2019s Alphago program to advocate for the robot-human alliance.", "Instead of thinking of the human-machine relationship as a zero-sum game, we should shift our mindset and think about ways to work with machines and make the pie bigger together! This is a great opportunity for us to think deeply about what we are good at, what we really want to do, how we can better leverage machines!", "Bastiane Huang is a Product Manager at OSARO, a San Francisco based startup building software-defined robotics.
