Gartner predicted that the applications of graph processing and graph databases will grow at 100% annually over the next few years.", "Over the last two decades, this technology was adopted mostly by engineers and ontologists, hence the majority of knowledge graph tools were designed for the users with advanced programming skills.", "In 1900, 40% of the population was involved in farming.", "Today it\u2019s 1%. Coding is the modern day \u201cfarming\u201d as only 0.5% of the world\u2019s population knows how to code.", "NoCode brings equal opportunities to talent of all trades.", "Let\u2019s just imagine, what impact this could have if the majority of world\u2019s population was able to take advantage of cutting edge technologies to solve top of mind problems.", "Empowering top talent with NoCode approach", "Engineering and programming are important skills but only in the right context, and only for the type of person willing to put in the necessary time and resources. The same could be said of many other skills like business, medicine or the arts. Focusing on coding inflates the importance of finding the \u201cright\u201d method rather than understanding the problem and the path to the solution.", "As we live in the ultra-competitive world, those who can adopt top technologies at a fast pace get ahead of the curve. No-code approach enables users with top skills to adopt technologies at speed.", "Knowledge graphs are a great example. With a no-code approach, they bring the best of the data science world to medicine, finance, business, education and the arts enabling anyone to generate and visualize unique insights from siloed data sources.", "Most organizations today collaborate on critical business processes via email, and spreadsheets stored on shared drives \u2014 sometimes on the cloud and often on employee laptops. Different departments tend to use different technologies. This often creates information silos and makes it difficult for them to share common information. Customer, supplier, accounting, operations, sales and marketing, and product data are often maintained across a range of platforms.", "With no-code knowledge graphs, all the departments in a company can speak the same \u201clanguage\u201d connecting the dots between sales, marketing, product datasets. Collaborators can contribute, visualize and query their data, eliminating information silos and enhancing strategic decision making.", "Similarly, knowledge graphs are used as a semantic search engine sparking new ideas and enhancing learning capacity in education and research. No-code knowledge graphs empower users to explore data intuitively across concepts, relationships, and fields, learning from resources that might have otherwise been overlooked.", "Lastly, simply storing information in a data silo limits its usefulness and value. Particularly, it is nearly impossible to aggregate data from multiple spreadsheets and derive meaningful information.", "With no-code knowledge graphs connecting data sources is easy, anyone working with csv files can import their data, define relationships between entities and create their own knowledge graph.", "Knowledge graphs are best known for their strategic role in development of advanced search engines and recommendation systems, but they also have countless valuable applications in finance, business, research and education.", "As knowledge graphs are gaining its momentum, NoCode approach enables bringing the technology into a mainstream use. As most datasets are siloed, producing an information overload challenge, no-code knowledge graphs are the game changers for collaborating on large datasets without extensive and time consuming training.", "Your home for data science.
