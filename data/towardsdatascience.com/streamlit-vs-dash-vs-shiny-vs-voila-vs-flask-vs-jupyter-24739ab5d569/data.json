Non-technical teams often request tooling to make this easier. Instead of having to poke a data scientist for every request, these teams want dynamic dashboards where they can easily run queries and see custom, interactive visualizations.", "A data dashboard consists of many different components. It needs to:", "In the past, you\u2019d have had to waste a significant amount of time writing all the \u201cglue\u201d code to join these components together. But with newer libraries like Streamlit and Dash, these components come in a single package.", "Still, figuring out which library to use can be challenging. Here\u2019s how they compare as well as some guidance on how to choose which one is best for your project.", "[Do you want more detailed tooling comparisons that cut through the marketing-speak? Sign up to our weekly newsletter.]", "As always, \u201cit depends\u201d \u2014 but if you\u2019re looking for a quick answer, you should probably use:", "Not all the libraries are directly comparable. For example, Dash is built on top of Flask, and Flask is a more general framework for web application development. Similarly, each library focuses on a slightly different area.", "Some of these libraries have been around for a while, and some are brand new. Some are more rigid, and have their own structure, while others are flexible and can adapt to yours. Some focus on specific languages. Here\u2019s a table showing the tradeoffs:", "These are not rigorous or scientific benchmarks, but they\u2019re intended to give you a quick overview of how the tools overlap and how they differ from each other. For more details, see the head-to-head comparison below.", "Streamlit and Dash are the two most similar libraries in this set. They are both full dashboarding solutions built with Python, and both include components for data analysis, visualization, user interaction, and serving.", "Although they\u2019re both open source, Dash is more focused on the enterprise market and doesn\u2019t include all the features (such as job queues) in the open source version. By contrast, Streamlit is fully open source.", "Streamlit is more structured and focused more on simplicity. It only supports Python-based data analysis and has a limited set of widgets (for example, sliders) to choose from.", "Dash is more adaptable. Although it\u2019s built with Python and pushes users towards its own plotting library (Plotly), it\u2019s also compatible with other plotting libraries and even other languages, such as R or Julia.", "Streamlit is a dashboard tool based on Python, while Shiny uses R. Both tools focus on turning data analysis scripts into full, interactive web applications.", "Because Python is a general-purpose language while R is focused solely on data analytics, the web applications you build with Streamlit (based on the Tornado web server) are more powerful and easier to scale to production environments than those built with Shiny.", "Shiny integrates well with plotting libraries in the R ecosystem, such as ggplot2, while Streamlit integrates with Python plotting libraries such as Bokeh or Altair.", "Streamlit is a complete data dashboarding solution, while Voila is a simpler and more limited tool that lets you convert existing Jupyter Notebooks into basic data dashboards and serve them as web applications to non-technical users.", "Like Streamlit, Voila is built on top of the Tornado web framework, so you can use Jupyter notebooks along with Voila to get something broadly similar to Streamlit. But Streamlit is more flexible (it doesn\u2019t require you to use Jupyter), while Voila can be simpler (provided you already have Jupyter Notebooks you want to present).", "Voila uses Jupyter\u2019s widget library, while Streamlit uses custom widgets \u2014 so if you\u2019re already familiar with Jupyter, you\u2019ll find Voila easier to work with.", "Streamlit is a full data dashboarding solution, while Jupyter Notebooks are primarily useful to engineers who want to develop software and visualizations. Engineers use Streamlit to build dashboards for non-technical users, and they use Jupyter Notebooks to develop code and share it with other engineers.", "Combined with add-ons such as Voila, Jupyter Notebooks can be used similarly to Streamlit, but data dashboarding is not their core goal.", "Streamlit is a data dashboarding tool, while Flask is a web framework. Serving pages to users is an important but small component of data dashboards. Flask doesn\u2019t have any data visualization, manipulation, or analytical capabilities (though since it\u2019s a general Python library, it can work well with other libraries that perform these tasks). Streamlit is an all-in-one tool that encompases web serving as well as data analysis.", "Dash and Shiny are both complete data dashboarding tools, but Dash lives mainly in the Python ecosystem, while Shiny is exclusive to R.", "Dash has more features than Shiny, especially in its enterprise version, and it\u2019s more flexible. Python is a general-purpose programming language, while R is focused solely on data analytics. Some data scientists prefer R for its mature libraries and (often) more concise code. Engineers usually prefer Python, since it conforms more closely to other languages.", "Dash is an all-in-one dashboarding solution, while Voila can be combined with Jupyter Notebooks to get similar results. Dash is more powerful and flexible, and it\u2019s built specifically for creating data dashboards, while Voila is a thin layer built on top of Jupyter Notebooks to convert them into stand-alone web applications.", "Dash is built on top of Flask and uses Flask as its web routing component, so it\u2019s not very meaningful to compare them head-to-head. Dash is a data dashboarding tool, while Flask is a minimalist, generic web framework. Flask has no data analytics tools included, although it can work with other Python libraries that do analytics.", "Shiny is a data dashboarding solution for R. While you can use Voila and Jupyter Notebooks with R, these are tools that focus primarily on the Python ecosystem.", "Shiny is a data dashboarding tool built in R. Flask is a web framework built in Python. Shiny works well with R plotting libraries, such as ggplot2. Flask doesn\u2019t have any data analysis tools built in by default.", "Voila is a library to convert Jupyter Notebooks to stand-alone web applications and serve them using Tornado. Like Tornado, Flask is a generic web framework. While it would be possible to use Flask to serve Jupyter Notebooks, you would have to reimplement most of the Voila library \u2014 so unless you have a very specific reason, it\u2019s better to simply use Voila.", "All the tools we\u2019ve covered here can help you access the value locked away in your existing data. One common mistake we see teams make is getting too tied up in choosing which tools to use, rather than focusing on the data itself. While using the wrong tools can definitely hinder your analysis, it\u2019s more common for teams to get bogged down by so-called Bikeshedding: spending too much time debating details that aren\u2019t very important.", "If you\u2019d like to chat about exploring your data and turning it into more revenue, book a free call with our CEO.", "Your home for data science.
