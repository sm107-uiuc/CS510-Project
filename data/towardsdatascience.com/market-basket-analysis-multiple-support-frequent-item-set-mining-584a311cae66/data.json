Some well-known examples of association rules can be {Milk} -> {Bread}, {Milk} -> {Bread, Eggs}, {Bread, Butter} -> {Jam} and the humorous {Diapers} -> {Beer}. Please note that association rules are not commutative, .i.e. \ud835\udc4b \u2192 \ud835\udc4c does not equal \ud835\udc4c \u2192 \ud835\udc4b.", "The problem of finding association rules for a given transaction database (market baskets) is defined as follows:", "a.

This would reduce the no of states/rules need to explore for generating all possible association rules. The Apriori algorithm works by this principle and is executed in two steps", "a.

The Apriori algorithm considers only one support value for all the items in the transactions, irrespective of whether an item is a frequently selling item (such as groceries) or a less frequently selling item (high priced items such as Home decors). So, to establish a weighing scheme for the frequently/rarely sold items, each item is given an individual support. The problem definition for MSApriori algorithm is modified as follows:", "a. Given a transaction database and different minimum input support\u2019s (MIS) for each item and confidence, find all the rules \ud835\udc4b \u2192 \ud835\udc4c that satisfy the given support and confidence constraints.", "b.

To discourage very frequently and less frequently items appearing together in any frequent item set, a support difference constraint \u03a6 is enforced on the candidate item set X", "The task of assigning MIS to items must be done in a meticulous manner. For highly moving items such as daily groceries, a high value of MIS is desired. For not so frequently sold items such as high end electronics, a less value of MIS is desired. One such assignment of MIS can be done using the following approximation.", "The above assignment is discussed in WebMining by Bing Liu et al. An algorithm for solving MSApriori is also proposed in the above book by Bing Liu, let\u2019s call it the default MSApriori algorithm. The default MSApriori algorithm does a scan of transaction database for each candidate item set Ck; k >=2 to compute the frequent item set Fk.", "Considering there are \u2018Z\u2019 number of total transactions in the database and \u2019N\u2019 unique items, the default MSApriori algorithm requires calculation of support for all C2; C2 would have N*(N-1)/2 item sets if the MIS of each item is defined as above equation.", "Similarly, C3, C4\u2026 Ck would have corresponding complexities based on the size of item set multiplied by the number of transactions in the database.", "The proposed improvement to the default MSApriori is to use a look forward strategy of computing the supports of each Ck in the first pass of the transaction database scan, storing them in a Hash Table (Hk) and retrieving them when required. In the first pass of the transaction database scan, for each transaction of length \u2018L\u2019, each Ck (k <= L) is generated locally and the count of its support increased in Hk. So, for C2, the proposed modification would work as follows,", "NOTE: CandidateGen2() directly returns the items into F2, no need for scanning the transaction database again!", "In the Modificaiton-1, an extra sub-loop is added for each transaction to compute the support for 2-itemsets, assuming the average length of transaction is \u2018L\u2019 then this step would add further processing time of L*(L-1)/2 for each transaction in the database. Assuming, there are \u2018Z\u2019 transactions in the database, the time required to complete the init-pass() is", "In the Modificaiton-2, I am adding an extra step for accessing the hash table (H2) which can be done in constant time (TH) in most library implementations.

We would ideally require a hash function that would give a unique hash value for a set of integers, irrespective of the order of the integers in the given set. Generating such a hash function is definitely not a simple task, so I have relaxed the hash value to be a Java object in my implementation.
