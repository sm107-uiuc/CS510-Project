If you are like most people, you have probably gone through early life without even hearing about Excel. You may even have gone to college or university, graduated with top marks and still had minimal experience with Excel.", "That was until you made it to industry and got yourself a job. You then found out that if Excel were to disappear for an hour, the whole world would come to a halt!", "Now, you probably know that there is very little that Excel cannot do! Having spent many years in investment banking, I can tell you that every time I think I\u2019ve seen it all, I come across another spreadsheet someone\u2019s put together! The possibilities are really endless.", "The main limitations of Excel today, however, is around larger data sets. The larger the data set, the more difficulties you face in Excel. In a data-driven, instant gratification kind of world, people want things to happen instantly; they hate waiting! There is also an expectation to constantly push the boundaries and provide ever-increasing levels of functionality.", "At the same time, people hate change. People are comfortable in Excel, and they don\u2019t really want to move away from it. It is, therefore, our job to make that transition easier. Provide more speed, more functionality, without ever leaving the spreadsheet.", "Until Excel can support big data, this is where Python comes in! Integrating Excel with Python allows us to supercharge the functionality we offer to our users through Excel. It allows our users to remain in their familiar, easy to understand Excel-world, all the while Python can take care of some of the heavy lifting! It provides for an intermediate step to this data-driven world until both Excel and our less technical colleagues catch up.", "Let us then explore some of the options available to us, to invigorate Excel with the superpowers of Python!", "Transitioning your userbase from their spreadsheets to the 21st century is not always an easy process. It is a journey that will take time, but it is our duty as IT professionals, to help our userbase through it. A lot of guidance, trust and reassurance will be needed along the way.", "As a first step, you can consider keeping the user interface (UI) the same. In other words, let us leave the spreadsheet alone, but let us move any backend processing from VBA to Python.", "Using a Python package called xlwings, you can seamlessly integrate Excel with Python. Our users can continue using Excel, but each form control button or user-defined excel function can call our Python scripts.", "The application is easy to install, and fantastic to use. I\u2019ve linked my previous in-depth tutorial if you want to learn more about it.", "With the explosion of technology, data and data science tools, a new breed of users has emerged: Power-users!", "Power-users understand technology, data, and they can code. They demand the freedom to express themselves and solve some of their problems. They are more than happy to leave their spreadsheets and use new technologies. So, how do you give them the flexibility to do that?", "Jupyter Notebook allows them to leverage Python and create shareable, interactive, web-based documents which can contain live code, visualisations and text. As for the data that could be utilised for this, you can continue using your enterprise data sources and databases.", "Once again, the application is easy to install, and very easy to learn to use. I\u2019ve linked Semi Koen\u2019s blog post on the subject if you want to learn more.", "Any way you cut it, people are comfortable in Excel and data generation may very well continue being in spreadsheets. As the data required for analysis increases in size, however, one can immediately sense the impending feeling of doom for Excel hell. Data operations will take a very long time and pivot operations an eternity. That is if Excel doesn\u2019t crash first!", "This is another instance that Python may come to the rescue. Using the popular pandas library, one can quickly load data from spreadsheets into either pandas DataFrames or an SQL database. Both of these solutions enable quick, painless data analysis and exploration.", "I\u2019m linking below a few of my blog posts on the subject in case you want to learn more about.", "Before we conclude our discussion, let us briefly cover some of other available popular Excel specific Python libraries. It is my opinion that the libraries we have covered above would be able to cater for most use cases, however, if you\u2019re looking for Excel specific features (such as Formatting, Filters, e.t.c) you might want to dip your toes in exploring some of the following libraries:", "A library to read and write Excel 2010 files. You can write new worksheets, edit existing ones, and do pretty much any operation you can do using the mouse in Excel. Its superpower? It supports pretty much any Excel extension!", "A library for reading data and formatting information in Excel files.", "Probably the most complete all things Excel Python library.", "Formatting, Conditional Formatting, Charts, Merged Cells, Filters, Comments, Integration with Pandas are only some of the features it offers. If you are looking to use the full functionality of Excel through Python scripts, you can start here!", "Excel is a fantastic tool that is extensively used in industry. If you are not familiar with it, you better get started! Excel\u2019s major limitation is big data, but I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long before Microsoft swoops in to save the day. Until then, however, we can use Python to help solve some of the problems we may experience.", "Do you use a different Python library for integration with Excel?
