Similarity and Dissimilarity are important because they are used by a number of data mining techniques, such as clustering, nearest neighbour classification, and anomaly detection.", "We will start the discussion with high-level definitions and explore how they are related.

For instance:", "s\u2019 = new transformed proximity measure value,", "s = current proximity measure value,", "min(s) = minimum of proximity measure values,", "max(s) = maximum of proximity measure values", "This transformation function is just one example from all the available options out there.", "The proximity of objects with a number of attributes is usually defined by combining the proximities of individual attributes, so, we first discuss proximity between objects having a single attribute.", "To understand it better, let us go through some examples.", "If you do not know about different attribute types i.e., Nominal, Ordinal, Interval and Ratio, then have a read at my previous article about distribution of attributes into different types.", "Moving forward, we are going to talk about Similarity and Dissimilarity between data objects separately. Without further ado, let\u2019s dive into it.", "We begin with discussion about distances, which dissimilarities with certain properties.", "The Euclidean distance, d, between two points, x and y, in one, two, three, or higher- dimensional space, is given by the following formula:", "where n is the number of dimensions, and x(k) and y(k) are respectively, the kth attributes (components) of x and y.", "It is the generalisation of Euclidean distance.

Supremum (L(max), or L(infinity) norm) distance. This is the maximum difference between any attribute of the objects. This is defined by the following formula:", "Distances, such as the Euclidean distance, have some well-known properties. If d(x, y) is the distance between two points, x and y, then the following properties hold.", "The measures that satisfy all three properties are called metrics.", "For similarities, the triangle inequality typically does not hold, but symmetry and positivity typically do. To be explicit, if s(x, y) is the similarity between points x and y, then the typical properties of similarities are the following:", "There is no general analog of the triangle inequality for similarity measure.", "Similarity Measures for Binary Data are called similarity coefficients and typically have values between 0 and 1. The comparison between two binary objects is done using the following four quantities:", "An example comparing these two similarity methods:", "Documents are often represented as vectors, where each attribute represents the frequency with which a particular term(word) occurs in the document. The cosine similarity, is one of the most common measure of document similarity. If x and y are two document vectors, then", "where . indicates dot product and ||x|| defines the length of vector x.", "An example of cosine similarity measure is as follows:", "It is a measure of the linear relationship between the attributes of the objects having either binary or continuous variables. Correlation between two objects x and y is defined as follows:", "where the notations used are defined in standard as:", "Until now we have defined and understood both similarity and dissimilarity measures amongst data objects. Now, let\u2019s discuss the issues faced in proximity calculations.", "The following are a few general observations that may be helpful. First, the type of proximity measure should fit the type of data. For many types of dense, continuous data, metric distance measures such as Euclidean distance are often used.", "Proximity between continuous attributes is most often expressed in terms of differences, and distance measures provide a well-defined way of combining these differences into an overall proximity measure.", "For sparse data, which often consists of asymmetric attributes, we typically employ similarity measures that ignore 0\u20130 matches. Conceptually, this reflects the fact that, for a pair of complex objects, similarity depends on the number of characteristics they both share, rather than the number of characteristics they both lack. For such type of data, Cosine Similarity or Jaccard Coefficient can be used.", "These are just a few suggestions to adhere to or can be followed. They don\u2019t cover all type of existing data sets.
