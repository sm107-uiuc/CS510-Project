Doctors often warned me that caffeine was the likely culprit. One time, in 2015, I even listened to them. I gave up coffee for about 3 weeks. Then I realized I\u2019m an extremely unpleasant person when uncaffeinated. So I went back to the sauce.", "Instead of giving up coffee entirely, I settled on a compromise rule: \u201cNo caffeine after 3pm.\u201d", "Adopting the rule didn\u2019t noticeably help my sleep, but at least it gave me an effective retort for the doctor. And even better: I didn\u2019t need to change any behavior to adopt the rule.", "Most days, later in the morning, I\u2019d walk to the coffee shop and order the largest ice coffee I could carry. Then I\u2019d walk back to my desk and wait for the liquid \u201cfocus\u201d to kick in. Occasionally I\u2019d also have an afternoon coffee, when demanded by meeting etiquette.", "This routine was perfectly consistent with the 3pm rule.", "Then Covid happened. Obviously Covid is horrible, but a silver lining for me was disrupting my coffee routine.", "When NYC shut down, my aquarium-sized coffees weren\u2019t as readily available. Without the ritual of walking to the coffee shop or coffee catchups with co-conspirators, the appeal was lost. So I switched to tea, earlier in the morning.", "About a month into the pandemic, I noticed I was sleeping better!", "This lasted another few weeks until we discovered the ultimate lazy-person\u2019s coffee: Wegman\u2019s glorious pre-made jug.", "Suddenly I wasn\u2019t sleeping again. Surely it wasn\u2019t the coffee? Was there something wrong with the 3pm rule?", "I understood, at least intellectually, that caffeine\u2019s half-life clearance schedule meant that some of it might still be floating around my brain later in the day, but until the Covid disruption I never gave it much thought.", "When the sleepless nights came back, I started to wonder. I sketched up a rough half-life model in Observable, tweaked the parameters and plugged in my usual coffee routine\u2026 And it became quite clear that my 3pm rule was total garbage.", "Obviously consuming a hot-tub-sized coffee feels great, at least in the moment. But caffeine in the morning can still disturb your sleep at night. It just never really sank in until I saw it play out visually.", "To make the dynamics of caffeine a bit more visceral (so you don\u2019t have to wait for the next pandemic to learn the same lessons I learned), I\u2019ve put together a simulator of how long caffeine sticks around in your body, and how it impacts an estimated \u201cbedtime.\u201d", "Let\u2019s walk through a few familiar scenarios\u2026", "The chart above approximates my previous coffee routine. At 10am, I\u2019d drink a giant 20oz \u201ccup\u201d of ice coffee. This gives a big boost of caffeine over the following hour and it lasts throughout the day (and into the night). For comparison, 20oz is equivalent to a Starbucks \u201cVenti,\u201d which packs a whopping 410mg of caffeine. (Incidentally, this is 10mg over the FDA\u2019s recommended daily limit.)", "The blue line with the emoji shows when caffeine levels fall below 50mg. This is a loose estimate for when your body has \u201ccleared\u201d enough of the substance to be able to sleep undisturbed. (More on this 50mg \u201csleep threshold\u201d below.)", "What I never fully appreciated: With a 5 hour half-life, a 20oz cup of coffee at 10am (400mg caffeine, assuming Starbucks equivalent) is like drinking a 10oz cup of coffee at 3pm (200mg caffeine). It\u2019s also like drinking a 5oz cup of coffee at 8pm (100mg caffeine). That is, it takes 5 hours for your body to filter out half of the initial amount of caffeine, then another 5 hours to clear out the next quarter, then another 5 hours to clear the next eighth, and so on.", "It\u2019s not necessarily the venti-size cup that\u2019s to blame. In the scenario above, instead of drinking the coffee all at once, roughly the same amount of caffeine is spread out over 3 smaller, 8oz cups, at 8am, 10am and noon. The result is the same because each cup of coffee adds to the caffeine that\u2019s already in your system. In the above scenario, peak caffeine (400mg) hits around 1pm, so it\u2019s 3am before you\u2019ve cleared enough caffeine for decent sleep.", "And then there\u2019s the kiss of death: the afternoon coffee. Suppose you\u2019re disciplined in the morning and limit yourself to 2 cups at 8am and 10am. But then you meet a friend for coffee at 4pm. Even if it\u2019s a small coffee, you\u2019re now looking at 5am until caffeine levels fall back below 50mg.", "To win the caffeine game, you want to get your levels \u201chigh enough\u201d during the day, then \u201clow enough\u201d by bedtime. This depends on a few factors:", "One study (src) compared the effects of caffeine given a 250mg dose and a 500mg dose. According to the authors:", "\u201cThe lower dose of caffeine produced more favorable subjective effects than the higher dose (elation, peacefulness, pleasantness), whereas unpleasant effects (tension, nervousness, anxiety, excitement, irritability, nausea, palpitations, restlessness) following the 500mg dose exceeded those of the 250mg dose. The lower dose of caffeine enhanced performance on the digit symbol substitution test and a tapping speed test compared to placebo; high-dose caffeine produced less performance enhancement than the lower dose.\u201d", "How do you get to 250mg? Below are a few general rules of thumb. (Examples chosen because in my mind I\u2019m still 14 years old, trying to stay awake all night to play Everquest).", "The tricky part: These reported numbers aren\u2019t super reliable:", "So, if you want a more consistent caffeine dose, why not start your day with an ice-cold can of Surge?", "As previously mentioned, your body metabolizes caffeine on a half-life schedule. But while a typical half-life for caffeine is 5 hours, this can vary widely from person to person, between 1.5 and 9.5 hours (src).", "To get a better feel for the distribution, we\u2019ll look at half-life measurements from 2 different studies (src, src), exploring the effects of caffeine on 41 people, divided into cohorts of smokers, non-smokers and people taking oral contraceptives. In both of these studies, researchers gave subjects a dose of caffeine, did some science to determine how much was still present after some time and then reported the half-life.", "The average half-life for the 41 participants was ~5.5 hours. As you can see above, the measured half lives vary both within and between the experiment groups. Between the groups we can see that smokers metabolize caffeine the fastest (between 2 and 6 hours) and people taking birth control metabolize it the slowest (between 7 and 9 hours).", "If you\u2019re neither a smoker nor on birth control (or, if you\u2019re a smoker and on birth control), the above doesn\u2019t give you much guidance. But if you suspect that you\u2019re particularly sensitive to caffeine, you may metabolize it more slowly, implying a higher half-life (or vice versa).", "Many studies (and pesky physicians) suggest that caffeine can be detrimental to your sleep. But just how much can we handle and still get a good night\u2019s rest? What\u2019s the caffeine threshold we need to stay below? We\u2019ve got a few different data points we can use to triangulate this number, from 3 papers and a general FDA recommendation.", "The first study (src) gave subjects 400mg of caffeine 0, 3 and 6 hours before their typical bedtimes then observed their sleep. They found that even 6 hours before bedtime, the caffeine had \u201csignificant effects on sleep disturbance relative to placebo.\u201d For example, subjects took twice as long to fall asleep and slept an average of 41 minutes less per night.", "The second study (src) gave subjects 100mg doses 3 hours before bedtime, then another 100mg 1 hour before bedtime. This \u201clengthened sleep latency, reduced sleep efficiency, and decreased sleep duration.\u201d", "A third study (src) gave subjects 200mg of caffeine 16 hours before bedtime and still reported \u201csleep efficiency and total sleep time were significantly reduced\u201d v.s. placebo.", "This latter study loosely matches up with the FDA\u2019s guidance (src). \u201cA cup of coffee at dinner may keep you awake at bedtime.\u201d In the quaint world of the FDA, a \u201ccup of coffee\u201d isn\u2019t a Starbucks behemoth, it\u2019s an 8 ounce cup with 90mgs of caffeine. To grossly over-analyze this guidance, if we assume dinner is at 6pm and bedtime is 11pm, then 90mg of coffee 5 hours later is 49mg of caffeine still in your system at bedtime. (Hence a 50mg default \u201csleep threshold\u201d parameter for the simulator).", "Your particular tolerance for caffeine might vary, but based on the studies above we can see that even as low as 24mg of remaining caffeine can be disruptive to your sleep.", "Find out for yourself! Now that you know the parameters, you can use the simulator to try different coffee-intake scenarios and see what that means for your expected bedtime.", "Who am I? No, no, who are you?!", "Hi!
