The idea of the game is to generate a fake cover for your own band\u2019s CD following the steps below \u2014", "To start the game we need to get the image from the site mentioned above and here we need very simple web scraping techniques with python. The idea of web scraping in short is, instead of a human browsing and copy-pasting relevant information in a document, a computer program does the same, much faster and more correctly to save time and effort. Even though we are not using web scraping here for data analysis, it is still useful to remember that the web sites are written mostly using HTML and these are structured documents, and not like a familiar CSV or JSON format that can be handled using data-frame library directly, like with pandas.", "To start with, first question would be what library will help us here in web scraping with Python ? Three of the most used libraries are BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Scrapy. Here we will learn to use requests, which will allow us to send HTTP request to get the HTML files.", "First we can start off with getting a random picture from Lorem Picsum website", "Here we created a response object \u2018raw_pic\u2019 by using requests.get . Now to get the information from this object, we need to access the response body and for that we will use content . Below is an example of saving the response object as a .png image \u2014", "I got a random image as below", "Now as a rule of the game, we need to put the album name and band name on this image and for that we will use python image library (PIL).", "First open and identify the image file using Image.open", "Since we want to draw (write) text on this image to complete the cover, we will use ImageDraw module from PIL library.", "This object 'draw\u2019can be used later for inserting texts.", "Next objective is to specify the font directory path for the fonts we will use to write the band name and album and I ask you to play around with font style and be creative. To load a font file and create a font object, we will again use PIL library\u2019s ImageFont module.", "Before we place the text and use these fonts to write, we need to use web scraping again to extract texts from websites, which are written using HTML.", "Like before for the image, here we create a response object for the random wiki page \u2014", "To read the content of the response one can use text as below", "Requests library will automatically decode content from the server. When we make a request, Requests library will make an educated guess about the encoding of the response based on the HTTP headers, which we can see here using r_wiki.headers . The test encoding guessed by Requests is used, when we run r_wiki.text . Let\u2019s check the encoding type", "Let\u2019s see how the decoded content looks like", "I get an output as shown below", "Our idea is to use the title of the Wiki page as the title of the band. As you can see in the above output, the title of the article is surrounded by the XML nodes as follows <title>Menyamya District \u2014 Wikipedia</title>. That\u2019s the usual format for any wiki page <title>Title \u2014 Wikipedia</title>, if we consider the title of the article. Our first job on extracting the title, is to find the XML nodes <title> and </title>. We will use string.find() function to find these nodes but before that as I have used python 2.7, I needed to convert the unicode to string as below \u2014", "After this we are ready to use string.find() and eventually just select the specific part of the XML as below", "Remaining task is to get rid of the unnecessary parts and we will be left with only the title. This you can take as a small assignment for string manipulation with python as there are tons of ways to do this, and check the github page later to compare solutions. We follow the same procedures for the wikiquote page and extract the title which will be our album name.", "Finally, once we have the band name and album name from web scraping, we will write (draw) these as texts in the image file. For this, we will use text on the draw object we have defined before. Since I\u2019m working with only gray-scale images, I can play around with text colors but if you want to have a colored image as the fake cover then the best option is to write text in a way so that it will be visible with background of any colors. Such format is provided by Alec Bennett and you can follow it and improvise. Once done we are ready to check our fake CD cover, and remember that the image, band name and album name are all subject to change on every run. So have fun! Below is the one I got in one such run", "While playing this fun game, what have we learnt so far \u2014", "Quite a lot, isn\u2019t it ? The full notebook is available in my github page. This whole game was a part of the final assignment in Python for applied data science course in Coursera, and as always these courses contain some fantastic lab sessions to play and learn with python. However, instead of the Wikiquote page, we used Wikipedia page twice for the assignment, to generate the album and band name.", "About Me: I was involved in science analysis of CALET electron spectrum to find Dark Matter signatures.
