The link for the same is shared at the end of this story.", "The cybercrime industry has been gaining traction over the years, especially owing to the fact that more and more data (personal and organizational) is available on digital mediums. Today, the issues posed by cybercrime cause companies to bleed millions of dollars across the globe. In a study conducted across 507 organizations in 16 countries and regions across 17 industries by the Ponemon Institute, it was defined that the global average cost of data breach for 2019 stands at $3.92 Million, a 1.5% increase from the 2018 estimate. Organizations worldwide are heavily investing into the capabilities of predictive analytics using machine learning and artificial intelligence to mitigate these challenges.", "As per a report by Capgemini Research Institute (2019), 48% of organizations say that their budget for implementation of predictive analytics in cybersecurity will increase by 29% in the fiscal year 2020. 56% of senior executives say that cybersecurity analysts are overworked and close to a quarter of them are not able to successfully investigate all identified issues. 64% of organizations say that predictive analytics lowers the cost of threat detection and response and reduces the overall detection time by up to 12%.", "Considering the above, the application of predictive analytics into investigating the endpoints which are likely to be infected by malware becomes imperative for organizations in the long run. The study explores this objective, using the knowledge of the specifications of certain hardware and software aspects of an organization\u2019s endpoint (Desktops, Laptops, Mobiles, Servers, etc.).", "The data has a mixture of both categorical and numerical variables. In this study, one of the primary challenges faced was the presence of a large percentage of missing data in the dataset. The data upon further analysis was categorized as Missing at Random (MAR). The variables in the dataset are:", "Missing data or missing values is nothing but the absence of data value in a variable of interest for the study being performed. It brings about several issues while performing statistical analysis.", "Most statistical analysis methods reject the missing values, thus reducing the size of the dataset to work with. Often, having not enough data to work with creates models that produces results which are statistically not significant. Also, missing data might lead to cases where the results are misleading. Results are often biased towards certain segment/segments that are overrepresented in the population.", "The classification of missing data was first discussed by Rubin in his paper titled \u2018Inference and Missing Data\u2019. According to his theory, every data point in a dataset has some probability of being missing. Based on this probability, Rubin classifies missing data into the following types:", "Multiple Imputation method for estimating missing data was proposed by Rubin (1987). The method starts with a dataset that contains missing values and then goes on to create several sets of imputed values for the missing data using a statistical model like linear regression. This is followed by calculating the parameters of interest for each of the imputed data set, which are finally pooled together into one estimate. Figure below shows a pictorial representation of a Multiple Imputation method of the 4th order.", "Single imputation methods like Mean Imputation, Regression Imputation, etc. work on the assumption that the estimated imputed value is the true value, neglecting the uncertainties related to the prediction of the imputed value.", "The advantages of using multiple imputation over single imputation are:", "One of the most popular methods of performing multiple imputation in R is using the MICE (Multivariate Imputation via Chained Equations) package. The code for the implementation of MICE on our dataset is shared below:", "Ensemble learning methods use the combined computational power of multiple models to classify and solve the problem at hand. When compared to ordinary learning algorithms that create only one learning model, ensemble learning methods create multiple such models and combine them to make the final model that makes more efficient classifications. Ensemble learning is also called as committee-based learning or learning multiple classifier systems.", "Ensemble learning methods are used and appreciated because of their ability to boost the performance of weak learners, often known as base learners. This in turn produces predictions with higher accuracy and stronger generalization performance. The models created also are more robust in nature and respond well to noise in data.", "Bagging is an acronym for Bootstrap Aggregating and is used to solve both classification and regression problems. The method of Bagging involves creating multiple samples which are random in nature with replacement. These samples are used to create models, the results from which are amalgamated together. The advantage of using Bagging algorithms lies in the fact that they reduce the chances of a predictive model overfitting the data. Since every model is built on a different set of data, the variance error component of the reducible error in the model is low, which means that the model handles the variance in test data well.For this study, we use two bagging algorithms, the Bagged CART Algorithm and the Random Forest Algorithm.", "Boosting ensemble learning works on an iterative approach of adjusting weights of an observation present in the training dataset based upon the performance of the previous classification model. The weight for an observation is increased if it is classified incorrectly and decreased if classified correctly. Boosting ensemble learning has it\u2019s in advantage in cases where the bias error component of reducible error is high. Boosting decreases this bias error and helps in building stronger predictive models.For this study, we use two bagging algorithms, the C5.0 Decision Trees Boosting Algorithm & Stochastic Grading Boosting Algorithm.", "The R code for the various models used is given below:", "After applying various ensemble models, it is found that the Stochastic Gradient Boosting model with a tree depth of 3 and number of trees as 100 gives the best values of accuracy and the Area Under the ROC curve.", "The study works towards establishing the hypothesis that with the correct knowledge of the specifications of organizational endpoints (both software and hardware), it is possible to predict the likeliness of an endpoint to get infected by malware attacks and other cybersecurity threats. In order to achieve the aim of this study, several real-life challenges related to data were faced, like understanding missing data, the imputation of missing data using multiple imputation technique, challenges with cross validation of data and performance evaluation of the models.", "The list of variables used in the study for building the model is not exhaustive in nature, several new metrics and variables can be added based upon the availability and applicability with respect to various organizations to build more accurate and robust models.", "Inviting you to check out the GitHub repo for the above analysis!", "Your home for data science.
