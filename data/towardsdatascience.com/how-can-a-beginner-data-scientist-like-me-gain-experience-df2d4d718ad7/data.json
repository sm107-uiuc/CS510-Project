So you might ask, \u201cWell then, why I would I take advice from someone not going for a job?\u201d.", "And you\u2019d be right in asking that.", "Always be sceptical of advice from someone who hasn\u2019t learned it through their own experience. My explanation is, no job I\u2019ve found suits me, so I created my own (this could be an article on its own, in fact, my advice is: don\u2019t get a job, start a business instead).", "However, if I was going for a role (and in turn, the experience it requires), here\u2019s what I\u2019d do.", "Online courses are commodities (a very common thing). Yes, I say this as someone who teaches an online machine learning course.", "An online course creates foundation knowledge, working on projects of your own creates specific knowledge (knowledge which can\u2019t be taught).", "So my first question back to Manuela would be, when you say you\u2019ve done some courses and projects, how many of the projects are projects of your own versus the ones you\u2019ve completed as part of a course?", "Here\u2019s my definition of experience: things you\u2019ve tried on your own (or in collaboration with others) without knowing the outcome.", "How many times did your mother and father tell you that the stove was hot?", "My guess is you never learned until you got burned.", "Listening to your parents is the equivalent of listening to instructors teaching you a course. Sure, you can take in what they say, but until you try it for yourself, the knowledge won\u2019t really sink in.", "So gaining experience (before actually starting a role) is the equivalent of touching the stove.", "If you\u2019re like me and have course certificates and course projects coming out your ass and are looking for this elusive thing called experience, now\u2019s the time to start asking yourself:", "Have I touched the stove yet?", "Find out the ideal kind of role you\u2019d like to go for, then start doing it.", "If this sounds outlandish, treat it as part of your research. If you\u2019ve got the ability to learn data science skills, you\u2019ve got the ability to figure out what different kinds of roles require.", "Let me give a concrete example.", "Say you were after freelancing roles, but all of the opportunities demand experience. And there\u2019s one there for building a computer vision model for identifying whether or not a doctors tool was present on an operating table (this is not made up, I\u2019m drawing this from an actual project I was asked to work on).", "You read the role task, and go, \u201cwow that would be interesting, I\u2019d love to do that\u201d you keep reading and see \u201c3+ years experience required\u201d, and think, \u201cwell, I don\u2019t have 3+ years experience, so I\u2019m not going to apply.\u201d Then spend the rest of your day thinking, \u201cwell, looks like I\u2019m not good enough for any of these roles.\u201d", "I\u2019ve been there. And it\u2019s the wrong thought process. It\u2019s a fear-based decision rather than a growth-based decision. You decide not to apply because you\u2019re afraid your abilities aren\u2019t up to scratch.", "Truth is, many roles involve plenty of figuring it out on the fly (after all, that\u2019s the science in data science or the engineer in machine learning engineer).", "So what can you do instead?", "You could take the job description for the project and build it yourself. Spend a week designing and planning how you might do it, four weeks actually doing it and then a week sharing what you\u2019ve learned.", "Worst case, you\u2019ve spent 6-weeks figuring out what doesn\u2019t work (for a particular problem), best case, you\u2019ve now got something to show someone what you\u2019ve actually done (without the helpful guidance of a course project).", "Something you can say, \u201cI saw this project, took it upon myself and decided to build out a proof of concept.\u201d", "For the doctor's tools problem, you could search the internet for different pictures of tools, create your own dataset (doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s artificial, what matters is figuring out how to create such a thing), build a model which detects whether tools are missing or not and then deploy your proof of concept using Streamlit into a nice user-facing application.", "If a future employer doesn\u2019t call that kind of initiative \u201cexperience\u201d, you don\u2019t want to work there.", "A side note: When Andrei (my business partner) and I hired a teachers assistant for our machine learning course (shout out to Shubhamai), we hired the student who was already answering the questions of others on their own. Shubhamai started the job before he had it.", "Another neglected point. Never see a rejection as a once and forever thing.", "As quoted, some interviewers said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have the experience we want, come back later.\u201d", "Let\u2019s change one word, \u201cyou don\u2019t have the experience we want yet, come back later.\u201d", "If someone tells you \u201cyou haven\u2019t got the experience yet\u201d and you take their word with good faith and go and practice your skills, namely, doing something like starting the job before you have it, you should follow up with them.", "Show them what you\u2019ve worked on (it should be noted: this requires actually going and improving your skills).", "Say, \u201cHey, based on our last conversation, I wanted to let you know I\u2019ve been working on my skills, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve built in the meantime. If you\u2019ve got any openings, I\u2019d love to be reconsidered.\u201d", "Most forget the follow-up. Not just with interviews but with anything. Any kind of relationship can be improved by someone taking the extra step to loop back.", "Remember, many results in life are nonlinear. If someone emails me once and I forget to reply within a couple of months (email is a blessing and a curse for me), I probably won\u2019t reply ever. But if they follow up and remind me of my slackness (thank you), I\u2019m far more likely to reply within the next 24-hours.", "No. Of course not. But it shows far more initiative than just pumping through multiple job postings.", "Many job openings aren\u2019t even listed.", "My first (and only) job at a technology company came by someone seeing what I was posting on LinkedIn who happened to know someone who knew someone who might be interested in talking to me. I ended up meeting this person (shoutout to Cam), who turned out to be a complete and absolute living legend, had a conversation on what I\u2019d been working on, he asked if I\u2019d like to come in for a day next week, I did, then another day and after two days, I was offered a role.", "What should be noted in this scenario is I did have foundational skills, far from world-class, but I wasn\u2019t walking in there not knowing what a pandas DataFrame was or how to troubleshoot and lookup questions on Stack Overflow (yes, many hours of my days, even months into my job were spent researching and Googling things, remember, an engineer is someone who \u201cfigures things out\u201d).", "For many of our future hires (especially juniors), they were because someone knew someone.", "I see it like this: job portals are dead.", "They may work for some but to me, I pretend they don\u2019t. I tell myself, it\u2019s easy to apply through that button, it\u2019s harder to go above and beyond, find the person I should talk to, talk to them, show them what I\u2019ve been working on, take their advice, listen to their feedback, work on my skills, follow-up and show them and potentially get an offer. Whereas, if I apply through a job posting, it\u2019s an instant no (maybe not, but again, that\u2019s what I tell myself).", "Of course, in an ideal world (though, maybe not ideal), companies would hire off talent and ability alone, but that\u2019s not how people work. People like to work with people they like.", "Okay, so how do you get to know someone?", "If you\u2019re going the digital route, keep it simple. Just as you emailed me (Manuela emailed me a very succinct and specific email, as you\u2019ve seen above). Short and sweet. Be direct with your questioning.", "I got an interview at Airbnb because I sent a recruiter (found by doing research), a message on LinkedIn. She replied within a day saying, \u201cHey Daniel, are you available for a call tomorrow?\u201d. I didn\u2019t get the job but I\u2019m certain I got closer than if I had applied through their job portal (which I didn\u2019t even do).", "Again, this process is not guaranteed.", "You may message 100 people and get 0 replies. Similarly with applying for 100 jobs and getting 0 offers. And if your scorecard does end up looking something like this, take it as feedback, your way of approaching things may need to improve.", "Digital is efficient and remote work is becoming more and more of a thing but people still like interacting (perhaps surprisingly to tech nerds like us) with their meat bodies, as in, being in the same room as each other. This means going to events (when social conditions allow), talking to people, going the extra mile to follow up (see above) with Dave from company X who told you about the project he\u2019s been working on for the past few months.", "The tech company I worked for hosts an artificial intelligence Meetup every month. Before I worked for them, I went to one of the Meetups not knowing who they were or that they even existed, 7-months later, I was working there.", "This should be clear but if it\u2019s not, I\u2019ll put it here again.", "If your attempts at outbound opportunities have failed, make them come to you.", "This starts by creating things and sharing them in public (finished or not).", "All of the best opportunities I\u2019ve had in the past 3-years have come from someone stumbling upon my work (I\u2019ve only been writing online since 2016 and about machine learning since 2017).", "Yes, you should have your own blog, use it as the central hub of your portfolio and other social media platforms (you can figure these out) as the spokes.", "Think about it. How do you learn anything? Chances are you\u2019ve searched around, stumbled across a great blog post about the topic and used it in your own work.", "You can become the creator of one of those helpful blog posts.", "This ties back in with the above. Start the job before you have it and share your work on it (there\u2019s your experience). And once you\u2019ve worked on something related to a previous declined offer, follow up and say, \u201cHey, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.\u201d", "Let\u2019s be real, hiring someone without experience is a major risk for any company.", "Because chances are, you will lose the business money in the short-term (as you learn and build upon your foundational skills). So you could think of your primary duty being to mitigate that risk.", "The points above are plenty to get started with. But if you\u2019re interested in learning more. The following resources will help.", "Questions? If you\u2019ve got any further questions, leave a response or feel free to email me.", "PS I turned this article into a video (riffing a little more on each of the points).", "Your home for data science.
