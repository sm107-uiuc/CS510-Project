But you can interpret the texts from a grammatical angle.", "Let\u2019s explore the concealed beauty of the Corpus!", "This refers to the concept of Parts Of Speech in a sentence, which you have studied in your high-schools. Using nltk library you can add POS tags to each word tokens and even phrases also. It is a complicated process and sometimes words are having ambiguous meanings concerning the form of the sentence. Well, the corpus has two types of POS taggers.", "You can use this technique when you encounter ambiguous words. Analyzing the predecessors and successors. It is also specific to a particular language. Capitalization and Punctuation pos tagging are part of this technique.", "One of the examples is the Brill\u2019s tagger. It is a rule-based tagger that is implemented in training data and finds out the set of rules with less pos tagging errors and best defines the data.", "If a word is tagged with a specific tag in training sentence, analyzing the highest frequency or probability, that word will be given a special tag.", "This is also called an n-gram approach referring to the fact that the word is decided based on the probability with n previous tags.", "Running the above piece of code you can see the words and corresponding pos taggings zipped inside a list.", "Here the abbreviations like NNP -Proper Noun, singular.", "IN means Preposition etc. You can explore more about the abbreviations in nltk library as well.", "You can also perform chunking operation to get a group of words. Chunking is used to add more structure to the sentence. You can also add regular expression techniques to form different kinds of groups of tokens or noun phrases etc. It is also called as Shallow Parsing or Light Parsing.", "Here pattern tells that how you want to create chunks from word tokens.", "some handy information about the pattern creation :", "If you run the above piece of code, you can better understand the chunking technique and visualize them as well.", "Here the graph depicts each word with pos tags. You can play more with RegexpParser to understand tokens grammatically and can make beautiful graphs to visualize better.", "You can clearly visualize the bigram approach is forming a tuple of two words and the trigram approach is forming a tuple of three words.", "These are probability models that help to decide the most likely decision, based on both the previously recognized word and the current words.", "HMM is a probabilistic model with a single state variable S and single observation variable O, So that the model will have two probabilistic pieces. Such as", "(i)TRANSITION MODEL \u2014 It tells us about the transition of a state over the period of time.", "(ii) OBSERVATION MODEL \u2014 It tells us about how likely you are getting different observations in a given state. (Refer Below Diagram)", "Below is the pictorial representation of the concept of HMM called a Structured Transition Model. The numerical values correspond to each transition is probability of state at a given time to the current state. Each node is a particular assigned state variable.", "Here S1 transits to S2 with a probability 0.7 and stays in its original state with a probability 0.2. A similar explanation for other states as well.", "Well, this is about the concept of the HMM. It is used in a wide range of NLP projects like robot localization, speech recognition, biological sequence analysis, text analytics, etc. I will discuss the detailed model with coding parts in upcoming stories.", "So\u00a0far, we have only analyzed the words using nltk library. Here I will try to give the words an artistic touch\u00a0using\u00a0wordcloud. It is fascinating, isn\u2019t it?", "Import required libraries as below. Convert the lemmatized texts from each sentence into a string and using wordcloud you can express it.", "Here you can find the writer tries to focus on words like america, india, trade , cooperation , modi ,trump etc.", "Later I will explain HMM, Word2Vec concepts for a deeper understanding of NLP & please do read part 1 of the series for a better understanding of this story.", "Until then enjoy Natural Language Processing!!!", "I hope you have enjoyed the Natural Language Processing Part-I .
