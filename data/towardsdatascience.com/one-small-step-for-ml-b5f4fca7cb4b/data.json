In this article I am discussing another cool new paper: \u201cMachine learning assisted design of \u03b3\u2032-strengthened Co-base superalloys with multi-performance optimization\u201d (npj Comput. Mater., 6, 62, 2020).", "1| How Do We Discover New Materials?", "Imagine you are an aerospace engineer trying to design a new engine for a rocket. What materials would you want to use? To withstand conditions as harsh as a giant rocket engine, a material has to have very specific properties; a really high melting point, low density and chemical stability to name just a few. When you get into the specifics, hardly any known materials are actually good enough which is why we really need to develop new ones.", "Alloys are really interesting; they are materials where the atoms of multiple different metals are all mixed together. Varying which metals are used and their ratios in the composition allows the alloy\u2019s physical and chemical properties to be altered. Superalloys are a class of alloy which are incredibly strong even at really high temperatures near their melting points (think above 1000 \u00b0C!). They\u2019re great candidates for these aerospace applications, but developing the optimum superalloy is actually really hard to do.", "How do you go about choosing the best metal for your alloy; Aluminium, Cobalt, Titanium, Iron, Chromium, Molybdenum or Tungsten\u2026 there are so many to choose from! To make it even more complicated, elements that improve one property of the alloy can cause another property to be ruined. This balancing act of simultaneous multiple property optimization is what makes new alloy development so challenging and interesting. It\u2019s like a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces keep moving. Traditionally this has been done using the normal \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach to lab research \u2014 trying to make something brand new and then testing its properties to see how good it is. This standard research method is so incredibly inefficient and expensive; it can take months (or if you\u2019re unlucky even years!) to figure out how to make new materials when you\u2019re not even sure they have the properties that you actually want. Testing of the new material is then expensive and time consuming and after all that you might have to start the entire process all over again because the material you made didn\u2019t turn out as you wanted it to. There must be a better way!", "2| Maybe Machine Learning Can Help?", "What if we didn\u2019t have to waste time on trial and error? What if we could use ML to predict the combination of elements which will give the optimum superalloy right from the get go? This accelerated approach to research could revolutionise materials science, driving scientific discovery forward faster than ever before. This is the idea explored by Pei Liu and co-workers in their recent paper \u201cMachine learning assisted design of \u03b3\u2032-strengthened Co-base superalloys with multi-performance optimization\u201d. They wanted to efficiently develop a new Cobalt based superalloy with optimised properties for aerospace applications. Let\u2019s take a look at what they did!", "3| What Would The Ideal Superalloy Look Like?", "Based on previous superalloys, a chemical mixture of Cobalt, Aluminium, Tungsten, Nickle, Titanium, Tantalum and Chromium was chosen where the percentage of each element in the alloy was the variable to be changed. With some constraints on the minimum and maximum values of each element, there were a total of 210,792 possible superalloys to be chosen from. You can see why this would be hard without ML!", "The authors had a lot of physical properties that they wanted their optimum superalloy to meet and to computationally identify it from so many choices they first had to set numerical targets. The first thing to know is that alloys can have different phases. Phases are different arrangements of the same atoms. These arrangements can cause different phases of the same alloy to have different properties i.e. different melting temperatures, different strengths etc. This makes things even more complex; you have to control which elements are in an alloy in addition to the way that its element atoms are arranged.", "One sample of alloy material can have regions with different phases next to each other and the relative amounts of these phases affects the material\u2019s overall properties. \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032 refer to two different phases of the alloy where \u03b3\u2032 is the stronger phase. The authors wanted this strong phase to make up the majority (60%) of their optimised material.", "The \u03b3\u2032 solvus temperature is very important \u2014 this sounds complicated but it is actually the temperature at which the strong \u03b3\u2032 would be converted to weaker \u03b3. Since the authors wanted to avoid this transition, they were looking for materials with a really high solvus temperature \u2014 more than 1250 \u00b0C!", "They also wanted wide temperature windows between phases (to make processing easier), resistance to chemical reaction (oxidation) and a low density material (\u2264 8.7 g cm/3) \u2014 a good alloy has to be light so it doesnt weigh down the aircraft.", "It obviously takes a lot of work to correctly find the material which has all these properties from 210,792 candidate alloys. To help with this challenge, the process was broken down into stages.", "First up a series of filters were applied to the choices to rapidly cut as many non-viable options as possible. The authors used their literature knowledge to cut unreasonable alloy compositions. They then used a thermodynamic database to computationally predict phases for the alloys and identify candidates with promising \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032 mixtures.", "They also applied different regression models to the physical properties of known alloys to predict the density and phase transition temperatures of new materials. Six different models (Support Vector Machines, Ada Boost, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Tree Boosting (click on each for background reading)) were tried but Gradient Tree Boosting gave the best results! The image below shows the correlation between the true density of known alloys and the density predicted by the regression model. It\u2019s amazing that the experimental properties of complex alloy materials could be predicted accurately using just these simple regression techniques. This allowed candidate materials which were unlikely to meet the targets to be rejected. Though even after all this extensive screening they still had more than 6000 candidate materials remaining!", "ii. Efficient Global Optimization Algorithm (EGO)", "Next up they used an EGO to find the alloys with the best \u03b3\u2032 solvus temperature because this was the most important property. Optimization problems can require very complex functions to be calculated which is really slow and computationally demanding. Meta-model based optimisation algorithms can really help with this and EGOs are among the most popular. They work by creating surrogate models from only a sample of points and then approximating the function. This is used to adaptively sample new points by calculating the Expected Improvement (EI) and updating the model by adding in the points with the highest EI. This process is repeated until an optimum is reached which is much more efficient than classic optimisation techniques.", "This is pretty cool because even these simple and well known ML techniques can get some really great results in this field!", "The EGO was used to recommend just four alloys with high \u03b3\u2032 solvus which were then experimentally made and tested to see what their actual physical properties were. These results were then fed back into the dataset and the process was repeated again until a material experimentally matching their desired targets was found.", "This sounds like a lot of work, but the iterative process only had to be repeated three times to find some really exciting superalloys. This means that from a list of 210,792 unknown alloys, the use of ML techniques enabled simultaneous multiple property optimisation so that only 12 materials had to be made. Compared to normal experimental work, thats unbelievably efficient and really reduces expensive lab time!", "The best performing alloy they found was Co-Ni(36%)-Al(12%)-Ti(2%)-Ta(4%)-W(1%)-Cr(2%). This material is really great with a whopping 74.5% of its composition being the strong alloy phase (they were aiming for 60% minimum) and a high solvus temperature of 1267 \u00b0C. This result even outperforms some benchmark alloys. Considering that it is also pretty light weight with a density of only 8.68 g/cm3, this is an all round great superalloy.", "This best material was studied by STEM (discussed in last weeks paper!) to show the locations of the different metal atoms in the alloy. If you look at the images below you can even see the different alloy phases (square areas are the \u03b3\u2032 phase and the bits in between are \u03b3) with the different alloy components distributed throughout.", "5| A Few Thoughts On The Results", "Overall this paper is a really nice example of ML\u2019s ability to speed up traditional scientific research, and I would encourage you to read the paper in full if you want more of the specifics. But it doesn\u2019t stop here\u2026 this sort of combined ML/experimental approach is being used to accelerate research in many fields like new drug development and identifying new superconductors. As ML continues to improve, and its potential is recognised in the traditional sciences I am sure that we will see so many more exciting results from this sort of cross-over.", "Your home for data science.
