People are constantly sharing them on many platforms. Rather than letting it be as it is, we can process them into something useful using text mining methods. One famous application is sentiment analysis where we can identify whether a text\u2019s opinion is positive, negative, or neutral. But here, we\u2019ll talk about another method and making sense of it: text clustering.", "As part of unsupervised learning, clustering is used to group similar data points without knowing which cluster the data belong to. So in a sense, text clustering is about how similar texts (or sentences) are grouped together. But how exactly we decide if some texts are similar? How can we tell the machine that the word \u201ctree\u201d is similar to \u201cplant\u201d?", "Think of unsupervised learning as a sort of mathematical version of making \u201cbirds of a feather flock together.\u201d \u2014 Cassie Kozyrkov", "It may be overwhelming for people who haven\u2019t known about text data processing but stay with me, I won\u2019t go into many complex details and just cover the important points for easy understanding.", "You can just skip the code section if you\u2019re not a code person.

Thanks to Dody Agung for creating this Traffic Accident in Indonesia dataset.", "The full dataset contains over 150,000+ tweets (language is in Bahasa Indonesia) with the keyword of \u201ckecelakaan\u201d (means accident). It contains the tweet id, the time it was tweeted, the time it was crawled, the username who tweeted it, and the full tweet.", "The manually labeled dataset is also provided by the creator, containing 1,000 tweets and their flags whether or not the tweet indicates a real accident. Flag 1 for accident and 0 for non-accident. We\u2019ll attempt text clustering using this labeled dataset. Here\u2019s a look at the data.", "As mentioned above, how can we determine if some texts are similar? Computers only calculate numbers, so we translate our texts into numbers!", "Before we get into that, we need to cleanse our text.

The point here is that the word \u201cdrives\u201c, \u201cdriving\u201d, \u201cdriven\u201d have the same context, so we use its base form \u201cdrive\u201d. See the differences between stemming and lemmatization, here.", "Another thing is the removal of stopwords like \u201cis\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, etc. Stopwords refer to the most common words that appear in our language. We see them often and are redundant, so it provides no real information. Hence, we remove them completely.", "After we apply stemming and remove the stopwords, the sentence will look like this:", "drive safe road must each one us whether driving bus car truck two wheeler", "In order to do the mentioned preprocessing, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is the go-to for language processing, but since the language is in Bahasa Indonesia, we use Sastrawi instead.", "This part is the key to an intuitive understanding of how text clustering works. We can easily find the sum, average, and count of a set of integer/number, but what about text? We\u2018re converting them into numbers in this part.", "There are one-hot encoding methods like CountVectorizer and TF-IDF, but we\u2019ll specifically use word embedding on this experiment. Basically, what word embedding do is represent words as vectors in a space where similar words are mapped near each other.", "Here\u2019s an example of word vector representations in 3-dimensional space.", "To apply word embedding to our dataset, we\u2019ll use the fastText library. They provide the pre-trained model for Indonesian language, but instead, we\u2019ll try to train our own word embedding model using the available 150,000+ tweets as our corpus. I\u2019ve processed the text beforehand and saved it in twitter.txt.", "By default, fastText\u2019s train_unsupervised will use the skipgram model and output 100-dimensional vectors. These vectors represent where a tweet is placed within 100 dimensions.", "If you noticed that we didn\u2019t tokenize the sentences, the reason is that with get_sentence_vector, it will automatically tokenize them (split the text into pieces). For more details, the model can be learned from here.", "FastText also computes the similarity score between words. Using get_nearest_neighbors, we can see the top 10 words that are the most similar along with each similarity score. The closer the score is to 1, the more similar the word with the given word.", "Here\u2019s the demonstration from fastText\u2019s website.", "Their pre-trained model even knows that the context of accomodation can be catering and hospitality. It\u2019s even more powerful now that you notice that the input is a misspelling of accommodation (yes, it can handle typos).", "How about our model? Let\u2019s check it out.", "Looking good! If you\u2019re Indonesian, you will clearly say that these words are in the same context. Some words like mobilio, pajero, fortuner, and mpv are actually well-known car model in Indonesia.", "Once the training is done, the model will be used to convert each tweet into a 100-dimensional vectors. Here\u2019s an example of a vectorized tweet:", "That\u2019s a bunch of numbers, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t try to visualize 100 dimensions in your head, okay? Humans can\u2019t (at least for now?), but our computers can handle that just fine! Now that we have created the word vectors, how can we cluster similar tweets together?", "For a refresh, clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm to cluster data into k groups (usually the number is predefined by us) without actually knowing which cluster the data belong to. The clustering algorithm will try to learn the pattern by itself. We\u2019ll be using the most widely used algorithm for clustering: K-means. This algorithm can cluster tweets based on their distance with the cluster centroid.", "We have stored the cluster output where a tweet belongs to. Let\u2019s try to plot it, but how can we make a visualization of 100 dimensions?", "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) comes to the rescue. It\u2019s a commonly used dimension reduction technique. Not all data are representative to the full picture, some might explain something while some others don\u2019t. The idea behind PCA is to extract the principal component(s) of the data. These principal component(s) can be used to visualize our data since they represent most of our data.", "Great, now let\u2019s visualize it in a 2D scatterplot.", "Some data points are overlapping with each other. What if we project it in 3D?", "Did some of you notice that we could\u2019ve just built a 3 dimensional word embedding model instead of a 100-dimensional model then use PCA on it? Let\u2019s try that.", "But, how can we compare which word embedding model can cluster similar tweets the better? This is the reason why we use the manually labeled dataset to predict the clusters. We can check whether or not real accident tweets are grouped and not in the same cluster with non-accident tweets.", "Let\u2019s see the label proportion of each cluster. The first figure used 3D word embedding while the second one used the default 100 dimensions. There\u2019s a big difference in how cluster 0 is created.", "With more dimensions, the word embedding model can capture more information and generates better cluster grouping. The visualization using PCA is just for intuitive understanding. The capability to accurately cluster texts with the same properties/characteristics is more preferred!", "Now, let\u2019s see if each cluster has some kind of characteristic.
