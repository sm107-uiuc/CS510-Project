Although a plethora of artists have already been covered extensively by the data heroes behind this aforementioned articles, the same cannot be said about Spanish speaking (or singing?) musicians.", "When the moment came to choose somebody\u2019s work to analyze, this issue came up pretty early. From there, the decision of choosing Jorge Drexler\u2019s music was almost automatic. One of my favorite artists of all time, Jorge\u2019s music comes from Uruguay; but certainly feels like it does from the whole Latin America. With a mixture of folkloric rhythms from Argentina all the way to the Caribbean and influences from Leonard Cohen to Caetano Veloso, his career spans more than two decades and his albums just keep getting better and better. His lyrics are lauded for being highly literate and poetic and his prose can get pretty unique sometimes. I hope that by writing this article, a little bit of his music will get to non-Spanish ears so they can enjoy it, maybe even as much as I do.", "The whole project was developed using Python 3. I created and cleaned the database with pandas, BeautifulSoup, Spotipy (an amazing Python wrapper for the Web Spotify API), the Genius API and Web Spotify API.", "Also, when I gave up, I corrected them and gave them the final tweaks using Google Sheets and MS Excel.", "Regarding data analysis and data visualization, I used pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, SciPy, Natural Language Toolkit, wordcloud and py-lex. The whole project was versioned with Git and its publicly available in my Github account.", "If you want to know how everything was calculated and coded, if you want to see the exploration in detail and not just the highlights, if you want to clone or fork the project, download the db or simply run the code just click here to visit the repository.", "Like every data scientist/analyst knows (or should know) already, getting the data is not always easy. What it definitely is 100% of the times, though, is time-consuming. How much better would our lives be if we could just google \u201cjorge drexler database\u201d and by some modern age miracle finish 3 minutes afterwards with a beautifully clean .csv on our hard drive.", "In retrospective, this was the moment I started with a rookie mistake. I didn\u2019t plan which were my end goals and what were the best ways to get there. This started just as a little project to fool around with Matplotlib and pandas, it went through different phases and ideas until I focused on this particular one. By the time I decided which was the kind of exploration I wanted to carry out, I\u2019d already done some development which I had to steer into the direction I wanted. The questions I should have asked myself before hand where of the kind of: what kind of data do I need? Where can I get it? In which format will it be? How can I transform it easily? How clean will it be if I get it from source A? Would source B be better and save me time?That being said, I ended up where I needed to be, however there definitely were most likely easier, more straightforward approaches which would have saved a lot of time on my part.", "At first I carried out data extraction using Genius API to get all of Jorge\u2019s lyrics. The API gives you the url for every lyric belonging to the artist and not the actual lyric. So some http requests, Beautiful Soup, and erasing lots of <div>s later, I ended up with a list of lot\u2019s of songs which contained duplicates, covers, live versions and a couple which didn\u2019t belong to Jorge at all.", "After deleting lots of useless features and lots of songs in Portuguese (?) , I began enriching the data by hand (ok, not really by hand but by using a Python script), adding to each song its year and album.", "Time passed and I decided to get data from Web Spotify API too. This is the moment when I realized how much happier I would\u2019ve been if only I had decided to do this in the beginning. Spotify\u2019s data is ordered, neat and doesn\u2019t contain duplicated and garbage songs. They don\u2019t have the lyrics, right, but having a dataframe with all the songs in an album already would have made everything easier. After removing useless features, I decided the rules and definitions to which the study would base its extension.", "At this point, I gave up on Python and pandas to continue my mission and turned to MS Excel, at first, and then Google Sheets to join the lyrics with the Spotify db. To my surprise, both Microsoft and Google need to step up their csv management solutions. MS Excel for Mac doesn\u2019t support Unicode! How can I analize lyrics in Spanish if every \u201c \u00e9 \u201d or \u201c \u00f3 \u201d I get is being transformed to nonsense like \u201c\u00c3\u00a9\u201d or \u201c \u00c3\u00b3 \u201d?. On the other hand, options to import and export csv to Google Sheets are pretty limited.", "After this long and winding road, I was finally ready to start analyzing.", "The first focus was put on word count.", "Once Spanish stopwords were removed (and also some non-sensical terms like the \u201cna\u201d in Estalactitas\u2019 chorus), I arrived to the words most used in Jorge\u2019s songs.", "For people who already know his songs, this alone says a lot.Let\u2019s take it up a notch and treat everyone of this five words as a theme which could present itself while listening to his songs. That way we can analyze how, through time, the usage of each has varied. Let\u2019s take a look at all of his albums.", "We can turn this graphs into a different kind of visualization, to ratify our output from last graphs and maybe find something new.", "An interesting trend appears if we analyze how the amount of words he uses in his songs varied along the years. The top is his 2014 album Bailar en la cueva with over 2400 words.", "Eventhough it\u2019s not monotonous, the curve is definitely growing in value: as years went by, he tends to add more words to his songs.", "Which would be the songs with more words? The following:", "Guitarra y vos tops the ranking for most words in a song with almost 400 words. Following are La luna de Rasqu\u00ed (367), Bailar en la cueva (359) and Movimiento (331).", "The word-counting section wouldn\u2019t be complete without a nice little word cloud:", "Given the case of dealing with strict content analysis, the concept of lexical density is known as the measure of the number of content words as a proportion of the total number of words \u2014 a value which ranges from 0 to 100. As a general rule, if a text has greater lexical density, the more content heavy it is \u2014 texts with low lexical density are easier to understand.", "According to Wikipedia the formula is as follows:", "where Ld is the analyzed text\u2019s lexical density, Nlex is the number of lexical word tokens (nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs) in the analyzed text, and N is the number of all tokens (total number of words) in the analyzed text.", "I don\u2019t know how orthodox this is, but basing myself on Myles Harrison\u2019s amazing data analysis on Radiohead, it sounds like this is just the ratio of words which are not stopwords to the total number \u2014 or could at least be approximated by it. Let\u2019s check how it panned out.", "So, check this out! Big tendency to decrease with time. Lexical density actually goes down from La luz que sabe robar (1992) to Salvavidas de hielo (2017).Frontera (1999) seems to be a pretty consistent album in terms of lexical density, while Sea (2001) is all over the place. Let\u2019s continue before drawing more conclusions.", "Now, Myles invented another metric. Basically lyrical density is the amount of words per unit of time. How fast information travels? How many units of language can you put in a second? The distribution looks like this:", "This is amazing. Let\u2019s bring back some past insights into the mix to analyze this one.", "Now what happens if we graph them against each other?", "By checking the outliers of this little graph, we can see that:", "Well, here we are with something a little bit more juicy than just counting words. Sentiment analysis, according to Wikipedia, is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.", "In this case, I used a couple of really good resources to do this. First and foremost, NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (aka EmoLex). The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). The annotations were manually done by crowdsourcing. The obvious problem with this, for me at least, is that Jorge\u2019s lyrics are not in English. EmoLex has also published its lexicon translated into more than 100 languages automatically with Google Translate. This is definitely not 100% accurate and will make my results a little bit off, but ended up being good enough to get some more interesting insight. Ideally, I\u2019d have a team of people willing to crowdsource the annotations in Spanish\u2026 maybe next time :).", "py-lex is a great python library to parse through this lexicon.", "Checking all emotions present in all of the songs and then aggregating by sum, I came up with a visualization which tackles the first and most obvious question: how does Jorge\u2019s songs feel?", "Jorge\u2019s songs show a lot of anticipation and sadness. This could be seen as eagerness, excitement, longing, melancholy, grief, sorrow, desolation or just plain sadness.To no surprise for anyone who has ever listened to his music, the songs show very little anger or disgust.", "Let\u2019s check which are the words that trigger each of the emotions and sentiments.", "How do this emotions pan out in the albums? Which is the saddest album and which the one that holds more anticipation?", "Let\u2019s check in a different graph how all this evolve through the years.", "To check correlation I used the pairplot tool in Seaborn and calculated each pair of variable\u2019s Pearson Correlation Coefficient, a measure of linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It ranges between +1 and \u22121, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and \u22121 is total negative linear correlation.", "Like my first suspicion, sadness and anger are heavily correlated. Also anger and disgust.Let\u2019s repeat last emotions graph quickly to appreciate the shape of their curves alone.", "Now, let\u2019s go into straight positive vs negative sentiments.", "Using Web Spotify API I was able to extract musical features for each of the songs. To check a detailed description of each of the features, visit this.A disclaimer needs to be made, though: all of those are calculated using either machine learning or signal processing techniques. It\u2019s all automated, so its far from being 100% accurate. I ran a preanalysis by checking unique values and outliers and identified some small errors, like Asilo not being in a 5/4 time signature or La plegaria del paparazzo being marked with a tempo of 192 when it reality it\u2019s half that value.", "Jorge uses two types of time signatures. Those with 3 beats in a bar and those with 4. Most probably those are 3/4 and 4/4, but Spotify API doesn\u2019t provide the denominator of the time signature; so there\u2019s no way of knowing which is the note value equivalent to one beat (Yeah\u2026 to be fare there is: checking one by one by ear.)", "The mean tempo of his songs is 121 bpm. Durante from Sea is Jorge\u2019s fastest song, with a rushing tempo of 178 bpm. His slowest is Hermana Duda from 12 segundos de oscuridad with a tempo of 64 bpm.", "Let\u2019s see how tempo is distributed along his albums.", "Let\u2019s bring some insights obtained before to combine with our next analysis.", "Remember the following? The tendency in lyrical density went up through time and albums, he sang faster and faster. Number of words too, as it was correlated to lyrical density. Lexical density had the inverted effect: with time Jorge wrote less dense-with-content, easier to understand lyrics.", "Now track length, the duration of the song, has decreased slowly with the years.", "Also, the fastest he sang, the shorter the songs got and the easier to understand they turned.", "In music theory, the key of a piece is the group of pitches, or scale, that forms the basis of a music composition in classical, Western art, and Western pop music.", "The group features a tonic note and its corresponding chords, also called a tonic or tonic chord, which provides a subjective sense of arrival and rest, and also has a unique relationship to the other pitches of the same group, their corresponding chords, and pitches and chords outside the group.", "Yeah, you guessed it. Let\u2019s check the distribution of keys over the albums.", "According to our guys in Spotify, valence is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).", "So, now let\u2019s try to analyze happiness and sadness purely from the musical side.", "There you have it. Those are the 5 happier songs musically.", "On the other side of the ring, these are the 5 saddest songs musically.", "Now, let\u2019s go with something more interesting. To finish the analysis, let\u2019s make music and lyrics meet.", "In this amazing article, RCharlie creates a metric called gloom_index which combines them perfectly and finds out which is Radiohead\u2019s more depressing song. I encourage everyone to check it out.", "Come, let\u2019s do the same for Jorge\u2019s songs! I\u2019ll re-scale it so it goes from 0 to 100.", "And now, for the grand finale, let\u2019s check how is gloom_index behaving for each album.", "The happiest are Eco and Sea, so now you know what to listen to when you want to get your mood up.", "Jorge already said it in La noche no es una ciencia: \u201cmaking songs is not an exact science\u201d. Well, analyzing them isn\u2019t either. While this study is extensive, in some places it lacks scientific rigor. Let this non-comprehensive list serve as a disclaimer/apology:", "Taking into account all of this, I definitely learned a lot about data analysis and all of its b-sides like dealing with generating visualizations from pure code, creating and cleaning a database and good practices for project planning.", "I also hope this project can help generating universal visibility to Jorge\u2019s work. Not because he needs it (I think he\u2019s pretty big already); but because his music will surely bring some more smiles into your days!", "I dedicate this project to him as my way of saying thank you.", "Quantifying Sufjan Stevens with the Genius API and NLTK by Jonathan Evans", "Text analysis in Pandas with some TF-IDF (again) by Jakub Nowacki", "Everything in Its Right Place: Visualization and Content Analysis of Radiohead Lyrics by Myles Harrison", "Data Visualization and Analysis of Taylor Swift\u2019s Song Lyrics by Preetish Panda", "Your home for data science.
