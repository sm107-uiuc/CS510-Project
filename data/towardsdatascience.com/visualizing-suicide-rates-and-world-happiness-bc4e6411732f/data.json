However, a rather unknown fact is that Nordic countries such as Norway and Finland have higher happiness scores AND higher suicide rates.", "With this project, we wanted to investigate this very anomaly and explore if there is a relationship between a country\u2019s suicide rate and happiness score by visualizing the vast quantity of data available on this topic. We wanted to see if we could find answers as to why these contradictions exist and to uncover the stories behind them in the form of historical events or government interventions.", "We conducted a literature review and learned that the reasons behind committing suicide can be numerous and very complex. We were clear that the purpose of this project is not to discuss the reason behind the suicide rates of a specific country but to try to understand the variation of suicide rate over the course of the years and to identify potential factors that may have contributed to the change. For example, if it has something to do with global trends such as economic crisis, historical events or government intervention (more examples on this to follow later).", "Based on the literature review, we discussed some possible visualizations that are generally applied in this field of study, including choropleths, line graphs and bar charts. This gave us a good starting point to ideate on the design elements that would accompany it. A brainstorming session led us to quickly sketch out some data visualization ideas to present our data in the most effective way possible.", "The final visualizations are composed of 2 dashboards with their own graphs \u2014 Suicide Dashboard and Happiness Dashboard.", "They both start out with this visualization:", "After selecting a country from the first map above, the next 3 graphs change accordingly to get a detailed picture of what\u2019s going on in that country wrt suicide.", "This viz shows the change in world happiness & suicide rate from 2015 to 2016. The darker color represents 2016 and lighter color represents 2015. Users can hover over the line to see which country it is and see the value of both metrics.", "Users can also filter the year so it will only show the value of the selected year. With both years being selected, users can see the change of both parameters. With the scatter plot, we can easily tell that there is no negative correlation, which means higher happiness score doesn\u2019t guarantee the lower suicide rate or vice-versa.", "2. Suicide Rates by Country & Age (Line Chart)", "To take a deeper look into the change of suicide rate over the years, we created the line chart. The graphs below show the trends in suicide rates from 1985\u20132016. User can also select the country, gender and age group to filter by. An interesting finding is that female suicide rates are typically way lower than male suicide rate from 1985\u20132016 globally.", "3. Suicide Rates Based on States (Choropleth)", "This graph shows the average suicide rate of USA state-wise. From the chart, we could tell Montana and Alaska have higher suicide rates. User can filter to select the year as well.", "After selecting a country from the first map above, the next 2 graphs change accordingly to get a detailed picture of what\u2019s going on in that country wrt happiness.", "This viz displays the distribution of the seven attributes of happiness scores from 2015\u20132016. According to the World Happiness Report, the attributes measuring happiness score include economy (GDP per capita), family, health (life expectancy), generosity, freedom, trust of government and dystopia residual. The chart shows the value of each attribute and how they each contribute to a country\u2019s happiness score for a given year. Users can hover over each bar to see the total value of the happiness score and its breakdown into each attribute. Users can also get a quick overview of which country has the highest happiness score.", "These pie charts allow the user to compare the overall contributions of the seven attributes making up the happiness score of a certain country by year. Users can filter the year and see the values for different years. This is different from the previous one as it is not an average of values and gives a distinct picture of each year.", "5. Greece\u2019s current economic crisis piqued our interest to see if it had any effect on its suicide rate. However, as per this visualization, Greece has actually sustained a relatively low suicide rate over the years compared to other countries we were interested in. Another paper we found confirmed this finding. [2]", "6. South Korea has had a very dramatic increase in the suicide rate over the past 15 years going from ~15/100k to almost 40/100k just 10 years later. There could be several potential reasons for this such as a high unemployment rate and a high incidence of cyberbullying. We found that the government of South Korea has taken actions like building local welfare and safety support systems, providing aftercare for those who attempted to take their own lives and also tailored healthcare initiatives based on age, gender, and socioeconomic status. [3]", "7. USA \u2014 Montana has the highest suicide rate in the United States. It increased from 25.90/100k in 2016 to 28.90/100k in 2017. Statistics show that Montana has less than a quarter of mental-health care providers required to serve its residents. In addition, the strong gun culture, high rate of heavy alcohol consumption, lack of daylight in the winter and high altitude all lead to the high suicide rate. [4] In 2017, facing a budget shortfall, the government made cuts to the state\u2019s health department, including mental health funding, which exacerbated the problem even further.", "Check out the video we made to see all the interactions and functionality!", "Due to the sheer number of countries, we were not able to investigate the variations in all the data and only have information for a handful of countries. Furthermore, it would have been nicer to be able to present this data with more of a visual design element by including some sort of illustration or iconography. However, even with the small amount of data we collected, we still got some good insights.", "USA is the only country in this release that has suicide data for each state. With more information, we would\u2019ve had more data to analyze and find out more \u2018Related Facts\u2019 to support our visualization. Furthermore, this would\u2019ve been helpful for those countries which didn\u2019t have a large jump or variation over time. In this case, the small ups and downs could be due to the individual changes in a few states which may have been easier to point out.", "The datasets we used are only until 2016. Having data until 2019 or at least 2018 may have been better since it would allow us to contextualize the findings better with more recent events.", "Authors: Anavi Kajla & Natalie Yeh", "Your home for data science.
