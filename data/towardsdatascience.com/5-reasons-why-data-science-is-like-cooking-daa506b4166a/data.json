Although raw ingredients may be fascinating at first, the fun doesn\u2019t start until you\u2019re actually able to start slicing, dicing, and eventually serving up something delicious to devour. Most of the time, you\u2019ll end up with a dish, but in the data science world, we call it data insights. In this article, I want to share 5 analogies of data science to cooking which helped me understand the field better.", "Just like ingredients, data are the raw materials. And as the saying goes, \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d. Good data is key to a successful data science project. The output of your machine learning model is just as good as what you put inside it. Hence, it is important to make sure that your data contains enough relevant features and not too many irrelevant ones. Without relevant and quality data, you can\u2019t really do any useful data science.", "\u201cData are becoming the new raw material of business\u201d \u2014 Craig Mundie", "The fact that most time and effort in cooking are spent cleaning and preparing the ingredients will resonate with anyone who\u2019s had a helping hand in the kitchen. This is also true for data science. But instead of slicing, dicing, and marinating; we have feature engineering, data cleaning, and normalization. Cleaning and preparing the data is required before delivering insightful visualizations and analytics that can eventually drive data-informed business decisions.", "\u201cData science is 80% preparing data, 20% complaining about preparing data.\u201d", "A cozy meal for two requires different tools compared to catering for 2,000. Similarly, processing 1,000 rows of data may run on a laptop, but processing a billion rows may require specialized distributed systems and servers. Choosing the right techniques is also important for both of these tasks. No one likes an undercooked or overcooked dish, just like underfitting and overfitting in data science.", "\u201cThere is no super algorithm that will work perfectly for all datasets.\u201d \u2014 No Free Lunch Theorem", "Just like cooking, you need certain tools and techniques, but you also need creativity and intuition. Data science doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, it must relate to other areas for it to have the greatest impact. Packaging the numbers creatively in a way that can be interpreted by others is crucial to getting them to see the whole picture and therefore finding the best solution. When you approach data science in a creative way, the results are often astonishing.", "\u201cTalented data scientists leverage data that everybody sees; visionary data scientists leverage data that nobody sees\u201d \u2014 Vincent Granville", "You can cook something by watching a video or reading the recipe from a blog. But, it doesn\u2019t really make you a great cook. Similarly, you can do some data analysis or modeling by copying code, but that won\u2019t make you a great data scientist. Likewise, completing a course or earning a certificate won\u2019t make you a great chef, and it won\u2019t make you a great data scientist either. It takes years of dedication, effort, and practice. Data science is a journey, not a destination.", "\u201cLearning data science is like going to the gym, you only benefit if you do it consistently.\u201d \u2014 Moez Ali", "If you enjoyed this, you might also like:", "Currently studying data science at CUHK-Shenzhen.
