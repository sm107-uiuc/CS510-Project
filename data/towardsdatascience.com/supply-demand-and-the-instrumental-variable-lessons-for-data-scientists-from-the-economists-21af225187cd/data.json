The smart anklet\u2019s going to have it all \u2014 fitness monitor, a foot massager, and a sleep tracker that will tell your Keurig when it\u2019s time to queue up your morning cup of coffee.", "Only one issue remains. Your friend needs some market analysis to convince seed investors that he can bring the smart-anklet to Millennials everywhere at a price that they are willing to pay. Here\u2019s where you come in. You start scouring the web for data on the wearables industry (Kaggle won\u2019t cut it this time). Finally, you come across some market research data and start plugging away, using what residual information lingers in your brain from your Principles of Econ class to start estimating demand curves. The work seems simple enough \u2014 some basic linear regressions, no need for Keras or LightGBM, or XGBoost.", "So, you start your exploratory data analysis. You expect your scatterplots to show a clear negative relationship between price and quantity and coinciding negative price coefficients in your regression models.", "Instead, you end up with something a little bit more like this:", "\u201cWell that just flies in the face of like 200 years of price theory,\u201d you think to yourself. You then turn to the two reliable friends you always turn to when things don\u2019t work out the way you want them to \u2014 Google and StackExchange. And, as usual, you find that dozens of people have had the exact same issue.", "The problem, it turns out, is pretty simple. Prices are set by the intersection of demand and supply curves. This relationship gives us our first insight. To estimate the demand curve, we need variation or shifts in the supply curve. By observing shifts in the supply curve as they intersect with the demand curve, we can trace out the demand curve. Something like this:", "That\u2019s great, problem solved. Or, it would be if it were a simple feat to shift the supply curve while keeping demand constant. See, although we need the supply curve to shift, we have no way to keep our demand curve constant with ordinary least squares (OLS). Our inability to keep demand constant gives us biased and inconsistent coefficient estimates of the effect of price on quantity demanded. That is, in this scenario, OLS gives us estimates that might closely reflect the true nature of the price-quantity relationship, even in large samples. Rather, we might observe no relationship at all, like in the example below.", "Thankfully, our friends at StackExchange have a solution for you that hails from the minds of Phillip and Sewall Wright: instrumental variables regression. See, at the tail end of the Roaring 20s \u2014 while flapper girls were piling into their Ford Model As and heading down to the jazz club \u2014 Phillip Wright and his son Sewall were pining over the equally exciting problem of estimating the demand for vegetable and animal oils. Of course, their scatterplots demonstrated the same weak relationship between price and quantity that your scatterplots show. So, they pioneered what is now called instrumental variables regression. The problem they faced in 1928 is no different than the problem you face today, except you get to analyze smart-anklet data and they were stuck with butter and olive oil.", "Let\u2019s talk endogeneity. A variable can be described as endogenous when its value is correlated with the error term, u. A variable might be endogenous for a variety of reasons related to statistical bias. Perhaps the most common source of endogeneity that researchers encounter comes from omitted variable bias. Omitted variable bias occurs when trying to determine the effect of some variable, X, on our dependent variable, Y, without including another explanatory variable, W, that is correlated with both X and Y.", "For example, smoking and drinking are habits that are both likely to be negatively correlated with life expectancy. However, smoking and drinking are likely to be correlated themselves as well. Therefore, if we create a model to estimate the effect of smoking on life expectancy without including drinking habits, we might overstate the effect of smoking on life expectancy. Neglecting to include alcohol consumption in our model gives us a biased regression coefficient for smoking.", "Omitted variable bias has a relatively simple solution \u2014 include the omitted variable in the model. However, there are occasions in which overcoming statistical bias becomes much more difficult. Consider the case of omitted variable bias where we simply do not have data for the omitted variable. Another common issue is the case of simultaneous causality bias \u2014 the scenario in which X affects Y but Y also increases X. Economists encounter this issue when trying to determine the effect of police funding on crime. More police should theoretically decrease crime rates, but higher crime rates are likely to invite more police funding to combat those crime rates. In both of these cases, running simple linear regression will give us biased regression coefficients. We have no reason to believe that the coefficients we observe in these models reflect the real nature of the effect that X has on Y.", "That is where instrumental variables come in.", "An instrumental variable is a variable (that we will call Z) that allows us to circumvent the problem of endogeneity. When we implement instrumental variable regression, we essentially look at the endogenous variable and break it down into two constituent parts. The first part is the problematic, endogenous part. This is the part of the variable that produces statistical bias. In the omitted variable bias example, this is the part that is correlated with alcohol consumption. In the simultaneous causality example, this is the part that comes from high crime rates causing increased police funding.", "However, the second part is the unproblematic, exogenous part of the variable that we are interested in measuring. If we can capture the effect of this part of the variable, we can obtain unbiased regression coefficients that allow us to estimate the true nature of the effect that X has on Y.", "Instrumental variables, or instruments for short, allow us to isolate the unproblematic part of the endogenous variable. If the instrumental variable, Z, meets two specific criteria, then instrumental variables regression will give us an estimate of our regression coefficient that is closer to its true value than estimates from simple ordinary least squares.", "The two criteria are as follows:", "An appropriate instrument meets this description: variable Z is correlated with variable Y only through its correlation with X.", "To further understand what makes for a good instrument, let\u2019s look at another example from economic research. Labor economists are often interested in the returns to schooling, the effect that an additional year of school will have on an individual\u2019s wages. However, there are several confounding and unobservable factors that can impact an individual\u2019s decision to attend school for an additional year. One unobservable factor is innate ability. Individuals with higher levels of innate ability are more likely to attend school for an additional year. Because attending an additional year of school is correlated with ability and we are unable to appropriately include ability in our OLS model, years of schooling will be an endogenous variable.", "Therefore, papers like Card (1995) take advantage of geographical data to estimate the true nature of the schooling-earnings relationship. Geographical proximity to a college makes attending an additional year of school more likely. This satisfies the instrument relevance condition. Meanwhile, the individual\u2019s parents typically decide where to live. As long as geographical proximity is uncorrelated with ability, which can be accomplished by controlling for observable factors like parental education and income, then the proximity variable should be exogenous. This satisfies the instrument validity condition. In the context of returns to schooling, geographical proximity is correlated with lifetime earnings only through the positive effect that it has on the likelihood of attaining additional education. That is the makings of a relevant and valid instrument.", "While OLS regression involves simply regressing Y on X, IV regression involves a two-step process (which is why another name for IV regression is two steps least squares). In the first step, we regress X on Z. This gives us a set of predicted values, X\u0302. In the second step, we regress Y on the predicted values, X\u0302. Below is a demonstration of the IV regression process.", "Where v is the error term.", "Where \u03b5 is the error term.", "Because our instrumental variable must be exogenous, the values of X\u0302 that are predicted by the regression of X on Z will be exogeneous too. Therefore, this first step removes the problematic, endogenous part of our explanatory variable, X. This allows us to regress Y on X\u0302 without having to worry about endogeneity.", "Let\u2019s return for a moment to Philip and Sewall Wright. The father-son duo realized that to estimate the demand curve for butter, they needed to isolate shifts in supply while keeping demand constant. By keeping demand constant while supply shifts, the Wright duo knew they would be able to estimate all the points at which the various supply curves intersected with the demand curve. To do this, the Wright duo used rainfall as their instrument. Low levels of rainfall, the father and son reasoned, should decrease grazing and thus reduce butter production. This would impact supply but rainfall should not have any meaningful impact on butter demand. As an instrument, rainfall meets the relevance condition \u2014 rainfall is positively correlated with butter prices. And rainfall meets the exogeneity condition \u2014 rainfall only affects butter prices through supply.", "Philip and Sewall Wright have provided legions of economists and smart-anklet analysts with valuable insight. By implementing IV regressions, using variables that shift supply but not demand as instruments, we can obtain consistent estimates of demand curves. We are now prepared to trudge forward with an example from real data.", "Okay, full disclosure \u2014 I do not have any data on smart-anklets or smart-watches or smart-anythings to analyze for this article. What I do have, however, is a very exciting dataset of broiler chicken prices between 1960 and 1999. Fun, I know. However, the principles of IV regression for estimating demand are applicable regardless of product.", "The data, which can be accessed here, come from Epple and McCallum (2006). The dataset consists of annual panel data of chicken and beef prices, chicken feed prices, population, per capita income, and inflation.", "Below is a scatterplot of log quantity and log chicken prices (with price on the y-axis as is the custom for economics).", "As we can see, this relationship appears to be in the exact opposite direction of a demand curve, as quantity is increasing in price. Therefore, this problem necessitates an instrumental variables approach.", "As I previously discussed, determining the demand curve requires holding demand constant while detecting shifts in the supply curve. As the previous 1700 or so words should have made clear, the key for doing this is instrumental variables regression. Specifically, we need to identify an exogenous variable that affects price only through its effect on supply.", "For the Wright duo and their butter-based analysis, the instrumental variable of choice was rainfall. Low rates of rainfall decreased the amount of land that cows could graze on, thus decreasing butter yields. However, there is no reason to believe that rainfall had any meaningful effect on the demand for butter. For our chicken or smart-anklet data, we need to identify variables that have a similar effect \u2014 inducing variation in supply while not having any impact on chicken/smart-anklet demand.", "The first place to look for the variables in question is the inputs. In our chicken data, we have information on corn and chicken feed. The price of these inputs is correlated with the price of the output product via their effect on the cost of producing the output. When chicken feed prices decrease, chicken prices decrease as it becomes cheaper to produce chicken. Cheaper inputs mean that final products can be produced more cheaply. Profit-maximizing firms then have an incentive to produce more, increasing quantity while decreasing prices. The variation of input prices causes the supply curve to shift, allowing us to trace out the demand curve.", "These principles transfer to the smart-anklet just as easily \u2014 simply replace \u201cchicken feed\u201d prices with the prices of similar input materials such as steel, silicon, aluminum, and crude oil.", "The first step in deploying our instrumental variables approach is regressing price on our instruments. Most statistical software packages have functions that compute IV regressions without having to manually compute the first step OLS regression. However, computing first step regression allows us to diagnose whether the instrument that we are using is a valid instrument for our problem.", "One important consideration is whether or not our instrument is relevant. Recall that instruments are relevant when corr(X, Z) =\u0338 0. If an instrument fails to explain much of the variation in the endogenous X variable, then it is considered a \u201cweak instrument.\u201d Without delving too deep (more information can be found here), the results of IV regression with weak instruments can create parameter estimates that are biased in the direction of OLS. Not ideal. However, a simple rule of thumb is that an instrument can be considered not weak so long as the F-statistic of the first-stage regression exceeds 10. For that reason, we will manually compute the first-stage of the regression.", "The first step of our IV regression approach is to regress log chicken prices on the instruments: log-chicken feed prices and log-corn prices, such that our equation looks like:", "Below are the first stage regression outputs produced using the jtools package. The F-statistic of 287.95 greatly exceeds the rule of thumb to determine whether our instruments are relevant. And, the adjusted-R\u00b2 value of 0.94 tells us that these instruments fit chicken prices quite well.", "Thus, we can move on to stage two with confidence.", "In stage two of IV regression, we use regress our dependent variable on predicted values of our endogenous independent variable and any additional exogenous independent variables. In this case, the dependent variable is log quantity, the predicted variable is log chicken prices. To ensure that our regression coefficients are not biased due to omitted variables, we are going to include additional predictors such as income, inflation, population, and the price of beef. Beef prices are included as they represent a substitute good for chicken. Our model is specified as:", "Where Q represents quantity, Y represents income, and CPI represents the consumer price index.", "So let\u2019s estimate our models. Below are the model estimates for a set of OLS regressions in which I do not implement instrumental variables.", "As we can see in the \u201cPrice Only\u201d model, the effect of price on quantity is positive \u2014 contradicting our expectations of the demand curve relationship. However, when we add control variables in the subsequent two models, the sign of the price coefficient changes to be in line with our expectations.", "After consulting with Philip and Sewall Wright, however, we are too wise to fall for these biased regression coefficients. Rather, we need to implement our instrumental variables methods. When we do so, with log corn and chicken feed prices as our instruments, we will obtain unbiased regression coefficients. Below are the instrumental variables model estimates with the same control variables as above.", "Interestingly, in the first model without additional controls, the price variable has the wrong sign, just like in the traditional OLS model above. This indicates that there is significant omitted variable bias in the price-quantity relationship. The key difference between the OLS models and the IV models, however, lies in the \u201cFull Model\u201d specifications.", "The OLS model indicates that a 1 percent increase in price is associated with a 0.42 percent decrease in the quantity of chicken demanded. However, the IV model indicates that a 1 percent increase in price is associated with a 0.54 percent decrease in the quantity of chicken demanded. The results of the IV model suggest that the OLS estimates of the price-quantity relationship are biased towards zero and therefore understate the effect of price on quantity.", "The difference between the biased OLS results and the unbiased IV results in our example is quite significant, especially to the data scientists in the fast-paced chicken production industry. For your friend in the smart-anklet industry, such a difference would be quite important as well.", "For applications in business, it is important to have an accurate assessment of the underlying market. Your friend looking to bring the smart-anklet to the wearables industry needs to have a thorough understanding of how consumers value price in deciding which wearable product to purchase. If you had provided your friend with the OLS results instead of the IV results from our example above, he would underestimate how sensitive consumers are to prices. As a result, he might bring his product to market at a price that is too high for what consumers are willing to pay.", "So, let\u2019s recap the key steps to estimating accurate demand curves.", "Recall that prices are set at the intersection of supply and demand curves. As Philip and Sewall Wright realized, we can trace out a demand curve by holding demand constant, exploiting shifts in the supply curves, and determining the intersection points. Statistically, we can achieve this by using supply-shifters as instruments in the IV regression process. Key variables to include as instruments are variables that impact the cost of production, such as the cost of input materials. In the technology sector, such inputs might include silicon, cobalt, and aluminum. In meat-products, these inputs might be the price of corn, wheat, or other goods that farmers buy for their livestock. In any case, we need to think critically about what impacts the cost of producing goods in whatever market we are interested in analyzing and then using those variables as instruments in our model.", "Recall our two conditions: instrument relevance and instrument exogeneity. These can be summed up in one sentence \u2014 the Z-variable should affect the Y-variable only through its relationship with the X-variable. In the case of demand curves, the instrument should affect price only through its effect on supply curves. That is, the variation in the instrument should not have any impact on demand. This last part, which is related to instrument exogeneity, is generally not a testable condition. That means that we need to use our industry-expertise and intuition to determine whether our instrument only shifts supply as intended.", "In Philip Wright\u2019s problem, rainfall could tenably impact demand as well as supply. Higher rates of rainfall might discourage market-goers from leaving the comfort of their cottages to buy butter. However, using our intuition, we can conclude that this relationship is likely small, hard to observe, or non-existent. The important point to remember, however, is that we must critically think about whether our instruments meet the two necessary conditions.", "Step 3) Consider Omitted Variables and Model Specification", "Just as simultaneous equations prove to be an issue in determining demand curves, so too can omit variables. As I previously discussed, omitted variables can induce statistical bias in our models and that is why it is important to use control variables, even in IV models. Income is a key variable to include when estimating demand curves. Income is a demand-shifter \u2014 as income increases, consumers tend to demand more of a product at the same price. For market analysts, understanding the relationship between a consumer\u2019s income and their willingness to buy a product at a certain price is a key piece of information. As we saw in our example above, including variables like income and the price of a substitute good can substantially change the regression coefficients towards the value of the unbiased, true coefficient values. Therefore, we should make an effort to pursue and include any variables we think might shift the demand curve as exogenous variables in our models.", "Additionally, it is important to understand the model specification. The two most common specifications are linear demand curves and logarithmic demand curves. The decision about which specification to implement largely depends on which interpretation fits the data better. In linear demand curves, a one-unit increase in price decreases quantity demanded by \u00df1. Meanwhile, with logarithmic demand curves, a one percent increase in price decreases quantity demanded by \u00df1 percent. In any case, we can test which model fits the data better by estimating two models \u2014 one in which quantity and price are log-transformed and one in which they are not \u2014 and comparing the goodness-of-fit measures such as R\u00b2.", "Step 4) Go Forth into the World", "Once you have identified potential instruments, vetted them for exogeneity and relevance, and considered your model specifications, you are ready to deploy instrumental variables regression. Whether you are a startup formulating your pricing strategy or an established company trying to better understand your customer base, instrumental variables can play an instrumental role in your data
