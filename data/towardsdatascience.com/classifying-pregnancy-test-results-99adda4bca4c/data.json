Some people did get it done before Lesson 2 was recorded! I guess it\u2019s not a race, and not being the fastest isn\u2019t a reason to quit. Once I watch the lecture, I have a much easier time figuring out how to work in the notebook, particularly In Jeremy\u2019s \u201cexperimentalist\u201d style.", "First, I need to decide what types of images to classify. Binary classification \u2014 where an image is either One Thing or a Different Thing, not Something Else Entirely, nor a combination of the two Things \u2014 sounds like a good option, but since I need to be able to assess how well the model is performing, the classifications it\u2019s making need to be something I have domain expertise in. I have an M.S. in pure math, and consider doing something involving math, but don\u2019t think of anything between digit recognition (done to death beautifully by MNIST), and something far more complex than I\u2019m ready to implement. I also have three children, and those two areas are probably the two I could consider myself to have \u201cexpertise\u201d in. So, something to do with parenting and binary classification\u2026 aha!", "We think of pregnancy tests as being either positive or negative, but there are also two more ambiguous cases that look quite similar to one another: faint positives, and evaporation lines, which are negative. There exist many forums \u2014 such as PeeOnAStick.com\u2014 full of people with extensive experience interpreting pregnancy tests. One might hope digital pregnancy tests would take this guesswork out of testing, but digital tests often read \u201cInconclusive\u201d or \u201cNegative\u201d for early faint positives, and won\u2019t read give an accurate result until a few days later in the pregnancy, when hormone levels have increased.", "Here\u2019s an example of faint positive:", "The evaporation line is darker than the faint positive above, but this is a negative test! This is the tricky bit. The chart below gives some insight as to the differences between the two:", "The evaporation line is thinner than the control line, so that\u2019s one way we can identify it. However, it\u2019s easy to see how this can be hard for humans to spot, so I wonder what chance my model will have. It would be good to know if a model has already been made to classify such images, so that I can compare my model\u2019s accuracy to that of one previously published, and I find a study that used machine learning to predict the accuracy of pregnancy tests, but I don\u2019t find any studies done using machine learning to classify faint positive vs. evaporation line specifically.", "Having chosen a project, I Google \u201cfaint positive pregnancy test\u201d and \u201cpregnancy test evaporation line,\u201d and follow the instructions in the lecture to download the images for each to .txt files. It\u2019s also a .txt file in the lecture video, but in the notebook, it\u2019s looking for .csv. No big deal to change that, but it\u2019s a thing.", "Then there\u2019s another thing. I follow Jeremy\u2019s instructions, but get the following error message and explanation:", "Okay, so this wasn\u2019t stated in the lecture, but the function we\u2019re using in the fastai library is explicitly looking for a file whose name begins with \u201curls_\u201d. I change my file names accordingly, and all\u2019s well.", "Viewing the data goes fine, though I can see there are some images that\u2019ll be hard for the model to classify, because either the tests aren\u2019t in focus, or the image doesn\u2019t have a test in it at all. Much worse, however: lots of the images that come up when I search for evaporation lines were posted by people asking if the result was an evaporation line or a faint positive, which more often than not were, in fact, faint positives, so those images are going to be in my data set with \u201cevaporation line\u201d labels, but should actually be labeled as \u201cfaint positive\u201d. I predict this will be the most significant source of inaccuracy for my model. I won\u2019t worry about that yet, though; I know from the lecture that after we run the model the first time, we\u2019ll do some hyperparameter tuning and manual data cleaning, if needed (Narrator: it was definitely going to be needed).", "So I train the model, with the following results:", "So I have a training loss of .9, a validation loss of 2.78, and an error rate of .56. Pretty terrible, but I\u2019ll press on.", "I go through the notebook cells dealing with the learning rate, but I\u2019m not planning to do any hyperparameter tuning until after I\u2019ve cleaned the data, since I already know it\u2019ll be messy.", "Here\u2019s the \u201cconfusion matrix\u201d for this first run:", "This shows that of the tests the model predicted to be evaporation lines, 7 were correctly identified, and 2 were incorrectly identified as faint positives. Of the tests predicted to be faint positives, 13 were correctly identified, and 12 were incorrectly identified as evaporation lines. Since I know that a majority of the evaporation line images were mislabeled by the users who posted them, though, this is more or less what I expected to see. The model is likely more accurate than it thinks it is!", "Now I\u2019ll clean the data. Here\u2019s the first batch:", "The first image has text covering the test, while the third image is too small and the test windows are too dark to determine a classification, I think, so I delete those. I can change the labels on the images as well, so I can switch the ones labeled as evaporation lines that should be labeled as faint positives. Then I recreate the databunch with just the cleaned data. I\u2019m not particularly optimistic that this will increase the model\u2019s accuracy to the very high rates achieved by the models shown in the lecture, because the tests display results in different configurations: some show a + when positive, while others show a single line if negative, two lines if positive. So if the model is just counting lines, it\u2019s going to have a hard time. We\u2019ll see.", "The ImageCleaner function creates a cleaned.csv file for the cleaned data set, and I create a new ImageBunch using that file, then train the model again.", "My training set loss went down by 0.2, my validation set loss went down by 1.5, and my error rate went down by .12. Let\u2019s look at the new confusion matrix:", "Just like I thought, the model is still classifying 12 faint positives as evaporation lines, and the faint positive lines can be so faint I\u2019m not at all surprised that it\u2019s confused. Adding in the different styles of test result displays, the model has the deck stacked against it.", "To improve the accuracy, I think I need to get a much better set of evaporation line images than can be found by grabbing images from Google. I might also need to train different models for different brands, but I\u2019d like to see if I can get decent accuracy with just one model first (one model to rule them all?). Countdown to Pregnancy has images of tests that can be sorted by brand, as well as by result. I select \u201cAll brands,\u201d and \u201cEvap,\u201d and get hundreds of images, so I start over with the new data. These are self-tagged by users, so some will still be mislabeled, but the image quality is leaps and bounds better than what I got from Google Images. I think my original faint positive images were basically fine, so I\u2019m keeping those. The only way I know to get the images\u2019 URLs into .txt files is the way the notebook does it, but when I do this, I get only an empty file of file type \u201cFile\u201d instead of .txt. I look around online, and find this script that uses Python to scrape the image URLs of any webpage. Okay, now we\u2019re getting somewhere! <ominous music plays>", "The script downloads the full URLs of the user\u2019s avatar image next to each test photo, but for some reason cuts off the first half of the URLs of the images of the tests. I realize that if I continue to use this method, I\u2019m going to have to remove all the URLs of the images I don\u2019t want, and also fix the URLs of the ones I do want. Just copying and pasting all the individual URLs of the images I want would be faster, but still pretty inefficient.", "Even worse, I just realized the images from Countdown to Pregnancy have a serious flaw. Here\u2019s an example. Can you spot the problem?", "I heard a podcast recently about a deep learning model that was trained to spot cancerous skin growths, and while it was astonishingly accurate, eventually the researchers realized that the model had worked out that all of the images it was given of cancerous growths had rulers in them, and the non-cancerous ones didn\u2019t have rulers, so it was looking for rulers, not cancer. These photos of evaporation lines all have an \u201cEvap\u201d tag in the upper right corner! The images are great, but the tag is a big downer.", "But it turns out that if I download the images, the tag disappears! I consider learning how to scrape the images, but since I realized above that half the images on each page aren\u2019t what I want, that method doesn\u2019t seem promising for this purpose. Instead, I install the Image Downloader Continued extension on Chrome, which lets me click on the images I want to download. Manually selecting each image feels pretty inelegant, but that\u2019s precisely what I would have to do later to remove noisy images otherwise, so I\u2019m going with it.", "I upload the images into the evap_lines folder, and run my model again.", "That\u2019s still pretty bad. Here\u2019s the Learning Rate Finder graph:", "I try setting the learning rate to a range of 1e-5 to 1e-4:", "That\u2019s the lowest training set loss I\u2019ve had, and the validation loss and error rate have improved, but not nearly to the standards we\u2019re going for. Here\u2019s the confusion matrix:", "Once again, nearly all of the errors are faint positives classified as evaporation lines. Improving the quality of the evaporation line images helped, but I think I\u2019m going to have restrict the model to classifying just one brand, rather than all brands, due to the inconsistencies in the way results are displayed, as described a bit above.", "I choose ClearBlue Easy, because it\u2019s a popular test (lots of images!), and also because blue dye tests seem to be most prone to evaporation lines. I download about 100 images each of evaporation lines and faint positives (\u201cfaint\u201d is a judgment call on my part), and run the model once more.", "This is still not working well. I know my data is as good as it can get from user-identified images now, so I\u2019m ready to try some hyperparameter tuning. I set my learning rate to a range between 1e-06 and 1e-04:", "A little better. Maybe run more epochs? Nope, I get essentially the same result.", "I\u2019m too new at this to say for sure, but I think it\u2019s very possible that the error rate is as low as I\u2019ll be able to get it without a better source for my image sets. I\u2019ve learned a lot from this project \u2014 about working in Jupyter notebooks, the fastai library, how to downloaded URLs and images from webpages, etc. \u2014 and perhaps I\u2019ll pick it up again at some point, if I think of a better approach, but for now I\u2019m going to leave this project here, then select a less tricky classification problem and start again.", "Previous post: Getting Started with fast.ai", "Lesson 2 (the sequel): Can Deep Learning Perform Better than Pigeons?", "Lesson 4: Predicting a Waiter\u2019s Tips", "Lesson 5: But Where Does the Pickle Go?", "Lesson 6: Everybody Wants to be a Cat", "I\u2019m a mathematics lecturer at CSU East Bay, and an aspiring data scientist.
