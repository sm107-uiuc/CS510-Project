We would solve and discuss four examples together to be aware of the Answer and Sensitivity report and also revisit certain topics covered in the previous article [Elements of a Linear Programming Problem (LPP)].", "Southern Oil Company produces two grades of gasoline: regular and premium. The profit contributions are $0.30 per gallon for regular gasoline and $0.50 per gallon for premium gasoline. Each gallon of regular gasoline contains 0.3 gallons of grade A crude oil and each gallon of premium gasoline contain 0.6 gallons of grade A crude oil. For the next production period, Southern has 18,000 gallons of grade A crude oil available. The refinery used to produce the gasoline has a production capacity of 50,000 gallons for the next production period. Southern Oil\u2019s distributors have indicated that demand for the premium gasoline for the next production period will be at most 20,000 gallons. [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "Let us assume R gallons of regular gasoline and P gallons of premium gasoline would be required to produce in the next production period. Hence the two Decision variables are R & P respectively. The objective is to maximize the total profit contribution. Constraint-1: Gallons of grade A crude oil used for regular and premium gasoline must be less than or equal to the available gallons. Constraint-2: Gallons of regular and premium gasoline produced must be less than or equal to the available production capacity from the refinery. Constraint-3: Gallons of premium gasoline produced must be less than or equal to the next period demand from distributors. Inequality Constraint: Gallons of regular and premium gasoline must be greater than or equal to zero, i.e. non-negative quantity. Our objective is to find a product mix that satisfies the above 4 constraints and also gives a value for profit function that is more than the value given by any other feasible solution. These are the set of initial inferences we can gather from the given unsolved problem statement.", "How to get the LPP solver in excel?", "Formulate a linear programming model that can be used to determine the number of gallons of regular gasoline and the number of gallons of premium gasoline that should be produced to maximize total profit contribution. [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "The optimal production quantities for Southern Oil Company in the next production period are 40 thousand gallons of regular gasoline and 10 thousand gallons of premium gasoline, with a resulting profit contribution of (0.30 * 40000) + (0.50 * 10000) = $17,000.", "Can the dual of the primal LPP be solved to show if the objective function value changes?

(Recap of a graphical solution to an LPP)", "The graphical solution also verifies that the optimal production quantities for Southern Oil Company in the next production period are 40 thousand gallons of regular gasoline and 10 thousand gallons of premium gasoline, with a resulting profit contribution of (0.30 * 40000) + (0.50 * 10000) = $17,000. There is no other point in the feasible region than Point-D which can further maximize the profit contribution. The optimal solution to this LPP model can be found at the extreme point (Point-D) of the feasible region.", "What are the binding constraints and slack variables in the optimal solution? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "The optimal solution tells us that the production of 40,000 gallons of regular gasoline and 10,000 gallons of premium gasoline would require all available Grade-A crude oil (Constraint-1) and the entire production capacity of the refinery (Constraint-2). If we substitute these values in the respective constraint equations we get Constraint-1: (0.30*40000) + (0.60*10000) = 18000 gallons of Grade-A crude oil, and Constraint-2: 40000 + 10000 = 50000 gallons of production capacity. Therefore any change in the availability of these two constraints would potentially change the value of decision variables (gallons of regular and premium gasoline) and therefore the maximum profit contribution. Hence these two constraints are the binding constraints.", "However, if consider the demand for premium gasoline constraint from distributors (Constraint-3) we get (0*40000) + (1*10000) = 10000 gallons of premium gasoline. The demand for premium gasoline constraint is not binding the feasible region at an optimal solution, implying that the distributor\u2019s demand for a premium grade would remain unfulfilled by 10,000 gallons. Rather this particular constraint (Constraint3) does not affect the feasible region and thus cannot affect the optimal solution, because even if this is removed and resolved, we get the same optimal solution. Hence this is a redundant constraint. Also, any non-binding constraint (having unused resource capacity for a \u201cless than equal to\u201d constraint) in a maximization problem is referred to as a slack associated with the constraint. Therefore the slack for the demand for premium gasoline is 10,000 gallons. The slack for Constraint-1 and Constraint-2 is zero. A slack variable is a variable that is added to the left-hand side of a less-than-or-equal-to constraint to convert the constraint into equality. The value of this variable can usually be interpreted as the number of unused resources.", "English Motors, Ltd. (EML) developed a new all-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle. As part of the marketing campaign, EML produced a videotape sales presentation to send to both owners of current EML four-wheel-drive vehicles as well as to owners of four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicles offered by competitors; EML refers to these two target markets as the current customer market and the new customer market. Individuals who receive the new promotion video will also receive a coupon for a test drive of the new EML model for one weekend. A key factor in the success of the new promotion is the response rate, the percentage of individuals who receive the new promotion and test drive the new model. EML estimates that the response rate for the current customer market is 25% and the response rate for the new customer market is 20%. For the customers who test drive the new model, the sales rate is the percentage of individuals that make a purchase. Marketing research studies indicate that the sales rate is 12% for the current customer market and 20% for the new customer market. The cost for each promotion, excluding the test drive costs, is $4 for each promotion sent to the current customer market and $6 for each promotion sent to the new customer market. Management also specified that a minimum of 30,000 current customers should test drive the new model and a minimum of 10,000 new customers should test drive the new model. Also, the number of current customers who test drive the new vehicle must be at least twice the number of new customers who test drive the new vehicle. If the marketing budget, excluding test drive costs, is $1.2 million, how many promotions should be sent to each group of customers to maximize total sales? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "Let us assume we would send a \u201cC\u201d number of promotions to the current customer market and also assume that there exists a \u201cC\u201d number of customers in the population who use EML 4-wheel drive vehicles. Let us assume we would send an \u201cN\u201d number of promotions to the new customer market and also assume that there exists an \u201cN\u201d number of customers who use 4-wheel drive sports utility vehicle manufactured by EML\u2019s competitors in the population. The response rate estimated from the population of the current customer market is 25%, so the number of customers estimated to respond from the current market population is 0.25*C. Again, it is estimated that 12% of the current population market would respond to the promotion. So the number of estimated current market customers expected to make a purchase, given they respond to the promotion is 12% off (0.25 * C), i.e. 0.12 * 0.25 * C = 0.03*C. Similarly, the number of estimated new market customers expected to make a purchase, given they respond to the promotion is 20% of (0.20 * N) = 0.20 * 0.20 * N = 0.04*N. The objective is to maximize the total sales contribution, i.e. Maximize 0.03*C + 0.04*N, subject to constraints. Constraint-1: Cost of promotion (excluding test drive) for both the Current and Newmarket must be less than or equal to the available marketing budget, $4 * C + $6 * N \u2264 $1.2 million {Marketing budget constraint}. Constraint-2: The number of Current market customers taking the test drive must be at least 30000. In other words, the number of current market customers responding to the promotion must be at least 30000. Hence, 0.25 * C \u2265 30000. Constraint-3: The number of Newmarket customers taking the test drive must be at least 10000. In other words, the number of new market customers responding to the promotion must be at least 10000. Hence, 0.20 * N \u2265 10000. Constraint-4: The number of Current market customers taking the test drive must be at least twice the number of new market customers taking the test drive. Hence, 0.25*C \u2265 2 (0.20 * N). Inequality Constraint: The number of promotions sent to current and the new customers must be greater than or equal to zero, i.e. non-negative quantity. Our objective is to find a mix of promotions between current and new customers that satisfies the above 4 constraints and also give a value for sales function that is more than the value given by any other feasible solution. These are the set of initial inferences we can gather from the given unsolved problem statement.", "La Jolla Beverage Products is considering producing a wine cooler that would be a blend of white wine, a ros\u00e9 wine, and fruit juice. To meet taste specifications, the wine cooler must consist of at least 50% white wine, at least 20% and no more than 30% ros\u00e9, and exactly 20% fruit juice. La Jolla purchases the wine from local wineries and the fruit juice from a processing plant in San Francisco. For the current production period, 10,000 gallons of white wine and 8000 gallons of ros\u00e9 wine can be purchased; an unlimited amount of fruit juice can be ordered. The costs for the wine are $1.00 per gallon for the white and $1.50 per gallon for the ros\u00e9; the fruit juice can be purchased for $0.50 per gallon. La Jolla Beverage Products can sell all of the wine coolers they can produce for $2.50 per gallon. [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "Let us assume W gallons of white wine, R gallons of rose wine, and F gallons of fruit juice would be required for the wine cooler. Revenue per gallon = $2.50 * (W + R + F).

Constraint-2: Availability of rose wine in the local refinery for the next production period, R \u2264 8,000. There is no upper bound of fruit juice availability from San Francisco, hence this is not a constraint.", "These are the set of initial inferences we can gather from the given unsolved problem statement.", "Is the cost of the wine and fruit juice a sunk cost or a relevant cost in this situation? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "No, the cost of wine and fruit juice are not Sunk costs because the number of gallons required of each ingredient to produce the blend depends upon the decision made by the profit maximization problem. Profit calculation would take both revenue and cost accounting for and since we are specifying the cost in the objective function itself they cannot be sunk cost. These would be Relevant costs instead. LPP problems are generally advised to not deal with any kind of fixed cost (e.g. rent of machinery or real estate, salary, depreciation, etc) because these are referred to as sunk costs and they do not depend upon the decision of the optimization problem.", "Formulate a linear program to determine the blend of the three ingredients that will maximize the total profit contribution. Solve the linear program to determine the number of gallons of each ingredient La Jolla should purchase and the total profit contribution they will realize from this blend.

If so, how much should they be willing to pay for each additional gallon, and how many additional gallons would they want to purchase? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "The optimal solution suggests that there is no slack in the availability of white wine constraint (Constraint-1 is a binding constraint). The current solution utilizes all 10,000 gallons of white wine that can be purchased for the next production period. The shadow price associated with this constraint is positive (2.9), which implies that one additional gallon of white wine can increase the optimal profit contribution by $2.9, keeping other constraints unchanged. The cost of wine is not a sunk cost and we have already accounted for this in our objective function. The allowable increase for this constraint is 3333.33 gallons. The shadow price of $2.9 is the maximum premium over the normal ($1) cost that La Jolla should be willing to pay for one additional gallon of white wine. From 10,000 to 13,333.33 gallons, the potential benefit of $2.9 to the optimal profit contribution would hold, not beyond that.", "If La Jolla Beverage Products could obtain additional amounts of the ros\u00e9 wine, should they do so? If so, how much should they be willing to pay for each additional gallon, and how many additional gallons would they want to purchase? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "The optimal solution suggests that there is a slack of 2,000 gallons in the availability of rose wine and this is not a binding constraint (Constraint-2). In other words, La Jolla has 2,000 gallons of rose wine as unused capacity in the next production period. The corresponding shadow price for this constraint is zero, which implies that every additional gallon of rose wine (over and above the current 6,000 gallons) would have no impact on the optimal profit contribution. The allowable decrease of this constraint is also 2,000 gallons, which implies that anywhere between 6,001 to 8,000 gallons of rose wine would not positively impact the profit contribution, keeping all other constraints unchanged. Hence La Jolla should not obtain any additional amount of rose wine from a local refinery.", "Interpret the dual value for the constraint corresponding to the requirement that the wine cooler must contain at least 50% white wine. What is your advice to management given this dual value? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "The optimal solution suggests there is no slack in the \u201cat least 50% usage of white wine\u201d constraint. The shadow price corresponding to the constraint (Constraint-3) is $2.4, implying for every additional percentage of white wine in the cooler, La Jolla has a potential of $2.4 to the optimal profit contribution. However, the allowable increase to this constraint is zero gallons but the allowable decrease is 1,666.67 gallons. The current solution uses 50% white wine, 30% rose wine, and 20% fruit juice. Since there is no flexibility to increase the white wine proportion in the mix, the only possibility is to reduce the white wine, but that would violate the restriction of at least 50% white wine usage in the mix. Hence any additional gallon reduction of white wine in the mix would reduce the optimal profit contribution by $2.4, keeping other constraints unchanged. This reduction of optimal profit would hold until white wine is reduced by less than equal to 1,666.67 gallons. Any reduction of white wine beyond that would require resolving the LPP with new constraints.", "Interpret the dual value for the constraint corresponding to the requirement that the wine cooler must contain exactly 20% fruit juice. What is your advice to management given this dual value? [ASWCCFO et. al.]", "We analyzed that increasing white wine proportion is not an option from the allowable increase numbers. Although we can reduce white wine proportion, yet that would result in a reduction in optimal profit contribution. In the case of rose wine, there is no shadow price (positive incentive) to increase the proportion beyond the current 30%. However, it has an allowable decrease of 2000 gallons with no extra penalty. The shadow price for fruit juice suggests for every additional gallon of fruit juice in the wine cooler, there is a maximum premium of $1 over the normal cost of $0.50 per gallon of fruit juice. Hence there is a positive incentive to increase the fruit juice proportion and reduce the rose wine proportion to 2000 gallons. Hence by one additional gallon of fruit juice in the mix would increase optimal profit by $1.", "Frandec Company manufactures, assembles, and rebuilds material handling equipment used in warehouses and distribution centers.

Could Frandec improve its position by pursuing this opportunity?", "The allowable decrease in the purchase price of frames (F2) is $3.58. The reduced cost for this decision variable is also $3.58. The reduced cost associated with a variable is equal to the shadow price for the non-negativity constraint associated with the variable. In our optimal solution of LPP-I, we noticed F2 did not take any positive value. Therefore until the contribution of F2 to optimal production cost (i.e. objective function) is reduced beyond $3.58, the decision variable F2 would not take a positive number.
