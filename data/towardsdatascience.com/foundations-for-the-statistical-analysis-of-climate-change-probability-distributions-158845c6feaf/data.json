Here, I will expand on KDEs and introduce Probability Density Functions, Probability Mass Functions, and Cumulative Distribution Functions. I will again be using the Python programming language for the demonstrations.", "Let\u2019s take a quick look again at our data. The values in the date column correspond with the year and the month, while the Monthly_Anom column values are the monthly temperature anomalies. Read more about why global temperatures are shown as anomalies here.", "Below is the distribution plot for our data. The anomalies range from around 1.5 degrees below the global average and one degree above the global average, with a mean of -0.093.", "Our data\u2019s distribution is a continuous distribution, as temperature is a continuous variable (as are height, weight, and distance). We can observe 0.1 degrees, 0.008 degrees, 0.98600093828209 degrees and so on, but the exact value of a continuous variable can only be estimated to a given accuracy.", "A probability density function, or PDF, is a parametric method of estimating the probability of occurrence for a random value within a particular range in a dataset. Because the values cannot be exact, you have to ask yourself what is the probability that variable X will fall between 0.3 and 0.4? By asking this question you are searching for the relative likelihood that a value occurs, as opposed to the absolute likelihood which, for continuous variables, is 0 since they are infinite. To calculate the probability for a given value between a certain range, you\u2019ll need to calculate the Area Under the Curve, or AUC. The AUC will be addressed in the following article.", "In order to visualize the distribution of continuous variables, you can use the Seaborn library\u2019s distplot() that displays a histogram (bars) and the kernel density estimation (red line), and has the option to plot the probability density function (black line).", "KDEs are a non-parametric way to estimate the probability of a value in a random variable. KDEs plot a curve at each individual point in the distribution that are then added to a distribution plot as a smooth density estimation, thus the smooth line. While the distribution is normal or nearly normal, the kernel used will be Gaussian, though other kernels will be used if the distribution is not normal.", "Histograms split the data into bins and counts each datapoint that falls within each bin. Seaborn\u2019s distplot() intuits the number of bins from your data, though you can specify how coarse you\u2019d like the bars in your histogram to be. You can identify the percentage of points that fall within each bin by normalizing the counts. Keep in mind, the y-axis then reflects the frequency, with the total probability under the KDE equaling 1. Depending on the number of bins that have been specified, the visualization may change and interpretation may vary.", "In the above plot, the PDF is shown as the black line. First, we assume that our data is normal after visualizing the histogram, though again, the distribution could be bimodal, exponential, etc, so your PDF may not be normal. The PDF of a normal distribution is calculated by taking two parameters, mean and standard deviation, of the variable. Once fit to the plot, you can then evaluate how well the PDF estimates the probability of a random variable. For our data, the PDF does a pretty good job, though there is a slight bump in probability around the 0.6 mark and a slight negative skewness that is not accounted for in the PDF.", "When the variable is categorical and the value can assume a finite, countable number, you have a discrete distribution. The probability of any of the outcomes is equal to 1. For example, the probability of rolling any number on a standard die (not weighted) is 1/6, and the total probability is equal to 1.", "A probability mass function, or PMF, shows the probability of a discrete random variable. The sum of each value\u2019s probability is 1. Categorical variables can be described with a PMF as there are a finite number of unordered values within the distribution.", "This graph was derived from an emissions dataset from 2015, demonstrating the percentage of factories in each sector that contribute to this particular greenhouse gas report. The y-axis displays the frequency of factories in each sector expressed as a fraction of the sample.", "As we saw earlier with the continuous variable and PDF that the probability of the temperature anomaly for a given month to be an exact value is 0, and the y-axis demonstrates the density of values but doesn\u2019t demonstrate actual probabilities.", "A cumulative distribution function, or CDF, calculates the probability that variable X is less than or equal to value x. What is the probability that the global temperature anomaly for a given month is 0 degrees or less?", "Inferring from the name, a CDF gives the cumulative sum of probabilities under the PDF. For our example, the cumulative sum of probabilities less than or equal to 0 degrees looks to be around 0.75. We can safely assume that the temperature anomaly for any given month will be 0 degrees or less around 75% of the time.", "Understanding the distribution and descriptive statistics of your data is essential, especially when studying global climate change. With a foundational knowledge of how likely or unlikely a certain value is among variables will help you identify when certain trends are expected or far off base, catching errors more easily or realizing when the unexpected occurs.", "Catch up on the first volume below, and keep an eye out for future articles on more descriptive statistics, forcasting, machine learning, and more!", "Your home for data science.
