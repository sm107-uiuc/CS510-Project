Many variations of the ARIMA model exist, which employ similar concepts but with tweaks. One particular example is the seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. The SARIMA model accounts for seasonality when generating time series forecasts. This tutorial covers the basics of generating and tuning a SARIMA model using Python, with the intent of forecasting a time series with seasonality.", "First, a little background on how the SARIMA model works. As the ARIMA model makes up the SARIMA model\u2019s backbone, it is beneficial to understand how the ARIMA model works. It comprises the following steps:", "AR model. An AR model forecasts a variable using a linear combination of its previous values (1). We describe an AR model with order p as follows:", "In the above equation, the epsilon term represents the random error term. The y(t-p) term represents the previous pth value in the time series. The phi value is a constant at each time step. The phi value decreases as it moves further from point t, the latest value in the sequence. Consequently, the closer a lagged value is to the prediction value (at sequence number t), the greater the phi value, and the more influence the time step has on the forecast.", "MA model. The moving average model resembles an AR model, except it is a linear combination of previous error terms (2). We describe it as follows:", "In the above equation, the epsilon term is the error term, with epsilon(t) being the error term at time step t, and so on. Like the AR equation above, the phi parameter is a constant value at each time step. Similarly, the phi value decreases as it moves more time steps away from time t.", "The ARIMA model includes three main parameters \u2014 p, q, and d. The parameters represent the following (4):", "The SARIMA model builds upon the ARIMA model. It includes the p, q, and d parameters, but also an extra set of parameters to account for time series seasonality. This parameter set \u2014 P, Q, D, and additional parameter m \u2014 is defined as follows (5):", "m: The seasonality of the model. For example, if the seasonality of a time series repeats yearly, then m = 12. If the seasonality is quarterly, then m = 4 (meaning the seasonal pattern repeats once every four months).", "P: The order of the seasonal autoregressive model.", "Q: The order of the seasonal moving average model.", "D: The number of seasonal differences applied to the time series.", "For this tutorial, we will use the monthly time series for electricity net generation from geothermal energy in the United States. The data can be pulled directly into Python via the Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) API (see this tutorial for more background on using the EIA\u2019s API). A snapshot of the time series is shown below, where units are in million kilowatt-hours:", "We use the code below to retrieve and visualize our time series:", "Before we generate a SARIMA model, let\u2019s decompose the time series to ensure it displays seasonality. We use the seasonal_decompose function, available via the statsmodels.tsa package. This function allows us to break the time series down into its trend, seasonal, and residual components:", "As you can see in the graphic above, the time series definitely displays seasonality, with a pattern recurrence occurring once every 12 months (yearly).", "Now that we\u2019ve performed some initial data exploration, let\u2019s build and tune a SARIMA model to forecast the time series.", "We select the p, d, q, P, D, and Q hyperparameters that best fit the SARIMA model largely through brute force \u2014 we sample different model hyperparameter variations until we find the best model combination. After generating each model, we use its AIC and BIC scores to gauge its performance. The AIC, or the Akaike information criterion, is a metric that compares the quality of a set of statistic models against one another (6). Similarly, the BIC, or Bayesian Information Criterion, is a Bayesian statistic used to compare different models (7). When comparing models using AIC or BIC metrics, we take the model with the lowest AIC and BIC score as the best option.", "In the code snippet below, we generate different hyperparameter variations to run through the SARIMA model, and return a list to loop through:", "In the above code snippet, we use the sarima_parameter_search() function to generate a list of different hyperparameter combinations, returned as the seasonal_pqd_combinations and pdq variables. The seasonal variable, set at a default value of 12, indicates that the seasonal pattern repeats once every 12 months (yearly).", "The trend variable has 4 possible options \u2014 \u2018n\u2019, \u2018c\u2019, \u2018t\u2019, and \u2018ct\u2019. This variable controls the polynomial trend of the time series; \u2018 n\u2019 means no trend (default), \u2018c\u2019 means that the trend is constant, \u2018t\u2019 indicates a linear trend with time, and \u2018ct\u2019 is both constant and linear (8).", "The p, d, and q variables can vary between 0 and the search_range limit (exclusive). In the above code, I set search_range to 2, so the parameter range varies between 0 and 1 (inclusive). This means that the max possible number of lagged terms for the associated AR and MA models is 1, and the max possible order of differencing is 1.", "For more information on hyperparameter tuning SARIMA models, check out the following two tutorials, which give a great background on the process:", "Let\u2019s first split our data into training and test sets. This way, we can build our model using the training set and gauge its performance using the test set:", "In the above code snippet, we use a standard 75/25 data split (training and test, respectively). We take the first 75 percent of the data points in the time series as the training set, and the last 25 percent of the data points as the test set.", "NOTE: It is imperative that we only use one split when generating our training and test sets, as the data MUST maintain its continuity. This is because the SARIMA model depends on the data sequence to make forecasts.", "Finally, it\u2019s time to build our SARIMA model. We loop through each of the possible hyperparameter configurations, generating a SARIMA model. We use the AIC parameters for each possible model to gauge model performance. Remember \u2014 we want the model with the lowest AIC scores:", "In the above snippet of code, we use the seasonal_arima_model() function to build the SARIMA model. If the model is successfully built, then the model summary is printed in the console, and the model and its associated AIC and BIC scores are returned.", "We call the seasonal_arima_model() function in a loop, where we sample each of the hyperparameter configurations. We set a default AIC value of 100,000,000,000 (really high), and replace it when we locate a model with a lower AIC score. As we move through the loop, we keep a tab on the model with the lowest associated AIC score, and save that model and its hyperparameter configuration (under the best_model, best_order, and best_seasonal_order variables). We take the SARIMA model stored under best_model at the end of the loop as our final model with the best hyperparameter configuration.", "Once the loop is complete, the best model configuration, as well as its summary, is printed in the Python console:", "The model summary above contains the \u2018Covariance Type\u2019 graph, which depicts each of the variables\u2019 impact on the forecast. We have four main lagged AR and MA variables. The first set of AR and MA variables is lagged by 1 time step (ar.L1 and ma.L1, respectively), and the second set is lagged by 12 time steps (ar.S.L12 and ma.S.L12).", "Looking at the \u2018P>abs(z)\u2019 term in the graph, all variables read as 0. This is great, as we want our P values to be as close to 0 as possible. Using a cutoff of <0.05 for statistical significance, all of our lagged AR and MA terms significantly impact the model forecast.", "Now that we have our SARIMA model, let\u2019s gauge its performance using the test data!", "In the code snippet below, we predict the values for the test set, forecasting out the total number of steps that are present in our test set. We then compare the predicted values to the actual values, using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. The lower the RMSE and MAE scores, the better the model fit. If the predicted values match the actual values exactly, both the RMSE and MAE equal 0.", "For more information on root mean squared error and mean absolute error, check out this link.", "Running the code snippet above, the outputted RMSE and MAE for the model are approximately 868 and 860, respectively.", "After calculating the RMSE and MAE metrics, we plot the predicted values against the actual values. This gives us a visual gauge of model performance:", "Looking at the graphic above, the model does a great job of forecasting out the time series by 140 time steps. This is almost twelve years out! We can see the seasonality of the forecast, which is accounted for by the ar.S.L12 and ma.S.L12 terms in the model.", "Your home for data science.
