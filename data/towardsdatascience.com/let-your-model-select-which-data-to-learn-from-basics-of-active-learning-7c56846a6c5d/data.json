This is what anyone thinks about all the time. But.. Let us take a step back and think in terms of \u201cactual\u201d data by taking a break from our \u201chypothetical\u201d data.", "It is not always easy to get data. No company will give it to you for free. There are a lot of trades that take place. For instance, you help the other company monetarily and they will help you with the data you want. As a Data Scientist, It is not always easy to convince your manager about the data you\u2019d like to have which will help the company, only because it costs a lot. You need to adjust your expectations by the budget a company has set for its data science team.", "If you are dealing with large amount of labelled data, you must have faced this problem before. Active Learning may be your go-to solution.", "Active learning is a machine learning algorithm where its main aim is to reduce the amount of training data by letting the algorithm choose the data from which it needs to learn in order to reach the desired goal of our evaluation metric by either performing better or at least the same as with more training data.", "In Figure 1, We have a bunch of faces and need to classify them into boys and girls but we do not have all their labels. Obtaining labels is expensive. In Figure 2, We obtain labels of some of these faces and classify them by randomly choosing a subset of data. As we can see, the classification error increases if we use these faces to classify actual faces. In figure 3, We try to choose faces which increase the accuracy of our model (We saved on our resources by selecting the optimal faces). This is what active learning is all about. We try to find the instances on which the model is most likely to make errors (who are closer to the decision boundary), such that after their labelling and inclusion in the training set, the model becomes more robust to these types of errors on unseen data.", "When we talk about query strategies, it is mainly about selecting those data points whose class you are most uncertain about. There are various scenarios of querying your algorithm \u2014", "As the name suggests, it is a strategy of generating/synthesising queries based on some membership criteria. Model generates the query de novo (from the beginning) i.e \u2014 Model generates new queries instead of existing ones.", "It is a sequential strategy where we can randomly sample data points from a sampled distribution and then select if we want to label it or not. Each query decision is made individually. The learner decides if they want to query that instance. There is some \u201cinformativeness measure\u201d which helps the learner decide about query strategies.", "When there is small subset of labelled data in a large pool of unlabelled data, queries are selectively drawn from that pool. Based on some \u201cinformativeness measure\u201d, all the queries are first ranked and then the best one is taken into account. This is the main difference between stream-based and pool-based sampling i.e individual querying and group querying.", "We will talk about two strategies today:", "In this sampling strategy, the learner will query those instances whose labels they are most uncertain about. This can be done in three ways -", "Query the data point whose prediction is least confident. This is done my calculating the probability of the data point belonging to different classes and ranking them from least likely to most likely. Least likely being the least confident.", "By using Least Confident strategy, we know nothing about the distribution of other labels. Thus, we are disregarding their informativeness. Hence, margin sampling overcomes this by considering the difference between the most likely label and second most likely label. Small margins are more ambiguous, hence we need to know their true label. Large margins imply we are almost correctly predicting the labels of those data points.", "Entropy depicts the uncertainty of a model. We calculate the entropy score for each class. If it is high, it is likely there is a lot of uncertainty; There is an equal probability of a data point belonging to multiple classes and if the entropy score is low, the points are distributed with quite some certainty. For our query strategy, we would select data points with the highest entropy score.", "There is a committee of models formed trained on the labelled dataset with different training instances. Each committee will vote for a label for the query candidates. We will select the data point where all the committees can\u2019t come to a fixed majority. Therefore, the most informative query will be the one about which they disagree the most. This a tree-based method.", "Your home for data science.
