This is for good reason, as a lot of code-bases are actually written inside of Python. Python is an interpreted high-level programming language written in C. Julia, on the other hand. Python has surged further into popularity with Data Scientists in recent years, prior to Julia coming on the scene.", "Julia is a high-level, multi-paradigm statistical programming language. Unlike Python, Julia was created primarily for statistical computing (like R.) Julia is a compiled language that uses its own compiler, dubbed the \u201c Just In Time\u201d compiler. Although Julia is a great language to do machine-learning with, Python is still exceedingly popular in comparison.", "The biggest upside to a Python-based project is that Python is a universal language, especially now in 2020. Lots of languages have been made to translate Python code, and the code is frequently used in many different industries, including, but not limited to:", "Another massive benefit to Python\u2019s popularity is documentation, as typically it is easier to find an answer to your question if somebody on the internet has asked it before. A big problem with Julia is lack of information, often you\u2019ll find yourself reading terrible Github-README documentation. Needless to say, that can get pretty old after a while.", "It\u2019s no secret that Python is easy, and that\u2019s a big plus. Let\u2019s face it, complex algorithms with loss-functions and correlation coefficients being flung around is complex enough without having to worry about low-level syntax. Even writing the same code into Lisp, for example, can take upwards of double the amount of time. This comes with the benefits of quick education, quick understanding, and most of all quick troubleshooting.", "Consequential to Python\u2019s massive number of users is Python\u2019s massive number of packages. What I really enjoy about working in Python is being able to use undocumented endpoints from a Python wrapper that someone made two years ago on Github. Things like this don\u2019t exactly exist in Julia, and it can make getting data even harder.", "Packages are a really important part of a language. Without the proper code-base to support machine-learning, you run into a lot of issues where you have to work things out from a very very low level. This is of course tedious, and consumes more time as it is being done. What\u2019s fun about Python is being able to grab any tool out of your toolbox at a moments notice \u2014 without having to go program that tool for yourself to use.", "It\u2019s no secret that Python and Linux go hand and hand. This information can in fact be validated just with the realization that Python was originally published under a GPL license, and of course remains open-source to this day. This is great, because it means that all of our servers, Linux-based computers, and even Apple devices are now coming with Python pre-installed with default folders ready to go.", "Another circumstance that this applies to is customization, as well as fixes. Don\u2019t like how your Gnome applications bar doesn\u2019t go away when it\u2019s not in use? Well, program that in! Anything you don\u2019t like is entirely programmable in one of the easiest languages to learn available.", "Julia is a very versatile language, but with that being said, Python is versatile in an entirely different way. Python was created for object-oriented and general purpose programming (though not particularly found in any one of those paradigms.) This means that while Python has proven its ability in statistics and machine-learning, Python is also able to run APIs, move files, serve GUIs, host web-servers, control microprocessors, pretty much anything you want to do that\u2019s above kernel level Python can do. This, of course, makes Python incredibly versatile.", "Comparing Python\u2019s versatility to Julia\u2019s versatility, Julia\u2019s usefulness certainly deteriorates at the lower-level. Not such a big deal, as low-level programming isn\u2019t really going anywhere in the future, and an additional language to that is beating a dead horse, but in particular, Julia can\u2019t do GUIs (not natively right now at least,) and has an arduino package \u2014 but has a hard time registering bus inputs. However deploying web-servers, statistics, and lower-level file-system work like writing text files is certainly still viable.", "Julia and Python are both great languages that I love so much. Both languages definitely trade blows when it comes to the better of the two for data science. If you\u2019d like to read a similar article from the Julia side of things, here\u2019s the counter I did to this one where I describe the 5 ways I think Julia is better than Python. I can\u2019t wait to see the future of Julia\u2019s path and where Data Science languages will be in 10 years.", "Your home for data science.
