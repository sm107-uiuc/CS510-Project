If it hasn\u2019t been hammered into our heads yet, Data Literacy is a critical component to data-driven decision-making.", "The journey to transform your product team\u2019s analytics is a long one. We\u2019re finally at a place where the data can speak to us and we can make decisions based on what it tells us. Inherently, this is why literacy can create or destroy value in an organization. The cost of misinterpretation can be significant.", "In this post, we\u2019ll discuss how to improve your data literacy through:", "As we go through the sections, I\u2019ll share and dissect illiteracies that I\u2019ve recently seen.", "Becoming data fluent doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It takes discipline, awareness, and collaboration to hone.", "If you think about it, becoming data fluent is much like learning a new language. There\u2019s a lot to learn \u2014 new vocabulary, colloquialisms, contexts, and media. Here are a few principles to get you into the right state of mind.", "Imagine that you\u2019re a senior Product executive. You read in a news headline that Microsoft Teams has more users than its competitor Slack (20 million vs 13 million). Your peer turns to you and says, \u201cI think Slack is still winning.\u201d Curious, you ask for her explanation.", "She looks at you and says, \u201cTheir CEO said that they have over 50 clients with $1M ARR. Over 70% of those are [Microsoft] Office365 clients.\u201d Full stop.", "Looking for clarification, you ask for her definition of winning. She says, \u201cWell, they\u2019re getting revenue from large Office365 clients so they have to be winning.\u201d Full stop.", "You reason, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re winning. Especially if you consider how much larger Office365 revenue is compared to Slack\u2019s. We don\u2019t know anything else besides the Active Users for both of them.\u201d", "She confidently responds, \u201cWell, their CEO said\u2026\u201d And then you tune out.", "What happened there? Well, a few things.", "As the cliche goes, \u201cpurposeful practice makes perfect\u201d. That also applies to data literacy.", "(In this example, all numbers are based on real occurrences. Names are fictional.)", "Imagine that Jimmy is the PM for Product X. CEO Kim asks Jimmy if the usage of Product Y has any impact on the usage of Product X. Jimmy crunches some numbers and arrives at the chart below.", "After seeing the 11.3% difference, Jimmy excitedly reports back to the CEO. \u201cKim, people that use both products are 11.3% more likely to click in Product X.\u201d CEO Kim pats Jimmy on the back and tells the company about this wonderful discovery.", "Let\u2019s pause right here. We can count two prominent issues with Jimmy\u2019s analysis.", "Now, back to the story\u2026 You, the data fluent PM, are curious about these numbers. Specifically, you want to know what is driving these numbers. You notice that these metrics are averages across all features of Product X.", "If you look under the hood, there might be an explanation of which feature(s) are contributing to the bump. You cut the data and arrive at the following chart.", "It looks like View Home Page has a nice little bump of 5%. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t explain half of the 11.3%, though.", "Ah, but look at the Search feature. There\u2019s a whopping 46% increase in Searches by users of X+Y. This is a pretty significant finding.", "You\u2019re about to share this with Jimmy and Kim but then you realize something: that same Search feature is also used in Product Y. Searches from Product Y might count as searches in Product X. There\u2019s a chance that the counts are wrong.", "The whole story changes. Product Y may not impact Product X usage as Jimmy thought. There may not even be a relationship.", "Good luck untangling that with the rest of the org.", "I wish this example with Jimmy wasn\u2019t true. Jimmy was a Sr. PM Manager in real life. Kim did tell thousands of employees. So where did it fall apart?", "There are a few critiques you could make about the analysis, but you get the picture. I\u2019d like to think that Jimmy is a self-aware guy and has long since corrected his literacy issues.", "We\u2019ve covered many different principles and considerations as you evolve your data literacy. Evolve is not a word used lightly. There are so many pressures that can push your fluency to grow if you embrace them.", "All the examples above are real. They are not meant to detract or discourage. Rather, they\u2019re meant to make you aware of pitfalls.", "There\u2019s a significant responsibility of being data fluent. That is to be accountable to reality and to be intellectually honest so the organization can make the best possible decision.", "Your home for data science.
