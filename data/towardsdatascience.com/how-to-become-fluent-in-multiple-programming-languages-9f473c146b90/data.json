For example, my native language is English, but I\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Learning a new programming language is much like learning to speak a new natural language.", "However, as I\u2019m sure many of my bilingual and polyglot friends would agree, it can sometimes get confusing to switch between two or more languages.", "For example, my native language is English, but I was enrolled in French Immersion in school. While this certainly paid off and made me perfectly fluent in both languages, it did have some unintended consequences when I was working in English. For the longest time, I would add E\u2019s onto many words or I would place the dollar sign at the end of a set of numbers (32$ instead of $32), both things that are requirements of the French language, but don\u2019t exist in the English language. With time and practice, these mix-ups eventually went away and I\u2019m now able to switch between the two languages seamlessly (more or less).", "I\u2019ve noticed this happening again for me, although this time, I\u2019m trying to transition from the structured world of C# and Java to Python. While I was in college, all of my courses revolved around strict programming languages such as C#. Now, I\u2019m trying to make a transition to data science, and I\u2019m currently in the process of learning Python. For someone who likes things very organized, Python is a nightmare language. For me, there is a severe lack of semi-colons, curly braces, and typed variables. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m learning a new language (Python), that is completely different from my native language (C#).", "Learning similar programming languages (such as C#, Java, and JavaScript) is akin to learning similar natural languages. For instance, by knowing French, it would be easy for me to pick up similar languages such as Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. However, learning a programming language (Python) that is semantically different from ones I already know, is similar to how my French background wouldn\u2019t be much help when learning Icelandic or Mandarin.", "However, as I\u2019ve discovered in the past, learning a new programming language is the same as learning a new natural language. Furthermore, becoming fluent in multiple programming languages involves some of the same fundamentals and tips I used when becoming fluent in multiple natural languages.", "Nearly every article titled \u201cWhich Programming Language Should I Learn First?\u201d suggests that Python is the perfect first language for someone to learn. While I agree that Python is a good first language due to its simple syntax and flexibility, I believe that several programming fundamentals won\u2019t be learned that will be necessary later on.", "Therefore, I would offer some counter-intuitive advice: learn the statically-typed and syntactically-specific languages first.", "Instead of learning the language that will hold your hand and will offer you a comfortable path to wade into the world of programming, learn the language that will yell at you if you forget a semi-colon or will refuse to work because your data types are wrong.", "Statically-typed languages (such as C# and Java) require a data type to be assigned to their variables. Data types include strings, integers, and Booleans, to name a few. Variables are bound to the data types they are assigned when they are initialized and can\u2019t be changed, otherwise, errors will be thrown in the code before they run.", "Dynamically-typed languages on the other hand (such as Python) don\u2019t require data types to be assigned at the initialization of the variable. The variable type will be checked to see if the types are correct at runtime (after the program has been compiled and run).", "By learning how to work with statically-typed variables, you get a foundational understanding of data types that you can build upon in the future. For example, JavaScript is a happy little programming language that has no problems adding together integers and strings. However, not being aware of datatypes can cause problems later on when bugs arise. By being strict with your learning and gaining a firm understanding of data types, you can save yourself a lot of headaches further on down the road when learning a dynamically-typed language with variables that can change datatypes on the fly. Additionally, learning a statically-typed language first will add a layer to your coding process logic.", "When learning a new natural language, you first learn your alphabet, and then you go on to learning the words, the sentence structure, the punctuation, and the grammar of that language.", "Learning a programming language is similar, in that each language has a specific syntax you must use for the code to work. In other words, each programming language has a way in which it likes its sentences to be structured and its paragraphs to be formed.", "Some languages, (such as Java and C#) are very specific about their syntax and will refuse to work if you forget a single semi-colon (semi-colons are often put at the end of a line of code, similar to how a period is placed at the end of a sentence to signify its end). Other languages, such as Python, have relatively no syntax structure that must be followed. For instance, Python has relatively no semi-colons, and very few curly braces to organize its code compared to C#.", "Learning a syntactically-specific programming language first will give you a firm understanding of the proper structure you need to follow when writing code. By becoming aware of the proper indentation structure, the necessity to end your line of code with a semi-colon, and the requirement for your functions to be written within the confines of curly braces, you will be able to write code that is easily-understandable, more organized, and easier to maintain and debug. Furthermore, this will help give you a template with which to write your code when you begin venturing into new languages that aren\u2019t as strict with syntax.", "In essence, learn the discipline now, and reap the rewards later.", "It would be rather difficult to live a life speaking a little of each language spoken around the world instead of speaking one language very well, wouldn\u2019t it? Furthermore, if you only understand a little of each language, then you wouldn\u2019t be of much use to anyone, would you? Because you would neither have a very large vocabulary nor a very strong understanding of any specific language, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to type something into Google Translate to try to communicate with someone from half-way around the world. The likelihood is that both of you would end up very confused!", "In my opinion, the same applies to programming languages. Instead of trying to learn several different languages without understanding any of them to a competent level, become fluent in your first language, or your language of choice.", "I\u2019m not suggesting that you need to be 100% fluent in a programming language before picking up another one. However, you should have a firm understanding of programming concepts in a single language before attempting to learn a new one.", "Why? Well, when you learn the fundamentals of code in one language, you can assume that the fundamentals will be roughly the same in a different language. For instance, if/else statements carry out the same function in every single programming language you come across, but the only difference is in the syntax you use to communicate them. For instance, an if/else statement in C# requires the statements to be organized using curly braces, whereas an if/else statement in Python has no curly braces and instead separates each statement using a single colon and code indentation. Fundamentally though, the statement works the same way in both languages.", "It\u2019s like how you learn to say \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cGoodbye\u201d in your native language. Once you understand what those words mean and how to use them, you can learn how to say \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cGoodbye\u201d in a multitude of different languages. The words will mean the same thing in a different language, the only difference is that you write them using a different syntax and use them following different conventions.", "By understanding whether your first programming language prefers a single class or multiple classes, if it has specific variable naming conventions, or if it requires an object-oriented structure, you\u2019ll become more fluent in your first language and the subsequent languages as you progress. Once you become fluent in one language, you\u2019ll be able to pick up on the nuances of other languages quicker as you become more aware of the differences between programming languages.", "When speaking a natural language, you can understand someone if they are speaking with an accent. For instance, I was understood by people whose native language is French, even though I spoke French with an accent. Because I was using the French conventions, they understood what I was trying to get across even if I used a round-about sentence structure or mispronounced a word.", "To become fluent in a new programming language, you can\u2019t code with it as if it was a language you already know. If you do, the likelihood is that the language won\u2019t necessarily understand what you\u2019re asking it to do, or it will do what you\u2019re asking in a very inefficient manner.", "I fell into this trap during my college capstone project when we were using Angular for the frontend of the system. I understood JavaScript well at the time and knowing that Angular is similar to JavaScript, I tried to code in Angular using similar conventions that I would use in JavaScript. Unfortunately for me, trying to code with an accent didn\u2019t yield good code, and it likely stemmed from not understanding Angular\u2019s conventions. My code was all in Angular, but it was speaking with a heavy JavaScript accent.", "In other words, don\u2019t repeat my mistake \u2014 use the new language in the way it was intended and don\u2019t code with an accent.", "By immersing yourself in the new language and forcing yourself to understand all of its unique conventions, you learn how to code with the language in the way it was intended without using it as a language you already know. This will allow you to become fully fluent in multiple languages, without speaking them all with a thick accent.", "For example, if English is your native language, but you decide to quickly learn five other new languages, you\u2019re likely to end up speaking Russian, Italian, Swahili, Yiddish, and Arabic, all with a thick English accent and using English conventions. If you had instead chosen to learn the conventions of the Russian language, native Russian speakers would understand you. The same goes for the other languages. If you were trying to speak Swahili using the typical English sentence structure, you would likely not be understood by someone from Kenya.", "Take the time to read the documentation provided by a programming language, and get a feeling for the specific conventions of that language. Not only will this make you more fluent in the language, but it will also make you more valuable when working on team projects with others who understand the language and expect you to be able to follow their conventions.", "You may have to force yourself initially to code without an accent, but the hard work will pay off when you can fluidly switch from language to language with few hiccups.", "This article outlines some of the more unique ideas for becoming multi-programming-language-lingual that I have come across in my time of becoming a programming language polyglot. These tips all helped me tremendously, but it wouldn\u2019t be a fully useful article if I didn\u2019t mention some of the more conventional tips that are out there:", "The best advice I can give is to be persistent. Learning a new language is tough, and programming languages are no exception. Don\u2019t discard the language if it takes a little effort to learn. Luckily, multiple resources around the internet can help make the learning process easier and more intuitive.", "Most of all, don\u2019t forget to apply the advice and tools available to you when learning a new language. Not only will you come out understanding the language better, but you will also become a better developer or data science in the long run.", "Your home for data science.
