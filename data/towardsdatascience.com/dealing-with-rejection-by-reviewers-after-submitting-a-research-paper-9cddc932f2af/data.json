You wait on tenterhooks for anywhere between two months to 18 months (my min and max range to date) to hear from what you presume will be experts in your field (not always unfortunately). Some of you fear that your work is not good enough and reviewers will highlight fatal flaws. Others at the back of their minds will think or at least hope that reviewers will recognise just how brilliant they are. The notification comes in and your heart sinks. The editor politely declines the opportunity to publish your work.", "One of the most common questions that I am asked particularly by graduate students is after receiving a rejection with detailed comments what is the next step? The first thing to note is that rejection is incredibly common and so don\u2019t unduly worry. I still recall the first reviewer\u2019s comments I ever received as a PhD student. I was taken aback by the tone by one reviewer in particular. They seemed to miss the point of the paper and were extremely rude and condescending.", "At that time I did not realise just how variable comments from reviewers and editors would turn out to be. The review process can be very random and difficult to get consistency across multiple reviewers and such consistency is generally needed if an editor is to allow you to proceed on to the next stage. Indeed in the economics field it is often best to assume your paper will be rejected especially if you are an early career researcher. This does not mean that you should not expect to get your paper published, rather it just may take on average multiple attempts and the number of attempts will depend on how good the paper is, how ambitious you are in terms of journal selection and on how lucky you are. Persistence here is really key.", "I have received wonderfully insightful comments from reviewers who have rejected my papers but I also have received very unhelpful ones which seem largely reflective of their own subjective biases and prejudices as opposed to any careful assessment of the merits or otherwise of the specific paper. As a graduate student it can be particularly difficult to figure out which is which. I have noticed some people completely ignore reviewer comments and simply resubmit elsewhere straight away whereas others may spend months looking to address as many comments as humanly possible before resubmitting.", "In deciding what to do it might be helpful to divide comments from reviewers into three broad categories and the extent to which this classification applies to any particular paper will of course vary greatly.", "This could take the form of being pointed towards new related literature that you were unaware of. A new potential channel that can help explain the main result. A type of robustness or sensitivity check that can add further weight to the findings. An important methodological detail omitted or not presented very clearly. Inconsistency in the presentation of a key argument. A key policy implication that had not been thought of. Generally reviewers who go to the trouble of providing helpful comments such as these also take care to present them in an accommodating tone. That being said, even if the tone seems harsh try and look beyond this.", "These miss the point of the paper entirely. Hard to characterise succinctly but could take the form of hostile comments towards the field of research as a whole (e.g. economics of happiness) or methods (e.g. I don\u2019t like surveys) as opposed to an evaluation of the merits of otherwise of the specific paper. Comments could also reflect the fact that the reviewer in question has a competing paper or simply that this paper contradicts their previous work which in turn could contaminate (often unconsciously) the fairness of the review. Condescending or juvenile comments \u2014 this often takes the form of a criticism of the methodological approach (e.g. using fixed effects) while misunderstanding what it actually involves and often using a superior tone in an attempt to try and convince the editor of how knowledgeable they are. More broadly, trying to impress the editor with overly convoluted criticisms and the \u2018gotcha\u2019 mentality is also unfortunately common.", "I find these comments relate to writing style and structure. For example, the paper would be greatly improved by expanding the background sections so that you can more carefully expound on the rich literature relating to whatever it may be. Condense the conclusion. Expand the conclusion. You explain X in too much detail. You explain Y in too little detail etc. etc.", "My advice is always to generally try and deal with the comments under 1 above before resubmitting. The variance amongst reviewers and editors is of course very very high (more on this in a future post), but even when it is unlikely that these same comments will emerge when dealing with new reviewers, your paper will be strengthened by considering those points. This in turn will likely increase the degree to which reviewers will \u2018like\u2019 your paper in future. It is also quite possible that the same reviewer is asked to review your paper again and they will likely appreciate any changes you made in response to their comments or be annoyed if you haven\u2019t taken their comments on board. I would suggest safely ignoring comments in the second category. They won\u2019t improve the paper which should be your main concern. It is true that you may get the same reviewer again but it is likely no matter what you do the reviewer will again find some \u2018fatal flaw\u2019 and suggest rejection.", "Whether to address any comments in the last category is a balancing act. Anything you can do to improve the clarity of the paper will improve your chances but there are diminishing returns. You have to be conscious of the time involved particularly if you also have new research opportunities to pursue. It is also worth bearing in mind that if, for instance, a reviewer makes a compelling case for a more detailed exposition, another reviewer may feel that there is too much detail obscuring your key contribution. As such if you are not careful you may end up chasing your tail somewhat.", "While comments from reviewers pertaining to style and structure may be helpful, I find the passage of time is often more effective here than any reviewer comments. When I look at a paper again after receiving a rejection I almost always find all sorts of ways in which I can make my writing clearer. Indeed it is not uncommon for me to completely revamp a paper six months later after receiving a rejection even if I didn\u2019t find the comments by reviewers particularly enlightening. This probably reflects the fact that clarity of writing continuously improves, my own knowledge of the subject matter in question has likely also improved in the intervening period and nothing beats looking at something with fresh eyes even if they are your own.", "Your home for data science.
