While two countries may be close by physical distance, the characteristics that define their respective economic regimes at a point in time may be drastically different.", "If we look to Japan and China, for example, two neighboring nations separated by the expanse of the East China Sea, during the early 2000s we find that the Japanese economy was languishing in the aftermath of the \u201clost decade\u201d, a period characterized by the bursting of stock and property price bubbles which crippled growth and inflation for many years to come. In contrast, China, in the same period, was reaping the benefits of economic liberalization initiated in the late 70s and emerging as one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies.", "The comparison could not have been more stark, but it illustrates an important point; to understand the state and relationship of global economies we must venture deeper than association by geography. And as the world teeters nervously on the brink of recession, the need for this understanding has never been more pertinent. As such, we approach the task with help of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called Hierarchical clustering using R.", "Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar observations together based on common attributes. These attributes are normally summarized by a distance measure such as Euclidean, Manhattan or correlation distance. In the first instance the two closest points are joined together to form a cluster, this happens re-iteratively, joining the closest points or clusters together until only one large cluster encompassing the entire sample space remains. The resultant structure can be visualized as a dendrogram like such:", "To implement this method for understanding economies, we take a vector of important macroeconomic variables that define the state of each economy and calculate the pairwise distance in Euclidean space between them. We will call this the economic distance. Intuitively, in this framework, countries/regions that are least distant to each other are deemed to be similar in their economic state or development. To calculate the economic distance we will use a set of \u201cfinancial indicators\u201d from The Economist website here. The variables include important macroeconomic data points such as growth, inflation, unemployment, industrial production, inflation, budget balance. The data does require some wrangling, the cleaned csv files can be found here. Implementing in R, it looks like the below:", "Upon visual inspection we can quickly see that geography is not necessarily the main driver of economic similarities. While countries within the Eurozone/Euro Area do appear to cluster together, this is to be expected. They\u2019re bound by a singular monetary union and a series of treaties that enables free movement of financial and labor capital. As such, the removal of frictions manifests itself in a more synchronized state of economic being that is emblematic of the region. However, we also know this not is always true, case and point is the Euro sovereign debt crisis of 2011 when the inability to of a number of members to refinance debt threatened to fracture the union. In these instances we can potentially use hierarchical clustering to help identify when this starts to happen as at risk countries start to disassociate from the rest of the global economy through upticks in measures like unemployment and long-term interest rates and declines in industrial production and growth.", "Other interesting relationships that form include Singapore being closer neighbors to Switzerland than France, Italy or Spain. From what we intuitively understand about these two countries we know that their similarity lies in the general robustness of their economies and their reputations for being centers of finance and commerce in their respective regions. Turkey and Argentina are the furthest away from the remaining clusters. This is representative of the degree of economic uncertainty facing both countries as they struggled with high inflation, high unemployment and falling growth.", "To test whether clustering by economic distance produces a distinctly different structure, we can create a similar hierarchical clustering dendrogram based on geographic distance and visualize how the clustering changes.", "The above tanglegram shows how countries and regions have changed positions in the hierarchy as the distance metric changes. Black lines indicate that their clustering structure has shifted while colored lines show otherwise. We observe that moving from one measure to the other, only Peru and Colombia remain in the clustered together(green lines), effectively demonstrating that economic distance produces a distinct and more informative representation when trying to understand the global economy.", "While the approach does give us a starting point, what is more useful is being able to view how and whether clustering has changed across time. This change can occur in two ways, one, through a flattening of the overall hierarchical clustering structure indicating that the global economies may have become more synchronized(macroscopic) for better or worse and two through within the clustering between the constituents countries (microscopic).", "So far we have been using the economic variables from February 2019 in our analysis, now we introduce the same set of variables for the same regions for March 2020. We will visualize this with another tanglegram.", "This time we can see that across the span of one year the global economic landscape has shifted drastically, with the obvious confounding variable being the spread of COVID19. The only countries that have remained clustered together are Indonesia, India and the Philippines, generally considered emerging market countries. Upon examination, we also identify that Turkey has dislocated from Argentina as a function of its recovery from its currency crisis a year earlier, while the latter still remains the most economic dissimilar country as it hovers on the brink of yet another default. Other discernible observations include that the most similar regions have become \u201ccloser\u201d, this again may be attributed to the exogenous shock created by the current pandemic situation, the effects of which have reverberated about the world. As countries globally continue to combat its spread, the economic effect has been indiscriminate. Almost all affected regions have experienced contractions in growth, tapering consumption, record unemployment rates and some form of monetary or fiscal stimulus. Most of these measures are well covered by the economic distance.", "While hierarchical clustering lacks the predictive abilities of its supervised learning counterparts, it still presents as an important tool in exploring patterns and structure in underlying data, this, combined with the economic distances forms a powerful, intuitive and interpretable framework in forming views on the global economy whether the end goal is of a social, policy or financial nature.", "Disclaimers: this post is purely an expression of personal views and opinions.
