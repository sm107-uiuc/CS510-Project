Since college times, I was interested in python and data science techniques. But, In life, things don\u2019t go as per your expectations all the time. I got placed in a multi-national company. I was happy at that time that I got placed in a company. And with the hope that I will be utilizing in the data science field, I joined the company. We usually feel happy when we get a job. However, In my mind, I was hoping for more. I was thinking that I will be working in the data science field.", "Finally, the day came when they tagged me to a project.", "I got to know that I will be working as support IT person who will support different applications. Ah! So, now I will have to work on IT support tasks, but what about my passion and goal of becoming a successful data scientist?", "In the beginning, I was numb as my team was forcing me to learn support tasks, and I was trying to focus on data science stuff. And finally, In this way, They assigned me to another support project because I wasn\u2019t giving my best in that project.", "I realized that I needed to focus on both the sides, my current position as a support engineer, and the data science journey. That was not easy as after nine to five jobs; you don\u2019t find time for your self-improvement. And, here begins my journey of managing the time and finding ways to learn data science techniques while enjoying my current support IT work.", "In our life, If we want to focus on learning new things and for that, we must have a calm mindset. We should not have any other load or any tension or pressure that can lead to distractions in our minds; otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to focus on the excellent learning stuff.", "This article will share my journey to become a certified data scientist. I will be sharing how I started and continued my journey, even being busy with my nine to five schedule.", "Research shows that if you follow the crowd, then it will be tough to make suitable decisions based on your ability. You want to go with the flow or not; it all depends on you. But destiny depends on your flow. Your environment will put you on a random path; but, it is your responsibility to modify the way according to your skills and knowledge. If you move in the same flow as others, it will be more challenging to change your career, And if you want to make change your job, you need to make your flow, and that flow should be continuous. You will find many obstacles in your flow, but you need to be so constant that barrier doesn\u2019t play a significant role in your success journey.", "As I started my job, I start observing others in my project. I found out that many people are still working in their previous IT jobs for more than five to six years, and now they don\u2019t have enough knowledge about the latest technologies. We can say that they become so much used to the support task that they can not switch their careers to different fields. So the flow should create at the beginning but not too late.", "\u201cMost people are not going after what they want. Even some of the most serious goal seekers and goal setters, they\u2019re going after what they think they can get.\u201d  \u2015 Bob Proctor", "Your passion plays a crucial role in your mental happiness. In research, it was found that following Your Passion Is More Important Than Money.", "It was a typical day, and I was working on my support task. I got a mail from my organization that there are a few certification courses related to automation using python, machine learning, and robotic process automation. And I was excited that day that I found something related to my area of interest in my organization. After getting confirmation from my managers, I opt for that certification and clear the certificate on the first attempt. I send a mail to my managers that I earn the certification regarding python. So, In this way, people started knowing me like a python developer.", "One day one of my colleagues ask me if I can automate his task using python. I was surprised at how things were going in a positive direction. I take that task after the confirmation from my managers. And I started working on that task, and luckily that task was a bit complex, so it took around six to eight months. But even after working for one year on my project, I didn\u2019t get a single chance to work on a data science project as my dream. And I continue to use as support IT person in my project with complete motivation because I don\u2019t want to make my organization feel that I am not interested in supporting IT tasks. After all, that was my only source of income at that time, and also that was my first job.", "\u201cPatience is a virtue\u201d is a tough pill to swallow, at least during times when we need it.", "Even after working for more than one year, I didn\u2019t get the opportunity to work on a data science project, so I started looking for other opportunities in different organizations. But, I found out that the criteria for being a data scientist were strict. They were asking for a vast set of skills set to be a data science employee, and at that time, as I was self-learning about data science, I was not that much prepared to work on a data science project in another organization.On that day, I feel a bit low because I was thinking that I am only getting time on weekends for self-learning, and I am not getting any exposure to data science, so how will I switch my career to the data science field.", "\u201cGod\u2019s gift to you is more talent and ability than you will ever use in one lifetime. Your gift to God is to develop and utilize as much of that talent and ability as you can, in this lifetime. Steve Bow\u201d", "If you notice that I started as a support person, and now I have a project where I am utilizing my python skills, I think God also helps you like a helping hand. You only need to be continuous in your journey.", "One day my colleagues came to me. My colleague was aware of my data science skills. She told me that another colleague had done a data science certification from an institute. He is now getting a data science project in a different organization with a good salary hike. So that was the time when I realized that I should also join the institute to learn the proper way of using data science in any project.", "I decided to join that institute over weekends. That data science course was nine-month-long. While doing the data science course, I realized that the skills they were teaching were required to be a data science engineer. And I devote most of the time to my certification course, where I learn about different data science techniques and kudos to the tutors who taught me about data science. Tutors were from good colleges, and they were the senior data scientist in different organizations. That gives me a sigh of relief. Finally, that course helps me to improve my knowledge of data science.", "Science says that chance favours the prepared mind. While doing the certification, I learn about the latest technologies in data science. In the meantime, I got a mail from the organization where I found that some tasks work related to data science. That day I was like much happy. God helps us if we continue to do good work. I applied for that task, and based on the skills that I learned from the certification course suggested by my colleague, they accepted me to do the task.", "I did my best in that task, and all the people who assigned the task to me were pleased with my dedication. In this way, they set more tasks for me. And, I got to know that those tasks use data science skills. So what I can observe from this is that if on that day, when my colleague approaches me for the certification Course, if neglected that one opportunity, then I might not correctly learn the data science skills. And also, I may not get those data science tasks. And here, we can see that opportunities play a significant role, and we should never neglect them. We should have a look at those opportunities once.", "When I was working on python and data science tasks, I was doing very well. All were happy with my dedication. And that helped me gaining trust from higher-level people in my organization. Later, they assigned me a critical task in data science. And literally, I was the key employee for them for that task.", "Once you gain their trust, you don\u2019t need to go to them, but they will come to you because they know that you will work on their task more passionately.", "Finally, the day came when I started getting offers to join their project based on my skills and work. And behind that, the main reasons were; first, I was having less number of years of experience, and being fewer years experienced person, they will have to you pay me accordingly. So it was a win-win situation for them because if they appoint more experienced data scientists with six to ten years of experience who will do the same task as me, but the organization will have to pay more as per the number of experience of the person.", "Being certified for any technology plays a significant role in an organization because to demonstrate your skills, you should have some proof. So I searched for different ways to get certified in data science and got to know that Microsoft is providing a certification course for demonstrating end-to-end data science skills. I was having good knowledge of data science. Hence, I opt for the certification course, and after a few days of revision, I cleared the certification of a data scientist. So finally, now I am a Microsoft certified Azure Data Scientist.", "After gaining more data science experience and becoming more confident in the data science field, I get to know from my friends that we can demonstrate our data science skills by writing articles, making YouTube videos, and other things. So I introduced to medium. I created my account and got it verified, and then I wrote some articles and send it to some of the publications that focus on data science and artificial intelligence.", "Based on the article content, they accepted my article in the journal. And in this way, I become a data science writer on medium. That helps me continue improving my data science skills. The more article I will write, the more I have to study, and also, I was getting paid to write articles, which gave me more motivation to write more articles.", "Everything started with the flow. I created my flow, and I focused on my current position as support IT Engineer and my main goal to become a certified data scientist. There were many obstacles, like being a nine to five employee; it is hard to find self-improvement time. It would be best to devote daily time for your improvement apart from your day-to-day job. I learned that your regular job would help you gain more connections and know people\u2019s perspectives and experiences. And also, we should see that destiny is like a child. You nurture it according to your skills, your dedication, your passion, and your attitude.", "No one was born to be poor, but we all are born to be rich.
