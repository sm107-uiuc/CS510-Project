Here, we\u2019ll walk through all the content you\u2019ll need for using TigerGraph and learning about graph technology. If you get certified, your credibility increases, therefore I strongly suggest you give it a try. In addition, TigerGraph is \u201cthe only scalable graph database for enterprise.\u201d By taking the certification test, not only will you increase your credibility, but you\u2019ll also learn something new that could help you almost anywhere. Also, taking the test is completely free, so all it takes is time and willingness to learn to pass your test!", "The first four modules you\u2019ll watch consists of theory. What is graphing technology? Can you tell the difference between some popular versions and what their different applications would be?", "A graph consists of vertices (also called nodes) which are connected by edges. All the vertices and edges make a schema. The power of graph technology is that the data are interconnected, allowing users to ask complex questions across complex data which sometimes isn\u2019t possible using SQL. The nodes and edges can have properties or attributes, such as age, location, time, etc., which provide details about each node and edge; graphs with nodes, vertices, and properties are called property graphs.", "Graphs can be used as a referral network by searching for different entities which have multiple vertices in common and are a few hops (or edges) away. You can find referral networks in your everyday life, like your suggested LinkedIn connections or suggested doctors.", "Property graphs contrast from Resource Description Framework (RDF) Graphs because each node on an RDF is a Unique Resource Identifier (URI) which cannot carry any attributes. They have subjects and objects (nodes), connected with predicates (edges), but they can get verbose.", "Next, we learn about different databases\u2019 methods of storing relationships and how graph compares. Relational databases stores each entity in separate tables which then require table joins to connect, an action which could take hours and are computation expensive. It can be used for indexing and searching for one type of data and performing basic analyses. Relational databases are optimised for transactions, not deep analytics.", "Graph databases, in contrast, are one, single, pre-connected table. They\u2019re a natural storage model built for storing and analysing relationships. Because all of its relationships are first-class entities, graph databases, optimised for deep analytics, tend to be much faster than relational databases.", "Compared to a NoSQL, graph databases tend to be better for deep analytics. One example of such is a key-value database, which stores all its data in a single table. Key-value databases allow for data flexibility and fast key lookups, but it\u2019s low-level. Column-family is efficient processing at scale, but it\u2019s slow for transactions and updates. Document can handle structures like XML and JSON, but it\u2019s often very specialised. All of these require traversing and analysing relationships, taking many scans of the tables, making it unfit for analysing deep relationships. Finally, graphs are good for dealing with relationships and are the only of the said structures which manage relationships well, but not all graphs offer real-time speed at scale. Overall, while NoSQL graphs can store a wide variety of data, graphs are the best choice for handling relationships and entities.", "There are currently three types of graph: Graph 1.0, Graph 2.0, and Graph 3.0. Graph 1.0 using native graph storage with a single server and non-parallel architecture. Graph 2.0 uses a NoSQL base for storage scale and can support two hops queries, but they aren\u2019t designed for real-time updates. Graph 3.0, however, is both native and parallel, supporting over ten hops and taking less time to run hops and load data.", "Graph 3.0, as provided by TigerGraph, supports HTAP (Hybrid Transactions and Analytics). It also supports OLTP and OLAP, has real-time performance, is a transactional graph, has scalability for massive datasets, can use Deep Link Multi-Hope Analytics, provides ease for develop and deployment, and provides enterprise grade security. TigerGraph is the world\u2019s first Native Parallel and Distributed Graph and has interoperability, parallelism with MPP, has many graph algorithms in a libraries, supports MultiGraph, uses GSQL (which is similar to SQL to allow easy transition). Graph Studio, a GUI, allows for quick and simple creations of graphs and easy visualisation.", "Graphs support many machine learning and data science algorithms. This is a walk-through of a few of them.", "Deep Link Analysis supports looking through data with more than three hops. This can grow exponentially. An example of Deep Link Analysis is trying to find a user\u2019s fraudulent history. Not only will it look at shallow connections, but it will also look deeper to detect whether a user\u2019s history is clear.", "Multi-dimensional Entity and Pattern Match will look for a pattern within a graph.", "Relational Commonality looks for something in common with two vertices, like common customers for two vendors.", "Hub Community Detection searches for the most influential vertex in a graph, the vertex with the most edges. This can help find the relevance of something within a community.", "Geospatial Graph Analysis shows how close two things are to each other using latitude and longitude.", "Temporal Graph Analysis is similar, but it looks at how entities and relationships change over time.", "Machine Learning and Explainable AI can be used by graph by extracting features and using GraphStudio (the GUI) to provide visual aids for the graphs.", "To use TigerGraph Cloud, go to https://tgcloud.io/. Login and then make sure you\u2019re comfortable with using this resource. Be able to create a solution, upload data, create queries, and build graphs using GraphStudio. There are already several great blogs about this, so I\u2019ll link them here.", "Using a Select Statement, one can traverse from one set of vertices to another. This is the general syntax (required parameters are in bold):", "When running this command, the algorithm starts with FROM, goes through all the other clauses to \u201cfilter\u201d or do operation with them, then the SELECT returns all the vertices that fit.", "In the example, s is the starting node, e is the edge, and t is the target or final node.", "WHERE filters out vertices that don\u2019t match a certain condition. These conditions can be joined using the AND statement.", "In the case, it\u2019s filtering all the edges with a connectDt between 2019\u201301\u201301 and 2020\u201301\u201301. Next, it filters all the target nodes with the gender attribute as \u201cF\u201d. In the end, Friends prints out all female friends who connected in 2019.", "Accumulators can be local(notated with one @) or global (notated with two @@). Local accumulators are specific to each vertex, and global accumulators are for the entire graph.", "Next, there are more specific types of accumulators:", "Here are two examples. The first has a one-hop global MinAccum:", "That second has a two-hop local AvgAccums:", "POST-ACCUM is independent from the ACCUM clause. They can either access the starting or target vertex (the s or t alias). If it\u2019s a global accumulator, the work will be queued and take effect after leaving the POST-ACCUM clause.", "Check out an example of normalising, with a global max accumulator and a sum accumulator:", "The HAVING clause is another way to filter out data. It\u2019s similar to the WHERE clause, but the HAVING clause only has access to the selected vertices and attributes, whereas a WHERE clause has access to the start and target vertices.", "Finally, the ORDER BY can sort the results to be ascending or descending. The LIMIT sets the maximum number of values in the accumulator.", "The above example orders the results to be ascending, then it grabs the top two, which would be the smallest two.", "For each vertex in your schema, you need to have a primary ID. In addition, for each vertex, you need to specific a FROM and To. Observe the following syntax:", "To load data, you\u2019ll need to define a loading job. To do this, you\u2019ll need to create filename variables and use loading statements:", "For this module, you\u2019ll need to be familiar with using your terminal or console for inspecting the graph. You can select which graph you\u2019ll use using the following:", "Then you can use a variety of other commands. Commands listed include from, to, directed, to, attributes, e_type. Here\u2019s an example:", "The queries you will create will return JSON. You can also use curl to run this graph. Know how to create queries and results.", "This module reviews accumulators, like OrAccum and AvgAccum and local and global accumulators. These are different ways to accumulate a variable. Remember, to make a global variable, use two @@, else just use a singular @ sign.", "For deep query, the module went over khop and run query name(parameters).", "In this article, I reviewed each video series and provided a summary or description of each. In addition, there are some miscellaneous topics, like how to use gadmin, on the exam. I recommend you also review TigerGraph\u2019s documentation if you have time.", "This is a textual version of what will be on TigerGraph\u2019s Certification test. Now, go here to get certified and learn more beyond this article. Good luck and happy learning!", "Your home for data science.
