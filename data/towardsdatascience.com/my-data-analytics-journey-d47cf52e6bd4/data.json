During these experiences, I worked a lot with Excel to manipulate, organize, and calculate metrics from hospital payroll data and cost reports. My days were full of vlookups, pivot tables, macros, powerpoints, and looking through the CMS website.", "It was an overall good experience and I worked with great people. I got to travel and live the wild lifestyle of a big 4 consultant. However, I wasn\u2019t completely satisfied in terms of the technical trajectory that career path was headed towards. I looked at my management and saw where I would be in 5\u201310 years if I continued on that path\u2026mainly on the phone or traveling to network and pitch project to hospital management. I knew that wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do.", "After 2 years of working in this extremely specialized group, I wanted to go back to school and expand the breadth of my technical ability to learn and grow.", "The full-time MBA combined with a start-up project I was working on were enough reasons for me to submit my 2-weeks-notice and move on to another phase of life.", "During the next year in school (and my start-up adventure, which I plan on writing about in a future post), I networked, explored, and got my feet wet in a variety of industries: public health, healthcare administration, nonprofit, advertising, web-development , operational improvement consulting, and data analytics. Out of all of those experiences, data analytics was the most intrinsically interesting to me. I took the remainder of my electives in this area and catered my degree towards it. Exploring and discovering insights through data is a very profound and useful process. There is a never-ending learning curve and hours pass like minutes while I\u2019m engaged in a project or interesting dataset. My first data-science-related project was automating and calculating probabilities for the \u2018Risk\u2019 board-game that you can look at here. I spent many late hours making this and teaching myself python along the way.", "After the Risk project, I decided to take Udemy courses and work on other projects I found interesting and useful. These include concepts related to statistics, machine learning, and data analytics. The projects I enjoyed the most are linked at the end of this post.", "It\u2019s been a wild ride and I\u2019ve learned a lot over the last 6 months\u2026 Fortunately 2 months ago, I landed an awesome job in operational improvement at Regions Financial Corporation, so I haven\u2019t had as much time to work on personal projects as I\u2019d like. I am learning technical skills related to dashboard building and project management, however, and I plan to blog about this as well. I also have been working on python for data science through a firm-sponsored DataCamp account and plan on reviewing my experience using DataCamp vs using Udemy courses soon.", "It may take many years, but my goal is to become proficient and confident in my data science abilities, so I can work with machine learning and advanced modeling one day. I have a long way to go, but I believe this past year I have taken healthy risks, put in a lot of effort, and made much progress.", "I know it\u2019s cliche, but the only lesson for anyone reading this is to keep trying everyday to pursue what you want. Set the right routines, have the right people in your life, and create habits that cater towards your goals. Progress will be slow, but it will happen if you keep trying.", "Thanks to anyone reading or following my journey.", "A few of my favorite projects:", "Is Random Forest better than Logistic Regression?
