By using skip pooling to extract information at multiple scales and levels of abstraction, and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the context feature, ION obtains Best Student Entry and 3rd Place in 2015 MS COCO Detection Challenge.", "As ION utilized a simple RNN called IRNN, it is also a good start to learn about RNN. It is published in 2016 CVPR with more than 300 citations. (Sik-Ho Tsang @ Medium)", "In original Fast R-CNN, ROI pooling is performed at conv5 only.", "To address the above issues respectively,", "It is noted that ION architecture is developed based on Fast R-CNN using VGG16 backbone. Thus, conv1 to conv5 at the beginning and fully connected (FC) layers at the end of the network, are from the original Fast R-CNN using VGG16 backbone.", "In Vanilla RNN (Plain Tanh RNN), tanh is used for activation:", "And the team from Prof. Hinton suggested IRNN, which is a kind of RNN, that is composed of ReLUs and initialized with the identity matrix. (If interested, you can visit the paper in arXiv, the paper called \u201cA Simple Way to Initialize Recurrent Networks of Rectified Linear Units\u201d.)", "Since it is done within an image, it is a lateral RNN. An example is as shown below. This step is repeated for each row (Right/Left) or column (Down/Up).", "And a naive version of 4-direction IRNN using the ReLU-based IRNN is as follows:", "The equations above are those for right-direction IRNN, similar for left, up and down directions. To make it efficient, authors simplify the above 4-direction IRNN. To simply, first, the hidden-to-output is merged into a single conv, i.e. concatenation followed by 1\u00d71 convolution:", "Second, the input-to-hidden is also simplified by 1\u00d71 convolution and shared the conv with 4 recurrent transitions:", "Finally, two modified IRNNs are stacked together to extract the context features:", "After the above modifications, the RNN equation becomes:", "As we can see, there is no input x, because the input is implicitly done by the 1\u00d71 convolution. And it is found that the W can also be removed due to similar detection performance:", "This is like an accumulator, but with ReLU after each step. Hence, the IRNN consist of repeated steps of: accumulate, ReLU, accumulate, etc. Note that this is not the same as an integral/area image, since each step has ReLU.", "As shown in the figure above, since the object detection dataset also contains the semantic segmentation label, during training, semantic segmentation is also performed using context features. Just like FCN, The deconvolution upsamples by 16\u00d7 with a 32\u00d732 kernel, and an extra softmax loss layer is added with a weight of 1. This loss is acted as a regularizer.", "During testing, this segmentation path is removed. Therefore, inference time is the same as the network trained without segmentation loss.", "As mentioned, the network is based on Fast R-CNN using VGG16 as backbone, thus, pre-trained VGG16 on ImageNet are used for those common layers. And the network is trained with conv1 to conv5 frozen. Then, the network is trained with conv1 and conv2 frozen.", "Ablation study is performed on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.
