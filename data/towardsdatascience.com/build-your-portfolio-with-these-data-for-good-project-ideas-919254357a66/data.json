For instance, when I noticed that sports analytics didn\u2019t have many analyses on women\u2019s sports teams, I used an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to build a dream team of WNBA players. Or when I kept hearing about bias in artificial intelligence, I decided to build a machine learning model that mitigated bias in AI. In both of these projects, I showcased my hard skills as a data scientist while also contributing to the greater good and upholding my values. To give back to the community of data professionals, I wanted to share some resources and tips to help you boost your portfolio with data for good projects.", "The first tip I want to share with you is to let go of fear and start using the skills you already have to work on a data project. Early in my journey to becoming a data scientist, I was most comfortable with using Excel to interpret data. At the time, I didn\u2019t know how to develop machine learning models in python. Using just the skills I had back then, I could have started working on data-driven projects \u2014 but the only thing that held me back was fear. If you\u2019re in the early stages of learning specialized, hard skills to become a data professional, you can still work on projects using the existing skills you have. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself this, but since I can\u2019t I\u2019m writing this article to tell you instead \u2014 just start! I try to include resources here that everyone can be inspired by, no matter how novice or expert you are.", "Whether you know what kind of data-driven projects you want to work on or you\u2019re still not sure, start brainstorming your ideas. Brainstorming, strategizing, ideating \u2014 the one thing that these words have in common is the tenant that there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cwrong\u201d idea. For anyone that wants a structured way to brainstorm data science project workflows, I designed this canvas (pictured above) to help you get started. If you need other tools to help you strategize a project workflow, you can also try hand-drawing or digitizing mind-maps, using design thinking tools, or simply opening up a blank word document (or a flipping to a blank page in your notebook if you\u2019re an analog type of person) and start writing down your ideas.", "Now that you have an idea for how to strategize your project workflow, you can start getting your hands dirty with these data-for-good datasets. Or you can also scrape your data, or get out there and collect your own. Most of the portals I\u2019m sharing in the list below provide easy-to-download datasets. Some of these resources are not purely focused on \u201cdata for good\u201d but still have relevant datasets that you can download. And lastly, these are just a few out of the many datasets out there!", "Data visualization can be a powerful tool to convey the insights that you\u2019ve gathered from your data analysis, especially if you\u2019re working on a data-for-good project. These are some of my favorite resources that showcase data visualizations for good.", "These are just a few blogs and/or publications that feature a collection of data-driven articles.", "There are so many ways to get involved and build communities around the notion of \u201cdata for good.\u201d Here are a few resources of ways you can get involved, whether it be through volunteering for an organization or attending a conference.", "I hope that these resources inspire you to create data-for-good projects! Remember that these resources are just a snapshot of what\u2019s available. If you want to share more resources or projects that you\u2019ve worked on, comment below!", "Thanks to Anuva Kalawar for always sharing data-for-good resources with me.", "Jasmine Vasandani is a data scientist and strategist.
