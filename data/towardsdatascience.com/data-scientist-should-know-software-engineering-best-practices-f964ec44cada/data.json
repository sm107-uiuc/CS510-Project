Mathematicians believe that before application there must be a solid understanding of the principles applied of which in various scenarios, I admittedly do not. Software Engineers expect Data Scientist to carry out their experiments whilst following basic programming principles.", "What stung me the most is that every \u201cyes\u201d voter is currently working as a Data Scientist and many of them in leading roles (at the time of the poll) \u2014 comprising of the likes of 4x Kaggle Grandmaster Abhishek Thakur. Ok, I admit, the role you want determines how deep an understanding of Statistics and other Math concepts such as Probability, Linear Algebra and Calculus is required \u2014 although the basics are absolutely essential \u2014 but Software engineering practices?", "I was once among the Data Scientists who believe we are solely Data Scientists, not Software engineers, hence our responsibility is to extract valuable insights from data and that is still a fact, however this poll disrupted my mental model and threw me into a deep trail of thought\u2026", "Why must I know the Fundamentals of Software Engineering when Job title is Data Scientist?", "I remembered the goal \u2014 To become an Indispensable Data Scientist. Am I saying that if I don\u2019t know/learn the fundamentals of Software Engineering I am not indispensable? Mmm, Yeah. basically \u2014 Note this statement makes an assumptions however, such as you are a Data Scientist writing code that will most likely make it to production.", "On that note, I\u2019ve curated a list of things that are fundamental principles of software engineering that should apply to Data Scientist. Not having a Software Engineering background, I consulted many friends that are Software Engineers to assist me make the list as well as teach me how to write better production code.", "Here are some of the best practices Data Scientist should know:", "Note: I want to start of by apologizing to R users as I have not done much research into coding in R hence many of the clean code tips will be mainly Python users.", "The first programming language I learnt was Python because I am a fluent English speaker and to me Python significantly resembled the English language. Technically, this refers to the high readability of the Python programming language, which was a deliberate implementation by the designers of Python, following the realization that code is read more often than it is written.", "When a veteran Python developer (a Pythonista) calls portions of code not \u201cPythonic\u201d, they usually mean that these lines of code do not follow the common guidelines and fail to express its intent in what is considered the best (hear: most readable) way. \u2014 The Hitchhikers Guide to Python", "I am going to list a few factors that constitute clean code, but I do not plan to go into too much detail since I believe there are many great resources out there that cover these topics better than I ever could such as PEP8 and Clean Code In Python:", "Remember, not only will others read your code, but you will too and if you can\u2019t remember what something means then imagine what hope someone else will have.", "This one can be partially blamed on the way we learn Data Science. I would be surprised if a Data Scientist could not spin up a Jupyter Notebook and begin doing some explorations. But that is all Jupyter notebooks is for, EXPERIMENTS! Unfortunately, many of the courses out there on learning Data Science do not do a good job of transporting us from a Jupyter Notebook to scripts \u2014 which are much more effective for Production environments.", "When we talk of Modular code we mean code that is separated into independent modules. Executed effectively, modularization allows makes packaging, testing and maintainable code that may be reused.", "In the video linked below, Abhishek Thakur builds a Machine Learning package for a Kaggle competition and was my first exposure to modularity. In the past, I\u2019ve also heard Abhishek mention that the way he learn more about modularity and software engineering best practices as a whole was by reading through the Scikit Learn code on Github.", "Some other things that contribute to writing good modularized code are:", "Code refactoring may be defined as the process of restructuring existing code without changing the external behaviour of the code at runtime.", "Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality. \u2014 Wikipedia", "There are many advantages to refactoring our code, for example, improved readability of our code and reduced complexity, which in-turn leads to our source code being much easier to maintain and we are equipped with an internal architecture that improves the extensibility of the code we write.", "Furthermore, we can not talk about Code Refactoring without talking about improving performance. The goal is to write a program that performs faster and uses less memory, especially is we have an end-user that will be executing some task.", "For more on refactoring in Python, see the link below!", "Note: I learnt briefly about testing (and the majority of other ideas covered in this post) in the Deployment of Machine Learning Models udemy course.", "Data Science is a funny field in a sense that our code may still run even though there are errors in our code, whereas in software related projects the code will throw an error. Consequently, we will end up with misleading insights (and possibly no job). Hence, test are imperative and if you know how to do them, your price goes up.", "Here are some reasons why we run test:", "I\u2019m sure there are more reasons, but for now I will stop here. Check out the link below for more on testing.", "Code reviews are done to improve code quality by promoting the best programming practices that will allow for code to ready for production. Additionally, it\u2019s beneficial for everyone since it tends to have positive effects on team and company culture.", "The main reason for a code review is to catch errors though the reviews are extremely useful for improving readability as well as ensuring the coding standards are met.", "A really great article that goes more into depth is linked below\u2026", "It\u2019s fair to say that this is definitely a whole load of things to learn, but for the exact same reason it increases the over value of a Data Science practitioner. Being able to whip up a Jupyter Notebook is no longer enough to make you stand out as a Data Scientist because everyone can do it.
