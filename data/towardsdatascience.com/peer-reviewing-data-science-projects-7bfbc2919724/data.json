It is used in research \u2014 both inside and outside academia \u2014 to ensure the correctness of results, adherence to the scientific method and quality of output. In engineering it is used to provide outside scrutiny and to catch costly errors early on in the process of technology development. Everywhere it is used to improve decision making.", "Those of us working in the tech industry are familiar with one particular and very important instance of peer review \u2014 the code review process. If you\u2019ve ever received a review you should know that despite being slightly uncomfortable \u2014 as putting our creations under scrutiny always is \u2014 it can be highly valuable. This process forces us to prepare and as a result, find numerous improvements to make even before the review. This often raises small but significant issues that have escaped our gaze but are easy for an outsider to spot, and sometimes it can provide very profound insights.", "The goal of this post, then, is to suggest a layout for a process that performs a similar function for data science projects. It is built as part of my own personal view of how small-scale data science projects should be run, a topic that I have covered in a previous blog post: Data Science Project Flow for Startups. You can find a figure of this workflow below.", "Edit: For takeaways from a year of implementing this approach, see my following blog post: Postmortem: A Year of Data Science Peer Review in Startups", "This framework is also based on my experience as a lead data scientist, team leader and finally an independent consultant, witnessing work patterns followed by various companies I consulted. I have also relied on the experience of many of my friends leading teams or groups of data scientists.", "In accordance my view for a project flow, I suggest two different peer review processes, for the two phases I feel require peer scrutiny the most: the research phase and the model development phase.", "The goal, then, is to provide a general framework for a peer review process for both phases that will:", "I\u2019ll discuss the motivation, goals and structure for both processes, accompanying each with a unique list of questions and issues to check for.", "Similar to the project flow, these processes were written with small teams working on applied data science in mind. However, larger teams or even research groups might find some of the ideas below useful.", "Credits: The model development review checklist is the creation of Philip Tannor, an awesome data scientist and an even better person.", "Just to jog your memory, we call \u201cthe research phase\u201d that part in the process where we perform an iterative back-and-forth between data exploration and literature review (can include reviewing existing code and implementations). This phase also includes mapping out the space of possible methodological approaches to frame and solve the problem at hand, and forming our recommendation for the best way forward, complementing it by listing the advantages and risks inherent in each choice.", "Notice three types of checks are performed at this stage to validate the naturally impactful choice of approach:", "I think that the main motivation for data scientists to get peer review of the research phase of their projects is to prevent them from choosing the wrong approach or direction in this early phase of the project. These errors \u2014 referred to as approach failures in the DS workflow \u2014 are very costly to make, and they impede the project for the rest of its lifecycle.", "If we\u2019re lucky, we discover the approach failure after several model development iterations, and we lose precious weeks of data scientist work. This is the case where the approach failure leads to degraded performance, when measured by using the metrics we\u2019ve chosen to track and optimize.", "In some cases, however, the performance discrepancies resulting from an approach failure are much more subtle, and can be extremely hard to recognise before validating model performance using significant amounts of production data, and sometimes even user/client feedback to that behaviour, leading to discovery the failure only after the model is in production. And the cost is significantly higher: Months of work of data scientists, engineers and product people, decline in client satisfaction, potential churn and even reduced earnings.", "This is why model benchmarking cannot be the only way we hope to find methodological errors in our process and decisions; we must explicitly assume they might escape detection by these means, and attempt to discover them methodologically, by examining the process itself, its logic and the claims and data supporting them.", "Obviously, the main goal here is to catch costly errors early on, as mentioned above, by explicitly putting core aspects of the process under examination, while also performing a basic sanity check for several catch-alls.", "However, two additional sub-goals can be stated here: First, improving the ability of the data scientist to explain and defend her decisions in upcoming product/business review process. Second, better preparing to present the output of the research phase to the rest of the team, an extremely common and important practice in most data science teams/groups.", "There three steps to prepare for the review are:", "In his presentation, the data scientist under review attempts to touch upon the following seven points:", "Finally, here is a suggested structure for the review meeting:", "The list focuses on questions that should be addressed during the research phase. I have divided it into ten categories:", "Let\u2019s go over the questions. Remember, this is just a preliminary suggestion I came up with, not a comprehensive coverage of everything that needs to be considered.", "Example: To determine whether change in plane ticket prices drives an upsurge in use of your service, you might want to use some classic causal inference statistical methods over a time series of both values. Alternatively, you might to predict plane ticket prices for the next month using a common model like ARIMA.", "Many such methods not only \u2014 sometime implicitly \u2014 assume that input time series are realizations of stationary stochastic processes, but they also provide neither a measure of the degree of stationarity of a time series nor a degree to which it can violate this assumption. Finally, they provide no upper bound on errors\u2014 or the probability of making them\u2014 when this assumption is violated to any degree.", "As such, this is a significant downside of these methods, and it should be presented and accounted for explicitly. In this case, stationarity can actually be tested for independently, regardless of the method used, so the validity of certain methods can be ascertained before making a choice.", "Here are some examples of some very strong and commonly implicit assumptions approaches make:", "For supervised learning methods based on optimization:", "Example: Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re working on a topical dynamic playlist generation system, as part of a music streaming service. This means we want to generate and update automatically playlists around topics such as \u201cNew Indie\u201d, \u201cBritish New-Wave\u201d, \u201cFeminist Music\u201d or \u201cCheesy Love Songs\u201d. For added complexity, we might also want to allow playlists for combinations of topics, like \u201cFeminist New-Wave\u201d or \u201cNew Gloomy Indie\u201d. Or perhaps, we want to be able to personalize each playlist to a listener. Eventually, if we have a model that ranks songs for inclusion in a topical playlist, and another personalized model that ranks songs by how likely is a specific user to like them, we might want to be able to combine the results of two such models.", "Different approaches can support these scenarios in different ways. For example, if we model each person/topic as a probability distribution over all songs, where playlists are generated on-the-fly by repeated samplings (without repetitions), any number of such models can easily be combined into a single probability distribution, and then the same process can be used to generate the adapted playlist. If, however, we use some ML model ranking songs using a score, we might have to devise a way to make scores of different models comparable, or use generic ways to integrate several rankings over the same set of items.", "For example, training a neural-network-based sequence model for text classification from scratch usually requires a lot of information if you can\u2019t rely on pre-trained models or word embeddings. If, for example, we\u2019re building a script-or-module classifier for code files, this might be exactly the situation we\u2019re in. In this case, and assuming each programming language represents an independent domain, NN models might not function well for very rare programming languages, or those we have very few labels for.", "Example: Let\u2019s say we are building a recommendation system for products in our online marketplace, used by numerous merchants, where new merchants join and start to sell their products every day. Using a neural-network-based model that learns an embedding for merchants \u2014 and/or their products \u2014 over some data representing them can perform surprisingly well for such new merchants by mapping them close to similar existing merchants in the embedding space, and then drawing upon the knowledge already learned on how likely different shoppers are to purchase certain products from existing merchants.", "Does the approach handle noise in the data? How?", "Again, recall that what I call the model development phase is the part of the data science project where a lot of data processing is done (including feature generation, if used), actual models are applied to actual data \u2014 in supervised scenarios they are trained or fitted \u2014 and are benchmarked using some predetermined metric, often on a set aside test/validation set.", "You can think of the whole thing as one big iteration \u2014 no matter how many approaches are examined \u2014 but I prefer to think of it as several iterations, each dedicated to a single approach. These are either carried out in parallel, or in sequence, by the ranking we outlined at the end of the research phase, where an approach failure \u2014 estimating that model sub-performance is due to basic inapplicability or mismatch of the current approach to the problem \u2014 leads to a new model development iteration over the next-best approach.", "Similar to all other phases, the final checkpoint is a joint discussion with the product manager in charge to validate that the model-to-be-deployed actually satisfies project KPIs. Yet before that another review is given by a peer.", "As in the research review, the motivation here is that model development phase errors can also be costly. These errors are almost always discovered in production, and may require active model monitoring to catch. Otherwise, they are caught late in the productization phase, while requiring a developer/data engineer and exposing gaps between implicit assumptions made about engineering capabilities or the production environment; the technical validity check done at the end of the research phase is meant to mitigate some of these errors. However, since many of them are (1) technical, (2) implementation-based and (3) model-specific they can often only be examined during and after this stage, and so the model development review also handles them.", "The goals, thus, are the same: First, providing a structured review process to the model development phase that will increase peer scrutiny by formally incorporating it into the project flow. Second, reducing the risk of costly errors by examining a prepared list of questions and issues to check for based on valuable experience of other data scientists who had to tackle them.", "There are three simple steps to make in preparation of the review:", "The data scientist under review should cover the following points in his presentation:", "The same structure is suggested here for the review meeting:", "Again, Philip Tannor created a checklist of questions and issues to use when reviewing the model development phase, divided into the following categories:", "There is no point in replicating the list here, especially since Philip plans to maintain his, so just go and read his blog post.", "Similar to my suggested data science project flow for startups, this is just an early draft. We are testing this approach to DS peer review at one of my clients\u2019 teams, and I promise to report back on the results. Also, I\u2019d love to hear feedback from other teams trying to implement this approach or a related one \u2014 I\u2019m sure many of you out there went through similar processes and emerged with your own approaches.", "As always, I\u2019m putting this out there to hear about the things I missed or got wrong, and to get your honest feedback. Hit me up through any of the contact options you can find at the bottom of my personal website. Also, feel free to reach out to me about hiring me as a consultant. :)", "Edit: For takeaways from a year of implementing this approach, see my following blog post: Postmortem: A Year of Data Science Peer Review in Startups", "Your home for data science.
