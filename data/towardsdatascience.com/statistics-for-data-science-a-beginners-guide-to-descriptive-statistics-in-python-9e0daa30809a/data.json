Why Statistics? In simpler terms, before any model can be developed, we need to be 100% sure of the data we are working with. The general idea being, \u201cit is advisable to use clean data\u201d for any machine learning algorithm, else the model ends up producing results contrary to what\u2019s expected out of it. Think of it like a painter, who starts painting a portrait, but the palette used is not clean enough. Will that produce a painting that will go for an auction or will stay in one corner of the house?", "But wait. Statistics is not that simple. Multiple underlying theories need to be validated before any assumption or methodology can be used. We all are familiar with bell curves or curves used to demonstrate the normal distribution of the data. If you are familiar with the fundamentals of statistics, you will realize that the normal distribution is a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. The X-axis represents the data points, whereas the Y-axis talks about the probability density estimate of the given point. Confused? I will make it clear later on. But the general idea being, as a beginner we need not bother ourselves with every component of statistics, rather focus on the more useful ones.", "Statistics can be divided into Descriptive and Inferential. Descriptive statistics talk about data summarization, tables, graphs, and charts whereas Inferential statistics is a method that talks about a population parameter from a sample. All soccer fans, Lionel Messi scoring 48 goals in a season is descriptive statistics. What does that tell us about his chances of winning a Champions League final is inferential statistics. How can we go from a description of Lionel Messi\u2019s performance to what his probability of winning a Champions League football reflects the journey of statistics? It is more about answering \u201cWhat is?\u201d vs. \u201cWhat else it might be?\u201d.", "A population is usually not observed, the reason being when working with data, we don\u2019t have access to every entity of the problem space. Also often there are data leaks or data lost during collation. Hence every data is considered as a subset of a population.", "Data types are an important component of statistics as it determines the type of descriptive or inferential operation one can perform on the data. As illustrated below all variables (often referred to as attributes, data, columns) can be broken into two categories of Qualitative and Quantitative. Qualitative data allows for operations like count, graphs, plots, modes, whereas Quantitative data allows for operations like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles, and so on.", "Raw data represents numbers and facts in the original format in which the data have been collected. The raw data needs to be converted into a form that can be utilized for decision making. Data extracted \u2192 is converted into information \u2192 which is then used to obtain knowledge about a scenario. Descriptive statistics is more about converting data to information. Now to start, let\u2019s look at frequency distribution first. A frequency distribution is used to classify raw data into information. One common example of using frequency distribution is to analyze the count of data across different buckets using a histogram plot.", "The range of data is divided into bins. These bins are then used to calculate the count of records under each group. E.g. Say we have access to two weeks of sales data from K Mart post lockdown. We want to analyze, how the sale value looks like across different buckets. In the example below, we can observe that in the past two weeks, there were three instances when the observed figure ranged from 44 to 46. Using this we can analyze, are sales figures different across days, or have they been similar post lockdown? What do you think?", "From here on, we will take examples to understand the concepts of statistics. K Mart Supermarket recorded sales of their store in Melbourne post lockdown. Now using a central tendency they want to analyze how their business went in the last week of September. Here are the three questions the store manager wants to answer.1. What is the average sale volume?2. What is the median sales last week?3. Is \u201csale volume\u201d similar for most of the days?", "Using figures 4 and 5 we can answer the trend observed post lockdown. In general, the average sale was observed to be around 85 units whereas the median and mode values are 80 and 50 respective. The mode provides us a bigger picture of the trend observed post lockdown. Can we infer that post lockdown K Mart usually observes a sale volume of 50 units?", "In simple terms, dispersion indicates how large the spread of the distribution is around the central tendency. The range is the simplest of all measures. It is calculated as the difference between the minimum and maximum value in a given data. If maximum data is equal to the minimum then it implies all observations are the same. However, when the difference is >0 we can infer that the data is dispersed. E.g. In the figure below, when we look into the sale volume by days, we can infer that the minimum and maximum sales figures are 30 and 65 respectively. Hence the range here is 65\u201330 which is 35. The variation of dispersion provides a picture of the range of sales that was observed post lockdown.", "Note: Range is not used for scenarios where either the maximum or minimum value becomes an extreme, i.e. if the minimum is too small or the maximum is too large we should refrain from using the range.", "What is the Median value in this example below?", "Dispersion provides a wide range of information about the data and is used as a key concept to detect and handle outliers. Dispersion provides information about the data distribution and answers key questions about the trend of a variable.", "The boxplot provides a picture of how sales figures are distributed. Note, the Median is 45, Q1 and Q3 values are 41.5 and 50.5 respectively. IQR is represented as Q3-Q1=9. Any value beyond Q1\u20131.5xIQR or Q3+1.5xIQR, which are 28 and 64 are considered as an outlier. Since 65 (sales figure observed on 30th September) falls beyond the upper limit, it is considered as an outlier.", "Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values or observations. Standard deviations are calculated as the square root of variance. Variance is a measure of how far the data points are compared to the mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the values are closer to the mean, whereas a high standard deviation is an indication of extreme values or skewness of the data. Standard deviation like dispersion is used as a metric to analyze the distribution of data.", "Time to pick up a calculator and do the math. The formulas for variance and skewness are outlined on the right side of the image. Standard deviation can be used to answer a multitude of questions ranging from:", "Correlation is a measure of the degree of association between two variables. It provides some directionality into how one variable changes w.r.t the other. Correlation can range between -1 to +1, where -1 signifies two variables being negatively correlated, i.e. if one variable increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. A correlation of 0 signifies no relationship between two variables, i.e. increase or decrease of one variable, doesn\u2019t impact the other. A correlation of +1 indicates that if one variable increases then the other variable displays a similar trend. Always remember that correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation. It only talks about the degree of association.", "Statistics helps us in understanding the following:", "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
