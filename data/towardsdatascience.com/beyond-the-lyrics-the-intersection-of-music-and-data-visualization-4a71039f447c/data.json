I recently created a Spotify developer account, learned how to scrape lyrics, learned about sentiment analysis, word clouds, and other NLP concepts, and taught myself how to use an awesome interactive data visualization software called Tableau. And, most importantly of all, I have a long list of further projects I want to tackle next.", "I would be remiss not to give credit to the two Medium articles that helped me stumble in a productive, ever forward-moving direction. The first one is called \u201cExtracting Spotify data on your favourite artist via Python\u201d by Rare Loot. The second one is called \u201cWord Clouds in Tableau: Quick & Easy\u201d by one of my favorite Towards Data Science authors, Parul Pandey.", "After I retrieved my client id and client secret from Spotify, I wanted to tackle a mini project to get acquainted with the API. I quickly browsed the Spotify for Developers discover page to get inspired by the already existing applications made by fellow members of the community. Some of my personal favorites are Playlist Souffle and Artist Explorer.", "I then read an article that talked about this mysterious library called spotipy, and with a name as perfect as that, you can probably guess what my next move was\u2026 yup, a good old pip install. The spotipy library enables you to extract audio features (e.g. acousticness, energy, tempo, danceability, liveness, loudness, instrumentalness, speechiness, valence, etc.) from any given song. Some of these words may sound made up (and they are), but these audio features can actually tell you a lot about a song, I would soon learn.", "So alas, I started playing around with some code. The first embedded Medium article that I took inspiration from walks a reader through how to extract feature data on your favorite Spotify artist. I wanted to deviate from this use case by visualizing the median feature values of a cohesive playlist of one genre of music juxtaposed against a cohesive playlist of a totally different genre of music. I decided to compare a sad playlist (called \u201csad\u201d) that I shamelessly listen to sometimes, a most-definitely-not-sad playlist (called \u201cHype Stuff\u201d) made by my 18-year-old brother, and an instrumental playlist that I listen to while studying (called \u201cacademia\u201d).", "The setup looks something like this:", "Next, I made a list of Spotify URIs for each of the three playlists and extracted the audio features for each song, placing them in a dictionary with playlist names as keys and lists of feature data as values. If you are interested in seeing the code, check out the gist below.", "Now, for the fun stuff. Here is the code to take those feature values and make a radar graph.", "If you are curious about how the spotipy library analyzes music to extract features, visit this link to learn more about the features. I ended up only including 7 features on my radar graph because I was not interested in liveness, loudness, or popularity. Liveness and loudness don\u2019t tell me anything insightful about music, and popularity is far too subjective to infer any meaning.", "I think all the features are pretty self-explanatory except for valence and energy. Valence describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). Take the valence of the rap playlist with a grain of salt because I am not sure if the feature relies more heavily on lyrical content or beat progression. Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Pretty accurate, right? These descriptions serve as a good sanity check for any data visualization you produce.", "The radar graph above allows us to make split-second inferences about the key characteristics of each respective playlist. For example, rap music has the fastest tempo, the most speech, and the highest energy and danceability scores. You might want to take a seat for this next observation: the instrumental playlist has the highest instrumental score and the sad playlist has the highest acoustic score. Even though the graph kind of tells us what one could easily hypothesize about the playlists that were examined, imagine studying how your \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d playlist changes over time or something else that is a little more obscure. Radar graphs are not only powerful, but they are an art form. The process of making them successfully will make you feel super sophisticated as a programmer. When you feel that you have graduated from the matplotlib basics that might resemble the code snippet below, you should move on up to radar graphs.", "Python and matplotlib have always been my bread and butter when it comes to executing a project from conception to visualization, but I was craving something novel relative to my skillset, something that would require learning and hacking and tinkering before I could reach my end goal. Enter Tableau. I have seen countless LinkedIn job postings that namedrop Tableau as a desired qualification, but I never knew what it was or what was so great about it. So I did some homework and learned about its capabilities. I came to the conclusion that it would be optimal for my needs because it would give me more control of my data visualization, which I deem as the most important aspect of this particular project.", "After having recently learned about Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in my Big Data class, I wanted to see if I could gain insights from song lyrics. I found a library called PyLyrics which lets you get lyrics from any mildly popular song so long as you know the song name and artist. Then I repurposed an old script to clean up song lyrics into a useful list of words.", "I wanted to analyze the lyrical content of different albums by the same artist. I was particularly interested in studying Mumford & Sons because I think that each of their albums have a very centralized theme. Additionally, Mumford & Sons is, without a doubt, my dad\u2019s favorite band of all time, so I learned how to play the \u201cair banjo\u201d from a young age and definitely hold their music close to my heart. For those who don\u2019t know, they are a British folk rock band with a very distinct sound. The lead singer, Marcus Mumford, is often described as having gravely, throaty vocals that come from a place of deep passion and emotion.", "The band\u2019s album Wilder Mind features songs called \u201cThe Wolf\u201d, \u201cMonster\u201d, \u201cSnake Eyes\u201d, and \u201cBroad-Shouldered Beasts\u201d, but one could argue that at the heart of all their lyrics is this potent theme of love. Their most recent album Delta, on the other hand, aches of emptiness and longing. It features songs called \u201cGuiding Light\u201d, \u201cPicture You\u201d, \u201cIf I Say\u201d, \u201cWoman\u201d, \u201cBeloved\u201d, and \u201cSlip Away\u201d. Just the juxtaposition of the song titles alone was enough for me to plunge full-force into this sentiment analysis project. I set out to produce a visualization of lyrics that would demonstrate the stark contrast between the two albums.", "Word clouds are a fun way to get quick insight into which words are used in a corpus of text, so the first thing I did was sifted through the lyrics and performed pretty rigorous data cleaning. The data cleaning process consisted of the following steps:", "Once that was finished, I made a dictionary of corpora (the plural of \u201ccorpus\u201d) based on which album the words were extracted from. I used a counter object to get the frequencies of each word in each corpus, and then I wrote the data to a comma-separated values (CSV) file that I would import into Tableau later. The CSV file was structured according to the schematic diagram provided below.", "While I had all the data readily available in my Jupyter Notebook, I used the Python wordcloud library to produce a quick word cloud for each corpus grouped up by album. You can see the result below. It was interesting that the words \u201clove\u201d and \u201cheart\u201d can be found without much effort in each of the 4 subplots in the image below. Each album also has its own unique set of high-frequency words which are pretty interesting and enable us to infer themes.", "I still wanted a bit more control over my word cloud. I wanted to be able to control the color and size of each word \u2014 and maybe even shape if I wanted to really go crazy with it. So I launched Tableau on my Desktop and played around with it until I produced a visualization I was happy with. Check out the GIF below if you are curious about what I did.", "In the word cloud above, all of the most common words from various Mumford & Sons song lyrics can be visualized. Each word is designated a color that is associated with which album the song lyric belongs to (see the legend on the right hand side). One thing that is interesting about this figure is that the words that stand out most are \u201clove\u201d and \u201cheart\u201d, and you might actually discover multiple occurrences of those words if you look long enough. The Wilder Mind album contains a lot of imagery of monsters and beasts, with words like \u201ceyes\u201d and \u201cmind\u201d jumping out at us. Delta, on the other hand, contains words like \u201cforever\u201d, \u201clight\u201d, and \u201cever-lasting\u201d. This inherent sentiment analysis made through the simple observation of which words stand out just goes to show that tools like word clouds can be very powerful in helping us learn about music. Moreover, the research exigence \u2014 studying themes encapsulated in different albums by the same artist \u2014 can be explored with actual lyrical data rather than just knowledgeable experts in the music industry.", "The last project involved producing a visualization to examine lyrics in a more insightful way, but I realized that the CSV file could actually hold additional variables that further tell us something about the lyrics. For instance, what if we used sentiment analysis to study how positively charged or negatively charged the words in a given subset of songs are? And then we could potentially use machine learning to classify a song into a genre based on its sentiment distribution. Okay, let\u2019s not get carried away just yet, but this is all very promising.", "To set up the case study, I looked at two popular Spotify playlists: Mood Booster and Punk Rock Classics. I picked these two playlists for no other reason except for the fact that they are polar opposites in terms of sentiment, in my opinion.", "Pop music is typically about love, money, partying, etc., so we can make the argument that the lyrics touch on generally lighter-hearted topics than punk rock music. Another interesting comparison we can draw is the time period in which the music was written. There is a gap of about a decade, on average, between the sets of songs from the two different playlists, so perhaps that has something to do with what we will see in the visualization.", "I followed pretty much the same procedure for scraping the data as I did in the previous subproject, save for one new element: afinn scores. The afinn library, made by Finn \u00c5rup Nielsen, offers a wordlist-based approach for sentiment analysis in Python. The premise is that it places all words somewhere along a spectrum, where -5 is the most negatively charged word that could possibly exist, 0 is neutral, and +5 is the most positively charged word possible. Get a sense of how it works using this web app if you are curious!", "To produce the Tableau visualizations I was envisioning for this project, I would need one more column (F4) in my CSV file. Below is the schematic for the new data setup. Note that column 1 (F1) now contains genre type rather than album name. Everything else is exactly the same, though, and all the same cleaning had to be done to get the words that would inevitably populate the new word cloud(s).", "I won\u2019t bore you by walking through the same procedure in Tableau now that you already have a solid understanding of word clouds and what goes into making them. Let\u2019s see the visualizations already!", "As the above visualization shows, there are notably more negatively charged words in the \u201cPunk Rock Classics\u201d playlist as compared to the \u201cMood Booster\u201d playlist. The only negative word that appears with high frequency in the \u201cMood Booster\u201d playlist is the word \u201chell\u201d, which has a sentiment score of -4.0. It also appears in the lyrics of many punk rock songs, apparently. That being said, punk rock songs aren\u2019t purely angsty or laden with only negative emotion. There is mention of \u201clove\u201d and \u201chope\u201d and \u201cwant\u201d-ing and \u201cwish\u201d-ing in the lyrics. Overall, though, these two word clouds are pretty interesting to analyze, especially after filtering out words with a frequency of, say, less than 10.", "One big limitation that I wish I could have resolved was having to produce 2 separate word clouds and compare them side-by-side. My aim was to have one word cloud and to color the words according to two different variables: one being the genre (stored in F1) and the other being the afinn score (stored in F4). I was never able to figure out how to make two different color spectra for one plot, but this is merely a starting point for me with Tableau.", "If you have interest in replicating any of these projects or taking some of these tools to the next level, all of the code can be found in my GitHub repository for this project: https://github.com/sejaldua/lyrical-sentiment-analysis. The code is cleanly organized and commented within the Jupyter Notebook called public_code.ipynb. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact me at sejaldua@gmail.com if you have any questions.", "If you take anything away from this article, I hope it is that studying music from a data science angle is a boundless endeavor. There is audio feature extraction, lyrical sentiment analysis, listening behavior, and so much more out there, just waiting to be examined. There are also so many different data lenses and techniques with which you can explore music. The Spotify API is a true blessing to work with, and Tableau makes data visualization seem much cleaner and easier than you and I both know it is.
