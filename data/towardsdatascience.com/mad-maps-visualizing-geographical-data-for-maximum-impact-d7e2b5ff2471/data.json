You have no doubt had maps flood your Twitter timeline and news feeds already, and the next few weeks after Nov. 3rd will see an escalation of that.", "We take maps for granted these days, and it\u2019s not difficulty to see why. Smartphones have commoditised technology to accurately locate us and provide live directions to the 5 nearest Japanese restaurants with at least a 4.0 rating. Maps have never been more integrated in our lives, even though just a decade ago people still used street directories. (Shudders)", "But it would be doing the field of cartography a huge disservice to say that Google Maps is the final evolution of maps. It\u2019s far from the truth, and while useful, that\u2019s only a small part of what maps can do.", "Maps are feats of human ingenuity that can help to derive unique insights and effectively convey them, whether they be demographic, economic, health, or indeed political.", "Imagine being an early cartographer, and accurately tracing the surface contours of our world from the ground level. Imagine being among the first people from your nation to explore certain regions of the world, and capturing on a page their form, inhabitants, flora and fauna such that the next people to arrive can navigate the world that little bit more safely and quickly. Imagine how it might feel to create something that will help inform and guide everybody from fishermen to generals.", "Cartography in other words creates visual aids to help users navigate through the treacherous seas of data, as in \u2014 the precursor to the broader field of data visualisation. The knowledge that one of the first known examples of data visualisation was an augmented map (of cholera outbreaks) has a certain quality of full circle to it as well, especially given the current pandemic and the proliferation of dashboards.", "With this relative simple map, John Snow was able to visualise the disease incidence data and illustrate that a central location of the outbreaks (and the water pump located there) was likely to be the cause of cholera cases.", "Fast forward to today, there exist amazing data visualisation tools (like Plotly, DataWrapper or Tableau) that are able to plot maps that are not only packed with information, but also visually striking.", "As an example, take a look at this image of crops farmed in the United States:", "Or this map of income support provided by various governments during the pandemic:", "Maps are truly amazing tools for visualizing data. And so in this article, let\u2019s take a look at how to create our own maps to visualise spatial data.", "To follow along, install plotly, pandas, and numpy. Install each (in your virtual environment) with a simple pip install [PACKAGE_NAME].", "You can find all of the required data and code here (look at the draw_map.py file):", "In this article we will plot data onto a map of the United States at a county level. To do this, we need a base dataset layout the county locations. Let\u2019s use the Plotly-recommended GeoJSON file:", "One easily available dataset at county level is by income. I have pre-processed the dataset (from the US census) and saved it to a dataframe, so simply load it here like so:", "To check that it includes appropriate data and right number of rows / columns, by running commands such as data_df.head(), data_df.info():", "(The dataframe should include 3223 rows, and each row should include a fips code.)", "The easiest, and most obvious thing to do, would be to respect the geographical boundaries and plot the data onto what is known as a choropleth map. Choropleth maps colour each area based on whatever quality is being described.", "What I am doing here is pretty simple. The data is passed on as the first argument (data_df); from which the fips column and the Median_Household_Income_2018 column are passed on as the location and color data respectively; and the counties variable is our GeoJSON data that we downloaded before.", "The update_layout and update_traces methods are run for aesthetic reasons; setting the map style, zoom level, location and figure margins.", "You might have noticed that I set the range of colours here to between 0 and 100,000. I chose this value as 50,000 is just about the median value for the dataset. It is designed to make those \u201cmiddle\u201d values look as neutral as possible.", "It\u2019s a good looking map! You can definitely see general trends of what is going on across the country.", "Edit: Here are some things that a super helpful Redditor was able to pick out from just looking the map (full comment here):", "See that teensy weensy blue dot in northern New Mexico? That\u2019s Los Alamos County. It includes two towns whose economy revolves around the local national lab, which hires thousands of scientists and engineers. Los Alamos has the highest number of PhDs per capita of any county.", "That huge blotch of blue in the DC area shows us that five of the eight richest counties in America border DC. They have dozens of federal agencies whose employees don\u2019t rely on the good economy to keep their jobs\u2026nor do any of the local businesses that cater to them. Thus, DC is the recession-proof city.", "That splotch of orange in eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia are laid-off coal miners and Appalachians who live in poverty.", "The orange spots in South Dakota and the Four Corners area are Native American reservations. Those places are perennially hit the hardest with poverty.", "The Black Belt along the Mississippi Delta and across the Deep South is visible. Rural African Americans struggle to make ends meet and suffer disproportionately from AIDS, diabetes, and obesity.", "Isn\u2019t that amazing? Just another reminder that data is infinitely richer in context, and that there are real people from whom the data comes from. You can find the commenter (Alex) here if you\u2019re interested in what else they know.", "Let\u2019s go another step further. What if we wanted to identify certain demographics, like lower-income or higher-income counties? We can get some idea with this map, but we can do better.", "One way to achieve that is by filtering the dataframe. As Plotly will simply ignore the missing data points (as you may have noticed above with the one non-coloured county), we don\u2019t even need to replace the missing values with placeholders.", "You\u2019ll notice that the code is more or less exactly the same. The only thing I\u2019ve done differently here is to filter the data and pass on the filtered dataframe. And voila!", "And we can make similar changes to plot the high-income counties.", "These maps do a better job of highlighting subsets of data \u2014 the majority of the lower-income counties are in the South, and many of the higher-income counties are in the coastal areas.", "Another advantage of plotting just a subset of this data is that it becomes easier to see gradients within the subset by manipulating the colorscales. Take a look:", "What I\u2019ve done here is to compress the range (to between 20,000 and 40,000), and then change the colourscale to a sequential (Oranges) one, reversed so that the lower colours are darker. The below is the result:", "And similarly with the higher-income counties, but with blue colours, and unbound colours (so that it naturally extends to the limits of the dataset).", "With these plots, the lowest-income counties and highest-income counties are really able to be highlighted.", "But what other patterns might exist? This is where choropleth maps begin to show their limitations. It only allows one variable to be plotted onto a fixed area.", "To explore the data, let\u2019s simplify presentation of the data by grouping data points (counties) together; in this case by county population sizes, and by household income.", "We could, for instance, split the counties by quartiles using the pd.qcut function:", "This will group the data by the number of counties. This might not be what we want, however \u2014 as the smaller counties will be underrepresented in terms of population.", "Already we can see that second plot reveals details that the first doesn\u2019t. While we can\u2019t see much correlation between the geography and the variable, the latter chart shows a clear correlation. Through this simple chart, we can see that county populations have some impact on typical incomes.", "So how can we plot data like this onto a particular geography?", "As great as choropleth maps are, it does have one big flaw. It\u2019s that the size always matters. As our brain is naturally inclined to take sizes as an indicator of significance on a map, the size of each area in a choropleth map always comes across as though it is significant. Even when the number that really matters might be, say, population rather than size.", "That might be a little abstract, so here\u2019s a real example. This is a map of the counties of the world. We\u2019ve all seen it a countless number of times:", "And then here is the world, where the borders were scaled by population. Notice how certain places like my home country (Australia) has shrunk to oblivion, while others like Indonedia is now much, much larger.", "Imagine colouring the first map with something like income, against colouring the second map with the same thing. They\u2019re going to look incredibly different.", "So instead, let\u2019s build a bubble chart. I am a huge fan of bubble charts; it allows us to represent another dimension of data with bubble sizes.", "So in the same spirit, let\u2019s plot our county map as a bubble chart where one bubble represents each county, and its size is based on the population. We won\u2019t be resizing the map as they\u2019ve done above, but resize what gets plotted into the map.", "The first step is going to be to choose one location for each county that will house each bubble. As a crude solution, I am going to pick a centre of a bounding box of each GeoJSON shape.", "This requires some familiarity with the GeoJSON data format, but once you take a few seconds to look through it you will understand what is going on here.", "Basically, the data is in a form of nested lists (in dictionaries), so this script looks through the list to get the lower left (min, min) boundary and the upper right (max, max) coordinates. Subsequently we collect the centre of the box, and build a dataframe along with the fips code.", "You should have a county_df that looks like this:", "From then on, it\u2019s a trivial matter of grabbing the income and population data, and plotting the graph.", "I choose to do it here using the .join method, and then simply plot the data. Note that the Ploty Express function that I use here is scatter_mapbox, not choropleth_mapbox, but everything here should be pretty self-explanatory.", "The only thing I had to tinker with was the size_max attribute; which is more or less down to personal preference.", "And we get this glorious looking graph:", "I compressed the ranges here for visual impact; but the picture is drastically different to above which essentially plots the same data, sans population. Take a look at this comparison:", "With a focus on the county populations, the majority of the middle of the country simply disappears and the coastal areas are highlighted. On the other hand, a focus on size of the counties brings your eye immediately to the southern states.", "I am not saying either visualisation is better. I do wish to note that it really highlights how visual representation of the same (income) data can look drastically different.", "As creators of these graphs, it is worth thinking about how to best support your message.", "And as readers, it might be worth considering whether the conclusions you might draw from a visual is actually warranted.", "Just a side note, but I think an important one in this visual world of ours.", "If you liked this, say hi / follow on twitter, or follow here for updates. ICYMI: I also wrote this article about Streamlit and Dash, two very popular packages for creating online dashboards with Python.", "And here\u2019s another article with geographical data visualisation \u2014 this time visualising NBA travel!", "Stay safe; and see you next time!", "Your home for data science.
