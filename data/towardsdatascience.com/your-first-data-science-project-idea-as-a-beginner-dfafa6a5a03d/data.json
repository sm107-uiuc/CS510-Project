Feel free to follow this series:", "I recently graduated from Chemical Engineering and landed my first role in the data realm in a tech company. During my interview process for data science positions, one of the most frequent questions that was brought up was", "\u2018What are some data science projects that you have done?\u2019", "This question is perhaps unsurprising. Almost certainly, an interview of a data science position will be incomplete without a question on the interviewee\u2019s data science project.", "Especially for someone without formal training in data science, a data science project is extremely crucial in allowing you to stand out among other data science candidates because it", "Therefore, if I were to provide advice to new data science learners, it would be to \u2014", "Create a strong project that showcases your technical abilities and your unique insight into your area of interest.", "This post provides a simple guideline on how to do that in three sections:", "Before diving into doing a project, it is generally a good idea to brush up on your technical knowledge and coding expertise. This reduces the steepness of the learning curve during project execution, making it more frictionless. Without such knowledge, you might find yourself getting stuck or not knowing how to troubleshoot the process.", "My recommendation is thus to have some basic knowledge in a coding language (R or python) and machine learning algorithms. To understand where to learn these, feel free to refer to my guide \u2014", "When you learn a programming language, the first step is to print a hello world statement. Similarly, the \u2018hello world\u2019 of data science is to start a data science project on a simple data set from start to finish.", "This gives you to get a glimpse of the full data science project cycle \u2014 which starts from getting an understanding of the business, to preparing the data, modelling the data, evaluating the model and then deploying the model.", "Here are some example of warm-up data science projects:", "My favorite beginner-friendly project is the Titanic Survivorship Project. This data set uses machine learning model that predicts which passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck.", "There are at least two good reasons why this is a great first project. Firstly, the data set is extremely clean and does not require extensive cleaning. Secondly, there are many excellent exemplary projects on this data set that are instructive to the beginner.", "For instance, here are a few notebooks that I have referred to extensively when I was implementing the project.", "Another great data set that can act as a warm-up data science project is the prediction of housing prices. For this, the King\u2019s Housing data set is a relatively clean data set that provides a reasonable number of features. There are also some excellent notebooks that you can emulate:", "It is an oft-repeated adage that one should not undertake a project that has been done many times. When a data science practitioner presents a project that was heavily reused, the reader might wonder how much of the project is original. To avoid the possibility of plagiarism \u2014 inadvertent or otherwise \u2014 an original project is strongly recommended.", "Now, you might ask \u2014 how do I find a project that is new and interesting? I will go through that extensively in this post.", "The project brainstorming phase can be broken down into three essential questions, as illustrated in this diagram.", "Once you have the answer to the three, you can identify what lies in the middle of three", "Let me explain these in a little more details.", "The topic of the project should be one in which you can provide a unique insight. Something that you are extremely passionate about, something that is quirky and interesting, or something that is related to the company that you are applying for.", "Did you come from a marketing background? You may do well in a project that involves customer segmentation.", "Are you a sports junkie? Maybe sports analytics is your turf. Here\u2019s a site that provides a list of sports-related data sets.", "Do you have a background in finance? Perhaps you can look at look at datasets related to banking and finance. For instance, credit card fraud detection might be a topic that you are very knowledgable in.", "Above are only a few non-exhaustive examples of what topics you could pick from. You should ask yourself \u2014 what are the topics that interest me?", "Today, data science learners can access excellent data sets with a click. Here are some data sources that are popular among data scientists \u2014", "Are you interested in a digital marketing company? Or a start-up? A data consultancy firm? Or a big tech firm?", "As much as possible, you should customize your project idea to the industry or the company that you are interested in.", "Why\u2019s that? If you are able to showcase a project that is highly related to the company that you are interested in, you are demonstrating not just an awareness of the problems faced by the company, but also the competency in solving those problems.", "Put yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager and ask yourself \u2014 what does a relevant project look like? What projects will I be impressed with?", "For instance, if you are interested in a role at an e-commerce company like Amazon, these projects (highlighted in this blog post) are likely to be very relevant.", "The skill set of a data scientist is broad and somewhat ambiguous. Different companies might have differing requirements. As such, you might want to research for job descriptions of your ideal role to find out what skills you want to demonstrate.", "Regardless, several core technical competencies are common in the job description of a data scientist.", "It might not be possible to demonstrate all the skill sets in one particular project. Therefore, you might want to strategically select only some skill sets to demonstrate.", "In deciding on a project, you should ask yourself", "\u2018Does this project allow me to showcase my capability in these skill sets?\u2019", "Here are some resources to consider for ideas and inspirations.", "My data science projects helped me land my role in the data realm, and I would strongly recommend you to start brainstorming yours today if you are serious about breaking into the field.", "Don\u2019t have an idea?
