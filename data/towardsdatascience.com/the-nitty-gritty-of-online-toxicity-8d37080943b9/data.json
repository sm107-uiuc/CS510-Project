Much of the discussions and discourse online took places in forums which were usually dedicated for people sharing certain interests. Things have changed a lot since the boom of social media and interacting with strangers online has become a lot more common and difficult at the same time and moderating such discourse has been a technical and ethical challenge for many platforms. While freedom of speech is important, creating an inclusive platform for meaningful discourse is also necessary.", "Using the data released by Jigsaw as a part of their challenge on Kaggle, I have tried to explore the way we hate online. Let\u2019s get started.", "Having meaningful discourse online could be more difficult for certain groups of people than we realise. Being part of a group which receives the most hate online could be really discouraging and prevent you from voicing out your opinions. So what are these groups?", "When we stack the toxicity for different groups next to each other, the two genders, males and females, come up on top, each scoring a little over 15% of the total hate pie. What\u2019s interesting to see is how white, christian, muslim and black collectively makes up for almost half (about 45%) of the hate in the dataset.", "Looking at the correlation heat-map between the different groups and the kind the different kind of hate, it\u2019s no surprise that the most hated groups online face the most identity attack, with white, muslim and black showing the strongest relationship.", "Studying how toxicity varies over time reveals some interesting insights as well. For example, the above plot which shows the variation of weighted toxicity over the time period starting from year 2016 to the end of 2017, its highest peak is reached in January 2017, with muslims taking the blow. So what happened in the month of January? A quick google search reveals this was the time when we President Trump announced the controversial travel ban for certain muslim countries. It\u2019s saddening to see how the internet reacted.", "So what are these toxic comments made of? In order to understand the patterns in our language, the following chart compares certain features across the most hated groups online.", "Almost all of them show a similar trend, where we observe toxic comments being slightly longer in length compared to non-toxic ones, most notably visible for the white and muslim groups.", "You might think that we would use more pronouns when it comes to hate speech. However, this is not particularly true for any of the top hated group. Besides pronouns, other parts of speech appears to have a similar average number of occurrence between toxic and non-toxic comments, at least for the groups mentioned in the plot above. This tells us something important \u2014 there is not much of a difference in terms of language structure when it comes to hate online.", "Freedom of speech is important but that does not warrant us the authority to spew toxicity out there. So what do comments look like for which the human annotators were equally divided in deciding whether it was toxic or not?", "The chart above shows the top eight frequent words in the borderline toxic comments and compares them against toxic and non-toxic ones. It is interesting to note how all the highest frequency words for borderline toxic comments appear in lower numbers in both toxic and non-toxic comments. \u2018Trump\u2019 seems to appear higher in numbers in toxic and non-toxic comments.", "Here are some examples of the three kinds:", "For both the toxic and non-toxic comments, it is immediately evident why they are labelled as such. One uses profanity and even targets a specific identity, whereas the other one has no elements of toxicity at all.", "However, it is not so easy to make a judgement about the one in between without much context which shows the importance of context in online discourse.", "Regardless of the different identity groups, the trend in toxicity appears to be upwards over time. The real world out there is already not the kindest towards certain groups of people and do we really want to make the internet just as bad or even worse for them? Asking ourselves such questions before directing our opinions towards certain groups would definitely help us make the internet a more civil place for exchanging meaningful discourse.", "And if you really want to test out if your opinion could be considered somewhat toxic, head over this web app I built which uses deep learning to predict how much of your texts could be considered as toxic, insult, identity attack, obscene or a threat.", "The application is quite easy and straight forward to use. You just have to enter your text and it will give you the results! Let me know what you think of it in the comments!", "Your home for data science.
