But how do we bring this added value to the user? Let\u2019s look at what we can do with Microsoft Teams, AI Builder in Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents.", "Sound like a lot of Power, right? Let\u2019s see it in action.", "In some of my recent stories, I\u2019ve shown how to build a no-code AI prediction Model with Microsoft\u2019s AI Builder, and we compared its performance to a typical hand-made Machine Learning model.", "Now that we have such a model, the question is how we could make its predictive power available to our business users in an easy and accessible way.", "What about a simple no-code chatbot hooked to our predictive AI model all within Microsoft Teams? No problem, let\u2019s build it!", "If you want to learn more about Power Virtual Agents (PVA), my Meet Lena story will introduce you to it.", "Let\u2019s imagine we\u2019re working for a real estate company. Calculating the potential sale price of a client\u2019s house is a daily task.", "To make this task an easy one, we\u2019ll build a Chatbot for Microsoft Teams, which triggers a dialog to collect the necessary details about the house and predict its sale price with our AI Builder model's help.", "We\u2019ve trained an AI Builder model to predict a house's sale price based on a dataset of over 2000 samples. We trained three models of complexity: Simple, Intermediate, and Complex.", "We select the simple model for this task and explore its input parameters in more detail.", "The model takes the following 4 inputs:", "Now that we know our goal, we can start building the bot. Go to https://make.powerapps.com/ and make sure you\u2019ve selected the same environment as for the AI Builder model.", "Go to Chatbots > Create and click New chatbot.", "Give the bot a user-friendly name, like \u201cBruce the Housekeeper\ud83c\udfe0,\u201d select the language, and click Create.", "After a couple of seconds, the bot should be ready, and we can go straight to dialog modeling (aka. Topics). Select Topics and click New topic on the menu bar.", "Give the new dialog a precise name and add a couple of Trigger phrases. PVA comes with out-of-the-box NLP, trained by those trigger phrases. See the screenshot below for some inspiration and click Go to authoring canvas when ready.", "As a first step, we trigger a workflow in the form of a new Power Automate Flow. Click the + icon at the end of the dialog tree, hover to Call an action, and click Create a flow.", "This will fire up the Power Automate portal and a new flow, for which we first define the necessary input parameters. Click Add an input on the trigger action and model the input as follows:", "To hook up our AI Builder prediction model, click the + Icon between our two existing actions, and select Add an action.", "Search for Predict Common Data Service and choose the Predict action from the results.", "We select our Simple AI Builder model and wire all of its input parameters to the previously created input variables.", "Once we\u2019re done, we can define the output. This is what our bot gets back from the flow.", "For this, we click Add an output.", "We define our output as Sale Price and wire it to the Prediction result of our simple AI Builder model, the predicted sale price in USD.", "Finally, we give the flow a meaningful name and hit the Save button.", "Back in the PVA portal, we open up the Call an action menu again. If all went well, it shows us the new flow for sale price prediction.", "Now that we have the flow connected to our dialog, it\u2019s time to collect the necessary input parameters. For this, we click the + icon and select Ask a question.", "Phrase the question according to its purpose, e.g., \u201cWhen was the house build or remodeled?\u201d. Choose Number as the Identify pattern since we expect the user to enter a number like 2018. Also, give the variable a meaningful name. This is where the user response gets saved.", "Repeat the same steps for Overall Quality and Lot Area and add additional questions to the dialog flow.", "Our AI Builder model requires a text input for the Exterior Quality, expressed in short strings like Ex for Excellent and Po for Poor.", "Since we can\u2019t expect the user to remember these options, we offer them as clickable choices within the dialog. For this, we choose Multiple choice options in the Identify pattern drop-down and add all possible options (Ex, Gd, TA, Fa, Po).", "Now that we\u2019ve all the questions modeled, we can wire the collected data to our workflow input. Just link the variables to the corresponding input on the action card.", "As a final step, we report the predicted sale price back to the user. Just add a Message at the end of the dialog and wrap the Sale Price variable into a user-friendly message. Don\u2019t forget to use a lot of emojis \ud83d\ude09, and of course, always hit Save.", "We can test the full dialog flow right inside the PVA portal. Just drop a message in the chat canvas and watch its prediction magic happen.", "Now that our bot is ready for work, we publish it to Microsoft Teams, so our users can interact with it efficiently.", "Go to Channels and select Microsoft Teams.", "Carefully read all the messages (\ud83d\ude09) and click Turn on Teams.", "Depending on your Team's environment, you either have to Submit the bot for admin approval or add it with a click on Open bot (added just for you).", "The Open bot action will fire up your Teams Desktop client, where we can finally add the bot to Teams.", "Bruce, our Housekeeper\ud83c\udfe0, appears on the app menu left side and is ready to chat.", "Let\u2019s say, \u201cI need help with predicting the sale price of a new house,\u201d and answer the questions as defined in our dialog flow.", "Depending on the inputs, Bruce will report the potential sale price for such a house \u2014 all predicted by our AI Builder model on the fly.", "Isn\u2019t that cool \ud83d\ude0e? Imagine the possibilities of bringing AI straight to Microsoft Teams using a Bot.", "Every single technology involved in this scenario already adds value on its own. However, the true Power unfolds when we cleverly combine them. Remember, it\u2019s all about adding value for the user and the business, so don't hide what you\u2019ve created. Bring it to the front, bring it to Teams.", "Many no-code solutions are nice, but they lack true business value. When you think about your next solution, consider adding AI models to the game, making those solutions more intelligent. This will drive adoption and mutes the discussion about license costs or make vs. buy decisions.", "Using a chatbot immediately provides cross-platform and omnichannel access. This is why it should often be the first choice when thinking about the UX of your no-code solution.", "Remember, we\u2019ve built all of the above without a single line of code. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is no-code!", "Your home for data science.
