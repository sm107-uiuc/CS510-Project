But still interesting.", "This article aims to explain in layman terms what these computer designed organisms actually are; how they are developed and how they can be beneficial to humans and our environment.", "The team involved in the research into the development of these biological machines (Xenobots) has drawn motivation from the fact that the current building blocks of human technology are based on materials that degrade and are harmful to both the environment and humans themselves.", "Xenobots present themselves as the perfect building blocks for materials. Their regenerative and biocompatible characteristics offer benefits that are steps to solving a variety of problems that we currently face today due to metal and plastic-based building blocks.", "The designing of biological machines also motivates the further exploration and discovery of the potential usefulness of cell-based organisms and technology in medicine, robotics, and other research areas.", "According to Sam Kriegman \u2014 a Ph.D. student at the University of Vermont and a member of the research group, nature\u2019s exploration into the possible combination of organisms that can be formed from biological cells is not extensive and we are required to explore areas that nature hasn\u2019t.", "Let\u2019s take a step back and understand the underlying composition of Xenobots.", "Xenobots are composed of stem cells from frogs(Xenopus Laevis), which are utilized as building blocks for the Xenobots. Skin cells and heart muscle cells were accumulated from frog embryos to form the basis of Xenobots.", "Therefore, Xenobots are best described as living robots built with underlying tissue cells.", "Rather than leveraging traditional robot-building materials, the researchers looked to nature for building materials.", "High school biology taught us that the stages of an amphibian lifecycle include it being a tadpole at the larval stage.", "Although a tadpole develops into a frog with legs that hops, they initially can swim.", "Now, Xenobots can perform locomotion that can be described as \u2018walking\u2019.", "The building blocks of Xenobots are at the embryonic stage of an amphibian lifecycle, stages before the larval and metamorphosis stage.", "So how can they walk so early on?", "Well, the research group removed something called Cilia from the Xenobots building cells.", "Cilia can be described as rhythmic moving hairs that can attribute to a swimming motion.", "The movement abilities of Xenobots are actually derived from the heart cells developing contractile muscles, basically heartbeat motion.", "The orchestrator of the assembly of these building blocks is a computer modeling system with an embedded evolutionary algorithm.", "The evolutionary algorithm randomly selects different configurations of building the Xenobots and selects the best Xenobot structural design based on the success of completing a given goal.", "But what is an evolutionary algorithm?", "An Evolutionary algorithms(EAs) is a process that optimizes the solution to a problem through methods that resemble or mimic natural selection.", "The process involves an isolated environment, where occupants of the environment are randomly generated with an embedded goal to achieve.", "After a certain length of time, a selection process commences. This selection process picks suitable candidates from the randomly generated population to produce offsprings for the next iteration of the process.", "The process repeats for a specified number of repetitions or generations and terminates once specific criteria are met.", "More information in regards to evolutionary algorithms can be found here:", "The algorithm that designs the structure of the biological organisms runs several structural compositions in a simulation until the most suitable composition is designed and then transferred to mold the actual organisms.", "We now have some understanding of Xenobots.", "An exploration of what benefits can they bring to humankind and our environment will create a view into what a future with an advanced version of these organisms could look like.", "Generally speaking, Xenobots and the research group work are still in the early stages for the long term benefits and utilization to be realized.", "Nonetheless, a vision guided by the unlimited boundaries of our imagination will steer advancement to a positive foreseeable future.", "No new development within the biological and AI field doesn\u2019t come with a slice of worry and speculation.", "There are obvious ethical issues that the development of Xenobots touches on.", "But even more widespread is the development of AI or AI-controlled organisms wiping out humans.", "Can Xenobots be programmed for evil intent?", "At the current state, the answer is No.", "The current Xenobots have a life span of seven days, and under the right conditions, they can live for more weeks or months. Humans win in the lifespan and longevity game.", "Humans have benefited tremendously from evolution. Xenobots, in their current state, do not evolve. Again human has an advantage here.", "There is a possibility that these Xenobots could be weaponized. Sam Kriegman stated that the creation of dangerous organisms through AI is not any more accessible than a biologist with ill intent doing the same. He also goes on to support the introduction of regulations around the application of Xenobots or any future versions.", "There you have it, Xenobots, in a nutshell.", "They are small, cool, and not here to destroy humans.", "And for us humans, the introduction of computer-designed organisms paves the way for a more steady pace of advancement and innovation in the field of cellular biology and AI algorithms.", "The start of the new decade has been eventful and will nonetheless continue at the same pace. New developments and discoveries are around the corner, and they will lead to more innovative and intuitive applications of technology to our everyday lives.", "It is indeed an exciting time.", "For More information on the \u2018Computer Designed Organisms\u2019 is provided in the following links:", "Your home for data science.
