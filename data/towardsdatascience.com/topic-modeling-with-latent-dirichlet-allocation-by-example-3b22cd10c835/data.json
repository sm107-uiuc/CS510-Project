Feeling lost in countless posts, tweets, comments, articles, pages, documents? Seeking out what people write about? You are not alone.", "In this tutorial, I provide a practical guide with proven hands-on Python code for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of texts or documents.", "We are going to apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to a set of tweets and split them into topics. Let\u2019s get started!", "We will be working with tweets from the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account. The dataset consists of all tweets from the account from 5/4/2009.", "The dataset is from http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive. An extract of the raw archive is given below.", "Pre-processing the text is important because language is ambiguous at all levels: lexical, phrasal, semantic. We make the tweets all lowercase and remove stopwords. They are commonly used words, which do not add significant meaning to the tweet. Below are examples of stopwords from the natural language toolkit (NLTK).", "Given the nature of tweets, we want to be careful with punctuation marks and terms like RT (used for re-tweets) and VIA (used to mention the original author), which are not in the default English stop-word list. We also want to remove URLs at the end of the tweets.", "We also tokenize our tweets. Tokenizers work similar to regular expressions and are used to divide tweets into lists of words. Below we provide the full code for pre-processing tweets.", "When we are interested in categorizing text, classifying it based on topic, we often do not want to look at the sequential pattern of words. Rather we would represent the text as a bag of words, as if it were an unordered set of words, while ignoring their original position in the text, keeping only their frequency. You can learn more about natural language processing in our article below.", "The most common words and their count are as follows.", "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic transformation from bag-of-words counts into a topic space of lower dimensionality. Tweets are seen as a distribution of topics. Topics, in turn, are represented by a distribution of all words in the vocabulary. But we do not know the number of topics that are present in the corpus and the tweets that belong to each topic. With LDA we want to treat the assignment of the tweets to topics as a random variable itself which is estimated from the data at hand.", "Finding the right number of topics for LDA is an art. Topic Coherence technique is usually preferred to Perplexity techniques. With coherence, we quantify the coherence of a topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between its high scoring words. This leads to topics which are more human interpretative. The technique selects the top frequently occurring words in each topic. It then computes and aggregates all pairwise scores (UMass) for each of the words to calculate the coherence score for a particular topic.", "Below, we visualize the average coherence score per topic for a range of models trained with a different number of topics. The number of topics for which the average score plateaus, is the sweet spot we are looking for. So our best guess for the number of topics is around 6. We should consider that, typically a corpus with very short documents (tweets in our case) tends to be more difficult to apply to coherent models than a corpus with longer documents.", "Now, we can run LDA on the texts using the optimal value of found via the analysis above. LDA is a generative approach, where for each topic, the model simulates probabilities of word occurrences as well as probabilities of topics within the document. The top 10 words for each of the topics are displayed below.", "Although the plausibility of the topics is questionable, we can see the following meaningful match. Topic 0 deals with meetings between the leaders of China, North Korea, and the United States. Topic 1 seems to relate to the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the last presidential election. Topic 4 seems to be about border security and building a border wall.", "We demonstrated how statistical modeling helps finding what people are tweeting about. The code provided in this article can be generalized to many other tasks, aiming at discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents.", "D. Blei, A. Ng, and M. Jordan.
