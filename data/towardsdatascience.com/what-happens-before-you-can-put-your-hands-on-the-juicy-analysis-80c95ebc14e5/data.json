Well, I did, or at least that was my imagination during school.", "But the reality is very different from what I thought! You will still spend a lot of time doing the analysis but just around 60%. The other 40%, you will spend on preparing for and wrapping up that analysis. Cleaning data or reporting you might think?", "After my graduation, I\u2019ve been working as a Data Analyst for around 2 years, doing different projects from small to large, collaborating with different teams of technical, semi-technical and non-technical stakeholders (by \u201ctechnical\u201d, I mean being well-versed in data analytics.) My experience so far really opens my eyes that this career is far more interesting than my expectations because there are certain things beyond just the juicy statistical analysis. And in this article, I want to share with you what you can expect in the preparation leading to analysis.", "If you want to pursue a career as a Data Analyst and you don\u2019t have a clear idea of what you\u2019re getting yourself into, read on! Because this article can really help you justify if this career is really for you.", "It\u2019s a part of Data Analyst life to receive data requests from different stakeholders, either internal or external, to support the decision-making process.", "But your time is limited so once you get these requests, there are certain steps to prioritize your time for the most important work.", "The very first step is to understand the context and value of the request. Ask yourself and your stakeholders:", "One of the great prioritizing tips is to follow the 80/20 rule \u2014 in any project, 20% of the activities yield 80% of the results. In this case specifically, what can you do with low effort but still can help answer most parts of the question?", "With your clear understanding of the context for the data request, you now have a better sense of whether the data request can really help solve the problem, and if there are any existing reports or you can point stakeholders to.", "In case there is none, and the problem is deemed important to solve, then you proceed to the next step.", "Sometimes, stakeholders already know exactly what piece of information they need, and your job is to brainstorm with them whether that piece really makes sense, or if they need to approach from a different angle.", "Some other times, they don\u2019t know, and your job is to bring up ideas and guide them through identifying relevant information.", "Either way, this step can never be avoided since it\u2019s an important part to make sure everyone is on the same page and to manage expectations between you and your stakeholders.", "Once you have reached an agreement on the solution, note it down somewhere that everyone can see (JIRA ticket, Google doc, Confluence page, etc.).", "But not the juicy analysis, just yet! There are still a few other things to take care of.", "Now that you\u2019re clear on the solution, it\u2019s time to think about some logistics here:", "Once you identify the data, hold yourself tight, you\u2019re not doing the real analysis just yet. As the good old saying goes: \u201cGarbage in, garbage out\u201d \u2014 you don\u2019t want to take garbage data to provide garbage insights. And hence, here comes the data validation part.", "I\u2019m not going to talk too much about this since there is no right and wrong way to approach data validation. The step varies depending on the problem and the nature of the data you\u2019re working with. There are also very detailed articles out there to get a sense of data validation, like this one (which I find very useful).", "Instead, I want to note certain things that really gave me gotcha moments.", "First gotcha: the dynamic nature and structure of the data", "Is there any lossy piece of information?", "For example, an invoice status can be open today but paid tomorrow \u2014 will there be another row of data when the status changes or the status will be overwritten? If it\u2019s overwritten, the data is lossy.", "The problem of lossy data is that the analysis result will change as the status changes, which leads to inconsistent insights to stakeholders if they want to view trends overtime. But if they want to see the current state, this data is ok.", "Second gotcha: the source of truth", "\u201cAll roads lead to Rome\u201d, but where exactly \u2014 to the Colosseum, St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, or Vatican Museums? The point is, there can be many different ways to get the final answer, but each way produces a slightly different answer. Just a slight change in how you join multiple tables can lead to very different results.", "Note that, the current data request might not be the only source of information your stakeholder is looking at to support their decision making. They can look at other data reports as well. And it is totally natural that they compare all this information, and raise questions if they see any mismatch or illogical parts. Much to our disappointment, there is no easy way to make sure this never happens.", "A big part of this comes down to a good Data Governance strategy, which ensures a clean, lean and trustworthy stream of data. If this is done right, you can reduce your time validating the data. If this starts to scare you, don\u2019t sweat! Because unless you are the only one in the company, a good Data Governance strategy and its execution is a whole company effort.", "Anyhow, I\u2019m not going to deep here as it\u2019s not the main part and I\u2019m no expert in Data Gov. In case you find yourself in a situation of no such strategy, two simple steps are to:", "That\u2019s a lot of information up there! The key message of this article is:", "As a Data Analyst or Data Scientist in a company, you are the expert to help guide your stakeholders (either internal or external) in using data to make their decision. The very first steps of this guidance are making sure:", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Scientist @ Shopify.
