Apparently the use of proper nouns in titles are very significant in differentiating fake from real.", "Overall, these results suggest that the writers of fake news are attempting to attracting attention by using all capitalized words in titles, and squeeze as much substance into the titles as possible by skipping stop-words and increase proper nouns.
