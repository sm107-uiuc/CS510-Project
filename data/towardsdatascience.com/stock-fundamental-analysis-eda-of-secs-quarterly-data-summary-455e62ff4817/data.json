That is why they appear in the first dump of 2020.", "Let\u2019s explore if everyone manages to meet these deadlines. We compare the value of accepted (when the data was accepted by SEC )with the period when the fiscal period ended.", "We look on the basic statistics parameters:", "The quickest accountants deliver the statements within 11 days, but both mean and median are nearing 60 days. Using Plotly's ability to create histograms, we can examine the usual delivery time.", "Do you notice the sudden drop in the number of submitted forms after 90 days?
