I recently participated in San Francisco\u2019s Developer Week Hackathon with Danny Mendoza, Benjamin Leung, and Steven Au-Yeung, where we created a demo of a home-safety webapp we called HomeView. The premise behind this app was that we would be using Clariai\u2019s image classifying APIs for the home security purposes of 1) Detecting a home invasion and 2) Monitoring babies more intelligently. At the highest level, our home invasion detector takes an image (from a live video feed in a production setting) and counts the faces to make sure at least one of them lives in the house. The baby monitor detects if a baby is in the picture or if it is in a dangerous situation i.e. there is a knife or fire in the picture. In any dangerous situation, we send an SMS to the user to alert them that there is an unsafe situation at home. The code for this project is on my GitHub if you would like to build a similar webapp using Flask.", "The home invasion portion of the project utilized Clarifai\u2019s face embedding and face detection models. The face embedding model takes a picture as input and outputs a 1024 dimensional vector describing that face. Using pictures of myself and teammates, we stored our face-vectors as vectors to compare any new face to. To compare our faces, we used a cosine similarity, a distance measure relating the angle of two vectors rather than the magnitude. This is a common comparison metric for sparse vectors because when many dimensions are commonly 0, they remove degrees of freedom for which our angle can be measured, limiting our comparison space. As a result, we can measure distance between faces in a method slightly more sensibly than by evaluating Euclidean distance. This greater granularity in assessing high-dimensional, sparse vectors allows us to be more confident in our assertions that a new face is or is not one of the project members. The code below shows the function we used:", "Once we had our ground-truth face vectors stored, we would run the face detection model to count the number of faces in the new picture. We then compare each face in the new picture to our ground-truth faces and make sure that at least one of the cosine similarities is above a set threshold. If none of the comparisons are above this threshold, we can assert that none of the faces are close enough to our ground-truth faces to be considered \u2018safe\u2019 and thus, there are intruders.", "The baby monitor portion of our webapp utilized a different Clarifai offering: the general model. Clarifai\u2019s general model is a convolutional neural network trained to classify objects within pictures with thousands of labels. Given the picture to the left, the model would assign the labels \u201cbaby\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d, assessing that there is both a baby and a dog in the picture. Knowing that we could look at image labels as a binary classification problem, we simply fed the model a series of pictures from a video and asked it \u201cIs there a baby in the picture or not?\u201d. If not, we would send a text message to the parents or whoever set up the webapp. Because of the plethora of labels the general model has been trained on, we could increase the \u201csmartness\u201d of our baby monitor to also check for dangerous situations. We added a danger threshold to determine if a baby was playing with a toy (that it shouldn\u2019t be), if there was fire in the room, or if the baby had a knife. If, based on the items in the frame, the baby was deemed to be in danger we would send the parents an SMS.", "We used the Twilio API for our sending of text messages. After installing, obtaining an API key, and importing the package, we inserted their create message function into our logic. The code below shows an example:", "With if/else logic, we could create custom text messages for different situations with unique text and images to describe the situation, as can be found in the app.py file in our repository.", "In order to construct a demo of this technology, we needed to create a user interface. Flask is a great tool for this, allowing us to use our Python functions to influence a webpage to show the effects of the functions we wrote. It is so great for this, that another blog post would be necessary to get into all great features. Because I\u2019m a nice guy, I\u2019ll link you to three: Flask Is Great.", "There are tons of great image recognition tools at many levels \u2014 from calling an API for objects in a picture to entire trained neural network architectures. Like much of the coding world (especially in Python), you often don\u2019t need to recreate the wheel to make great image-handling applications. What might have taken hours, days, or weeks to train can now be one of the fastest moving parts of a hackathon challenge because of these available tools, so use them!", "Your home for data science.
