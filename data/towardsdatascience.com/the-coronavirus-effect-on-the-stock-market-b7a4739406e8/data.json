What are the events that have been perceived as the most important by the investors? What\u2019s the role of Media? Let\u2019s have a look at the big picture through a few charts.", "The Coronavirus outbreak is an evolving situation: every 5 minutes there\u2019s a news that helps to better define the problem and it\u2019s very hard to stay on top of it. The whole matter, though, has been punctuated by various events. I have found this page that reports (and updates) the main facts since the beginning of the contagion; from that list I\u2018ve selected those elements that I\u2019ve considered the most important for my analysis:", "In terms of \u201cwhat\u201d to analyze, I have pulled several stock indices: S&P 500 (US), FTSE MIB (Italy), NIKKEI (Japan), SSE 50 (Shanghai), KOSPI (South Korea), STOXX50E (Eurozone), with the idea of observing how different markets reacted at the various events. Additional interesting data that I\u2019ve pulled in my analysis is the VIX index, a popular measure of the stock market\u2019s expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options. All of these information are coming from Yahoo Finance (Il Sole 24 Ore for the FTSE MIB dataset).", "Another useful set of information is coming from the COVID-19 dataset that shows confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries for each day and for each country. I downloaded the Kaggle version.", "Finally, I wanted to look at the effect of Media on this crisis. Unfortunately there was no easy way to access the latest news from all over the world, so I needed to collect the data myself. I ended up gathering the information from reddit.com, more precisely from the World News subreddit. I took the submissions titles (from the beginning of January 2019 through 6th March 2020) and checked whether they were talking about Coronavirus; I am conscious that this is a weak proxy for \u201chow much Media are talking about it\u201d, but it was the best that I could do. To collect the Reddit data, I used the pushshift.io APIs and the dataset is available at the link: https://gofile.io/?c=AW4NiM.", "By a visual inspection of the time series we can observe a consistent low some time after the Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan (2019\u201312\u201331). For example, the following charts are the closing prices for SSE 50 (Shanghai) and S&P 500 (US):", "Looking at the charts above and considering that other indices have a similar trends, we can identify two days that seems to be particularly important: 2020\u201301\u201320 and 2020\u201302\u201323; we can easily see that all the indices experience lows after those days (e.g. see the same happening in STOXX50E (Eurozone)):", "What happened? On January 20th, many airports started to implement safety measures. The sequent days the headlines are all about this: Coronavirus has gone international. What seemed to scare investors is the evidence that COVID-19 is not anymore confined in the China borders, but started spreading\u00a0. Surprisingly the second event that I highlighted is telling a similar story: on 23rd February (as well as the following days) the virus starts to consistently afflict Italy.", "Of course markets are not independent among themselves and we\u2019d need to consider this interdependence: in the global economy, if one market falls the others might follow. Anyways, my takeaway from what observed above, is that the greatest fear of investors is the virus to spread internationally.", "We can also see the VIX index rising just after the Italy outbreak (the magenta line in the following chart is the number of cases confirmed in Italy):", "Finally, the following table shows the average drop of all the indices considered between the day of the outbreak and the last available date in the data (time series have been smoothed using moving average with 3 days window):", "The Japanese index seems to be the one that registered the worst performance (-10.7%). I have some doubts about the SSE 50 (Shanghai) results, it could be probably worth to look at the index composition (although China handled the crisis pretty well, so that fairly small loss could be related to that).", "Another factor to consider is the role of Media. Looking at the time series, it seems that news are actually having an impact, since stock indices and Mass Media mentions are negatively correlated. I would say that the two signals are not independent though: the fact that the stock market is nosediving, makes news louder. Still, I think it\u2019s something interesting to observe:", "Thinking about it, this is no surprise: I would expect most investors reacting when information starts to circulate. I am only considering the absolute number of mentions without splitting news by \u201csentiment\u201d, because, unfortunately, the \u201csentiment\u201d is pretty well known.", "The fact that the two series are negatively correlated can be seen also in the following scatter plots (S&P 500 (US), KOSPI (South Korea)):", "Again, a single subreddit is probably a weak proxy, and a much nicer analysis would involve many other types of mentions (e.g. Tweets and other sources).", "There\u2019s not much more to say, unfortunately. While the situation seems to be settling in China, spread in Europe is still scary especially from a health standpoint.", "If the Italian pattern will repeat in other countries, we might expect markets react in a similar manner, so the only thing to do at the moment is stop or slow down the contagion, to safeguard both health and economy.", "As an Italian, I am living the outbreak in my country with some worries, but I still trust that the Government and people will make it to overcome this unbelievable situation. Let\u2019s cross our fingers and hope COVID-19 will be defeated quickly, for both physical and financial health.", "Note: This article is intended for general information purposes only.
