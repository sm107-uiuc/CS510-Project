John Kingston, a researcher at University of Brighton in the UK, recently published a paper which maps out the landscape in this legal field. His analysis raises some important issues that the automotive, computing, and legal worlds should be wrestling with in earnest (if they are not already). At the heart of this debate lies whether an AI system could be held criminally liable for its actions. Kingston says that Gabriel Hallevy at Ono Academic College in Israel has explored this issue in detail. The paper talks about three different legal scenarios that could apply to AI systems: (i) perpetrator via another, which applies when an offense has been committed by a mentally deficient person, who is therefore deemed to be innocent, (ii) natural probable consequence, which occurs when the ordinary actions of an AI system might be used inappropriately to perform a criminal act, and (iii) direct liability, requiring both an action (e.g. the AI takes an action resulting in a criminal act) and an intent (which is harder to determine, but nonetheless relevant).", "A new test may help show that a fundamentally different approach is required for AI systems such as Siri and Alexa to actually master language. Developed by researchers at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2), a nonprofit based in Seattle, the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) will pose elementary-school level multiple choice science questions (see paper). Each question will require some understanding of how the world works. For example, one question could be \u201cWhich item below is not made from a material grown in nature? A) a cotton shirt B) a wooden chair C) a plastic spoon D) a grass basket.\u201d Such a question is easy for anyone who knows plastic is not something that grows. The answer taps into a common-sense picture of the world that even young children possess. The new test is part of an initiative at AI2 to imbue AI systems with such an understanding of the world. It is important because determining how well a language system understands what it is saying can be tricky.", "When it comes to getting affordable airfares, price comparison websites are all well and good, but they do not really address the fact that prices are constantly changing. That means that, while you may have gotten the cheapest flight from Los Angeles to New York at 10 o\u2019clock on the Wednesday when you booked it, there\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s still going to be the cheapest flight closer to the time of departure.The latest service offered by robot lawyer website DoNotPay (best known for getting thousands of people out of parking tickets) claims to be the first-ever service to reduce the price of your flight after you have booked. Compatible with all U.S. airlines and travel booking services, it forces companies to pay their customers whenever the price of their ticket drops. It does this by observing the legal small print that requires airlines to give customers the option to amend their bookings \u2014 but which few people actually do.", "Your home for data science.
