As a result, very limited information is available from the outbreaks of this pest, which is fast becoming ineradicable across continents. The only way then to mitigate the monumental losses left in the wake of its infestation is to understand the pest in great details and develop multi-pronged crop protection and pest control strategies.", "This study attempts to shed light on the conditions favoring the spread of FAWs by combining three different datasets bringing complementary information on potential outbreaks of FAW.", "Due to the limitations of the data collection method used by FAO, the combined dataset does not allow to build a forecasting model. This study, therefore, focuses on extracting features which are driving the spread of FAW in Africa, where most of the data has been collected.", "Although based on the Africa dataset, we have conducted the analysis in such a way that the findings can be extended to any FAW incidences globally.", "The larval stage of FAW moth is a pest that feeds on more than 350 plant species, causing extensive damage to economically important cultivated cereals such as maize, rice, sorghum; cash crops like cotton, sugarcane, peanuts; fruit crops like apples and oranges, and vegetable crops, among others. Maize however remains the preferred host. Because the caterpillar eats so much of the plant, they are very detrimental to crop survival and yield.", "According to the FAO, as much as 18 million tonnes of maize are lost annually in Africa, enough to feed tens of millions of people for whom it is a staple crop and representing an economic loss of up to $4.6 billion in the continent. In addition, country specific studies have shown a positive correlation between FAW exposure and intensity of insecticide use. Several measures to control FAW infestation exist and yet do not significantly reduce the losses.", "The outbreak of FAW was detected in Africa in 2016 and has since spread to Asia including the Middle East, and Oceania. A rapid breeder that reproduces at a rate of several generations per year, with a diverse diet, the insect can survive harsh conditions by migrating to different places (across continents) or go into hiding to spring back when conditions are more favourable. The moth can fly up to 100 km per night. The female moth can migrate as much as 500 km before oviposition. However, the insects are not resilient to low temperatures. They cannot migrate and breed at a temperature lower than 0\u2103. Warm winters, which have been attributed to global warming, have therefore, created good conditions for FAW to breed at a large scale.", "The extent of the global infestation and country-wise damage caused by FAW is detailed in FAO\u2019s Food Chain Crisis Early Warning Bulletin, January\u2013March 2020 \u211634. A snapshot of the situation in countries at most risk and the scale of devastation, where reported, is presented here.", "Angola- FAW was reported in 2017 where more than 19,000 ha of maize, millet and sorghum crops were devastated causing approx. US$ 1.8m in damages.", "Ethiopia- FAW attacks maize planted in all seasons: the main rainy season, the short rainy season and irrigated maize. In the country, more than 458 maize-growing districts were affected by FAW.", "Malawi- The presence of FAW was first reported during the 2016/17 main rainy season (November-March). The pest has caused serious damage to maize across the country, off-season irrigated maize (April-October), and other crops such as wheat. The government declared a state of disaster due to the pest during the 2017/18 ready for cropping season (November to March).", "Uganda- The presence of the pest has been confirmed in all 121 districts (100 percent of the territory).", "South Sudan- The presence of FAW has been confirmed throughout the country (in all former 10 states of the country). Field observations and farmer reports indicate that FAW infestation is severe when the crop is under water stress.", "Swaziland- The presence of FAW was first reported during the 2016/17 season. The pest caused serious damage to sorghum, millet and maize across the country, into the 2017/18 season.", "Egypt (North Africa)- FAW has been officially reported in maize fields in southern Egypt since May 2019. FAW was able to cross the natural barrier of the Sahara Desert. Therefore, North African countries are at risk.", "Sudan- FAW has been reported from Sudan since 2017 and the Nile Valley may be considered the probable route of introduction to Egypt. The climate in Egypt and Sudan allows for continuous planting of many host plants, which increase the likelihood of pest spread and damage.", "Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe- The presence of FAW was first reported during the 2016/17 season, and the pest continued to cause damage to maize during the 2017/18 production season (November to March).", "Bangladesh- FAW was first detected in August 2018. Since then, it has spread to several parts of the country.", "Cambodia- As of 11 June 2019, a total of 11,142 hectares of corn crop had been destroyed in Cambodia, consisting of 2,544 ha in Pailin Province, 3,033 ha in Battambang, 4,715 ha in Banteay Meanchey and another 850 ha in Tboung Khmum Province.", "Myanmar- FAW has invaded maize fields in the country since the first week of January 2019, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation. FAW has been confirmed in Ayeyarwady region then spread to 9 states/regions within a short period of the same year. Approximately, 4,046 hectares have been affected in Ayeyarwady.", "Indonesia- FAW was first detected in West Sumatra in March 2019. Within four months, the pest had spread to 12 provinces in Sumatra, Java and some parts of Kalimantan.", "Phillipines- By June 2019, the local government of Mabinay, in Negros Oriental, declared that FAW attacked 28 of the mountainous town\u2019s 32 barangays.", "Sri Lanka- FAW has infested maize mainly in Anuradhapura, Monaragala and Ampara Districts, but has been detected in patches across farms in almost all the districts in the country. The total area under maize infested by FAW over the three above mentioned districts measure 61,010 ha and 34,856 ha, respectively. Further, it has been reported that FAW has spread to crops such as rice, tomato, millet, green gram and some grass varieties like sugarcane. Out of 82,000 ha cultivated in Sri Lanka, 43,037 ha has been reported to be infested by FAW. The total estimated crop loss in the country ranges from 10 percent to 25 percent.", "Yemen (West Asia)- The introduction and presence of FAW has been reported since 2018, which increases the risk of introduction to neighbouring countries such as Oman and Saudi Arabia.", "China- Not included in the FAO report, but according to news reports, on March 5 2020, the Chinese government admitted at a press conference that FAW first invaded China in 2018. South and southwest provinces were the most affected. The Chinese authorities found the number of FAWs to be ramping up in the south and southwest of the country from November to January 2019. The affected area, which covers 40,000 hectares, is 90 times larger than during the same period last year. Since the pest has already infested over 80,000 hectares of land in adjacent Laos, the authorities predicted a worse scenario may occur in China.", "According to the guidelines released by China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the northward migration of FAW will happen one month earlier than it did last year. Once they move north, 50 percent of the cornfields in the regions around the Yellow River and the Huai River will be under threat.", "FAW has also been reported in Taiwan since June 2019. There have been 199 confirmed FAW sightings in Taiwan, with more than 50 hectares of cornfields being affected as of 10 July 2019, according to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ).", "India- Not from the FAO report, but independently verified that FAW was first reported in the fields of Chikkaballapur district in Karnataka (South India), according to a survey conducted by the National Bureau of Agriculture Insect Resources (NBAIR) in July 2018. The pest has destroyed more than 70 percent of the crop in Karnataka and has now spread further into southern, western, northern and northeastern India. Maize is grown in about 9.3 million hectares with a total annual production close to 28 million tons.", "Australia- Not included in the FAO report, FAW has been detected across multiple regions in the Northern Territory and in northern Western Australia, and could soon threaten crops in Queensland\u2019s Wide Bay region. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries said FAW had only been found in corn, sorghum and soybean crops since it was discovered in Australia in February this year. If established, FAW has the potential to become a pest of cotton in Northern Australia.", "We have combined three complementary, publicly available datasets for this study.", "The three datasets are merged based on the geo-coordinates of the crop fields provided in the FAMEWS data.", "Two different methods of inspection have been used in the FAMEWS dataset: Scouting and Pheromone traps. The different inspection methods, as standalone and in combination, may generate unforseen biases. We have, therefore, limited the study to the sample detected using Scouting, as it represents the largest sample (69% of the cases, i.e. 26901 \u2014 see Figure 5).", "As shown in Figure 6, when looking at the relative distribution of positive and negative detections of FAW in the Scouting sample from FAMEWS, positive cases are dominating the sample at 85.9%. The very strong bias for positive detections in the dataset actually suggests that the data collection through the mobile app has been started after the actual FAW outbreaks. If the data collection was made from a systematic survey in a given area (with inputs from all farmers in that area during the survey period, irrespective of the incidence of FAW), we would expect to see a far lesser fraction of detections in the dataset.", "This observation is actually confirmed by the distribution of scouting inspections with time as illustrated in Figure 7: the lack of temporal consistency is symptomatic of a reactive pattern rather than a systematic data collection.", "Focusing on a specific area in Africa as shown in Figures 8, supports similar conclusions: the distribution of number of inspections differs with location (for the selected area in red in Figure 8-Left, the number of inspections is near-zero for 2019).", "As demonstrated, the Scouting-inspection-based dataset is highly biased toward positive detections. This is most likely due to the reactive nature of data collection following outbreaks (farmers only use the app once their field has been infested). Such an unbalanced dataset doesn\u2019t allow us to build a prediction model of FAW outbreak for a given field at a given date. To achieve such a goal, a more systematic and unbiased data collection is necessary, to provide a realistic representation of outbreak cases.", "We, therefore, decided to focus our research on the drivers and aggravating factors of the spread of FAW in maize crops. In practice, we are using machine-learning modelling to extract a set of features with predictive power to identify the presence of FAW. We want to make sure the predictive importance of these features can be extrapolated through location and time, so that the insights we get from Africa\u2019s outbreaks in the past are valid for other countries (e.g. India) in the future.", "We decided to train an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) optimized to predict, as a target variable, the percentage of plants infested by FAW at a given inspection point. As described in the previous section, prediction of the spread of the pest (i.e. if a field is going to be affected or not?) is not possible due to the bias in the detection sample. Therefore, we chose to focus on the prediction of the level of infestation (i.e. knowing that the field is infested, what is the expected fraction to be affected?)", "Figure 9 displays the range of potential degrees of infestation at each scouting inspection, demonstrating that a binary target variable (positive, as detected, versus negative, as not detected) simply won\u2019t allow a full grasp of the problem. We also removed from the training set cases with 0% and 100% of infestation as they appear to be more related to a lack of information from the survey as inputs are keyed in by the farmers.", "Before any model training, we proceed for a proper pre-processing of the dataset:", "Given the nature of the FAMEWS dataset, and the mixture of spatial and temporal features used (soil and weather data), we have to implement a particular validation strategy, to ensure that the most important features will generalize properly through time and location. Our validation strategy is based on a temporal separation, where data from 2018 is used in training and data from 2019 in validation. However to decouple any spatial effect, we improve this basic strategy as follows:", "With such a validation strategy, we optimize the most important hyper-parameters starting with a global grid search, followed by a more local grid search to fine-tune. With the three splits described above, while fine-tuning the hyper-parameters of the model, we can calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the model between the validation sets. The lower the MAE, the higher is the ability of the model to generalize through location and time.", "Once the model is trained, we can calculate, for each feature, the gain in the XGBoost objective function obtained when one of the decision trees of the model makes a split in the dataset using that feature. We then define the importance of a feature within a XGBoost model as the sum of all these gains.", "However feature importance can be artificially boosted by hidden correlations, or masking information about location or time. To ensure that the selected features generalize properly, for each feature, we again fine-tune and train a model leaving the feature out. We then compare the MAE of this new model excluding the feature, with the previous model including it. If the MAE increases considerably (more than 0.005) when leaving the feature out, we discard the feature. In this case, the set of important features is re-calculated again, leaving the discarded feature out of our predictors set.", "Examples of features that were discarded:", "The final set of 14 features selected from the original set of combined variables from the FLDAS, HWSD and FAMEWS datasets, to have the highest predictive power for FAW infestations, are:", "To visualize the power of the selected features to discriminate between highly and slightly infested crops, we build a decision tree using a binary target which is defined to be True if the crop has a percentage of plants with FAW over the median (which is around 25% of infestation), and False otherwise, as represented in Figure 10.", "The decision tree reads from top to bottom and as follows:", "To better understand how to read the tree, let\u2019s take the two most extreme cases:", "1 - The first instance corresponds to the cell with the darkest shade of blue, which accounts for 5.7% of the sample set used for this study (Scouting inspections in Africa for maize crop), whereby 85.4% of each field (in this subset) were infested (\u2018value=[0.146,0.854]\u2019), favoured by the following conditions:", "2 - The second instance corresponds to the cell with the darkest shade of red, which accounts for 5.5% of the sample set used for this study (Scouting inspections in Africa for maize crop), whereby only 17.1% of each field (in this subset) were infested (\u2018value=[0.829,0.171]\u2019), favoured by the following conditions:", "Although the decision tree brings out interesting insights on the importance and interaction between the selected features, let\u2019s now try to interprete why some of these selected features have a high predictive power. We are focusing on a few selected analyses and are not aiming at an exhaustive study. Again, our goal is to demonstrate that the method used allows us to identify the most important drivers behind the spread of FAW.", "Here we need to highlight that some of these features have a real predictive power only when combined with others. For example, as seen in Figure 11, the fraction of Clay \u2018T_CLAY\u2019independently has a rather weak correlation with our target. However the second plot in Figure 11 shows that when combined with the surface pressure \u2018Psurf_f_tavg_mean\u2019 it has a stronger impact. This fact can already be deduced by the decision tree.", "A tentative interpretation is that at higher Surface atmospheric pressure the soil is denser disregarding its composition. At lower atmospheric pressure, the soil being less dense, then the texture of Clay will impact more the density. With a less dense soil (so at low atmospheric pressure and lower fraction of Clay content), the FAW adult moth can more easily emerge from the soil once the pupae have eclosed, increasing the risk of infestation.", "A similar interpretation can be put forward with the fraction of Organic Content as seen in Figure 12: the higher the Organic Content fraction the less dense the soil will be, therefore the higher the risk of infestation.", "Note that in the figures 11 and 12, we used a third order regression. The low statistics in measurements in the extreme cases of Clay or Organic Content weight fraction, prevent any interpretations as such measurements and may not be reliable enough.", "The FAW caterpillars feed mostly on the tender part of the maize leaves and whorls, which explains a stronger risk of infestations on young crops and a rapid decrease of the risk with older crops seen in Figure 13. The peak of infestation is around 30\u201380 days. Maize matures in 130\u2013135 days after planting, which explains the rapid decrease in statistics (and infestation cases) beyond this age, as such cases are probably mostly related to mistakes in data collection (as the age is computed from data collected by the farmers directly).", "In Figure 14, we investigated the impact of Soil temperature on infestation rate (air temperature and the soil radiative temperature correlate very strongly with soil temperature so we focused only on this variable). There is a clear peak around 20\u201325\u2103 (293\u2013298K), with strong decreases below 17\u2103 (290K) and above 27\u2103 (300K). These temperatures correspond to the ideal soil temperature for an efficient growth of the maize roots, which means this variable relates to the intrinsic health of the crop (healthier crops will obviously correspond to higher infestation rates).", "When displaying the effect of wind on infestation, as shown in Figure 15, an increase of infestation is noticeable at first with stronger winds (up to 2m/s), but when wind is getting stronger the infestations are reducing (up to 4m/s). A potential interpretation would be that some wind improves the chances of the FAW moth to spread and resume the cycle in a different area of the crop field, but stronger winds prevent FAW caterpillars to remain on the leaves to continue feeding.", "Figure 16 shows a negative correlation between the infestation and both Air Specific Humidity and Rainfall. These results indicate that despite humidity and rainfall being beneficial for the development of the plant, excessive rain washes out FAW caterpillars from the leaves, in fact reducing the infestation rate. This is a controversial result as some studies in the literature tend to indicate the opposite.", "As seen in Figure 16, Rainfall seems to be slowing down infestation. We further investigate the impact of watering to see if indeed rainfall is harmful for FAW.", "In Figure 17-Left, Soil moisture displays similar negative correlation with infestation rate as Air humidity and Rainfall. However when looking at the effect of different types of watering, in Figure 17-Central, it is clear that while irrigation seems to favour infestation, Rainfed watering is definitely reducing the infestation rate, confirming the result mentioned above. As shown in Figure 17-Right, Soil moisture is on average higher with Rainfed than with Irrigation, which means that rain is favouring the development of the plants as well (in fact soil moisture also depends of soil composition, information provided by the Available Water Capacity \u2018AWC_CLASS\u2019 in our dataset.)", "One clear observation which can be made regarding irrigation from this analysis is that any irrigation system (like sprinkler) mimicking rain would reproduce the effects noticed with Rainfed (reducing infestation rate).", "It is also interesting to note that there is no evidence from our analysis that lack of soil moisture (water stress) aggravates the infestation by FAW, as reported from South Sudan in the FAO report referenced above. More data and deeper investigations would be required to understand such a discrepancy.", "The work conducted, besides providing some actionable insights (for instance, with irrigation), demonstrates the significance of taking a data science based approach to use various sources of information, beyond the scope of restricted surveys, to support the development of comprehensive and result oriented agricultural projects.", "We would recommend adopting a systematic survey strategy by collecting information directly at the farm level, independently of pest infestations over several seasons, and combining the inputs from farmers with independant weather and soil information. The design of the survey needs to have predictive and prescriptive modelling as an aim based on which measures can be adopted to fight biases as much as possible. Such projects require the involvement of Data Scientists and Machine-Learning experts right from conception.", "Your home for data science.
