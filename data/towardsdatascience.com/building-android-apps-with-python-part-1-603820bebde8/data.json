Android universe is mainly build using Java, Kotlin, Flutter, and Corona using Lua Scripting Language (mainly gaming engine, used in games like angry birds) but in recent times, Python has made its way into every domain and android is no different. In this series of articles, we will look at how to set-up the required environment, the basics of developing an android app, referencing the documentation, and how to move ahead with your projects.", "Android development in Python has been made possible only because of an open-source Python library for developing mobile apps and other multi-touch application software that is Kivy. Its initial release was in 2011 and a stable one in 2019! Kivy not only supports android application development but its applications can be run on IOS, Linux, OS X, Windows, and Android. It is written in Python and Cython, and most of the core developers are from Russia.", "We will use Kivy a lot for the front-end of the application but with another package and why we require that package will be covered shortly.", "It\u2019s usually a good practice to set-up a new environment for new projects as:", "I use the Conda package manager for creating and managing my environments. You can use any other package manager but to follow along with me, you can use Conda (see this guide to set up Conda and anaconda). Open up your Conda terminal and type:", "Replace \u2018name-of-env\u2019 with your custom name and \u2018version\u2019 of your choice but greater than 3.5. I will use Python 3.7. To list all the Conda environments, type:", "The output will be similar to this:", "Here is the link to the cheat-sheet of Conda in-case you are interested in exploring more about this. Now, after checking the name here, activate the environment like this:", "We are ready to install the required libraries. As we are using python, pip is a great way to install and manage python packages. To install Kivy and its dependencies, type the following command one-by-one:", "A bonus tip: Make a file called requirements.txt, copy the above lines in the file, place the file in a known location and terminal run:", "It will install all the dependencies at one go!", "We are ready to develop some awesome applications, but there is one problem here. In the beginning, I told you we need an additional package to be used with Kivy. Just install it for now and we will discuss the why part later in the article.", "The part you have been waiting for so long is here. I am using Pycharm IDE for coding because it\u2019s easy to code for me, but you can use VSCode, Sublime, or spyder as per your wish. Before I start, we need to understand some points here:", "Now quickly open up your IDE and start with this basic code of Hello World!", "After running this program you will see this output:", "Let me explain this code line by line:", "This how we build our first app but did you notice one thing that the background is automatically black and text is white? I haven\u2019t even mentioned this in the code. Kivy takes it by default. Now we move to the interesting part, let\u2019s build a simple button with no enhancement in Kivy:", "This is a very unattractive look and imagines you are using an app that has an interface like this. I would uninstall that app and won\u2019t even rate it! Enhancing features in Kivy is a tedious process and requires a lot of code. Don\u2019t believe me? Look at the code to create a rectangular flat button placed at the center with a blue border, blue text, and white background:", "Don\u2019t grasp the code as it is beyond your scope for now but just look at the output now:", "Now we have talked a lot about Kivy and we know it provides the platform for building applications. KivyMD is a collection of Material Design compliant widgets for use with Kivy and approximately Google\u2019s Material Design spec as close as possible without sacrificing ease of use or application performance. It is based on Kivy and is easier to code. It is very similar to Kivy and just adds MD at starting in every element and widget, plus it has a wide variety of other new elements. Now see the code in Kivymd to generate the same output button:", "Try to run this script and you will see the same output as returned by long Kivy code.", "This was an introductory lesson to building android apps in python. We learned what is Kivy, why, and how to use environments, built a basic app in Kivy, compared Kivy and Kivymd with an example of a button code. In the next article, we will continue our journey and explore various other key elements in Kivymd. If you liked this article, follow me on medium so you receive notifications about upcoming parts.
