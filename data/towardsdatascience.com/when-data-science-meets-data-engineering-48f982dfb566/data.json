It is great to have people with different skillset covering different needs throughout the data science/analytics life cycle, but the rise of specialisations means we need to start defining ways of working that enable different roles to work together effectively. One of the most common working relationships you will have within a data team is between data scientists and data engineers. This relationship has probably been around for the longest, but it is by no means one that is well understood. I have been having conversations with different people within the industry and, interestingly, there seems to be no best way for the two roles to engage with each other. So we will look at why these roles need to work together, understand the differences between the two and potential tensions. And most importantly look at a few different ways of working and highlight some pros and cons to help you find a way that works for your team.", "Data science and data engineering are two sides of the same coin because to get value from data, we need the creative problem solving and business acumen from data scientists and we need the robust implementation and scalable architecture from the data engineers. Without each other, both will not be as effective at delivering a good solution at the end. On a more practical level, the two roles need to work well with each other because their work intertwines back and forth through the solution development process. Because there is no clear boundary between when one\u2019s job ends and when the other\u2019s job starts, it can create unhealthy tension between the two disciplines.", "It is imperative that data science and data engineering work well together because they interact multiple times throughout the development process. Compared to other key relationships that we have in the process, e.g. backend & front-end development and application developers & operations, where the two parties just need to have a single interface to deliver a solution. Data science and engineering require much more fluid interaction and collaboration throughout the process and that\u2019s due to the following characteristics of data work.", "Experimentation is at the core of data science and a big part of getting value from data is to find insights from the data, design algorithms that can leverage those insights. By definition, this is an iterative process and it requires engineering on both ends, from curating and providing robust data feed to taking the algorithms and making it available to other systems and processes.", "Software engineers build solutions based on specifications but that is not enough for data engineers because data systems are built on top of data and specifications usually don\u2019t cover all the nuances and errors that come with real-life data. Data engineers need to constantly adapt and improve how data are processed to ensure downstream users and applications are getting timely and accurate data. To do this effectively, data engineers should leverage data scientists for their business understanding and familiarity with the data.", "These are just two obvious examples where the two disciplines need to work well together but it goes to show that there is an absolute need for collaboration here. So let\u2019s explore the main differences between the two roles to understand where the tensions come from and more importantly how to improve the working relationship between the two.", "For those who have been on either side of this debate, it is not uncommon for data engineers to see data scientists as cowboy coders who don\u2019t know how to program and for data scientists to think that data engineers are developers who take way too long to build a data pipeline and don\u2019t understand the business logic. The difference between the two is a clash in perspective shaped by their background, experience and incentives.", "Data scientists mostly come from a business background while data engineers mostly come from a computer science background. I believe the choice of discipline is merely a representation of who they already are, so while there is no doubt that the two disciplines went through different curriculum but that is not what shapes the two different perspectives. Before data science became a standalone degree, working data scientists came from backgrounds like statistics, economics, actuarial science and other quantitative fields that focus on using maths to solve real-world problems. On the other hand, before data engineering become a topic on its own, data engineers came from software and database development which focus much more on the technology solution than the application. This is no coincidence because fundamentally they are different people with different interests. However, what changes now is that with data and technology being front and centre in most companies\u2019 focus, the pressure for the two to work closely together arises, thus putting their difference under a spotlight.", "These differences get magnified as people work together and without a proper understanding of each other\u2019s strengths, the gap between the two disciplines will likely widen. Given the immaturity of the disciplines, most people in the field don\u2019t have a lot of experience working with others. Additionally, because the two roles come from such different backgrounds, it is easy to just expect the other person to understand your strengths but that\u2019s rarely the case.", "It is also important to understand how the roles are assessed in terms of performance. In an overly simplistic view, we have data scientists who are incentivised to maximise the value that their insights or algorithms can bring to the business and that encourages them to constantly try new methodologies and technologies. This will inevitably drive up the complexity of the solution over time and because data scientists are not responsible for the final system being scalable and operational in most cases, there are no incentives for them to make sure their solutions are something that can be built and maintained. On the other hand, data engineers are incentivised to ensure that the system is stable and manageable as they will be the ones ensuring that the system is operating as expected in the long run. This ultimately encourages data engineers to keep complexity down and discourages changes being added to the system. There you can see how the two different perspectives create tension between the two roles.", "It would be wrong to think that the goal is to eliminate this difference. We need that tension between the two to build the best solution and the key is to find a way to leverage that tension effectively rather than allowing it to cause unnecessary friction within the team.", "The ambiguity between functions is where the friction comes from and one way to improve that is to have predefined interfaces between data scientists and data engineers. It is less important where the actual boundaries are but the fact that they are aligned between the two roles. While this way doesn\u2019t encourage full collaboration, it is an effective way to reduce ambiguity. By setting boundaries, it encourages each team to take ownership and responsibility of their part of the deliverable, whether it is the data pipeline or the model training. This is similar to the DevOps \u201cYou build it, you run it\u201d principles and ownership is the key theme here because, to encourage people to produce high-quality work, they need to be held responsible to maintain their work after they are done.", "However, the hardest part of implementing this strategy is to define boundaries that make sense. Where is the actual line between data science and data engineering? There isn\u2019t a definitive answer and you will likely see gaps between where the line should be for both discipline. For this model to work, you will need to get both roles to agree. There is also the risk of each team producing suboptimal work to push the responsibility to the other side which might be detrimental to the overall success. With that being said, this is still a widely adopted model that is working in a lot of companies.", "On the other side of the spectrum, we have the cross-functional model where you have a team that consists of both disciplines and other functions that are needed to deliver the goal. This is a more flexible model as it doesn\u2019t have any clearly defined roles within the team. This flexibility translates well when it comes to implementing new ideas as the requirements are more ambiguous and changes are more likely to happen. This model works well for teams that have a good understanding of each other\u2019s abilities and a safe and collaborative environment. You will see this model working well as tasks are being delegated within the team efficiently without any guidance. This helps each of the teammate to gain perspective on the other side and learn to appreciate their strengths. This model generally takes longer to be effective and it requires stability in the team structure and goals which not a lot of organisations can provide at the early stage of the data journey. However, there are tremendous benefits that this model can provide when done right.", "We should note that these are only two examples of how data scientists and data engineers can work together and they are by no means prescriptive. The intent for these engagement models is to facilitate collaboration between the two by highlighting what each discipline needs from the other and encourage them to leverage each other\u2019s skillset. The ways of work will change over time as technology makes collaboration easier but if you want your team to perform well together, you need to focus on aligning them on the problem you need them to solve. It takes a strong leader to bring people with different background together and that\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t change over time.", "If you have enjoyed my content, sign up for more at https://jchoi.solutions/subscribe", "Your home for data science.
