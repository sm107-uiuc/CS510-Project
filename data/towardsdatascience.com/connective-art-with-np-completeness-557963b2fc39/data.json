Across the entire world, cultures have looked at the sky and found constellations. Mathematicians have long tried to formalize the optimal way to find the shortest path among an arbitrary set of locations. This led to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).", "You\u2019ve encountered this problem before, for example, by asking: What order should I do my errands so they get done the fastest? We can reduce this problem into a graph: Each errand is a dot, a vertex, and how long it would take to complete that errand, that dot, to another dot would be the distance between them. Finding the shortest path would be the fastest sequence of errands.", "Stippling is an artistic technique that represents a picture with a collection of dots, to give the impression of tone. We can use this to connect stippled images, where dots are clustered by how dark the image is. In doing so, we can create a TSP problem and some mathematically interesting art.", "If you\u2019d like to try some of this for yourself, I made an easy-to-use python repository on Github! Try it out for yourself.", "The algorithm for this art is deceptively simple at a high level:", "To demostrate how to make TSP art, lets first pick an image. I\u2019ll be transforming this Penguin image.", "Lets start by generating some dots. The technique used in my repo is called Weighted Vornoi Stippling, first introduced by Adrian Secord, here.", "You can clone my repo, and follow the setup instructions in the readme.", "To generate a stippled image, you specify the path of an image after calling the python file.", "This stipples an image with 20k points, forces recomputation, saves the output, and displays it to your screen.", "After a short bit, the file will be generated, and it will output 3 files: A PDF, A PNG, and a NPY file. The PNG is interesting, but the real meat in the stippler.py file is that it creates .npy file, which contains the X and Y coordinate of every dot in the image. We can feed this directly into a TSP solver.", "To do this, we specify the path of the .npy file in the TSP solver script:", "This will produce a TSP image!", "You can configure these, and find more configurations in the repository below.", "I\u2019ve learned most of this type of art from my math major advisor, Dr. Bosch. He has written an entire book on this field of optimization art. Its an accessible and enjoyable read, with many nice pictures.", "You can check out his book here:", "Bosch, Robert.

I tried to convert it into its TSP representation, and that had mixed results. I was quite pleased with how it stippled, but it looked incredibly bizarre as a TSP.", "Another one of my favorites is Feminine Wave, by Hokusai (~1830). Japanese Woodblock paintings tend to be stippled very nicely due to how tone is handled through the medium, and its something I\u2019ve grown to appreciate.", "If you\u2019d like to check out more of my work, you can look at my portfolio website here.", "The code for the following article is in this repository here.", "Try it out and share your works in the comments below!", "Your home for data science.
