I found that the most popular articles are not those with state-of-the-art machine learning technologies, but those with straightforward and meaningful graphs.", "At a certain stage of my career as a data scientist, I realized that delivering the information is more important than showing the fancy models. Perhaps that\u2019s why linear regression is still one of the most popular models in the finance world.", "In this post, I am going to talk about a simple topic. It is how to draw the spider plot, or the radar plot, which is one of the most essential graphs in a comparative analysis. I am implementing the code in R.", "NBA players\u2019 basic statistics and advanced statistics per game in 2019\u20132020 NBA playoffs. (from basketball reference)", "Let\u2019s first visualize James Harden\u2019s stats in a spider plot. We only focus on five stats: PTS (points), TRB (total rebounds), AST (assists), STL (steals), and BLK (blocks).", "In the code of this block, the data was read to a data frame, \u201cdf\u201d. And the maximum and minimum values of each column were calculated because these values are useful to define the boundary of the data in the spider plot.", "For example, I extracted the stats of James Harden and LeBron James for our analysis.", "To define the function of the spider plot, we need to load the fmsb package.", "In the function, \u201cradarchart\u201d is to draw the spider plot, some arguments of which is explained below.", "pcol and pfcol define the color of lines and the color to fill, respectively. plwd and plty give the line width and type of the spider plot, respectively. The grid line (or the web) has the color and type defined by cglcol and cglty. I don\u2019t want to put any label in the center of the spider plot, so the caxislabels is given null strings (rep(\u201c\u201d,5)).", "Let\u2019s see how Harden\u2019s stats look.", "From the plot above, we can see that Harden is not only an excellent scorer (high points) but also a playmaker (high assists). These interpretations are perfectly consistent with the James Harden we know.", "To compare the stats between James Harden and LeBron James, let\u2019s input both players\u2019 stats to the function.", "We can see that LeBron has got better rebound and assist numbers in the stats comparing to Harden even though his scoring is not as good as Harden.", "Let\u2019s do a similar comparison between Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kawhi Leonard in their advanced statistics, which include offense box plus/minus (OBPM), defense box plus/minus (DBPM), offense win share (OWS), defense win share (DWS), and true shooting percentage (TS).", "We can find that Giannis is an all-round star because he has good stats in almost every aspect. No wonder he won his second MVP for the 2019\u20132020 regular season.", "Next, let\u2019s compare Giannis with Kawhi Leonard in their advanced statistics.", "We can see that Giannis outperformed Kawhi in all aspects of the advanced stats.", "You can compare any number of players with this simple function, however, I don\u2019t recommend to use a spider plot for the comparison of more than 3 individuals.", "If you do need to compare a large group of objects, a heatmap could be a better choice for visualization. Here is one of my previous posts of the best heatmap function in R.", "I hope this short article could contribute to your toolkit as a data scientist!", "Your home for data science.
