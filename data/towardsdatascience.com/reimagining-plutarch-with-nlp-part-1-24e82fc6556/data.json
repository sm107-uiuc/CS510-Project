In this article / tutorial\u2014 following a previous one on text generation \u2014 I will continue the text genre and explore this book using some of the natural language processing techniques.", "To help with the easy replication, I adapted the code to Google Colab, and highlighted what is unique to the platform \u2014 otherwise the entire code can be run locally on Python 3.6+. The code is sequentially presented throughout the article and the link to the Github files is embedded at the end as I may skip some minor details or code.", "First, let\u2019s set up the basics\u2026", "On Colab, let\u2019s change the Runtime Type to GPU, then import the OS library and save + print the file path for future reference:", "Let\u2019s import the text into the Google Colab drive \u2014 we need to keep in mind that our files there are ephemeral and we\u2019ll need to upload them every time after taking a longer break from using the platform:", "When executing this code we\u2019ll see Colab uploading the file and then we can click on the Colab Files tab on the left to make sure the file is there along with the Google\u2019s default Sample Data directory.", "At this stage, we\u2019ll be focusing on word level analysis, i.e. ignoring character and sentence levels. Hence we need to segment the text into separate words \u2014 that is tokenize. In addition, we need to remove the English stop words and can rank word frequency \u2014 all by using NLTK and matplotlib.", "In the code below, we are reading the raw text file, tokenizing it, removing English stop words (the NLTK standard plus some additional ones), drawing a chart with 40 most frequent words, and saving the tokenized file as \u201cPlutarch_tokens.txt\u201d for future use:", "The overall text is over 674,000 words long and here is the chart of the 40 most frequently used ones:", "Unsurprisingly, Caesar is the most popular from the emperors, followed closely by Pompey \u2014 they\u2019re the only two who made it to the top 40. Without actually reading the book \u2014 apologies to those who are very familiar with the text \u2014 one can easily get a sense the book is largely focused on war and conflict due to frequency of words \u201cwar\u201d, \u201cenemy\u201d, \u201carmy\u201d, \u201cfriends\u201d, \u201csoldiers\u201d, \u201cpower\u201d, and \u201cbattle\u201d; I presume even the word \u201cmen\u201d \u2014 third most frequent \u2014 is often used in reference to soldiers.", "How about the pairs of words?", "I presumed that \u201cthree hundred\u201d \u2014the second most frequent pair of words \u2014 was in one or few instances referring to the legendary battle of Thermopylae (the primary historical source of which is Herodotus) and three hundred Spartans who fought there, but upon the \u201clow tech\u201d inspection (looking up the expression in the text) it turned out to not be the case. The number appears to be generally popular in a variety of contexts: Romulus enlisting all who were of age to bear arms into military companies (a.k.a. legions), each company consisting of three thousand footmen and three hundred horsemen, Numa recalculating the number of days in a year, a recommendation when raising stocks of bees to not place them within three hundred feet of another, Mucius outmaneuvering Porsenna with a threat of (non-existent) three hundred Romans waiting to attack, three hundred ships coming to support Demetrius, Cato summoning three hundred Romans as his council etc. The numeric assessments of all kinds are popular across the entire author\u2019s text \u2014 several are among the most frequent bigrams and quite a few are among the most frequent trigrams.", "For deeper insights, we may not necessarily want to worry about the tenses and other forms / derivatives of essentially same words. That\u2019s when stemming and lemmatization come to the rescue.", "Stemming helps to reduce the word to its root (stem) often by chopping off a part of the word (e.g. ending \u201c-ing\u201d, plural endings) or changing to the stemmed form which may be different from an actual word (e.g. \u201cciti\u201d for \u201ccities\u201d and \u201ccity\u201d).", "Lemmatization is different from stemming in that it cares about the intended meaning of the word (incl. part of speech and context within which the word is used), finding a root of which is only a part, so it is a more complex algorithm and probably has much more room to evolve relative to stemming. Luckily, both stemming and lemmatization can be easily applied in our case, compliments of NLTK:", "We will notice that while the original tokenized text has 20,214 unique words with 6.48 letters on average, the lemmatized one has 17,864 with 6.34 letters on average, and the stemmed \u2014 12,722 with 5.49; chopping really shows in the latter one. Now we have three sets of tokens to choose from for further analysis.", "Here is the code for the above:", "Word cloud is a great way to visualize text, but obviously has its limitations when dealing with large books\u2014 it is hard to see 20,000+ words on one computer screen. In addition, useless (for frequency count) words that may not be a part of the NLTK or wordcloud library may stand out and take away real estate from the other words \u2014 luckily, both NLTK and wordcloud libraries make it easy to increase their stop words; the former adjustment was shown earlier and the latter is included in the Github notebook.", "Let\u2019s run the basic word cloud on the tokenized text:", "Note that while I am using my pre-defined stop words, it is not necessary to include it in the code as the text itself is ex stop words. However, I wanted to keep this line in as a reminder in case the word cloud is run independently from NLTK or the library\u2019s own stop words need to be applied.", "Now let\u2019s run a word cloud for the stemmed words:", "One of the cool features of the wordcloud library is the ability to superimpose a picture \u2014 the gallery of examples gives us a sense of various possibilities, including using pictures and custom colors. With the code above, I used the opportunity to combine the word cloud with a picture of the Roman emperor Augustus.", "For the lemmatized word set, the word cloud picture is at the top of the article \u2014 I am not sure the aesthetics is what the library author had intended, but it worked. The code is very similar to the one above, but in case you need to look it up, it is on Github.", "In Part 1 of this article, we focused on leveraging NLTK and wordcloud libraries to explore a text sample \u2014 the entire code shown in this article and more can be found on Github. In Part 2, we will delve into word embeddings and visualization,", "Your home for data science.
