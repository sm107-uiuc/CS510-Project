One of the most promising applications of deep learning is image analysis, e.g. for image segmentation or classification. Whereas segmentation yields a probability distribution per pixel (also known as mask) for each class (i.e. each pixel belongs to 1 of K classes), classification does so for the whole image (i.e. each image belongs to 1 of K classes). Software solutions can be encountered nearly everywhere nowadays, for example in medical imaging. In clinical research, where novel medications are tested, it is of interest to examine if a new drug can change the condition of a tissue, e.g. reduction of inflammations. These can be monitored by medical images, which are created by imaging techniques such as medical ultrasound, X-ray, computed tomography (CT), or even regular light microscopes. However, segmenting or classifying generated images is hard \u2014 and even for a specialist, it is a time-consuming and expensive task with; the question arises whether this can be automatized to save time and money. This post aims to provide some intuition into deep learning based medical image analysis (with emphasis in lesion segmentation in multiple sclerosis patients using data from a former challenge).", "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the central nervous system (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, as signal transduction is distorted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). While the cause is unclear, the underlying mechanism is thought to be either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors such as being triggered by a viral infection. The name of the disease refers to the scars (sclerae \u2014 better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis (yet), several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. Starting medications is generally recommended in people after the first attack when more than two lesions are seen on MRI. There is ongoing research looking for more effective, convenient, and tolerable treatments for relapsing-remitting MS, creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes, neuroprotection strategies, and effective symptomatic treatments (but to assess the efficacy of novel therapies, cheap and standardized disease progression examination would be helpful).", "Medical imaging techniques such as the one mentioned above are typically based on invisible light, i.e. light outside the spectrum which is visible for our eyes (380\u2013750 nm). For example, MRI scanners use radio waves (wave lengths of 1 mm to 10 km) to generate images of the organs in the body. In contrast to MRI, CT and regular X-ray imaging use light with wave lengths of 250 pm to 10 nm (called X-rays, hence the name). (Note that X-rays are energy-rich and can cause cell damage, be careful when you play with them.) Other diagnostic methods like electroencephalography do not generate classical images as primary output but pure electric signals (technically, every digital diagnostic method generates electric signals at some point, but in imaging they are mapped by Fourier transformations to generate images). X-ray imaging and ultrasound generate 2D images, whereas CT and MRI generate image volumes (3D images)\u2014 which makes them even more difficult to analyze to find diseased tissue, e.g. in the brain. However, single slices behave like regular images. Below, sample MRI slices of the brain (neuroimaging) in different imaging modes/settings (e.g. proton density (PD), fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), etc.) are shown.", "The mask above (image on the right) shows three lesion regions in a patient with MS. A lesion is any damage or abnormal change in the tissue of an organism usually caused by disease such as MS. To examine the efficacy of a treatment against MS, these regions have to be observed over time to asses whether any physical improvement(s) can be achieved with a therapy, for example by measuring the total volume of lesions in a image volume. Note how there are much more black than white pixels in the mask. Black and white images are represented as rank two tensors (better known under the term matrix) in which every entry represents an intensity for a pixel. Values range from 0 to 255 as the representation is in form of 8 bit, but the entries are normalized to the range [0,1] before being fed to a network \u2014 the higher the value, the brighter the pixel. Colored images are rank three tensors in which the one dimension iterates over the different color channels (e.g. RGB color space). Analogously, a 3D colored image volume is a rank four tensor. However, the color channel may instead contain different imaging modes (PD, T2, etc.) or even Gaussian-filtered images of said modes. The dimensions of a MR image volume are:", "Voxel is the analogue of pixel for an image volume. A typical MR image has about 200x200x200 voxels. This yields a total of 8.000.000 voxels per channel. Assuming 4 channels are present (for four different modes), this gives 32.000.000 (!) voxels. The output with all masks for all classes has dimensions:", "The gold standard for image analysis has been established by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and finding good network architectures has been a main purpose of recent research. CNNs consist of convolutional layers which are defined by a kernel (also knows as filter) which is a tensor of rank two for 2D images or rank three for 3D images filled with weights. A convolution is a mapping that generates new images by hovering over the input and weighting the image tensor entries with kernel entries for all channels. Those new images are called features maps.", "Usually, many filters are used within a single layer in a CNN which are learned during the training (inference) phase, i.e. weights are set in a way that regions of interest are more pronounced than irrelevant ones. After a convolutional layer, some activation function (sigmoid, rectifier) is applied to the feature map, which also can be followed by a pooling layer. In CNNs, sequential mappings of convolutional layers (and sometimes pooling layers) with activation functions are computed, which amplify certain patterns over the course of the network as the output of each operation is again a feature map.", "Below, a 3x3 convolution with a stride of 1 for vertical edge detection (example from above) and a 3x3 maximum pooling is visualized. Note how vertical lines are more pronounced in the filter maps (vertical edges that separate shapes are clearer, i.e. less blurred, than other edges). In addition, the pooling operation makes the image coarser.", "From the images above, lesions are anyway quite hard to detect because they merge with the surrounding regions. The filters have to be designed in a way (learned during the training phase) so that the lesions are the pronounced textures in the feature maps. You could also argue that the result could be improved by some using other MR imaging mode, but in the end the combination of different modes and additional Gaussian-filtered versions are needed to uniquely identify lesions. Different image modes are stacked and act as individual channels in the input. Hence, the general shape of a convolutional layer is:", "So the number of parameters for one single convolutional layer is:", "Assuming there are 3 input channels and 16 filters of shape (5x5x5), the total amount of parameters of this layer is:", "Note that for volumetric images three-dimensional filters are used. As mentioned above, a volume consists of several millions of voxels which makes it currently infeasible to process the whole volume, and subsamples have to be used instead (e.g. 80x80x80 voxels). It provides less context in border regions which will results in worse performance, but it needs less computational power. However, it is better to perform it in a random manner; due to the imbalance in the classes, it is important to control for the class distribution in the subvolumes by selective random sampling, i.e. occasionally discarding subvolumes without lesions.", "There are different CNN architectures (also known as topologies) depending on the problem (e.g. whether classification or segmentation is performed) and image dimensions (2D or 3D); U-Net, 3D-U-Net, V-Net are among the better known ones for segmentation tasks, whereas ResNet proved to be high-performing in classification tasks. They consist of multiple (10+) millions of trainable parameters. Current top scores in lesion segmentation are in the range of 91.7\u201393.4%.", "The V-Net consists of a part with regular convolutions, in this context also called downconvolutions, which generate feature maps. In the other part of the network, upconvolutions (also known as transpose convolutions) do the opposite. An upconvolution is the inverse operation of a downconvolution (convolution) \u2014 read more about here. At the end of the network, a 1x1x1 convolution removes residual channels and assigns class labels to each pixel/voxel using a sigmoid or softmax activation function depending on the number of classes.", "As mentioned above, lesion segmentation is an example of an imbalanced data set problem, which makes it even more challenging to develop a proper solution. In such cases, a model usually misclassfies the class which has less samples in the data set, here it would be a lesion pixel. This issue can be tackled by assigning weights to the contribution of each class in the calculation of the loss function, which is often formulated as (binary) cross entropy. Other loss functions which correct for the imbalancing are possible, e.g. dice loss.", "Besides pure convolutional neural networks, there have been also developments inspired by video image segmentation. A video is composed of images (also known as frames) which are correlated in time-domain, i.e. single frames depend on each other on possibly many time steps. To deal with sequential data of any kind (text, audio, time-series), recurrent neural networks are used, e.g. as long short-term memory (LSTM) unit, or gated-recurrent unit (GRU). By treating one of the three dimensions in a MR volume as time-coordinate, convolutional LSTM and GRU implementations have been developed for medical image analysis.", "Although it is important to explore the space of network architectures, better performance can also be achieved by integrating (on-the-fly) data augmentation and regularization techniques in a model, which decreases variance and avoids overfitting (bias-variance trade-off). The goal of data augmentation and regularization methods is to avoid overfitting and develop a model that generalizes well, i.e. predicts data with high accuracy/precision/recall without having seen it before. One one hand, synthetic data can be created by samling from the dataset and applying transformations like deformations, scaling, or rotations on it; and together with selective random sampling, the amount of labeled training data can be increased (if you need a class that has these features implemented, I can direct you to my GitHub. ImageDataSampler is a class that subsamples from a set and creates training batches during a session with the possibility of augmentations). On the other hand, DropConnect (which is a generalization of DropOut) helps in uncorrelating single neurons.", "Your home for data science.
