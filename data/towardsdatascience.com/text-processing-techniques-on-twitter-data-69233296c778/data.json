Analyzing data in the text format is the most complex task for a machine as it\u2019s difficult for a machine to understand the semantics behind the text. To serve this purpose we process text data into a machine-understandable format.", "Text Processing is simply converting the data in text format to numerical values (or vectors ) so that we can give these vectors as input to the machine and analyze the data using the concepts of algebra.", "However, when we perform such transformation, there could be data loss. The key is to maintain an equilibrium between conversion and retaining the data.", "Before processing the text, preprocessing of text is essential. To have a quick glance at what text preprocessing is, check this article.", "In this article, we will discuss various techniques to perform text processing.", "Before getting started, let us understand a few commonly used terms.", "Text processing can be done using the following techniques,", "Now let us begin exploring each technique in detail.", "Bag of Words does a simple transformation of the document to vector by using a dictionary of unique words. This is done in just two steps,", "Create a dictionary of all the unique words in the data corpus in a vector form. Let the number of unique words in the corpus be, \u2018d\u2019. So each word is a dimension and hence this dictionary vector is a d-dimension vector.", "For each document, say, r\u1d62 we create a vector, say, v\u1d62. Now, this v\u1d62 which has d-dimensions can be constructed in two ways:", "This type is known as Binary Bag of Words.", "Now, we have vectors for each document and a dictionary that has a set of unique words of the data corpus. These vectors can be analyzed by", "There are three elements here \u2014 word, document, corpus. Term Frequency \u2014 Inverse Document Frequency, TF-IDF, in short, uses the relationship between these to convert text data into vectors.", "Term Frequency says about the relationship between a word and a document. Whereas, Inverse Document Frequency says about the relationship between a word and the corpus.", "Term frequency is the probability of the word w\u2c7c in the document r\u1d62. And is calculated as,", "If Term Frequency of a word in a review is high implies, the word is frequent in that review. If Term Frequency of a word in a review is low implies, the word is rare in that review.", "Inverse Document Frequency says how frequently the word is in the entire corpus. And is calculated as,", "If Inverse Document Frequency is low, implies the word is frequent in the corpus.If Inverse Document Frequency is high, implies the word is rare in the corpus.", "The reason to use log instead of the simple inverse ratio is scaling. Term Frequency which is a probability ranges between 0 and 1. When we simply take this inverse ratio it will be a huge value, thus the entire TF-IDF value will be biased to IDF. This is one of the simple and highly accepted reasons for using the log in IDF term.", "TF-IDF of a word in review is TF(word, review) *IDF(word, document corpus).", "Now in the vector form of each document, we have this TF-IDF of the word. Converting a document into a vector, using TF-IDF values is called TF-IDF vectorization.", "TF-IDF vectorization gives high importance to words which are", "In Bag of Words and TF-IDF, we convert sentences into vectors. But in Word2Vec, we convert word into a vector. Hence the name, word2vec!", "Word2Vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located close to one another in the space.", "In this article, we will be using Customer Support on the Twitter dataset from Kaggle.", "The Customer Support on the Twitter dataset is a large, modern corpus of tweets and replies to aid innovation in natural language understanding and conversational models, and for the study of modern customer support practices and impact. This dataset offers a large corpus of modern English (mostly) conversations between consumers and customer support agents on Twitter.", "Let us use the preprocessed data and perform each text preprocessing on it. Let us look at the preprocessed data", "Sckit learns provides us with many libraries. It makes us so easy to implement any functionality in a single line.", "Sckit learn provides CountVectorizer to perform Bag of Words.", "Creating an object of count vectorizer and fitting, transforming with the preprocessed data. bow_df is a sparse vector which contains more number of zeros than ones.", "Sckit learn provides TFIDfVectorizer to perform TF-IDF Vectorization.", "tfidf_df contains the tf-idf values of each word in a document in a 1000 dimensional vector.", "Google provides a huge list of vectors trained on humongous data of google news. To use these vectors, we need to import Gensim.", "There is no obvious answer to this question: it really depends on the application.", "For example, the Bag of Words is commonly used for document classification applications where the occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier.", "TF-IDF is used by search engines like Google, as a ranking factor for content.", "When the application is about understanding the context of words or, detecting the similarity of the words or, translating given documents into another language, which requires a lot of information on the document, Word2vec comes into the picture.", "Thanks for the read.
