As of late though, more and more data scientists have been utilizing this file and code management platform for working with both their .py and .ipynb files.", "A Jupyter Notebook is a research environment and platform for data scientists to test their Python code, model, and results. It is saved with an extension \u201c.ipynb\u201d, and can be executed, containing separate cells that perform the code within them.", "Holding a master of science in data science, as well as experiencing various data science and machine learning courses, I have become too comfortable in my familiar Jupyter Notebook. In my experience, Visual Studio Code has become a tool to increase my efficiency in programming Python and implementing machine learning models. Below are the main reasons why data scientists should use Visual Studio Code:", "The dataset is dummy data created in a Google Sheet. It was developed to mimic similar fields of the coronavirus pandemic dataset of 2020. The fields include the date, region, record counts, and dummy categories. When following this tutorial, a different dataset, such as the real coronavirus dataset [2] can be used for educational and academic research purposes only. This data contains a date feature that can be better represented, which is the goal of the implemented code in this tutorial.", "The first step in starting Visual Studio Code is to download the necessary packages from here [1]. It will be an application on your computer that is a platform for visualizing and executing your code. From there, if you choose to use Python as your main programming language, search for that extension in the marketplace as seen below. You can also clone your GitHub repository from here and start making pull requests and terminal commands as well. For my example, I chose to create a new folder with a subfolder that housed three Python files and a standalone Jupyter Notebook file outside that subfolder. My file system written out is as:", "In my example, I have classes that help to describe and display how setting up your data science algorithm could possibly be managed. The goals of these classes are simply to return a pandas dataframe with a converted datetime feature, as well as a dataframe that could be ingested in an algorithm. While my __init__.py file is empty, as expected, my introduction_class.py includes a class \u2018IntroductionClass\u2019:", "Below is my read_df.py. As you can see, I use pandas to read in my dataframe from a .csv file. I perform a simple datetime conversion from pandas [3] as well. The column \u2018Year Month\u2019 is converted to a \u2018Date\u2019 that includes the day of the month, month, and year. I then return the top 5 rows of the dataframe from the head function. This class serves as a simple illustration of what could be imported into your Jupyter Notebook.", "The final part of the importing is contained in the Jupyter Notebook itself, \u2018visual_studio_code.ipynb\u2019. This file imports the two python class .py files, which include \u2018IntroductionClass\u2019 and \u2018testClass\u2019. Below, the classes are called after being imported. They return the expected dataframe, and the first new Jupyter Notebook code is manipulated by a pandas function that describes a dataframe column with common statistics, in this case, the \u2018Confirmed Recovery\u2019 field.", "Once you have started with your first example, then practicing with importing classes from .py files, you can create better code for production that is scalable and efficient. You can work cross-functionally to implement your algorithms with object-oriented code, but then have the benefit of testing and visualizing your dataframes better in Jupyter Notebook form, the best of both worlds.", "Being the top of your data science game can be overwhelming and complicated, but I believe with new and familiar tools, you can better your skills and become more adept at machine learning engineering, too. I believe Visual Studio Code is one of those tools.", "It aided me in importing Python classes and functions that were used to shape my dataframe for a possible machine learning model. It can serve as a platform to engineer your GitHub repository code side-by-side to your research Jupyter Notebook. It serves as an excellent bridge to data science, data engineering, and machine learning.", "My Visual Studio Code setup was created using a dummy dataset. The features/fields/columns are dummy attributes as well. The images are my own screenshots of the VS Code main file management platform. The data and metrics visualized in my VS Code screenshots are to not be used for any medical reason. It is static, non-real, and does not have any reliance on accuracy. It was purely developed for tutorial purposes.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Sr/MS Data Scientist.
