What is the difference between a calculated column and a measure? When should I be using Power Query?", "I got stuck really early in my journey trying (and failing) to understand some key concepts that made Power BI seem much more difficult and confusing than it is. I almost abandoned my BI ambitions to crawl back to my familiar pal, Excel. Better the devil you know, right? WRONG!", "I am so, so, SO happy that I kept banging my head against the wall to get over those initial hurdles. Today, I use Power BI almost daily, and I use it cheerfully, gleefully even, and I rarely use Excel. But getting here was hard, really hard. And it was harder than it should have been because, for a long time, I did not have a clear, conceptual understanding of some key Power BI concepts.", "I am going to try to keep things as simple as possible to give you just a hint, a tinge, a taste to get you started.", "More experienced Power BI users might cringe at the way I am (over) simplifying and reducing these concepts, but you know what? At this point, all of the nuance and minutia really doesn\u2019t matter. You need a place to start. Trust me, the complexity will come.", "So, my intrepid warrior, my Padawan, my Power BI master-to-be, here is a very basic overview of:", "What the heck is it? This is where it all begins. Power Query is where you pull your data into Power BI. M is the coding language used by Powery Query. You can use Power Query by pointing and clicking and the code in M will essentially be created for you. You can also write your own code in M directly.", "When do I use it? To clean and format your data. You can do things like remove and add columns, filter out data, change column formatting, etc.", "Do I have to use M?: Short answer, no. You can do most things in Power Query by pointing and clicking without needing to use M at all. However, knowing M can be really helpful in making your process more flexible and easier to replicate in the future. For example, when using M you can copy and paste bits of code you want to reuse and you can annotate your steps.", "Tip for learning: Do what you need to in Power Query by pointing and clicking and then open the Advanced Editor. The M code will be there for the manipulations you have just completed. This way, you can start to get familiar with the language and by making small tweaks before you try writing your own M code from scratch.", "What the heck is it? DAX, short for Data Analysis eXpressions, can be used to create measures and calculated columns once your data has been pulled into Power BI with Power Query/M.", "When do I use it?: Using DAX is essentially like using formulas in Excel \u2014 it allows you to make calculations based on your data. You can use DAX to create calculated columns or measures.", "What the heck is it? Calculated columns and measures are two ways to write expressions in DAX. A calculated column will create an additional column with a value for every row in your table. A measure is an aggregate expression based on multiple rows in a table or multiple tables.", "When should I do a measure vs. a calculated column? I am so glad you asked because I really struggled with this one. This is a tricky one because you often can use either a measure or a calculated column (but that doesn\u2019t mean you should).", "Things to keep in mind with measures and calculated columns:", "If the distinction between calculated columns and measures doesn\u2019t totally make sense right now, that is okay. Try experimenting with creating both a measure and a calculated column and see if they both do what you need them to. If they do, great, use the measure. If just the calculated column works, go with that!", "Things got confusing for me here, too, because it seemed like most of what I could do in Power Query/M, I could also do in DAX. Which one am I supposed to use and when?", "Short answer: Use Power Query/M when possible. (The big exception here, that you\u2019ll rarely use, is if you are trying to create a calculated column that references a column in a different table. In that case, use DAX to create a calculated column)", "And just like that, you did it! You made it through a basic conceptualization of Power Query, M, DAX, measures, and calculated columns. If you don\u2019t understand all the differences and uses right now, that is perfectly okay! You have laid the foundation, and that is a huge step in the right direction.", "The easiest and fastest way to get these concepts to stick in your brain is by exposure and practice. Here are some great resources to get started with:", "While I highly encourage engaging with all the wonderful resources out there, nothing is going to help you more than by trying things out on your own and seeing what happens.", "Keep banging your head against the wall.
