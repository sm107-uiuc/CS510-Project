Vision is vital to our learning. It is the key to deepening our understanding of the world.", "But what do we do if we want computers to have a deep understanding of the world too?", "We give it eyes through computer vision!", "Wait a minute. What is computer vision?", "Computer vision is a field of interdisciplinary study in which we train computers to have a deeper understanding of digital images or videos. It is a subset of Machine Learning in Artificial Intelligence. It is responsible for self-driving cars, robotics, drones, security, medical imaging and treatments for the visually impaired.", "Behind this amazing technology is neural networks. Or more specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are used primarily to classify and cluster images. They can be used to identify faces, street signs, tumors and many aspects of visual data. CNNs power the advancement of computer vision. One of the more notable CNN is AlexNet. Designed by Alex Krizhevsky, AlexNet contains eight layers \u2014 the first five were convolutional layers, some of them followed by max-pooling layers (reducing parameters so it is easier to identify features), and the last three were fully connected layers.", "Convolutional neural networks make up of 3 main layers:", "The composition of the neural network has many layers within its structure which have many interconnected nodes. Each node has its own role. When an image is an input into the neural network, each node is responsible for a certain part of the image and it is activated based on whether or not it fulfills the criteria.", "For example, you input this image of a rose into the network.", "The neural network would scan each pixel, calculating the color gradient of each pixel using the kernel in linear algebra. They measure the color difference of the pixels on their left and the color pixels on the right to figure if it is an edge.", "If the difference between the color gradient of the pixels on both sides is significant, the image would be able to figure out that it is an edge.", "The first hidden layer would scan for rough edges and curves, each node being responsible for a certain part of the image. The network continues to go through more convolutions and soon enough the network would soon be able to identify specific objects like the rose with the final convolution putting it together.", "Compared to the human eyes, the computer is at a disadvantage. We\u2019ve had years of evolution to teach us how to identify images and understand them. The computer has none. But luckily, thanks to the large amounts of data on the cloud, we can easily obtain training images to teach the computer within hours.", "The applications of computer vision are endless, but here are some of the more notable ones.", "Using computer vision, we can actually diagnose many types of diseases and illnesses. For example, we can scan the X-ray of someone\u2019s lungs to detect lung cancer. This is called Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) most commonly used by radiologists. To detect lung cancer, radiologists had to look through each x-ray of the patient to find a specific spot in the lung that is cancer. This is inefficient and takes time from treatment if the patient was actually found to have cancer. Using computer vision, we can feed the network labeled data to teach it how to detect cancer in the lungs.", "Autonomous vehicles use YOLO (You Only Look Once) technology to achieve its self-driving technology. The biggest difficulty in building these networks is that it needs to not only understand the object and but also understand what the object does. So when the network detects a pedestrian, it must also understand that the pedestrian, according to traffic rules, has the right of way and the car should not run them over.", "One of the most prominent examples of computer vision is in autonomous vehicles. We all know of Tesla, the world\u2019s leading brand for self-driving cars. It's breakthrough technology allows for the car to park, drive, and switch lanes all on its own.", "Recently, a paper on YOLO nano was released. YOLO nano is a version of YOLO technology which breaks down the CNN into smaller sections in order for them to process images at a faster rate. When the car is driving, the images they take in are processed by a complex network and every image has to go through the network. This takes a few seconds but for autonomous vehicles driving on the road, its too much time. YOLO nano breaks down the CNNs into smaller networks so each piece of labeled data only has to go through one short network. This cuts down the processing time to just milliseconds allowing the car to make decisions in a much shorter time frame.", "As of right now, Artificial Intelligence is this grey area to the general public. For example, with autonomous vehicles, if the customer does not know exactly why the vehicle made a decision, they will not feel safe in the vehicle. So in order to ensure that customers are willing to use products with AI, we must promise transparency with them.", "What is the future of medical imaging and cars?", "That was obvious but who would have know that our vision, something we tend to take for granted can play such an important role in our lives?", "Your home for data science.
