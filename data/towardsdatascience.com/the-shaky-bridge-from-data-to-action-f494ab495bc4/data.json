His intervention often had the merits to calm spirits in the most tense situations. In many ways, this statement had the flavor of a truism but something in it really appealed to my Cartesian mind: cold facts and data are the essence of truth, subjective opinions take us further from the truth. The founding charter of the Statistical Society of London (founded in 1834) also said something along these lines: data has to receive priority in all cases over opinions and interpretations. Data are objective; opinions are subjective. This creed still guides many statisticians today: in fact I think the \u201cblind faith\u201d in data is stronger than it has ever been, to an extent where we purposefully decide to ignore human experts opinion and instead rely on \u201cwhat the data says\u201d.", "In an era with an unparalleled abundance of facts (\u201cbig data\u201d collected on everything, accelerating scientific progress, multiplying computing power to process the data \u2026), we should be closer to the truth than any past generation has ever been!

Never in our modern era have facts and data been more abundant, and yet \u201ctruth\u201d more elusive, relative and subjective.", "To me this is a fascinating paradox that merits further investigation. I attempted to do so in the following by analyzing how we actually apprehend reality and decide what is true from what is false. I summarize my approach using the following chart.", "Finally opinions are extremely important because they ultimately driver actions", "Let us illustrate this with another \u201ctemperature\u201d analogy: Cimate change.", "The facts are the massive data sets of temperature measurements, sea level-rise and man-provoked carbon-emissions across the various years and locations around the earth.

In reality scientists will often state their affirmations in terms of probability (for example a scientist may claim there is a 70% probability that man-provoked climate change will cause a 50 cm rise in sea level is the next 50 years or in the opposing side \u201cThere is a 80% probability that natural climate variations caused the rise. The probability that this is provoked by green house Gas emissions is so small it is insignificant ) but practically these will be simplified often into more generic and definitive and bite-size statements (fossil fuels cause sea-level rise \u2014 sea level rise is not provoked by man and there is nothing we can do about it).", "Actions are the government policies (or non-policies) that are put in place as a result of these opinions", "This simple example clearly shows how smart educated scientists can reach different conclusions from the same facts, and more importantly, government implementing very different policies", "So where does the disconnect in this \u201cReality \u2014 Facts \u2014 Estimates \u2014 Opinions \u2014 Action\u201d happen? Let us examine each dimension separately", "There is a story in the history of science that always fascinated me: Lewis Fry Richardson was an English physicist that wanted to test a funny theory: the probability of war between two countries depended on the length of their common border! While researching data, he started stumbling on troubling inconsistencies: the length of a border, say between Netherlands and Belgium, varied significantly between sources. It could be for example 380km in one source And 449 km in another.", "Richardson was eventually able to solve this paradox by realizing something that seems quite intuitive to is today: the length of a border or any natural coastline depends on the size of the ruler. You will get a different answer with a 200 km ruler than if you did it with a 50 km ruler (see image below)", "This finding was later called the \u201ccoastline paradox\u201d and was an instrumental element in the study of fractals by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.", "You may think that this is a rather trivial finding: of course with a finer ruler I will get longer lines for irregular lines\u2026. But what is interesting to me is not Richardson\u2019s discovery itself, but rather when it was made: 1950! Think about that, by that time the scientific community had made significant strides in areas like quantum mechanics and general relativity, and yet nobody had noticed this trivial fact that could very well have been discovered by the Ancient Greeks!", "What was considered an unquestionable \u201cfact\u201d \u2014 the length of the border between Spain and Portugal is 987 km claimed the Spanish and 1214 km claimed the Portuguese \u2014 turned out to be wrong for both. In fact fractals theory shows that this length diverges to infinity as the ruler becomes finer: from a theoretical perspective there is no length to speak of \u2026", "One of the most interesting mathematical demonstrations I read about recently is by Nassim Taleb. In a nutshell the general conclusion reads as follows: if you have n observations that form a particular distribution (i.e. the histogram of the observations) and that K is the largest observation in your sample, the probability of a future observation being larger than K is 1/n (for all power law distributions \u2014 which is quite a generic set). This rather simple conclusion has profound implications: It tells us things like \u201cHow likely are we to have heat waves stronger than the 100 ones already on record\u201d or \u201chow likely is the next financial crisis to be stronger than the ones we have witnessed\u201d. Indeed, many \u201cexperts\u201d overly rely on existing historical data, which makes them under-estimate the potential \u201cfat tail\u201d hidden behind the maximum pattern we have observed historically. Once again, this comes as a humble reminder that our observations are sometimes what Nature has chosen to reveal to us, but she may have kept some hidden cards in reserve \u2026", "PS: If you are interested in an easy illustration of this property, check-out Mike Lawler\u2019s great post . The mathematical demonstration can be accessed here", "How many other \u201ctruths\u201d do we consider unquestionable today, only to have our confidence shaken by some future discovery? Of course discoveries like the one above do not happen every day, but when consider that facts are often \u201cmeasurements\u201d of reality, we have to allow for some margin of error (even with the best of intentions \u2014 like the margins of errors caused by how fine the ruler is).", "I work myself with raw data and I know from my experience and from observing colleagues, that there is strong bias towards over-confidence in the quality of the raw data, often because this is the best you can get. Questioning the source, double-checking data quality and assigning proper margins of errors to it is a tedious task that most analysts avoid because it\u2019s much more appealing to dive straight through to the analysis \u2026 just like Richardson did with his theory on probability of war (that\u2019s much more exciting than measuring borders \u2026).", "Kant said we never really experience reality but only perceive it through the veil of our senses (he called it the veil of perception).

The results are below:", "As we can clearly see, the most popular dish is Egyptian Moussaka, and it is the creation of\u2026 chef Faven! By relying on our average per chef only, we were about to fire the person responsible for our most popular dish!

The latter is not any \u201ctruer\u201d than the former. Interestingly an Artificial Intelligence will only be able to express the objective statement such as \u201cthe cup has 50% of water in it\u201d and will not be able to make a distinction between the half full / half empty opinions. Those are distinctions that for the foreseeable future will remain intrinsically human \u2014 which is precisely the reason I consider them critical.", "Simply put, the way we process information depends only partly on the information itself, and just as much on our biased perception. If the representation layer (previous chapter) deals with the biases that the author introduces in conveying the data, the interpretation layer deals with the biases that the reader of the data introduces in making sense of the data. To expand the metaphor I used: if the representation layer is about the author representing the data with different color brushes, then the interpretation layer is about the reader looking at the facts through their own colored glasses", "There are several factors that can significantly influence this interpretation, some of which are inherent to our human and subconscious biases, other rooted in our intrinsic beliefs, culture and world views, and finally others in external factors such as the group we happen to be into when we \u201cconsume\u201d the facts.", "The Nobel economist Daniel Kahneman wrote an entire book, \u201cThinking , Fast and Slow\u201d on the topic of subconscious biases.

Nicholas Nassim Taleb, another one of my favorite authors explains this as the narrative fallacy", "The narrative fallacy addresses our limited ability to look at sequences of facts without weaving an explanation into them, or, equivalently, forcing a logical link, an arrow of relationship upon them. Explanations bind facts together. They make them all the more easily remembered; they help them make more sense. Where this propensity can go wrong is when it increases our impression of understanding", "In our example, we are trained to try to explain the variable on the y axis by the behavior of the variable on the x axis.

But it\u2019s enough the flip the axis to get a different interpretation \u2026 Of course people who are trained not to trust their first instincts on this and to dig deeper will often have different interpretations of this same data than the \u201ccommon sense\u201d.", "Subconscious biases are intrinsic to human nature and by definition common across individuals. In contrast our values and beliefs are specific to each individual as they are influenced by the individual education, upbringing, cultural environment, past experience, etc.", "The climate change topic is ideal to showcase how these values for can affect the interpretation of the data. The following chart from NOAA\u00b2 shows the increase in CO2 in the earth\u2019s atmosphere, which has recently surpassed 410 ppm.", "Mark Levin, the conservative commentator and radio host uses this information to argue that CO2 is only a trace gas in the planet\u2019s atmosphere. He condemns the establishment\u2019s often strong efforts to dissuade counterarguments and claim scientific near-unanimity on climate change.\u201cThey never mention what a tiny fraction of the atmosphere CO2 is,\u201d says Levin. https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/americans-for-carbon-dioxide-mark-levins-idea-whose-time-has-come", "From a pure factual perspective, Levin is right: CO2 is indeed a tiny fraction of the atmosphere. But perhaps someone should give him a glass of water with a tiny fraction of arsenic in it and ask him to show us how brave he is \u2014 after all it\u2019s so tiny \u2026", "Joking aside, this is a perfect illustration of how adherence to moral values and group thinking (in this case the climate denialists group) can heavily affect facts interpretation.

We see the same confirmation bias on the other end of the political spectrum with people picking the data that will make it sound most dramatic. The reality is that while there is scientific majority on one end of this argument, it is not yet a full consensus as there are still gaps in the factual analysis that cannot provide an \u201cirrefutable proof\u201d one way or the other that a a) the increase is provoked by humans and b) it will cause to catastrophe. I have my reading on what to do about this despite the uncertainty that I will elaborate on in the next chapter.", "I am borrowing this example from an article by Howard Wainer and Harris L. Zwerling but expanding on it. I was also exposed in Daniel Kahneman\u2019s book Thinking Fast and slow.", "You are a data analyst in one of the leading private laboratory developing a new cancer and have been tasked by the leadership to understand the geographies with highest incidence of kidney cancer. You do your research and present the following data map to the leaders", "Note: This scenario is purely ficticious but the data is real from the National Cancer Institute", "You show the chart to the executive leaders assembled around the table and for the first minute or so nobody knows what to make of it. But just then the CEO who has a sharp eye says: \u201cI get it! The counties where the cancer incidence is highest are mostly rural, sparsely populated in the Midwest, and the South. These states have higher poverty, a higher fat diet, too much alcohol and tobacco and no access to good medical care. It makes total sense!\u201d And immediately now everyone sees the pattern and nods in agreement.", "If you have nodded in agreement again yourself, think again, because the conclusion is in fact false. Indeed the counties where the cancer incidence is lowest are also rural, sparsely populated and in the Midwest, South and West \u2026 The chart below which splits the counties <50,000 in population and >50,000 in population and shows how they divide between low incidence and high incidence of kidney cancer. As you can see, we have just as many counties with low incidence of cancer in both types of counties, and roughly just as many low incidence as high incidence in the smaller counties.", "The rational explanation here is the \u201cLaw of small numbers\u201d: when we have smaller sample populations, we are more likely to have higher variances around the mean incidence rate. As a result we are more likely to find extremes (both low or high) in the smaller samples (in this case smaller counties) whereas the larger samples will be tend to be closer to the mean with less variation (indeed you can see a higher % of larger counties in the \u201cmoderate\u201d category.)", "The above explanation is essentially random \u2014 there is no causal reason why smaller counties would have lower or higher incidence. But our minds don\u2019t like randomness and will always be actively seeking causal relationship (more on this in Daniel Kahneman\u2019s book).", "This is similar to the narrative fallacy above. But there\u2019s another effect of interest here: note that the explanation could have gone a completely different way: some of the people in the room could have noticed that many small counties have a very low incidence of cancer and explained this by the benefits of the rural lifestyle, the lack of pollution, etc. That did not happen: the opinion shift to one end was driven by the power dynamics and role modeling from those in the organization with moral authority (in this instance the CEO). While this example has been explicitly exaggerated for the purpose of illustration, note that this happens in organization extremely frequently, albeit in more subtle ways. Examples of how these group dynamics emerge include for example who has stronger character or authority, or sometimes simply who gets to be the first at stating an opinion. Note that a healthier debate in these instances could be encouraged by soliciting the opinion of everyone before engaging in discussions, or also providing clearer charts by someone with deeper knowledge of statistics.", "There was something that always bothered me in the \u201ctoo hot / too cold\u201d example that my friend used to illustrate \u201cfacts over opinions\u201d, something felt off. It took me some time to figure out what, and in hindsight it was obvious: the analogy makes sense if the debate is just about knowing what the temperature is, like a scientist trying to measure a natural phenomenon, but if the analogy relates to whether people are feeling comfortable with the temperature, the analogy breaks. Indeed, knowing that the temperature was \u201cobjectively\u201d 68 degrees Fahrenheit did not diminish in any way the subjective feeling of cold or hot. After all the only way to bring satisfaction was for one of them to stand up and adjust the thermostat, therefore bringing in a new reality. Said differently, the metaphor implied that the objective truth should always trump the subjective truth. And yet what ultimately leads to action often has nothing to do with the objective and all to do with the subjective.", "This \u201cobjective vs. subjective\u201d is an age-old debate in many disciplines\u00b9 What is relevant to this article though is that action is a result of the subjective \u2014 or collective subjectives \u2014 and these actions have an impact on reality. So the linear chain \u201creality \u2192 opinion \u2192 action\u201d we described is in reality a closed loop.", "It\u2019s worthwhile here to introduce the concept of Reflexivity: so far we have been talking about the observer as an individual apprehending the data and facts through several lenses (observation, analysis, representation, interpretation \u2026) but assuming that this individual is a mere passive observer of reality, like a scientist observing ants. Reflexivity posits that in many fields, it\u2019s incorrect to consider the individual purely as a passive observer, as the views that he will develop will actually have an impact on the situation he is observing \u2014 making the relationship reflexive. Said differently: reality is not independent of the perception of the participants \u2014 it can be shaped by this perception. We have determined in the previous chapters how 2 individuals can develop 2 very different perspectives when exposed to the same facts. I will explain here why this perception matters especially when it become the reflection of a collective. Indeed, this is particularly relevant in the fields related to human affairs, such as finance or social sciences, where a collective of subjective observers are also participant in the objective reality they are observing.", "Reflexivity was taken up as an issue in science in general by Karl Popper who highlighted the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted, calling this the \u2018Oedipus effect\u2019 in reference to the Greek tale in which the sequence of events fulfilling the Oracle\u2019s prophecy is greatly influenced by the prophecy itself. George Soros (his pupil) later significantly expanded on the topic (check this article for a great summary). A quick example can be found in the Financial Markets:", "a) The participants (e.g. hedge funds) develop a biased view of the price of assets that differs from the facts (i.e. as should have been reflected by the market fundamentals based on the prevailing economic theories) \u2014 it\u2019s easy to see based on the chapters above why this perception can be biased. Soros calls this the cognitive function and introduces the concept of fallibility to describe the human bias", "b) The participants will then act upon their biased perception. And the market will adjust prices accordingly. This will favor companies that have been more favorably prices as they will have more access to capital and penalize companies unfairly biased downwards. To some extent this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Soros calls this the manipulative function\u00b3.", "c) The continuous interaction between the participants and reality reflects this cyclical effort to both understand and shape reality.", "A very similar phenomenon can be said about political surveys and polls. An \u201cimperfect poll\u201d published by CNN or Fox is not just a snapshot of the underlying sentiments \u2014 it also affects them!", "Let us illustrate with a contemporary issue why this is also very relevant for our Data to Action framework: fake news and fake accounts have had a significant impact on a number of elections around the world. Beyond just affecting opinions, a number of these fake accounts created Facebook pages organizing demonstrations on a variety of controversial topics- often based on fake news- to which real co-hosts were enlisted unwittingly and organized the events. So \u201cfictional people\u201d have organized real events attended by real people whose emotions have been stoked by \u201cfictional news\u201d! So to demonstrate further how the lines between reality and fiction can be blurred in that case, imagine the following scenario:", "In a certain town, a survey shows that 5% of people believe in issue X. A fake account creates a demonstration based on fake news to promote issue x, enlists real co-hosts that start organizing rallies in town. A new survey now shows 10% of the town behind issue X \u2026 what % (5% or 10%) would you say represents the real sentiment of the town on issue X? To be honest I don\u2019t have a good answer myself \u2014 but the example illustrates how we can not disentangle the dynamic closed loop: reality \u2192 opinion \u2192 action \u2192reality", "So now that we have, at least conceptually, closed the loop, we have established that", "So what are we to do? I do want to conclude on a positive note. I don\u2019t think what I am driving towards is to give up, but rather to be aware of the uncertainties in the flow and have the right dose of skepticism. This is what will continue to differentiate us humans from A.I. : An AI is objective by nature \u2014 it is unencumbered by values and cultural norms and therefore should be able to reach unbiased conclusions (e.g. based on probabilities of outcome). The imperfections are not a glitch in our software but rather a feature of what makes us human.", "There is a strong belief in certain powerful circles that \u201cthe answer is in the data\u201d. I hope that with the above illustrations I have contributed to dispel that myth. As a data enthusiast myself, I do believe data is a very important piece of a larger puzzle that needs to include many other disciplines for decision making, including domain specific expertise(s) but also philosophy, ethics as well as history. Even in the face of uncertainty, we can still chose our actions wisely.", "I will now close the loop and illustrate with Climate Change again. While the facts and data are often undisputed, there is no full consensus in the scientific community on the causal relationships (e.g. is this the cause of human action?) and the forecasting models (i.e. how fast will the impact happen?), as these are higher level order and less open to falsification. That being said, I believe that this uncertainty does imply a certain course of action: even if we assign a small likelihood to the probability of the pessimistic models being right, the precautionary principle implies that we cannot afford not to do anything, because the cost of failure is way too high.", "1 For example, very recently I came across this reading Killing Commendatore, Haruki Murakami\u2019s latest book \u201cThe objective does not necessarily surpass the subjective, you know. Reality does not necessarily extinguish fantasy.\u201d", "2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration", "3 Reflexivity is inconsistent with general equilibrium theory, which stipulates that markets move towards equilibrium and that non-equilibrium fluctuations are merely random noise that will soon be corrected. In equilibrium theory, prices in the long run at equilibrium reflect the underlying economic fundamentals, which are unaffected by prices. Reflexivity asserts that prices do in fact influence the fundamentals and that these newly influenced set of fundamentals then proceed to change expectations, thus influencing prices; the process continues in a self-reinforcing pattern. Because the pattern is self-reinforcing, markets tend towards disequilibrium", "Your home for data science.
