Back in the 1940s McCulloch and Pitts introduced the Neuron[1] and in 1950s the first Perceptron by Frank Rosenbolt was introduced[2]. The neural networks were with us since the 1940s but, the field faced ups and downs due to lack of practical implementation. The recent growth in the practice of deep learning techniques involving a variety of neural network architectures is because of two major advances, first, computation power (High-performance CPUs and GPUs), and second, amount of data available.", "Geoff Hinton and two of his graduate students showed that how one could take a very large dataset called ImageNet, with 10,000 categories and 10 million images, and reduce the classification error by 20 percent using deep learning. This happened back in 2012 at the NIPS meeting which was remarkable as Terrence Sejnowski says,", "Traditionally on that dataset(ImageNet), error decreases by less than 1 percent in one year. In one year, 20 years of research was bypassed. That really opened the floodgates. \u2014 In an interview at The Verge.", "This was the moment when the \u201cDeep Learning-buzz\u201d started. Artificial Intelligence grew from this point.", "ANNs consist of a large number of simple interconnected processing elements. These elements operate in parallel, whose function is determined by network structure, connection strengths, and the processing performed at computing elements or nodes. The growth of interest in deep learning was partly due to the failures of traditional programming techniques in \u201chard\u201d tasks such as machine vision, continuous speech recognition, and machine learning.", "There have been significant demonstrations of neural network capabilities in vision, speech, signal processing, and robotics. The variety of problems addressed by neural networks is impressive. There have been recent breakthroughs in tasks such as Image Classification, Object Detection, Text Generation, Image Captioning, Language Translation, GANs, etc.", "The hot research area of the neural network is growing fast and in a wide range due to its effectiveness and availability of high performing processors(GPUs, TPUs). Recent advancements in cloud technologies such as AWS, Google Cloud, etc. also contribute to better research. However, deep learning often faces the problem of scaling, and real-world problems. (discussion about the problems is beyond the scope of this post)", "Function Approximation is describing the behavior of complex function by ensembles of simpler functions. The methods included polynomial approximation by Gauss, series expansion to compute an approximation of a function around the operating point, like the Taylor Series, and many more.", "Neural Networks are function approximation machines that achieve generalization statistically.", "Feedforward neural networks provide a universal approximation framework, The Universal Approximation Theorem,", "The universal approximation theorem, in one of its most general versions, says that if we consider only continuous activation functions \u03c3, then a standard feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is able to approximate any continuous multivariate function f to any given approximation threshold \u03b5, if and only if \u03c3 is non-polynomial.[3]", "The feedforward networks provide a universal system for representing functions in the sense that, given a function, there exists a feedforward network that approximates the function. This says that there exists a large network that approximates the function under consideration, but it does not answer, exactly how large?", "In short, a feedforward neural network with a single layer is su\ufb03cient to represent any function, but the layer may be quite large and may fail to generalize correctly.", "As an example of a function approximation, I took the well-known sine, cosine functions, and a custom function. The range of data points, [-3,3] makes the function plots look as follows,", "Further approximating these functions with the neural network of architecture,", "The approximated functions based upon neural network's optimization results below function plots,", "The above illustrations show with a correct set of parameters neural network almost fits the original function. Everything seems perfect, then what could possibly go wrong?", "Yes, our neural network overfits! The error on the training set is driven to a very small value, but when new data is presented to the network the error is large. The network has memorized the training examples, but it has not learned to generalize to new situations. This must be avoided. We can have a look over another custom function with the same neural network architecture.", "These were some of the attempts to understand the basics of the universal approximation power of neural networks, which makes possible the deep learning field to be effective on a wide range of tasks. Finally, we summarize the above as follows:", "One can observe changing the neural architecture and parameters affects the results by experimenting themselves in the notebook with code, for the above plots here.", "[1]McCulloch, W.
