The process included more debug cycles than I care to admit, partly because of growing code complexity and evolving requirements, and partly because I could have planned and executed more effectively.", "After some reflection, here are some key lessons from that experience, which can help you write software more effectively as a data scientist.", "When I started my project, I dove into coding with limited upfront planning, thinking that the exact details of my software design would become clearer as I coded.", "As my code became more complex, I started losing track of how all my functions fit together. When requirements changed, I had to reinvest time into understanding my code to make desired modifications.", "Avoiding this pitfall takes relatively little effort. Have a simple, but clear picture of what your software does at a high-level, whether you draw out a diagram or take notes on your software\u2019s design and functions. Keeping a sketch with pen-and-paper and boxes and arrows would suffice. I personally wrote bullets on a working document that I could constantly modify.", "There are several advantages to keeping a design map. For one, documenting your software design will give you a clearer idea of how all your code pieces fit together. Verbalizing the logic of your data manipulations can help you sense check that your logic will give you your intended result. And of course, having a clear reference becomes extremely handy when you need to make bigger changes to the design of your code.", "Between multiple scripts and Excel files, I grossly underestimated the number of files that I would be navigating throughout my project. When my ad-hoc file naming system eventually failed, I found myself re-writing several functions because I couldn\u2019t find the original files in which I\u2019d written them.", "Investing in your organization will inevitably reduce stress down the line, and improve long-term efficiency. Before starting a project, it\u2019s helpful to invest some upfront effort to define a clear, maintainable file organization and naming system.", "Some basics guidelines would be to have:", "Beyond that, I found it helpful to use version tags and date tags on code and data files (v2-file-2020-08-03), to make it easier to navigate by chronology.", "Debugging was the most painful part of my programming project by far. This pain often stemmed narrowing down the location of bugs. One lesson I learned was to validate regularly at each transformation step, to ensure that any data processing result had values and dimensions I expected.", "This allowed me to catch unexpected behavior early on and allowed me to be confident about data at each step.", "A couple of basic checks that I regularly used:", "To increase efficiency and repeat keystrokes, I would think about ways to automate validation, either through by creating simple validation functions or Excel templates. For me, time invested in automating validation easily paid itself off tenfold.", "When errors arise, debugging by following your instincts can sometimes pay off. But without a plan, this approach can be arbitrary and frustrating. In the long-term, following a methodical debugging procedure is a more effective strategy.", "Building a system in which you narrow down sources of error and document attempted solutions can help you more effectively circle in on a solution. Moreover, this keeps stress at bay, allowing you to focus on debugging with an organized and calm mind.", "At a high-level, I think a system should involve understanding the error message, developing context around the bug, and testing and documenting solutions in an organized fashion. In this system, you get more control over your debugging process, a reference document for future debugging cycles, and significant reduction in stress in exchange for a small additional investment in time and effort. The procedure that I\u2019ve been using is:", "1. If there is an error message, read it carefully and look it up; if not, describe the unexpected behavior in writing", "2. Narrow down the location of the offending code by inserting manual tests", "3. Once you\u2019ve identified where the error occurs, check the structure, format, and values of the data entering your offending code \u2014 usually this will lead to a solution", "5. If the error persists, research the error further and test again", "6. If the error persists, ask for debugging help", "While your system might be different, I think the core principles will be the same: understand your error, locate the bug, investigate obvious sources of error, and test and document.", "In the course of my project, I caught myself debugging the same problem several times, which was an inefficient use of time.", "To avoid solving the same problem twice, I started maintaining a document of bugs that I ran into, along with their solutions. This reference also has a preventative benefit, allowing me to keep track of common bugs and avoid making those mistakes in the first place.", "I suggest keeping your solution document simple; you can keep track of each error you face in a spreadsheet \u2014 mine only has four columns: error, context, solution, and notes for next time.", "I\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way in the course of this project, and hope that this post can save you some stress and time in your next software endeavor.
