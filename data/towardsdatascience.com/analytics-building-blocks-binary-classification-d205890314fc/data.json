The feedback on my regression notebook was a great motivation to publish the classification notebook. If you have already used the regression notebook, you can scroll to the bottom and access this notebook from my GitHub repo as the structure remains the same. If not, please read on\u2026", "This article summarizes and explains key modules of my classification block (One of the simple modularized notebooks I am developing to execute common analysis tasks). The notebook is intended to facilitate quicker experimentation for users with a moderate understanding of classification models and Python programming. However, this time I have included some of the other great articles to give the users prior knowledge about the topic. GitHub link to the notebook is at the bottom of the article!", "Similar to the regression problems classification is one of the classic problems in analytics. Any classification can be converted to a regression problem by predicting the probability of belonging to a certain class for the data, but we will not get into that for the time being. Here goes my standard motive for sharing creating these notebooks: Many times while performing an analytics task, it is good to fail fast by testing different model forms to determine the most suitable model which provides a good balance of accuracy, complexity and execution efficiency based on the problem at hand. Some of the software such as RapidMiner provide this functionality. However, using a software product for this purpose results in a black-box approach in terms of tuning the model and exploring some of the intricacies. Hence I decided to create a simple python script with just-enough modularization and parameterization to enable testing and tuning many of the widely used classification algorithms with minimal changes in the code.The summary of this notebook is as follows:", "To test, tune and compare various classification models with minimal manual intervention in Python.The models included in this module are:", "The user should have an intuitive understanding of how each of these algorithms works along with a good understanding of how changing a particular hyper-parameter might impact the outcome. Basic understanding of python is required to be able to effectively utilize the code and further customize it based on requirements.", "Although, I am including links to a few great articles to understand the basics of these algorithms:", "Below are the key inputs (More details are provided for each input in the inline comments). These sections have been highlighted in the code with a note \u2018MAKE MODIFICATIONS HERE\u2019:", "After taking these inputs, the following actions are performed for each model form under consideration:", "* Forward feature selection* Normalization* Grid search for hyper-parameter tuning* Metric calculation for the best model", "A pandas data frame \u2018results\u2019 is created which provides the following metrics for each of the models you are testing for label 1. You might need to adjust your input data based on which class is more important to your analysis based on context.", "This table helps in comparing various model forms. The precision and recall metrics can be helpful in choosing a model which is more aligned with the business objective rather than just accuracy.", "This module in no way deals with feature engineering and only performs feature selection based on the input data. It is highly important to perform effective feature engineering in order to improve results with any model. A user might observe one of the model forms giving better results than the other however overall performance of any model can be improved significantly with improvement in predictor variables.", "The first function creates the pipeline for normalization and grid search based on conditions specified by the user in the control panel.", "The second function performs forward feature selection and returns the indices of best features.", "This function performs grid search for the provided parameter grid and returns the best model object.", "The last function calculates all the relevant metrics for the best hyper-parameter combination and returns a pandas series of these metrics.", "This is the global dictionary for various model parameters for all the models in this module. Some default set of values have been populated in the code for typical ranges based on the cancer dataset. This dictionary contains some of the key hyper-parameters for each model and it is not exhaustive. Users are encouraged to visit scikit-learn documentation to get a list of all the parameters and add to the below dictionary according to their requirements.", "The inputs to the modules can be changed here. This is the control panel for this script where all the variables mentioned in the introduction can be altered to test various scenarios. Please refer to the comments to understand the variables.", "This section iteratively finds the best set of the hyperparameters for each of the model specified by the user, calculates the metrics and populates results table for further analysis/experimentation.", "In the case of the cancer patient detection, it would be very important to detect all the patients, in formal terms, to have the recall as high as possible for our model. From the above graph, we can observe that there are 3 models which are able to achieve perfect recall: Ridge classifier, logistic regression and support vector machine. In this scenario, the best way forward would be to pick the model with the highest accuracy among these models which is SVM.", "Similar to the example in regression notebook, the simpler models such as logistic regression and ridge classifier perform better than ensemble models.", "I hope this module enables faster experimentation and provides an opportunity to build further customizations on top of it based on your needs!", "Your home for data science.
