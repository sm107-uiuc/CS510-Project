While the numerous email clients out there today go to great lengths to make life easier in this regard, it could be really useful if one could perform email-related tasks in a programmatic manner. Let us consider a scenario where this approach can come in handy \u2014 email clutter. Now, it can be argued that the internet is awash with advice on how to reduce email clutter. While all these tips can potentially help you use your email more efficiently going forward, what if currently, your inbox has reached a point of no return, where it is nearly impossible to clean things up manually? A classic case in point \u2014 my wife\u2019s inbox has over 35000 emails from over 300 different senders. She is positive that most of these are marketing related, but feels, and rightly so, that it is way too much of an effort to individually unsubscribe to these emails. The first part of this post deals with this issue and explains how to send, retrieve, categorize, delete and unsubscribe to emails using python\u2019s imapclient and smtplib libraries.", "On the other hand, let us assume you are an email organizing ninja who is in total control of your inbox and meticulously labels and files every single message. You might be interested in some statistics about your emails like who emails you the most, what does your traffic look like or what your typical email response times are. The second part of this post is meant exactly for this, demonstrating how to analyze email data using Pandas and create visualization tools using Matplotlib", "Note that although Gmail is used here to illustrate the various concepts, the code can be made to work with any email client with some minor modifications since only general Python libraries are used for the most part rather than client specific APIs. Also, remember that the tutorials shown here represent only a fraction of what can be achieved with these Python email libraries. So I strongly encourage you to use this as a starting point and then extend it to suit your requirements. We will only look at the key code snippets needed to get this project running. You can find the full code in my GitHub repository.", "Before using Python to access your email, you will need to change your google account setting to allow access to less secure apps. Otherwise, google will block your code\u2019s attempt to sign in to the account. Now, for security reasons, I recommend changing this setting back to its default state once you\u2019re done running the code.", "Once this is done, we can log in to the server using the account\u2019s username and password. It is always good practice to accept your username and password as user inputs during runtime rather than hard coding them in.", "IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a standard protocol that specifies how to communicate with an email server to retrieve messages. It is defined by RFC3501. Imapclient is a pythonic third party library which uses python\u2019s standard imaplib library underneath, but provides a cleaner and easier to use API, especially in reference to parsing and error handling. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and Smtplib are equivalents of IMAP and Imapclient for sending messages.", "After importing these libraries, we connect to the servers and create an IMAP object and an SMTP object. The server names used here are different for different email services. We enable the secure socket layer (SSL) encryption for IMAP and the transport layer security (TLS) encryption for SMTP, as required by many providers. Again, the type of encryption and port number depends on the provider.", "We might wish to perform the search operation on multiple folders. To do this, let us first get the list of available folders.", "We use the pprint module to make the folder list look more readable. You can see here that both user created folders and Gmail\u2019s own folders (technically, labels) are displayed. You can choose to loop through multiple folders to search emails, but for this tutorial, only the Inbox folder is used.", "Here, we first tell Python to increase the memory allocation from a default value 10,000 bytes to 10,000,000 bytes. Without this in place, in case our search returns a large number of emails, Python might raise an exception. Note that the _MAXLINE command belongs to the Imaplib library rather than the Imapclient library. In the next line, we select the folder we want to search using the select_folder() method. Setting the readonly keyword to true prevents messages in this folder from getting accidently deleted.", "We then search for emails within a time range of four months. The search() method takes in a large variety of search keys that let you search by sender, receiver, subject or body content, seen, unseen, answered or unanswered flags, etc. For example, to search for messages from a particular sender, the search key would be [\u2018FROM\u2019, \u2018sender@example.com\u2019]. The documentation for the IMAPClient class contains more information about this.", "The results of the search are stored in the UIDs variable, which is a list of unique integer IDs for each email matching the search criteria. This ID will later be used to retrieve the corresponding message.", "Once we have a list of UIDs, we categorize the messages based on their labels using the get_gmail_labels() method. Note that this particular method is specific to Gmail. To implement this in other email clients, I suggest looping through the list of folders obtained previously and categorizing based on that. The categorization used here is completely arbitrary and is primarily to illustrate the process. For instance, a single message can be assigned all three labels \u2014 \u2018starred\u2019, \u2018important\u2019 and \u2018inbox\u2019. The code here would put that message into the \u2018starred\u2019 category.", "There is quite a lot going on in this snippet. First, we create several lists that will be used to hold the different attributes of the email. Then, we loop over the list of UIDs and using the fetch() method, retrieve the body of the message corresponding to a particular ID. When we use pprint() to print the contents of raw_message, it looks something like this.", "We can see that this prints out a nested dictionary and that the contents of the \u2018Body[]\u2019 key are in a pretty obscure format. It actually, is in the RFC 822 format, meant for IMAP servers. Another module pyzmail \u2014 can be used to parse these raw messages and convert them to PyzMessage objects from which fields like \u2018from\u2019, \u2018to\u2019, \u2018subject\u2019, \u2018body\u2019, etc. can be easily obtained. Pyzmail is a high level library that can parse the email messages downloaded by imapclient and convert them to simple string values. It essentially masks the rather complex MIME structure and encoding/decoding.", "Keep in mind that the date might be formatted slightly differently in some messages. You will need to write appropriate code if you wish to separate it out into day, year, time, etc. The get_decoded_header() method is particularly useful here as it can be used to extract information from any of the message\u2019s headers. To understand what exactly is going on here, we display the original contents of the email as shown below.", "These are the headers that the get_decoded_header() method is accessing. For instance, get_decoded_header(\u2018Subject\u2019) would yield the same output as get_subject(). We store all these different attributes in lists in order to use them for our analytics code later on.", "A note on the List-Unsubscribe header \u2014 it is considered good email practice to include this header and make unsubscribing easy and a one-click process, but it might not be present in all of the messages. If the link is absent, the logic presented here will not work. This is a great article that explains more about this. Our intent here is to extract the unsubscribe links and later on, use the information in this to automatically unsubscribe from unnecessary emails. We are concerned only with unsubscribe links that have an address to which the unsubscribe email needs to be sent to and not the ones with an http link that needs to be clicked to unsubscribe.", "Finally, keep in mind that retrieving messages and extracting the different attributes is not a superfast process. It takes about 2\u20133 minutes to process about 1000 messages.", "Once we have extracted the various email attributes, we can then proceed to deleting multiple messages or unsubscribing from mailing lists based on one or more conditions that we can build using these attributes. For example, we may choose to delete all messages received in the past six months, or unsubscribe to emails from a particular sender or emails containing a particular word in their subject.", "In the code snippet above, we search the inbox for all messages with the word \u2018Best Buy\u2019 in the subject and obtain their unique IDs. We then tag all these messages with \\Deleted using the delete_messages() method and delete them using the expunge() method. Note that some clients delete messages without waiting for the expunge() call. Due to the way Gmail\u2019s labels are set up, things are a little different here. We add the label \\Trash to the messages to move them to the trash folder immediately. If we follow the previous method, the messages are archived, but not deleted.", "Auto-unsubscribing needs some additional code since it involves sending an email to the address extracted from the unsubscribe link. Some parsing work will have to be done to extract the address from the \u2018mailto\u2019 section of the link and the subject from the \u2018Subject\u2019 section if applicable. Specifically, it shows how to extract relevant information from the unsubscribe link.", "You can see that the unsubscribe link is in the html format. Therefore, Python\u2019s urllib module and re module are used to separate out the address and subject from it. Once we have this, we can use the smtplib module to send out the unsubscribe email.", "Let us go over this code snippet. First, the email library \u2014 the MIMEmultipart method allows us to construct a multipart message. We then loop over the UIDs list to find the unsubscribe link based on our search condition. In this example, we are trying to unsubscribe from Groupon emails. Once we have the address and the subject extracted from the unsubscribe link as explained previously, we create the message object and assign the \u2018to\u2019 and \u2018subject\u2019 attributes to it. Finally, we use the send_message method to send the unsubscribe email. If an empty dictionary is returned, it indicates a successful send and that there were no addresses to which the delivery of the email failed.", "Once we have completed the various email operations, we disconnect from the server. This is accomplished using the quit() method for the smtp object and using the logout() method for the imap object.", "In this section, we will use the Pandas and Matplotlib modules to analyze some statistics and visualize them. Before that, let us write the data we obtained in the previous section into an excel sheet. This might be useful if you want to perform any analysis outside Python. We will accomplish this using the openpyxl library as shown below.", "Here, we first create a workbook object followed by a worksheet object. Next, we write the various headers like date, time, sender, etc. into the first row of the sheet. Then, we populate the appropriate columns with the lists of email data from our previous section. Finally, we save the spreadsheet. If you would like to know more about using excel through Python, refer to these documentation pages that explain the modules used to read and write spreadsheets.", "Next, we use Pandas to read this excel sheet. Pandas is a powerful Python module that provides numerous tools for data analysis. It is often referred to as the SQL of the Python language. You can read more about it here", "The data variable here contains the DataFrame which is essentially a structure with two or more dimensions. The following code snippets that are fairly self explanatory show how to select, filter and print data from this structure.", "The last section of this tutorial shows how to use the matplotlib library to create some visualizations that help understand the data better. For this purpose, we are using a dataset comprising of over 3000 emails", "This plot shows us the distribution of total emails over the different days of the week. We see some signs of Monday blues here, then the email count more or less stabilizing over the next four days, and eventually tapering off during the weekend. The first line of the code here is used to arrange the various categories (days of the week) in the correct order. Without this, the alphabetical order will be used by default to sort the categories.", "In this plot, we are looking at the distribution of received emails over the course of a day. There seems to be a distinct peak at noon for some reason. In the code here, we first filter the emails by sent/received. We then extract the hour part of the timestamp before sorting.", "This bar chart shows the top twenty senders along with the number of emails from them in a specified time period. The value_counts() method is used to count the number of occurrences of a particular entry and the nlargest() method is used to output the entries with the largest number of occurrences. The tolist() method converts a data series into a list. Groupon seems to be the biggest offender here!", "This is a histogram showing the distribution of the number of words used in the subject of the email. It looks like about five to ten words is the preferred range here. To count the words, the subject string is split into a list of words and the length of this list is stored as a separate column in the data frame.", "5. Common words in subject lines", "This is an interesting bar chart that shows the words that commonly occur in the email subject lines. The code here is slightly involved. First, the words in the subject are separated using the split() method. It is a good idea to use the fillna() method to convert empty subject entries into the string \u2018none\u2019, as blank entries may create problems later on. Next, we convert the 2d list into a single list of lowercase words. For this analysis, we are not interested in common words such as \u2018the\u2019, \u2018is\u2019, etc. so we create an exception list using these words and also filter out any words with three or lesser letters. Finally, we separate out the words and their frequencies into two different lists, and plot them. The high occurrence words here indicate that most of the emails analyzed were marketing related.", "By now, we have a good understanding of how to perform email related tasks using Python, analyze email statistics using Pandas and visualize them using Matplotlib. These concepts can be extended to a variety of applications, including some that involve machine learning. Here are a few possible use cases:", "I am a vehicle dynamics simulation engineer at Rivian.
