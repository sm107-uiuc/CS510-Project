This happened to two of my childhood friends\u2019 dads within the short span of a few years. Both men seemed like loving parents and model citizens, so the news came as a big shock to me and to their respective communities. The same tragic story repeated with three of the main heroes of my adolescent years \u2014 Kurt Cobain, Robin Williams, and Anthony Bourdain. Over the years, I\u2019ve spent sleepless nights trying to figure out what could possibly push people, whom I loved and admired and who, at first sight, appeared to have successful and happy lives, towards such extremes. Driven by all of these unanswered questions, which have probably tortured anyone who has had a close encounter with a shocking suicide of a close friend, family member or star-idol, I decided to partner up with my classmate Brian Srebrenik and try to investigate the mystery of suicide with Data Science.", "The goal of this project was to build a Machine Learning supervised regression model using a number of socioeconomic and mental health metrics of 200 Countries and try to determine which factors might have a statistically significant correlation with National Suicide Rates.", "After doing some research into the previous work done on the subject, we collected data on the following independent variables which we believed would help to build our model. We used data for the year 2016.", "Note: If you are not interested in the technical details of how we built and optimized our model, please skip to the section \u201cModel summary and final insights and conclusions\u201d for a detailed summary of our findings.", "First, we gathered the data from the World Health Organization API and a few other sites with annual socioeconomic data for 2016. After cleaning all the data and merging it into one pd.DataFrame we checked for independent variable multicollinearity using a SeaBorn Correlation Heatmap:", "The heatmap informed us that Bipolar Disorder % has a very high correlation to three other mental health issues, so we decided to drop that variable before running our model to avoid extra noise caused by the heavy multicollinearity.", "Next, we created paired scatterplots of each independent variable\u2019s correlation to our dependent variable \u2014 Suicide Rate:", "From the graphs above we can see that there is a somewhat linear relationship between rates of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, alcohol use, and levels of Religiousness of a country. So, our initial expectations were that our Machine Learning model should be assigning more weight to some of these categories.", "Since some of our independent variables are measured in thousands and others are measured in percentages \u2014 we decided to scale all the independent variables to make sure our model doesn\u2019t assign coefficients that are disproportionately large for certain variables.", "The next step was to introduce interactive terms via a Polynomial function of a second degree, to help our model with Feature selection and boost its final prediction accuracy and reduce its Root Mean Squared Error. The Correlation Heatmap below helps us identify all the new variables that are correlated:", "Now that our data is clean, scaled and preprocessed it is time for the final step \u2014 training our Machine Learning model on our train data in order to improve its predictive accuracy on the test data. We used three model optimization sub-steps to create our own custom GridSearch function:", "The graph below shows our RMSE function and how we train our model to pick the number of independent variables that generate the lowest error:", "Now that most of the heavy work is done it is time to analyze our results. First, we plotted scatterplots with the model statistics for our Training Data versus our Test Data to ensure that there is not much train data bias or overfitting. As we can see from the graphs below the RMSE, z_scores, and R_squared of the test and train samples are pretty similar, which is what we were hoping for. The R_squared score of 0.66 is not amazing, but given that we only had about 150\u2013200 examples (Countries), we\u2019re pretty happy with the model performance. We\u2019re confident that if we could feed 500+ observations into our training set, the model\u2019s predictive accuracy will improve significantly.", "We also wanted to look at the actual independent variables and their coefficients and try to draw some insights and conclusions from their distribution. Below is the final model equation and a bar-chart of each independent variable and their weight on the final model:", "From the equation coefficients and the bar chart below we can posit the following hypothesis that can be tested further:", "2. Variables which tend to decrease a country\u2019s Suicide Rate:", "I was really intrigued and surprised to find out that our model put a lot of weight on the level of religiousness of a country when it comes to its effect on suicide rates. If we look closely at the coefficients chart above, we can see that most features that seem to have a very strong direct effect on high suicide rates such as Depression, Alcohol use and Schizophrenia, tend to lose their negative effect in countries with highly religious populations. This interesting phenomenon is demonstrated in the two graphs below:", "Even though we didn\u2019t analyze enough data to be able to make any strong conclusions, our findings provoked me to think about the topic a bit further and try to come up with valid explanation of how Religion can negate the effects of some of the factors that seem to cause high suicide rates such as Depression, Anxiety and Drug use. I did some research on the main symptoms of people suffering from Depression and suicidal thoughts listed below:", "How might Religion happen to counter those symptoms and act as a spiritual anti-depressant?", "So, intentionally or by sheer randomness of circumstances, Religion seems to act as a powerful anti-depressant, which can fill many of the emotional and social voids that people with depression and suicidal thoughts seem to experience. For me personally, this was the most interesting finding of our project and I can safely say that I will carry many of the other valuable lessons that I learned during this investigation and try to use them to help people in need in the future. I sincerely hope that this article will also reach many people across the world, who can benefit from our findings in one way or another!
