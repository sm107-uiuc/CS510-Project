Instead of looking for what companies wanted in their job postings, he wanted to know what data scientists in Singapore had done before they were hired for their current position? As a person hoping to enter this field, I am interested going back to the basic of what companies are looking for for their data scientists today in the city I live in: Vancouver.", "I have two reasons for looking into this: 1) I will soon be looking for data scientist positions in Vancouver, BC (selfish reason); 2) I am currently working as a teaching assistant for UBC\u2019s Masters of Data Science program (altruist reason). So, I wanted to see what positions most closely align with my current knowledge and skill-set, and also what are my current gaps based on the average data scientist job? And, I want to help these students prepare over their program to be ready to land a great job when they graduate.", "To do this, I turned to LinkedIn. Instead of looking at each posting individually or a sample of them, I wanted to look at all of the positions in Vancouver. So, I turned to web scraping LinkedIn.", "As Hanif mentioned, the legality of web scraping LinkedIn is currently unconfirmed (although this likely just changed!). The job postings are all publicly available (they\u2019re trying to hire somebody after all), but using a scraping program on their site puts you in violation of their terms of service. If you are going to try to modify or reproduce this code, please do so with caution. To do this, I used both selenium and BeautifulSoup. For the full code, see the Github repository.", "1. Compile list of all relevant postings", "As of writing, there are 133 postings that fit my criteria. LinkedIn actually shows different web page setups depending on the browser. With Chrome, there is an infinite scroll with a button to show more postings. After loading the page I set it to click that button multiple times until it doesn\u2019t appear. Then, all the links are available on the side", "This part involves checking the html of an example job posting to get the proper HTML tags. The job title is stored under the h1, the company under the class_name topcard__org-name-link, and the bulk of the info under the section with class_name \u201cdescription\u201d. I store each of these in a dictionary and append it to a list before visiting the next page.", "3. Clean and compile data together", "This part is a pain and required a lot of trial and error. I finally, got it to work by searching for strings where the next text element is the start of a list as is common in job postings. Most have 1\u20133 sections that I categorize as \u2018requirements\u2019, \u2018assets\u2019, and \u2018responsibilities\u2019. Separating between the requirements and assets is important to fill in the gaps you need and to see what can set you apart.", "Then I worked on searching for keywords in each job description section. I based on my previous knowledge would be important, or from looking through a few of the postings (I wasn\u2019t originally going to include C++ for example, but it shows up in this excerpt for a job with Amazon so I wondered how common this was). I also had to be creative with some of the keywords to get the correct usage of it (e.g., \u2018MS\u2019 is often used as a shorthand for a Master\u2019s of Science, but is also the ending of a lot of plural words like \u2018programs\u2019, \u2018aims\u2019, and \u2018teams\u2019.).", "Now that the data is cleaned, we can see what we find.", "Finding 1: Graduate education is common", "Some form of university education appears in nearly 50 of the postings, with 33 of these being in reference to a requirement for graduate education (master\u2019s or PhD). Most of these educational requirements are listed in the \u2018requirements\u2019 section with specialties or majors often included as assets.", "What these numbers do show is the flip-side of this education in a field as new as data science. Degree programs in data science specifically at universities and colleges are starting to pop up more and more, and there is obviously a ton of bootcamps and online courses that cover similar material. That many jobs don\u2019t list even a bachelor degree as a requirement may be a sign that they\u2019re more interested in your knowledge in this specific area without needing a degree to back it up.", "SQL was the most commonly mentioned language across the job postings (64; requirements and assets together). Python came next (54), with R quite far behind (19). Other programming languages also appear, but likely in more niche roles that would require high performance C++ code for instance.", "Apart from some of the main programming languages, some softwares and services also appear in a lot of postings. Spark tops the list with Tableau coming in a close second, both with over two appearances.", "Finding 3: Niche knowledge for niche jobs", "Some of the things that data scientist bootcamps and courses stress a lot of only appear in a small handful of posting. Neural networks (including CNN and RNN) are only explicitly listed in 4 postings. Natural language processing (NLP) is only listed in 9. If these are areas you really want to get into, they will obviously be required for these specialized data scientist positions, but it appears most job postings are for a more \u2018generalist\u2019 data scientist position. (For more on this, check out this podcast episode I liked on the topic of the specialist versus generalist debate in data science).", "While this isn\u2019t to discount the usefulness of these methods, nor that they might come up in interviews, it\u2019s not what companies are leading with for most of their postings.", "Knowledge is power. And data scientist jobs are no exception. While you may be expected to perform the analysis, lots of jobs want you to know the theory behind it as well to make sure you\u2019re applying the right kinds of methods and techniques when they\u2019re appropriate.", "I was interested to see what the whole population of data science jobs (in Vancouver, BC) at least looks like. The findings might not be too surprising, but it does show the overall landscape and where you might need to fill in the gaps in your knowledge to get yourself job market ready.", "Did I miss anything you\u2019d be interested in? Comment below, send me a message or feel free to explore for yourself here.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Currently a PhD student at the University of British Columbia looking to transition into a data science role."], "all_outgoing_urls":
