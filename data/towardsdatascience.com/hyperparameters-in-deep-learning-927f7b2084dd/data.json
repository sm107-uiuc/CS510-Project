Your ears, fingers and eyes are all learning the guitar. Getting use to of the guitar sounding out of tone is like creating a bad habit, a habit that will spoil your entire experience of falling in love with guitar learning process.", "Tuning your guitar can really assist you in the process of falling in love with guitar. So is the case with hyperparameter tuning for Machine Learning & Deep Learning", "Hyperparameters are varaibles that we need to set before applying a learning algorithm to a dataset.", "The challenge with hyperparameters is that there are no magic number that works everywhere. The best numbers depend on each task and each dataset", "Hyperparameters can be divided into 2 categories:", "They are related more to the optimization and training process", "The single most important hyperparameter and one should always make sure that has been tuned \u2014 Yoshua Bengio", "If our learning rate is too small than optimal value then it would take a much longer time (hundreds or thousands) of epochs to reach the ideal state", "If our learning rate is too large than optimal value then it would overshoot the ideal state and our algorithm might not converge", "This is just an illustration. In real world things are much more complex.", "a) your model will have have hundreds and thousands of parameters each with its own error curve. And learning rate has to shepherd all of them", "b) Error curves are not clean u-shapes. they have more complex shapes with local minima", "Batch size has an effect on the resource requirements of the training process, speed and number of iterations in a way that might not be as trivial you think", "Historically, there has been a debate to do Stochastic training where you fit a single example of the dataset to the model and using only one example, do a forward pass, calculate the error and then backpropagate and set adjusted values for all your hyperparameters. And then do this again for each example in the dataset.", "Or, it was better to feed the entire data to the training step and calculate the gradient using the error generated by looking at all the examples in the dataset. This is called Batch Training", "Commonly used technique today is to set a minibatch size.", "Stochastic Training is when the minibatch size =1 and Batch Training is when the minibatch size = Number of examples in the training set", "Recommended starting values for your experimentation", "A larger minibatch size allows computational boosts that utilizes matrix multiplication in the training calculations but that comes at the expense of needing more memory for the training process.", "A smaller minibatch size induces more noise in their error calculations and often more useful in preventing the training process from stopping at local minima.", "Good value for minibatch size= 32", "So, while the computational boost incentivizes us to increase the minibatch size, this practical algorithmic benefit incentivizes us to actually make it smaller", "To choose the right number of epochs for our training step, the metric we should have our eye on is the Validation Error.", "Intuitive manual way is to have the model train for as many number of iterations as long as validation error keeps decreasing.", "There\u2019s a technique called Early Stopping to determine when to stop training the model. Stopping the training process if the validation error has not improved in the past 10 or 20 epochs", "They are more involved in the structure of the model", "Number of hidden units is one of the most mysterious hyperparameter amongst all.", "Neural Networks are universal function approximator and for network to learn to approximate a function (or a prediction task) it needs to have enough \u2018capacity \u2019 to learn the function", "The number of the hidden units is the main measure of model\u2019s learning capacity", "For a simple function, it might need fewer number of hidden units.", "The more complex the function, the more learning capacity the model will need", "Slightly more number of units then optimal number is not a problem, but a much larger number will lead to the model overfitting i.e. If you provide a model with too much capacity, it might tend to overfit and just try to memorize the dataset.", "Another heuristics involving the first hidden layer is that setting the number of hidden units larger than the number of inputs has been observed to give better results in number of tasks.", "Andrej Karpathy tells us in his blog that in practice it\u2019s often the case that 3 layer Neural Net will outperform a 2 layer one.
