By working exclusively on research projects, I managed to scrape by and developed models and software for studying cancer. I hope to share some of the things I have learned and mistakes I\u2019ve made along the way as I finish my training.", "The question of \u201cWhere should I start?\u201d on getting started in data science is something I get asked a lot from people who want to transition careers. Let\u2019s walk through and evaluate some popular starting points.", "There\u2019s an ongoing debate on the best language to learn for getting started in data science.", "Python is the one I hear the most because of its general-use, human-readable syntax, and its established data science community.", "However, learning Python, while not that difficult, still has a non-negligible learning curve to overcome. Additionally, the computer science and statistics topics you need to tackle on add more friction to your learning journey. For these reasons, I wouldn\u2019t start with Python as a fledgling data scientist.", "R is another appealing language to learn, especially for its state-of-the-art mathematical and statistical modeling packages. But I would not recommend a beginner to start with R either for the same reasons as Python.", "Julia is a relatively new language that combines the best of Python\u2019s ease-of-use and computation of C++. Additionally, becoming an expert in Julia is a great opportunity to become a Julia expert and build new cool things. However, that also means there are fewer resources, support, and pre-built packages for software related to data science.", "These arguments beg the question: what language should I start with to learn data science?", "In my graduate research, I got started learning Python and MATLAB. This was mainly because I needed to use software built on both languages. Looking back, I found that the language that accelerated my data science learning the most was MATLAB.", "While I wouldn\u2019t consider MATLAB to be a general-purpose programming language, I argue it should be a starting point to learn data science because:", "As a data scientist, you will be using linear algebra to analyze large datasets with many attributes and samples. Other programming languages can perform linear algebra operations as well, if not better than MATLAB. However, MATLAB\u2019s syntax is much more identical to standard linear algebra notation, which can drive home the core concepts better.", "Let\u2019s take the example of a simple operation: the dot product between two matrices A and B. We will compare the syntax in Python, R, and MATLAB.", "Seems simple, but we still have to use NumPy data objects and methods for the dot product.", "Let\u2019s now consider the R implementation:", "Again, we need to load up the geometry library and deal with the less-intuitive R syntax, which can be confusing to a beginner.", "Let\u2019s now consider MATLAB\u2019s implementation of the dot product:", "MATLAB automatically knows how to construct a matrix, and visually, this looks more like what you would see in a linear algebra textbook.", "Additionally, many linear algebra operations are built into MATLAB\u2019s basic functionality because it is a language that was built for mathematical modeling and engineering.", "MATLAB\u2019s ease-of-use and similarity to standard linear algebra notation can be helpful to learn the fundamental mathematical concepts you will encounter in your data science career.", "While it\u2019s possible to run MATLAB using the command line, it comes with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing software, testing code, and debugging.", "In recent versions of MATLAB, interactive plots can be generated in a script or in a notebook, which can facilitate on-the-fly data analysis. We\u2019ll take the simple example of generating a scatter plot from two vectors.", "And below is the resulting scatterplot.", "In MATLAB, I clicked on the two center data points to show their x- and y-coordinates. If we wanted to add more complexity, such as additional attributes associated with each data point (for example, Person A and Person B), this text would show up in those data points as well.", "Interactive plots are possible in Python and R using libraries such as Plotly and Dash, and the plots you can make are beautiful. However, there is some learning you would need to do to format the data in a compatible way and design these plots.", "MATLAB\u2019s plots are not the prettiest, but the interactivity and simplicity in coding up these plots can facilitate complex data analysis, especially for a beginner.", "MATLAB has additional software that enables model training, such as the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. This extension allows the user to perform standard statistical procedures and train simple machine learning models.", "To demonstrate how simple it is to prototype a machine learning model in MATLAB, let\u2019s train a random forest model on the Cars dataset to predict fuel economy.", "With less than 4 lines of code written, we can easily train a machine learning model. Additional functions are built in to help visualize and evaluate the model results.", "Deep Learning applications are being built to solve real-world problems, and now is a great time to learn about these complex algorithms. MATLAB has developed the Deep Learning Toolbox, allowing us to train deep neural networks on image, text, and numerical data.", "I am writing a series of articles for using the Deep Learning Toolbox if you want to get started on deep learning.", "While MATLAB can be useful for learning data science, it does have the following limitations that prevent it from becoming the primary language for data science:", "These days, I still use MATLAB, but only for quick prototyping and running applications specific to my graduate research. Once I mastered the basics, I found myself working on developing Python applications and performing more complex analyses in R.", "However, learning data science in MATLAB served as an excellent foundation for my research, and hopefully can be the tool that gets you started in your data science journey.", "If you want to share your perspectives about how you got started in data science or helpful tools to start learning, leave a response in the comments below.", "Additionally, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn \u2014 I\u2019d love to connect with you and discuss all things nerdy!", "Your home for data science.
