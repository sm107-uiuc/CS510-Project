I have bolded the phrases that should probably require some explanation for the average reader.", "We introduce and analyze a natural algorithm for multi-venue exploration from censored data, which is motivated by the Dark Pool Problem of modern quantitative finance. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time to a near-optimal allocation policy; prior results for similar problems in stochastic inventory control guaranteed only asymptotic convergence and examined variants in which each venue could be treated independently. Our analysis bears a strong resemblance to that of efficient exploration / exploitation schemes in the reinforcement learning literature. We describe an extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm on the Dark Pool Problem using real trading data.", "Dark pools are a type of stock exchange in which information about outstanding orders is deliberately hidden in order to minimize the market impact of large-volume trades. That is to say, if someone who owns 30% of the total market capitalization of a company wanted to sell his share, it is likely that the very process of selling would be sufficient to disrupt market prices.", "That\u2019s just the basic demand-and-supply process : the sudden arrival of such a huge amount of stocks on the market would be similar to an increase in supply ; demand remaining more or less the same, prices would plummet. Thus, the seller would receive only a fraction of the market value his shares had before being sold. Hiding information about this outstanding order would prevent buyers\u2019 from noticing the sudden jump in supply, and enable the seller to get a price equal to the market value of his stocks before his trade. It is a voluntary case of asymmetry of information on a financial market.", "Dark pools are a recent type of stock exchange in which relatively little information is provided about the current outstanding orders.", "As of February 2020, there were more than 50 dark pools registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The success and proliferation of dark pools have created challenging and interesting problems in algorithmic trading, in particular, the problem of optimizing the allocation of a large trade over multiple competing dark pools : that is why the authors are talking about multi-venue exploration for finding an allocation policy for your trade (i.e., how many of your shares it is optimal to distribute on each of the venues).", "In the Dark Pool Problem, at each time step a trader must buy or sell up to V shares of a given stock, and does so by allocating them over multiple distinct exchanges (venues) known as dark pools.", "Censored data is a type of incomplete data where you only have information about the boundaries of a value. Example : you have a list of people. You also have their age for some of them, but for others you only know that they are between 20 and 30, or more than 50, or less than 18, etc. Be careful not to confuse censored data with truncated data : the latter occurs when values beyond a boundary are excluded, whether when gathered or when analyzed. For example, if someone was conducting a survey on middle-class workers, he would ask you if you make more than $100,000 ; if you answered \u201cyes\u201d (lucky you), he would then stop at that point : you\u2019ve been truncated.", "If v_i shares are allocated to dark pool i, and all of them are executed, the trader learns only that the liquidity available at exchange i was at least v_i, not the actual larger number that could have been executed there; this is why the data is considered censored.", "An algorithm is said to be of polynomial-time if its running time is upper bounded by a polynomial expression in the size n of the input for the algorithm, i.e., T(n) = O(n^k) for some positive constant k. Problems for which deterministic polynomial-time algorithms exist are considered easy and fast, in contrast to problems of exponential complexity, i.e., T(n) = O(e^n) or worse, which quickly become unfeasible when the data is too large.", "A near-optimal solution to a problem is obtained when finding the true solution is too hard and/or too costly, and one restricts the optimization problem to a class of potential solutions with interesting properties making the optimum easy to find (a convex class for example), or when one relies on numerical methods for finding a proxy to the solution.", "The aim of stochastic inventory control is to determine the optimal timing of issuing a replenishment order (and its corresponding quantity), subject to uncertainty of demand, by stochastic methods. Asymptotic convergence of a stochastic procedure means that performing a huge number of random estimations, will make the algorithm tend towards a finite value that is the solution to the problem. That will become clearer later.", "If we routinely allocate too-small volumes to a venue, we receive censored observations on sales and underutilize the venue; if we submit too-large volumes we receive uncensored (or direct) observations on sales in the venue, but have excess inventory.", "A recurrent financial problem for companies is to find an efficient exploration and exploitation scheme. Firms are engaged in new activities like research and at the same time in more routine ones like development and production. Thus, they should find a satisfying financial arrangement between exploration (uncertain but large future financial gains) and exploitation (certain, present but moderate financial gains).", "Its transposition in reinforcement learning is direct : the cost here is the running time of the algorithm, we\u2019d like the agent to find the best solution to a given problem as fast as possible ; however, in the meantime, committing to solutions too quickly without enough exploration of other potential strategies sounds pretty bad, as it could lead to local minima. Modern RL algorithms that optimize for the best returns can achieve good exploitation quite efficiently, while exploration remains more like an open topic. The efficient exploration of the action and state space is a crucial factor in the convergence rate of a learning scheme.", "A learning algorithm receives a sequence of total volumes V_1, V_2,\u2026 and must decide at each time step t how to distribute the V_t units across the venues.", "Congratulations !

The venue to which the next unit is allocated is chosen to maximize the estimated probability that the unit will be consumed; if v_i units have already been allocated to venue i, then the estimated probability that the next allocated unit will be consumed is simply the estimated tail probability of v_i + 1.", "It is important to notice here that the Greedy Algorithm is identical at every timestep. The tail probability estimates are considered to be given beforehand and don\u2019t change over time, there isn\u2019t any time component anywhere in the process.

The allocation returned by Greedy maximizes the expected number of units consumed in a single time step.", "While not all units are allocated, the greedy algorithm iteratively adds a unit to the venue whose tail probability of the total allocation augmented by one would be the highest.", "In order to understand the proof, you just have to note two things:", "Thus, we can say that at each step of the algorithm, the sum of maxima over all venues and all allocated units is equal to the global maximum of this sum (what would generally speaking not be true were the series not decreasing, since adding the local maximum at each step would not guarantee convergence to the global maximum).", "The figure above illustrates the process. At a given step, we have allocated a part of the V units on the K venues (area under the red curve) : in this example venue 1 has 4 units, venue 3 has 2 units... The sequential process guarantees that at every step, all items under the red curve have highest tail probability than all items above the curve. In order to choose which venue to allocate the next unit, welook at the tail probabilities and choose the venue where the estimated tail probability of an incrementation of 1 unit would be the highest (represented here by the white square).", "The output of the greedy algorithm is :", "We now want to prove that the expected number of consumed units is maximal for the greedy allocation. If it maximizes the expected number of units consumed at each venue, it also maximizes the overall expected number. Using the fact that tail probabilities at a level are defined as the sum of densities above this level, we can easily introduce telescopic sums that lead to the following result, for each venue i :", "Tadam ! Maximizing the sum of tail probabilities, as Greedy does, is equivalent to maximizing the expected total consumption ! Isn\u2019t that beautiful ?

I will first provide an overview of the algorithm and its analysis before diving into the technical details.", "If you understood the Greedy Algorithm, you should have no difficulties with the Censored Exploration Algorithm. As I said previously, the greedy process was identical over time ; the authors simply introduced timely updates of the tail distributions estimates, calculated with the censored observations from each venue collected at the previous timestep (i.e., the consumed units at each venue given the number that had been allocated). Thus the algorithm (Algorithm 2 below) implements a continuous allocate-reestimate loop.", "Everything seems simple in my description of the procedure, but as you will have understood, the crux of the matter is updating at each time step the estimated probabilities according to the censored data collected at this step. This corresponds to the subroutine OptimisticKM, which specifies how we calculate the new estimated tail probabilities from the observed data.", "The most natural choice would be the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) on the data, aka the Kaplan-Meier estimator (thus the KM in OptimisticKM, which is only an optimistically modified MLE that will be detailed later).", "I present hereunder an implementation of this algorithm.", "You can see that I can provide here any implementation for the update of the tail estimates.

Indeed, from the formula of the tail probability estimate, they extract theorem 2 hereunder which states that these tail proability estimates also converge with time to the true distributions, for each venue.", "(I will not explicit the proof, which calls lots of unpleasant calculus, since it doesn\u2019t help the comprehension. Feel free to read it in the original paper.)", "Hurray ! Now that we have a convergence bound of the MLE towards the true distribution, we can try to modify this estimator a bit. Indeed, it seems obvious that, the more data we have, the more accurate our estimator will be, but we would like to guarantee that it will indeed get sufficiently accurate if we provide for the necessary amount of data. I will explain the details hereunder.", "In Algorithm 3 , the value c can intuitively be viewed as a \u201ccut-off point\u201d up to which we are guaranteed to have sufficient data to accurately estimate the tail probabilities using the MLE.", "Thus for every quantity s lower than this cut-off point, we simply calculate the tail probability estimates through MLE.

Don\u2019t worry, we will now drift towards the dark pools.", "As mentioned in the Introduction, dark pools are a particular and relatively recent type of exchange for listed stocks. Indeed, the main challenge in executing large-volume trades in traditional exchanges is that it is difficult to \u201cconceal\u201d such trades, and their revelation generally results in adverse impact on price (e.g. the presence of a large-volume buyer causes the price to rise against that buyer). That\u2019s basically demand-and-supply law.", "If the volume is sufficiently large, this difficulty of concealment remains even if one attempts to break the trade up slowly over time. Dark pools arose to address the problems faced by large traders, and tend to emphasize trade and order concealment over price optimization.", "In a typical dark pool, buyers and sellers submit orders that simply specify the total volume of shares they wish to buy or sell, with the price of the transaction determined exogenously by \u201cthe market\u201d.", "Upon submitting an order to buy v shares, a trader is put in a queue of buyers awaiting transaction, and there is a similar queue of sell orders. Matching between buyers and sellers occurs in sequential arrival of orders, similar to a classical exchange. However, in this case no information is provided to traders about how many shares might be available in the pool at any given moment. Thus, at a given time step, a submission of v shares results only in a (possibly censored) report of how many shares (up to v) were executed.", "Dark pools have become very popular exchanges, responsible for executing 10\u201320% of the overall US equity volume.
