This article provides some facts and insights into the most popular and viable routes.", "I use AI, ML, and Data Science interchangeably. This article is not sponsored or reflect the opinions of my employer.", "Like What You Read? Connect with me on Medium, LinkedIn, or Twitter. Also, do you want to learn business thinking and communication skills as a Data Scientist? Check out my \u201cInfluence with Machine Learning\u201d guide.", "I introduced four Archetypes of Data Scientists to highlight the exit possibilities and ran a survey to understand what the community is thinking.", "Here are my takeaways. Please leave a comment if you see other insights.", "Caveat: this graph does not indicate how people want to transition. For example, you might think most Unsung Heroes want to become Super Geeks. This may not be 100% true. The survey doesn\u2019t track any individual information (e.g. IP), so we can\u2019t trace on an individual level.", "Whenever we present some data, people always ask so-what. My answer is always \u201cit depends\u201d, \u201cwhat do you mean by so-what?\u201d, or both. \ud83d\ude00", "So, let\u2019s frame it this way: it depends on if you are 1) a data scientist planning to transition, 2) a data science team manager or executive, or 3) an aspiring data scientist trying to join the field. Each persona has different interests and challenges.", "To limit the scope of this article and given the audience size, let\u2019s focus the discussion of seasoned Unsung Heroes who are planning to transition. If you belong to other personas, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or leave a comment. Happy to exchange thoughts.", "I interacted with a fair amount of Unsung Heroes in my work as an Expensive Consultant working a global firm and my recent AI startup adventure. Most Unsung Heroes feel like they are at a disadvantage. If you do, you are luckily wrong.", "In fact, you have two advantages: 1) functional expertise, 2) you know what it takes to design, deploy, and manage ML in messy businesses, and 3) work closely with non-Data Science teams. These are often downplayed.", "Everyone has a different approach to their career. I assume you want to:", "Sorry, I am not qualified to discuss this. I\u2019ve never worked as a Super Geek at any of the Big Tech firms. The closest moment was when I got an offer from the top Wall Street Hedge Fund to be a Geek, but I couldn\u2019t take the job. Long story short: the US visa system sucks.", "Depends on the reaction to this article, I can discuss my preparation and interview experience in a follow-up post.", "In the meanwhile, here are a few non-recruiting interviews of Super Geeks at the leading tech companies. They give you a good flavour of what they do and what the R&D teams care about. But here is one thing to keep in mind. R&D at smaller companies also do cool things.", "Before we discuss how to transition into consulting, let\u2019s look at the types of firms: the Giant Firms, Big Tech, and the Boutiques.", "The Giant firms offer a range of business and technology solutions across all industries and functions (e.g. Deloitte, McKinsey, Accenture). Service arms of Big Tech which focus on integrating specific solutions (e.g. Microsoft, IBM, or Google Cloud, Amazon Cloud). Boutique firms are typically smaller in size, offer very specific solutions, and focus on a narrow industry or function.", "Best Entry: As an Unsung Hero, your best bet is to join the Data Science specialist track at general service firms. Pursuing this path allows you to use your advantages on Day 1.", "These firms usually have two tracks: generalist and specialist. Generalist is typically open to new graduates, MBAs, and client- and sales-focused seasoned professionals. They will work on a wide range of non-data science projects or whatever domain they have deep relationships. In contrast, specialists are experts that lead deep technical work and thought leadership in their respective domain. Some senior specialists may have sales targets, but it\u2019s usually not the focus.", "If the generalist track is something you are interested in, you may need to prepare to take a step down in the level for learning and building networks. Alternatively, you really need to demonstrate your business acumens and understanding of key business topics (e.g. Economics, Marketing, Operation, Technology, Finance, etc.)", "Service arms at Big Tech and boutique firms are not the best first choice because of the focuses on software and system integration. Data Science work is typically to support the sales of the software, instead of general problem-solving.", "See more of the good and bad of working as an Expensive Consultant in my last article.", "The definition of AI startup is complicated. I typically group them into 1) companies that build AI tools, 2) companies that use AI in their products or services, and 3) companies that offer special AI algorithms.", "For AI tool startups, they usually build tools to enhance ML workflow. Most of the AI startups fall into this category. This diagram is my favourite way to show the general landscape.", "For companies that use AI in their product, you can think of Uber in their early days. Their main business is in transportation, but they use ML algorithms to enable better routing, demand matching, and user experience.", "For companies that offer AI algorithms for specific use cases, you can think of DeepMind before they got acquired by Google. I think this is what most people think of and want to join when they consider an AI startup. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t many out there.", "Best Entry: Companies that use AI in their products. Again, you can use your expertise on Day 1 and will be solving real ML problems. If you join a new payment company and you are a risk expert, you can build new risk models with new algorithms and interesting data (or no data depending on how early the company is). That\u2019s where creativity and fun come in!", "Joining an AI tool company is like joining the service arm of a Big Tech. You won\u2019t be solving actual data science problems, you will spend more time building software tools for other data scientists. You might build a simple model as a demo of the software.", "Good luck finding the AI algorithm companies. Maybe you can find them in university research labs. If you find them, prepare for a big pay cut and responsibilities. Everything has a cost, including the startup dream, right?", "See more of the good and bad of working as a Tech-Savvy Sales and Product Hippie in my last article.", "Many of us probably recognize that right now \u2014 during the storm of COVID-19 \u2014 is not the best time to explore career transitions. I highly recommend you read this post by Edouard Harris that discusses the current state of the Data Science job market.", "I can\u2019t (and don\u2019t want to) speculate how things will become after COVID-19. This is a good time for all of us to take a deep, hard look in the mirror. Are our current Data Science roles really creating or adding value? If yes, we don\u2019t have to worry and there will always be opportunities. If not, to Edouard\u2019s point, how can we reshape our roles to become truly indispensable?", "I hope this article offers some concrete insights into how you, an Unsung Hero running ML at large corporations, can transition to other roles with your absolute advantages. As always, I am open to feedback and love to exchange thoughts.", "Like What You Read? Follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, or Twitter.
