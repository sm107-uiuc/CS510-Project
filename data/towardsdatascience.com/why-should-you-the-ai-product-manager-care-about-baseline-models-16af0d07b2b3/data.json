You have heard that incorporating these algorithms into your Product can lead to several benefits but are wondering where to get started? How would you know if you are on the right track? Is there a low-effort way to assess if the results of the fancy models presented by your Data Science team are in-line with the objectives of your organisation? The answer to these questions lies in building a baseline model.", "Below are 4 reasons as to why you should invest time and effort to build a baseline model that you are confident will perform reasonably well.", "Baseline models are simple algorithms or heuristics that are straightforward to build and are easy to test. Ideally, they should not involve advanced Mathematics or the utilisation of expensive computing resources. A rule of thumb is, if it takes you under two weeks to develop your baseline model, you\u2019re likely on the right track. Otherwise, it might be a good idea to go back to the drawing board to figure out a more efficient way to construct your baseline. Lets now look at a toy example of a baseline model \u2014 both the algorithm and the Python code (using Fast.ai libraries)", "Problem statement: Let\u2019s consider the equivalent of the \u201cHello World\u201d program i.e printf(\"Hello, World!\"); in the field of Computer Vision. Your team\u2019s objective is to build a Deep Learning model that can recognise handwritten digits. In order to narrow down the problem statement, we will only consider handwritten 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s in this example. Below are some important details about our data set of handwritten digits", "The above image is an example of a randomly selected image of a handwritten one from our training set. As you can see, there are 784 pixels (28*28). Pixels whose value is 0 are white in colour. Pixels whose value is closer to 256 are darker shades of grey", "In line with the best practices of Data Science, our dataset is divided into training and validation sets. In our training set, we have 5923 images of handwritten 0\u2019s and 6742 images of handwritten 1\u2019s. While in our validation set we have 980 images of handwritten 0\u2019s and 1135 images of handwritten 1's.", "Task: As an AI Product Manager, you want to build a baseline model to get a sense of what value can be delivered before engaging with the Data Science team. Furthermore, by building a baseline model, you will also get a chance to intimately familiarise yourself with the dataset.", "Our algorithm to build the baseline model consists of the following two simple steps", "This section contains the Python code for constructing the baseline model. Feel free to skip this section if the technical aspects are not of interest to you", "In the previous section, we built our baseline model using a simple algorithm. Let\u2019s see what our \u201cideal\u201d 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s i.e the results of our baseline model look like.", "It is worth noting that the baseline model for handwritten 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s look pretty close to the actual digits!", "Let\u2019s now assess the accuracy of our baseline models using a quick and dirty approach. Below are the steps", "Expected result: If our baseline model is correct, we should observe that the randomly selected 0 will be closer to the \u201cideal 0\u201d than it is to the \u201cideal 1\u201d.", "Observed result: As you can see above screenshot, the distance of the randomly selected image of handwritten 0 from the baseline model of Zero (aka \u201cideal 0\u201d) is 0.15 while its distance from the baseline model of One (aka \u201cideal 1\u201d) is 0.22. As expected, the randomly selected 0 is closer to the baseline model of Zero than it is to the baseline model of One", "Conclusion: Therefore, we can conclude that our baseline model correctly classified the randomly selected image,", "However, it is not sufficient to just look at randomly selected images. We need to calculate how accurate this baseline model is when it comes to classifying the images in the entire validation set. It is worth to pause at this point and remind ourselves of two points", "Quick reminder 1: Our validation set consists of 980 images of handwritten 0\u2019s and 1135 images of handwritten 1\u2019s", "Quick reminder 2: The images in the validation set were not used to build the baseline model. The images in the training set were used", "Metric: The metric that we will use to assess our baseline model is known as the Accuracy. It is the \u201cthe number of images that the baseline model correctly predicts (either as 0 or as 1) divided by the total number of images\u201d. More formally, Accuracy is defined as", "Accuracy = number of correct predictions / total data points", "We will use the same logic that we used in the quick and dirty approach to measure the accuracy of our baseline model. If the pixels of a given image are closer to our \u201cideal 0\u201d, then we will predict it to be 0. Whereas if the pixels are closer to our \u201cideal 1\u201d, then we will predict it to be 1.", "The above code snippet shows that the Accuracy of our baseline model is 95%. This result shows that the baseline model that we built is a great place to start! We managed to get over 90% accuracy on both 0s and 1s simply by using common sense and basic Mathematics (averages).", "It is worth noting that, in order to build our baseline model", "There is a tonne of great content such as this, this and this on how to approach baseline models for Data Scientists and Data Engineers. However, there is a widespread belief that Product Managers should play a more active role in data collection and in the training of datasets. As Andrew Ng said during his talk at the State of Artificial Intelligence", "\u201c\u2026we\u2019re training Product Managers to use a new language to speak to the Engineers to give Product specifications. For example, Product Managers now know to train a dataset and and provide that to the Engineer and say\u2026. are you able to deliver 98% accuracy on this dataset at detecting cars between 50 and 100 meters\u2026\u201d.", "I wrote this post to demonstrate that Product Managers (and almost anyone) can conceptualise and build baseline models. Even if you are not a programmer, you can devise the algorithm and collaborate with an Engineer to build. As seen in this example, it is possible to design the algorithms for baseline models using common sense and very simple Mathematics knowledge.", "You can view the source code on my GitHub profile by clicking here", "This blog post was inspired by Lesson 4 of the Fast.ai course.", "Your home for data science.
