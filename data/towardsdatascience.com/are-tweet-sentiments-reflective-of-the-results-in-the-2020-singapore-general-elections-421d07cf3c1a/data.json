What do you do when you\u2019re really excited as a first-time voter who has a lot of spare time on her hands? You conduct a quick study to analyse the sentiments of Tweets and see if they reflect the actual results from the election. Okay, I guess I might be the only one who thinks in this manner (nerd alert), but anyway, let\u2019s just dive straight into it!", "Using the Tweepy API, and with the help of the code used by Griffin in this article, I downloaded tweets using \u2018PAP #GE2020\u2019 as the search term.", "PAP stands for the People\u2019s Action Party, which is Singapore\u2019s ruling party. The hashtag GE2020 is used by most people who tweeted about the 2020 Singapore general elections.", "I deliberated quite a bit over what the appropriate search term was \u2014 simply using #GE2020 wouldn\u2019t be quite right, as the tweets collected would also include those reflecting public sentiments towards opposition parties. Although the search term that I used would exclude tweets that did not mention PAP or use the hashtag GE2020 but were, in fact, talking about the ruling party, I felt that it was the closest that I could get to isolating the tweets reflecting the sentiments towards the ruling party.", "I chose to include retweets as well, as I figured that Twitter users tend to retweet tweets that they resonated with. My dataset included tweets and retweets posted in between 6 July to 8 July, where the online political discourse was likely to be the most active since polling day (10 July) was coming up. By the way, you might be wondering why 9 July was excluded, it\u2019s because that day is cooling-off day, where there is a prohibition of campaigning activities so as to allow voters to take a step back and reflect on issues before heading to the polls the following day.", "I originally hoped to collect 50000 tweets and retweets but ended up getting a lot of duplicated data, probably because there aren\u2019t that many tweets that fulfilled the criteria of my search term over a short span of 3 days (I also forgot how Singapore\u2019s citizen population of around 3.5 million isn\u2019t that large to begin with). My final dataset consisted of 2504 tweets and retweets, and 406 unique tweets.", "Now, you may be curious about what are some of the commonly used words in these tweets. Let\u2019s create word clouds to find out!", "In the word cloud that includes both tweets and retweets, some of the terms that might be of interest would include \u2018WP\u2019, which stands for The Workers\u2019 Party, \u2018Hougang\u2019 and \u2018Aljunied\u2019, which are constituencies currently held by the opposition party. The frequent mentioning of such terms in tweets could suggest that The Workers\u2019 Party is the opposition party that is gaining the most attention, and that Hougang and Aljunied constituencies are likely to be one of the closely watched constituencies in the upcoming elections. Two other opposition parties, PSP (Progress Singapore Party) and SDP (Singapore Democratic Party) are also mentioned in the tweets quite often.", "What about the word cloud for tweets only?", "We observe a much larger variety of words commonly used in the tweets, but The Workers\u2019 Party remains a prominent subject in many of the tweets.", "While word clouds allow us to pick out commonly used words across the tweets in our dataset (which haven\u2019t been too surprising so far), we don\u2019t know how the sentiments of those tweets are like. That brings us to the next part, where I perform sentiment analysis using VADER and BERT.", "I\u2019m sure most people are quite familiar with VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), so I won\u2019t bore everyone with a lengthy explanation about it in this article. Instead, I\u2019ll jump right into my findings, where I present the breakdown of tweets that are classified to be carrying positive, negative or neutral sentiment.", "For the dataset that included retweets, VADER classified most of the tweets as positive, a quarter as negative and slightly less than 10% of them as neutral.", "After excluding retweets, VADER classified a smaller proportion of tweets as positive, but that percentage remains slightly more than 50%, with the remaining tweets being quite evenly split between negative and neutral.", "I took a quick look at the classified tweets and realised that VADER tends not to detect the correct sentiment when sarcasm is used, which isn\u2019t too surprising. In this example, the tweet carries a negative sentiment towards the ruling party, but VADER identified a positive sentiment instead. Wow, awkward, indeed (sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist).", "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state of the art NLP model developed by Google, and Rani\u2019s article does a pretty good job of explaining what it is about.", "For the purpose of this study, I\u2019ll be using the BERT model fine-tuned by Preston using a Kaggle airline Twitter dataset, as detailed in his article here.", "How did BERT classify the tweets?", "When retweets were included, BERT classified most of the tweets as negative, which is vastly different from VADER\u2019s classification.", "When only tweets were considered, BERT classified a smaller proportion of tweets as negative, but it still remains the majority sentiment.", "Remember that sarcastic tweet that VADER misclassified? Let\u2019s see if BERT manages to identify the correct sentiment.", "BERT successfully detects the negative sentiment in this tweet!", "I took a quick look at some of the tweets classified by the model, and realised that BERT struggles with detecting the right sentiment at times. Here, we see an example with a negative sentiment, but BERT misclassifies it as positive. Then again, even I as a human find it difficult to correctly identify sentiments sometimes, so how can we expect machines to be perfect at the job?", "To summarise the actual results of the 2020 Singapore General Elections, while PAP kept their supermajority in parliament, it lost an additional constituency (Sengkang) to The Workers\u2019 Party. The PAP\u2019s average vote share declined to 61.24% which is its lowest vote share since the 2011 elections.", "BERT might be the better model at correctly classifying sentiments even in the presence of sarcasm, but given the largely negative sentiment on Twitter that it detected, I would have expected an even more drastic vote swing away from the ruling party. Perhaps, there is a certain degree of self-selection when it comes to turning to social media to express political opinions \u2014 those who are more vocal on Twitter tend to be critics of the ruling party, while supporters of the ruling party are more likely to remain silent on social media platforms.", "Another possible explanation would be the demographics of Twitter users. Twitter users tend to be younger, which would mean that even if there is no self-selection of Twitter users who express their political sentiments, tweet sentiments will only be representative of a subset of the Singapore population.", "One interesting extension to this study would be to go through the same process for Singapore\u2019s more prominent opposition parties, such as WP, PSP and SDP, and then compare the proportion of sentiments to that of PAP.", "All in all, I had quite a lot of fun with this frivolous pet project, and all relevant codes and files can be found on GitHub here!", "Disclaimer: The opinions in this article are entirely my own, in no way do they reflect the views of the organisations that I am part of.", "Your home for data science.
