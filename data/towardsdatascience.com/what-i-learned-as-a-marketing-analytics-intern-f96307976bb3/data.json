With COVID-19 causing many companies to cancel internships across the country, I wanted to share what I\u2019ve learned so that those who did not have the privilege to have an internship could still take something away from this summer! If you haven\u2019t check out my previous story: A Day in the Life of a Marketing Analytics Intern, make sure to check it out!", "My internship has been unique because I\u2019ve learned marketing skills, technical skills, and business skills. I want to highlight these, specifically in technical and business skills for this story, because I feel that what I learned from these fields has helped me progress as an analyst, marketer, and data scientist. Let\u2019s get into it!", "Disclaimer: I am not a full time marketing analytics professional, I am simply relaying my experience from my summer internship. This is not meant to teach you all the skills and tools used in marketing analytics, as I am still learning. For this information, please check out Towards Data Science. If you are interested in what I\u2019ve learned this summer, and how it could help you, keep reading!", "Python: When I started my internship, I had very little knowledge of Python. Quite frankly, I was afraid to start learning it because I had just spent so much time learning SQL, and didn\u2019t want to go back to square one with another language. From a technical perspective, learning Python was one of the best things I have taken away from this internship. Whether you are in data science, business intelligence, or marketing analytics, I would highly recommend learning some basic python. Here are a couple applications of Python used during my internship:", "SQL: I already had some previous SQL experience coming into my internship. I didn\u2019t realize, however, how helpful it would be. As an intern or entry-level marketing analyst, you want to do everything you can to add value to the marketing department, and in a timely manner. I would get Excel files with 2.5 million rows, and having the SQL knowledge to import it and quickly clean the data saved me a lot of time! Here are a couple SQL applications used in my internship:", "Power BI and Tableau: Data visualization in general is very important in the work that I\u2019ve done this summer. I\u2019d get through a project and think I\u2019m done and realize, \u201cWait I can\u2019t present a table of statistics or metrics\u201d. While I had Tableau experience coming into my internship, I actually did not have a Tableau license, so I ended up learning how to use Power BI! Here are a couple applications of Power BI, but could apply to any visualization tool:", "Communication: If you\u2019ve ever asked a data scientist, marketing analyst, or business intelligence analyst for a good skill to learn, most of them always say, \u201cCommunication\u201d. Now I\u2019ve always felt that I\u2019ve been a good communicator. Coming from a marketing background, I would be doing multiple presentations every semester in my coursework. What I never realized is that written communication is just as important as verbal communication. Here are a couple scenarios where written communication was important:", "A quick note about written communication: During this time of COVID-19, many employers are placing a greater emphasis on written communication, I would highly recommend working on this skill as you work on other projects and technical skills!", "\u201cWhat I never realized is that written communication is just as important as verbal communication.\u201d", "Building Relationships: Being able to build relationships with other people at your organization will go a long way. If you genuinely care about the other people on your team, and really buy into the team mentality, members of your team will be more willing to help you out and teach you something you didn\u2019t know before. Here are a couple examples of this in my internship:", "While I learned many new skills in technology and business during my internship, here are five more very important lessons I\u2019ve learned that don\u2019t fit into either category, but are important for marketing analysts and other young data aspirants to know:", "\u201cAny great discovery started with one simple question. Always ask questions\u201d.", "If this was helpful, please let me know! I really enjoy writing about data, and would love to write more articles about data as a craft, how to excel in your internship, and share more of what I\u2019ve learned from a technical perspective! Stay safe everyone, and have a great day!", "To contact me or recieve more content, follow me on Twitter @BMNAnalytics!", "Your home for data science.
