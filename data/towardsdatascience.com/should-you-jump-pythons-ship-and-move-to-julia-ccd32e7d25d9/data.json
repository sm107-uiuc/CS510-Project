While Python is certainly a useful language that has been moderately popular since its inception, typically this surge in popularity is attributed to Python\u2019s fantastic capabilities in machine learning and statistical analysis. With the shifts of time, however, new languages have risen to the occasion in an attempt to dethrone Python and create a universally faster experience for machine-learning. One of the most promising and popular languages that fall into this category is Julia.", "Julia is a multi-paradigm, statically-typed, general-purpose language that was built with machine-learning and statistics in mind. The primary motivation behind most Julia usage tends to be Julia\u2019s speed, but I think it\u2019s important to remember just how many variables there are for speed alone. This is not even touching on the other capabilities or disabilities attributed to that language.", "While speed is certainly important, and even more important in the context of machine learning, I think it is also important to discuss other hindrances and advantages alongside the discussion of performance. A big question that should be asked before jumping the Python ship is", "There is no sense in learning a new language if the trade-offs outweigh the single benefit that is performance. Julia does have a few problems that might not necessarily make switching the best choice for certain developers.", "The first, and arguably biggest thing that is lost in the translation between Python and Julia is", "While Julia does have some great packages that are worth checking out, as well as a great package manager to facilitate them, the scope of these packages is nowhere near as mature as Python. A lot of Julia packages have a severe lack of documentation, have dependency issues, or are convoluted and so segmented that you will have to add fifty packages to get one thing done. While this is certainly a big downside, it should be noted that Julia doesn\u2019t have the module dynasty that Python has because Python is far more mature as a language. Over time, this issue will almost certainly be resolved, and with the great developers that are working on the language, compounded with the fantastic and rapidly developing community around Julia, this might not be a big issue for too much longer. I understand why some Julians might point out \u201c PyCall.jl\u201d as a potential solution for this, but I don\u2019t agree with that stance as using PyCall for everything is slower than using Python for everything, so why not just use Python instead at that point?", "Another significant \u2018downside\u2019 to Julia is its paradigm. While Julia is indeed a multi-paradigm programming language with support for many generics, Julia\u2019s syntax is inherently static, meaning that for the most part, Julia code will fall into the functional paradigm. While I\u2019m sure the Lisp, R, and Haskell fans just jumped in their seats, looking at a list of the most popular programming languages registers why a switch into this paradigm can be incredibly jarring, even for experienced programmers. So while this might not be a disadvantage to me or others, it can certainly put off those without substantial interest in such a language.", "It\u2019s likely that we are all familiar with Python, so I\u2019m not going to spend much time going over why you might want to switch from Python to Julia. However, I think there are some disadvantages to Python that should be brought to the table objectively in order to determine the pros and cons of potentially switching programming languages.", "Firstly, as I\u2019m certain we\u2019ve all heard, Python is an interpreted language. And while there are certainly solutions to get around this using various tools to get compiled executable, and greater speed, none of these are sure-fire ways to make a package faster or distribute software. While I am not particularly keen on the \u201c Python == \u2018slow\u2019\u201d bandwagon, there is no denying Python\u2019s lack of speed. Fortunately, Python\u2019s interpretation through C does put it in a unique position, as it can be used to manipulate and call C code from a high-level interface.", "While this is a big plus for Python, not all work in Data Science is done in modules that are already written in C, and sometimes the added layer of the Python.h header can also bog down calculation speeds and ruin C\u2019s great performance.", "Though speed is definitely important, I would like to reiterate that it is definitely not everything. There is a host of significant advantages to using both Python and Julia, some of which are even subjective. For example, I have a boiling hatred for indentation syntax in Python, so working in Julia where functions are ended with a delimiter is subjectively my preference.", "Another thing I would like to point out is Julia\u2019s polymorphic dispatch, and Python\u2019s easier syntax. All of these points are meant to illustrate that while performance is important, the host of features in a language could be a greater factor in choosing which language to use. Not only that, but you could pick-and-choose which language to use for your current scenario, as there are naturally some things that one language will be better at than the other.", "Another interesting thing I have touched base on before with Julia is the idea of using Python as an interface to Julia, instead of interfacing with C. This comes with the advantage of being able to write your fast code quicker while still maintaining similar performance. Fortunately, I even created a package to do so that you can install through PyPi.", "Your choice of language doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be binary. A great thing about Julia is that you can retain your use of Python and use Julia as you would Scala, as well, given Julia\u2019s big-data capabilities and floating-point accuracy. Julia even has BigInt and BigFloat types for handling numbers that are bigger than the average bear.", "In terms of actual speed, I have put Julia\u2019s benchmarks above. As we can see from this basic benchmark, Julia tends to linger close to the performance of Go, while remaining a little more consistent. Interestingly as well, Julia, in very rare cases can out-perform even C and Rust. While this is certainly a great feat, the goal here is not to compare Julia and C, but instead to compare Julia and Python.", "To maintain consistency between the two comparisons, I will be using Julia\u2019s syntactical expressions to force the language to type a little more like Python. If you\u2019d like to read a bit more about how to do this, as well as get more familiar with Julia\u2019s dispatch, I have an article I am quite proud of that will tell you all you need to know here:", "For my iterative test, I created this function in Julia:", "Likewise, I created this class in Python to accomplish the same goal:", "You might notice that I used dot() and sq() to replace .* for element-wise multiplication, and .^ for element-wise squaring. Here are those functions:", "For my data, I generated a 500,000 dim DataFrame in Julia like so:", "And I also made a test DataFrame with 600,000 dims:", "For consistency, I saved the DataFrames and read them into Python with Pandas:", "To time the Python results, I will, of course, be using the IPython %timeit magic command. As for the Julia results, as you might expect I will be using the @time macro. Here are the results:", "While this is a nice comparison, and Julia certainly came through with about 30 percent less time on calculation, I wanted to", "While it is quite impressive just how well Python was able to stack-up against Julia, there is certainly something to be said for this real-machine-learning example of Julia out-performing Python. I think this also speaks very much to what I spoke of before, with Julia being incredibly useful for handling big-data. I think that if there is one thing that this test taught me it is that Julia definitely has a place in the world of machine-learning. Even if Julia isn\u2019t a replacement for Python, it could certainly replace Scala and many other similar languages.", "Though the language has its quirks and is constantly evolving, the performance is certainly there. Though it might not be time to jump ship on Python programming", "(I'm kidding), or it might never be time to get rid of Python for machine-learning, at the same time I don\u2019t see a good reason not to learn Julia. Fortunately, if you are already familiar with Python, then learning Julia should be relatively straightforward, as the syntax is quite similar. Who knows \u2014 maybe you\u2019ll find some things you prefer in Julia as well! Overall, the future for Julia in the scope of machine-learning is very exciting. I think any Data Scientist looking to broaden their horizons a little bit should certainly check it out, and maybe even contribute to the growing beast that is the Julia language.", "Your home for data science.
