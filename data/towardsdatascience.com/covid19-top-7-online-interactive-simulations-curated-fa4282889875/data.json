So this is going to be grouped by category, in no particular order (actually, from what I think is most intuitive to understand):", "Washington Post uses a billiard ball model, where each individual is a perfectly elastic 2D circle that with a constant speed on a straight line, living in a rectangle with perfectly elastic walls. This is a very good time to bring up spherical cow:", "Milk production at a dairy farm was low, so the farmer wrote to the local university, asking for help from academia. A multidisciplinary team of professors was assembled, headed by a theoretical physicist, and two weeks of intensive on-site investigation took place. The scholars then returned to the university, notebooks crammed with data, where the task of writing the report was left to the team leader. Shortly thereafter the physicist returned to the farm, saying to the farmer, \u201cI have the solution, but it works only in the case of spherical cows in a vacuum\u201d. http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/WAPP2_cow.html", "I\u2019m not making fun of WaPo. The whole idea is that designing simulation is an art. It is too hard to make a perfect simulation of the world. You need to make some assumptions and simplification somewhere, without making it too simple and losing the behaviors that we want to model. And I think that WaPo have made good decisions. (For a more sophisticated billiard ball simulation, albeit non-interactive, check the 3blue1brown in the Honorable Mentions section at the end) https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/", "Another billiard ball model by Petr\u00f4nio Silva and team where they compare 5 different scenarios.

Instead of modelling people as billiard balls, he models it as a motionless square cell in a grid.

Most interestingly, even when coming up with a completely different model and assumptions, it reaches similar conclusions with the billiard ball model.", "There are a lot of parameters to play with, but not too much.

Here is the link: https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/outbreak/", "Very similar with Melting Asphalt, much less interactive, but with one key difference, hexagonal grid. Although simpler to code, using square grid causes many issues, like how it spreads like a diamond (if you use 4-neighbors) or square (if you use 8-neighbors). In short, hex is better for simulations in general because it is the most circular shape that could tile a space. You can read more about it here and here.", "R2D3 is an excellent website.
