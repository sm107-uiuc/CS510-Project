The series is based on content from a book I am writing also titled, Fighting Churn With Data: I\u2019ll extract the key takeaways from the book for these posts, and leave the details, including the code, for the book. (If you want more details the book is already partially available by electronic access, and the complete printed manuscript will be out in early 2020. The code from the finished portions of the book is available on github.)", "A primary goal for any product or services is to grow. Growth occurs when new customers are added through marketing and sales, but when customers leave it counteracts the growth and can even lead to contraction. For those in the business of providing such services, customers quitting a service has become known as \u201cchurn\u201d. Most service providers focus on acquisitions, but to be successful a service must also work to minimize churn. If churn is not addressed a service won\u2019t reach its full potential.", "The term churn actually originated with the \u201cchurn rate\u201d: The churn rate refers to the proportion of customers departing in a given period, as will be discussed in more detail below. This leads to the customer or user population changing over time, which is why the term \u201cchurn\u201d made sense: because the word churn originally meant \u201cto move about vigorously\u201d as in churning butter. But in the business context the term churn is now also used as verb: \u201cthe customer is churning\u201d; \u201cthe customer churned\u201d; and as a noun: \u201cthe customer is a churn\u201d. Customers not churning from a service can also be framed in a positive sense, if you prefer to see a glass as half full. In that case people talk about \u201ccustomer retention\u201d.", "The sketch below summarizes the typical situation for fighting churn:", "Given those components, this is how fighting churn with data usually works:", "Is that so hard? If You\u2019re a data scientist already you can probably see where this is going and think it should be a piece of cake. Well, there are a few things about churn you that make it different.", "Churn is hard to predict, even with the latest machine learning technology. It\u2019s easy to see why predicting churn is hard if you consider your own behavior the last time you unsubscribed from something: You probably were not taking full advantage of the subscription for a long time, but it took you so long to cancel because you were too busy or you spent some time researching your alternatives, or you simply forgot. If a data person or analytic system was observing your behavior during that time it would have flagged you as a risk and been wrong (in the sense that you did not churn) for the entire time it took you to make up your mind and find the time to cancel. The moment of churn was determined by too many extraneous factors to be predicted.", "More generally, many important aspects of the situation are usually unknowable to those who wish to reduce churn. Consider the following additional pieces of information that would help to predict churn if you knew them, but you probably never will:", "If you worked on a project where you predicted churn in the past and found it easy to predict with high accuracy you were probably predicting churn too late, when it is not possible to stop it \u2014 a subject I will address in a future post.", "It is hard to accurately predict churn, but preventing churn is even harder. The reason is simple: In order to prevent churn in a long term and reliable way a service must actually improve either the benefit delivered by the service or reduce the cost incurred from using the service. Think of what it would have taken to stop you from churning off of a product you used in the past but no longer do: Would better content and features have stopped you from churning? Maybe. Would a lower price have stopped you from churning? Maybe. How about an improved user interface \u2014 would that stop you from churning? Probably not, unless the user interface was terrible to begin with. And would more frequent emails and notifications from the product stop you from churning? Definitely not!", "So to reduce churn you really need to increase value the users receive but this is going to be harder than getting people to sign up for a service in the first place. Because these are people who already know exactly what the service is really like, so promises made via marketing or sales representatives are unlikely to get a lot of traction. As will be discussed in detail later, one of the best options available is trying to make sure subscribers take advantage of all the best aspects of a service that are already available, but this has limits.", "As the data person, you may be asked for \u201csilver bullets\u201d to reduce churn, and here is the bad news:", "TAKEAWAY There are no silver bullets to reduce churn", "The alternative of course is to reduce the cost of the service. But reducing the monetary cost is the nuclear option for a paid service \u2014 revenue churn or downsells may be better than complete and total churn, but it\u2019s still churn.", "WARNING Price reduction is a \u201cdiamond bullet\u201d against churn : it always works, but you can\u2019t afford it.", "Preventing churn is not really the job of a data person, or at least not something a data person can do alone. There have been remarkable advances in AI and data science in the past years, but for the most part preventing churn requires a human touch with the customers or users. Consider the following examples of roles that can really reduce churn:", "These roles vary by the type of offering and organization and my descriptions are really just generalizations. But the point is that ultimately reducing churn depends on taking actions to influence customers, and these actions are usually taken by the specialists in different parts of business, not by a programmer who is wrangling the data.", "These roles are obviously very diverse, and I will refer to all of these functions as \u201cthe business\u201d, for lack of a better term. It is not to imply that the data person is not a part of the company, but data people usually have no direct responsibility for concrete business outcomes (like revenue) while the people in these other roles usually do. From the point of view of the data person \u201cthe business\u201d is the end user of the churn analysis results.", "As a result of all the factors mentioned above, what the business people need to help them fight churn are a concise set of facts or rules for understanding customer engagement. These rules need to be actionable for the business, meaning they understand how to reduce churn based on the findings. That in turn requires that the facts you discover are really causes or drivers of churn and engagement. These facts usually take the form of relationships between customer behavior and churn or retention. To make a simple example, you may discover business rules like \u201ccustomers who use (view) the feature X more than five times a month churn at half the rate of customers who use it less than twice a month\u201d. Something like using or viewing more of a particular feature may not seem very complicated, but as long as it is a correct reading of the data its really useful. Each part of the business can use a fact like that differently: Product creators will know the feature X is providing value, and improve it or make more like it. The marketing department can design a campaign to drive users to the feature. And when Customer Success/Support people are talking to a customer they can ask if the customer is using that feature and encourage the customer to try it if not.", "This type of analysis is not an AI algorithm of the kind that gets the most attention in the media and university education nowadays. This may disappoint some readers: To reduce churn it will not be sufficient to deploy an \u201cAI\u201d system that will win a data science forecasting competition. If you try to deliver an analysis that predicts churn without explaining it in terms of concrete rules, the business will not be able to use it easily and so they will probably not use it at all. While there are techniques to make black box machine learning models more interpretable, I will show that you can reach better conclusions through more straightforward methods.", "By using simple methods you can really make the business people part of the investigative process, capture more of their domain expertise, and give them more confidence in the result and better ability to interpret it. Predictive models for churn can be useful, but they are much more useful when the prediction is the natural extension of a program of investigation and knowledge transfer from the data team to the business.", "Klipfolio is a data analytics cloud app for building and sharing real-time business dashboards. These dashboard can be created by multiple users, and a common metric for any product that allows multiple users on one subscription is the number of users that are active. The figure below is a demonstration of how the number of active users per month at a Klipfolio customer is related to churn.", "The figure above uses a technique called Behavioral Cohorts to show the relationship between a behavior and churn. You will see a lot of these plots in below and in the book and learn how to create them, and for now I will give a brief explanation of how it works: Given a pool of customers and a behavioral metric like the number of active users per month, the customers are organized into cohorts by their measurements on that metric. Typically ten cohorts are used, so the first cohort contains the bottom 10% of customers in terms of the metric, the second cohort contains the next 10%, on up to the final cohort which contains the top 10% of customers on that metric. Once the cohorts are formed, you calculate what percent of customers in each cohort churned. The result is displayed in a plot like the figure above: each point in the plot corresponds to one cohort, with the x-value of the point given by the average value of the metric for all customers in the cohort and the y-value of the point given by percentage of churns (i.e. the churn rate) in the cohort.", "One other thing I should mention about the cohort plot is that it doesn\u2019t show the actual churn rates, only the relative difference between the cohorts. This is because the churn rate is a very important operational metric and it would be inappropriate to reveal the true churn rate for the companies in the case studies. Similarly, none of the behavioral cohort churn plots in the book show the actual churn rates with labels on the y-axis. However, the bottom of the behavioral cohort plots is always set to zero churn rate, so the distance of the points from the bottom of the cohort plot can be used for comparing relative churn rates. For example, if one point is half as far from the bottom of the plot as another that means the churn rate in that cohort is one half the other.", "Turning to the details of the churn cohort plot, it shows that the lowest cohort has under one active user per month (an average over multiple months) and the highest cohort has more than 25 active users per month. The churn rate on the cohort with the lowest active users per month is around 8 times greater than churn in the cohort with the highest number of active users. At the same time, most of the differences in churn rates occurs between around one and five active users per month.", "While measuring the number of active users is a good metric for fighting churn, an even better one is shown in the next figure: this is the license utilization metric calculated by dividing the number of active users by the number of seats the user has purchased. Many SaaS products are sold by the \u201cseat\u201d meaning the maximum number of users allowed (this is called the licensed number of seats). If the number of active users is divided by the number of seats licensed, the resulting metric measures the percentage utilization of the seat license by the customer.", "The result in the figure above shows that license utilization is a very effective metric for fighting churn: the lowest cohort in license utilization has average utilization just above zero, and the highest cohort has license utilization around 1.0. The lowest cohort has around 7x the churn rate as the highest cohort and the churn rate varies more or less continuously across the cohorts \u2014 in contrast to churn in the the number of active users cohorts, there is not really a level at which having higher utilization no longer makes a difference. This makes it more effective for distinguishing churn risks than active users alone. As will be explained further in later posts and the book, the reason the active users per month actually conflates two different underlying factors related to churn: How many seats were sold to the customer, and how often a typical user is active. Utilization is a measure of how active the users are that is independent of the number of seats sold and is usually very useful for segmenting customers with respect to their engagement and churn risk.", "Broadly is an online service which helps small and medium businesses (SMB\u2019s) manage their online presence including reviews. A very important event for Broadly\u2019s customers is the number of times the business is reviewed positively, or promoted. The figure below shows the relationship between the number of promoters per month that a Broadly customer has and churn. (For a detailed explanation of the cohort plot see the start of the last section.) In the figure below the cohort with the fewest promoters per month (just above zero promoters on average) has a churn rate that is around 4x higher than the cohorts with the most promoters; the reduction in churn mostly happens between 0 and 20 promoters per month. This is a clear relationship for an important event and it is easy to see why customers that have more on-line promoters are more likely to stay with Broadly service, because receiving positive reviews is one of the main goals for a customer using Broadly.", "Another important event for Broadly\u2019s customers related to the number of promoters is the number of detractors, or the number of times the business is reviewed negatively. The figure below shows the relationship between the number of detractors per month that a Broadly customer has and churn: The cohort with the fewest detractors per month (just above zero) has a churn rate that is around 2x higher than the cohorts with the most detractors (average of just under 5 detractors per month); the reduction in churn mostly happens between 0 and 1 detractors per month.", "While this relationship looks a lot like the one for customer promoters shown above, doesn\u2019t it seem like there is something wrong here? Getting negative reviews is a bad thing, and presumably not the result that Broadly\u2019s customers were looking for \u2014 so why is having negative reviews associated with reduced churn?", "To understand why more of a bad thing like detractors may be associated with less churn it helps to look at another, better metric for Broadly\u2019s customers: If you take the number of detractors and divide it by the total number of reviews (promoters plus detractors) then the result is the percentage of detractors, which I call the Detractor Rate. The next figure shows the relationship between churn and the detractor rate \u2014 this is probably more the kind of relationship you were expecting for a product event that is negative for the customer: The higher the detractor rate, the higher the churn, and in a very significant way.", "So why does the relationship to churn show that more detractors is good when you look at detractor count alone, and that more detractors is bad when you look at the detractor rate? The answer is that the total number of detractors in is actually related to the total number of promoters shown in, because Broadly customers who receive a lot of reviews overall are likely to receive more of both good and bad reviews, just by virtue of having lots of reviews. So when you look at the impact on the relationship between the number of detractors and churn in the simple way it conflates two underlying factors driving the metric: having a lot of reviews (which is good), and having a high proportion of bad reviews (which is bad). When the proportion of bad reviews is analyzed alone you get the more useful result.", "Versature provides telecommunication services for businesses. As a unified communications provider many of their most important events are voice calls which have a duration stored in a field attached to each event. The figure below shows the relationship between the amount of voice calls a Versature customer makes and churn. The lowest cohort in terms of local calls has practically zero calls and a churn rate that is around three times higher than those cohorts of customers that have local calls per month is in the thousands.", "When trying to understand churn it is important to consider not only the amount of a service customers use, but also how much they pay. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is a standard metric for calculating the amount a customer pays to use a subscription service: it is the total the amount a customer pays each month to use a service, but not including any setup fees or irregular charges. (I say more about MRR and how to calculate it in the book.) The amount customers pay can also be analyzed with a behavioral cohort approach to look for a relationship with churn, which is shown below.", "The behavioral cohort plot below does something new: rather than displaying the average MRR of the cohorts directly it shows the average MRR after every MRR measurement has been converted to a score. If you are familiar with a concept of \u201cgrading on a curve\u201d then metric scores are the same idea: the measurements are converted from one scale to another, but the ordering remains the same. So a given cohort like the bottom 10% on the metric is still the same set of customers if the metric is converted into a score, and the cohort has the exact same churn rate. That means that converting a metric into a score only affects how the cohorts are spread out along the horizontal axis of the cohort plot, but not the vertical position of the points, which is the churn rate. Metrics are converted to scores when the re-scaling on the horizontal access makes the result easier to understand. I say more about metric scores and how to calculate them in the book.", "The cohort churn rates show that MRR is also related to churn, though not as strongly as making calls: the churn rates in the different cohorts do not vary in a totally consistent way, and the lowest cohort churn rates are only about one half or one third less than the highest churn cohorts. But this is another case where it makes you stop and think about what it is saying: people who pay more churn less. Is that what you expected? This may be surprising but its actually quite common, especially in business products. That\u2019s because business products are sold with higher prices for bigger customers and bigger customers churn less for many reasons: They have more employees, so when it comes to product use like making calls or using software customers who pay more for a product are usually are using a lot more too. So the lower churn for customers paying higher MRR is actually related to the lower churn for customers with more calls shown above.", "But a different way to look at how the amount customers pay relates to churn is shown below: The MRR metric is divided by the metric for the number of calls per month. This results in a metric which is the cost per call the customer makes. I calls this a \u201cvalue metric\u201d, because it explains how much of the service the customer receives for their money. Like in the MRR figure, the cost per call figure shows the cohort average as a score rather than in dollars. The behavioral cohort churn plot for cost per call shows that customers that pay more really do churn more, when the payment is measured in relation to the amount of the service consumed. The highest cohort in cost per call has a churn rate that is around 6 time higher than the cohorts with the lowest cost per call. Value metrics like this are a key weapon for understanding why customers churn and an important subject that will be explored fully in later chapters.", "This series is going to be different from a lot of writing about data science, because I\u2019m not going to tell you that you need some shiny new technology or a complicated sounding algorithm. Instead I emphasize using your brain (via the scientific method) and the following areas:", "Your home for data science.
