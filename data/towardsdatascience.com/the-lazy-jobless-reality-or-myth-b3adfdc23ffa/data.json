This class has 78 lecture slides in total. I will compile them into a breezy, 7-minute read for you.", "Does unemployment benefit make people lazy? If it does, states with higher benefit would have more unemployment, holding all else equal.", "Lo and behold, the red line is above the blue line everywhere!", "At this point, any unsuspecting person would be tempted to make the following conclusion: unemployment benefit makes people lazy.", "After all, all states end with the same unemployment rate \u2014 the only difference is, states with below average benefit seems to get there faster.", "When we see (high benefit, high unemployment rate), there are many possible explanations besides \u201cunemployment benefits make people lazy\u201d.", "Here\u2019s one alternative explanation: states with high benefits have more knowledge-based industries. And it takes them longer to find the right employees. This is also consistent with (high benefit, high unemployment rate), but has nothing to do with people being lazy.", "Whether this explanation is right is beside the point. All I\u2019m saying is, let\u2019s slow down before we conclude that \u201cbenefits make people lazy, so we should cancel unemployment benefit\u201d.", "In the following discussion, I will start with question 3, so we get a bird\u2019s-eye view of the problem. Along the way, I will discuss some cool data analysis that tackles question 1 and 2.", "At its heart, finding the optimal social insurance design is a cost-benefit analysis. We want to help people who\u2019re down on their luck, through no fault their own. But we also admit that benefit encourages shirking. To find the optimal unemployment benefit level, we need to answers some basic questions:", "The optimal social insurance problem can be formalized as a dynamic programming problem. For details, PM me or read the paper by Professor Raj Chetty.", "A few notes about the notations here:", "By estimating a hazard model on the Continuous Wage and Benefit History, Meyer answered the following question:", "How does the hazard rate, defined as the (# of employed/#unemployed), respond to changes in unemployment benefit?", "A 10% increase in benefits results in a 9% decrease in hazard rate. This implies a 9% increase in expected unemployment duration!", "It is important to note the recent studies using bigger and better data, including one by Meyer himself, get smaller estimates around 5%.", "With increasingly granular survey data, economists now have a pretty good estimate on how much time people spend on a job search.", "The last piece of the missing puzzles is the U\u2019(C)s. It\u2019s easy to find consumption data, but not so easy to find utility functions. So what economists do is to back out the optimal benefit levels for a wide range of utility functions.", "If you believe people have constant relative risk aversion, with the consensus risk coefficient around 2, then the optimal benefit is 5% of total wage, much lower than what we have.", "40%, which means that 60% of the additional length of unemployment was used for finding a better match.", "Powerful insight: an increase in unemployment benefit does two things: give you money+ distort the relative wages (i.e. decreases the wage to benefit ratio).", "How do they affect your search effort? Intuitively, when you have more cash on hand, you feel less pressured to search for jobs you don\u2019t like (a.k.a. \u201cliquidity effect\u201d); when the wage to benefit ratio is low, you feel less motivated to work (a.k.a. \u201cmoral hazard\u201d).", "Both liquidity and moral hazard decrease your search effort \u2014 except that liquidity effect is desired, while moral hazard is not.", "Important insight: to estimate one effect, we need to mute the other effect.", "To estimate the moral hazard effect, look at people who already have enough money. These people would not have picked up undesirable jobs, even without any additional help. Effectively, the liquidity effect is muted.", "For people in the highest quartile of net wealth, there\u2019s no statistically significant increase in unemployment rate, when benefit level increases!", "Compare this with the graph for people in the lowest quartile of net wealth I showed you at the beginning of this blog: this suggests that a lot of poor people are pressured into accepting less than optimal jobs because they can\u2019t afford to wait!", "What if you agree with the Republican line of thinking, that rich people become rich precisely because they have better work ethics?", "The almighty Chetty has another paper with Card and Weber in 2007 to deal with this concern, using severance pay data from Austria\u2019s construction workers.", "Severance pay is a form of unemployment insurance that does not distort the attractiveness of working, relative to staying unemployed. So it would capture the liquidity effect, rather than the moral hazard effect. Effectively, we\u2019re muting the moral hazard channel, to estimate the liquidity effect.", "In Austria, you receive severance pay only when your job tenure exceeds 36 months. Let\u2019s compare the unemployment duration for people right below and above the 36-month threshold. These people should be pretty comparable.", "When people who don\u2019t have enough savings, they really need to search harder.", "The graph on the right suggests that workers are pressured into accepting less than ideal job matches, which translate into shorter subsequent job duration.", "A full discussion of the unemployment insurance literature is beyond the scope of this blog. But the takeaway lessons are clear:", "Whenever you see suggestive plots, ask yourself: are there any other narratives that could have generated this pattern?", "In this case, unemployment insurance is good because it helps people find better job matches (60%), but it also encourages some to procrastinate (40%).", "In the real world, any changes have cost and benefit. The real question is rarely \u201cyes or no\u201d, but rather, \u201cis it worth it?\u201d", "With better data and better design, scientists constantly update their estimate about key parameters. Even the Card, Chetty and Weber (2007) paper I discussed is not iron-clad. Can you discover the Achilles\u2019 heel?
