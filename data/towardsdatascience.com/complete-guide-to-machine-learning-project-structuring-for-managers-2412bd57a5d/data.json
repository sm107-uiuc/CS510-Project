Established companies are disrupting themselves and making a painfully slow shift towards becoming data-driven organizations, while startups need to implement clear and efficient data strategies to be relevant.", "Although the necessity of having a data strategy is now widely accepted across small and large companies, a common challenge remains: how to structure and manage a machine learning project?", "This article offers a framework to help you manage a machine learning project. Of course, you will have to adapt it to your company\u2019s specific needs, but it will get you in the right direction.", "For hands-on video tutorials on machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, checkout my YouTube channel.", "Of course, we need to start with why. Why is it important to develop an AI strategy within the company?", "The problem in machine learning projects is that there are a lot of ways to improve the performance of the model:", "However, pursuing the wrong strategy can result in an important loss of time and money. You could be spending six months collecting more data for training, only to realize that it barely improved your model. Similarly, you could blindly train your model longer (and pay for the extra computation time) and see no improvement at all.", "Hence the importance of well-defined AI strategy. It will help make the team more efficient and increase the ROI of your AI projects.", "The most effective machine learning practitioners have a clear view of what to tune in order to achieve better result.", "Orthogonalization refers to having a control with a very specific function.", "For example, an office chair has a lever to bring it up and down, while the wheels on the chair make it move horizontally. In this case, the lever is a control with the function of raising and lowering the chair. The wheels form a control with the function of moving the chair horizontally.", "Therefore, these controls are said to be orthogonal: rolling the chair on its wheels will not lower it, just like pulling the lever on the chair will not make it move backwards.", "The same concept must be applied to machine learning projects. A single modification to the project must have an impact on a single aspect. Otherwise, you will improve in an area, but will lower performance in another, and the project will be stuck.", "How does this translate to AI projects?", "First, we must consider the chain of assumptions in machine learning.", "It is assumed that if the model performs well on the training set, then it will perform well on the dev set, then it will perform well on the test set, then it will perform well in the real world.", "This is a fairly common list of assumptions across AI projects. Now, what the model does not perform well in one of these situations?", "The list above gives clear orthogonal controls to improve the model in very specific situations. Once your model performs well on one set, move on to improving it in another set.", "Now, how do you know if your model performs well?", "As outlined above, you need a clear goal to determine if a model is performing well. Hence the importance of setting an evaluation metric, as well as satisficing and optimizing metrics.", "Having a single evaluation metric allows for quicker assessment of an algorithm.", "For example, it is common to use precision and recall for a classifier. However, there is a trade off between these two metrics. Instead, use the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. Thus, a single metric is used, and it becomes much easier to assess the quality of different models and it speeds up iterations.", "Once you have a single evaluation metric, it is common to track other important metrics.", "For example, you might want to build a classifier with an F1 score of at least 0.90 and a runtime of less than 200ms. In this case, the F1 score is the optimizing metric, while the runtime is the satisficing metric.", "An optimizing metric will usually be the same as your evaluation metric, and you should only have one optimizing metric. The other metrics of interest will be satisficing metrics, and will help you choose the overall best model that satisfies the optimizing metric.", "The train, dev and test sets were mentioned above, but are they exactly?", "The training and development (or holdout) sets are used to train a model. The training set is usually used to fit the model to the data, and the development set is used to make predictions and tweak the model.", "Then, the test set is an example of real-life data on which you test the algorithm to see how it would perform.", "Once you have different datasets, you must make sure that the distribution is representative of the data you expect to get in the future.", "For example, if you wish to create a model to label images from mobile uploads, it does not make sense to train the model on high-resolution images from the internet. Mobile uploads are likely to be lower in resolution, the pictures can be blurry, and the objects might not be perfectly centered. Therefore, the train/dev/test sets should contain that type of images.", "Also, you want each set to come from the same distribution. For example, you are building a model to predict client churn, and 6% of your dataset contains instances of churn. Then, your train, dev, and test set should also have roughly 6% of the data as churn instances.", "How large should each set be?", "Typically, the split used to be 60/20/20 for the train/dev/test set respectively. This is still valid if data is not very abundant.", "However, in the case where you have millions of instances, a more appropriate split would be 98/1/1, because the model can still be validated on more than 10 000 data points.", "Recently, we started seeing headlines where AI systems outperform humans or come very close to human performance.", "Unfortunately, humans are very good at a lot of tasks and it is very hard to get AI systems close to our performance. Colossal amounts of data are required, and your model\u2019s performance will eventually plateau, making it hard to improve.", "In the case that your model is overfitting, you mus reduce variance by:", "In the case that your model is underfitting the data, you must then reduce bias by:", "If none of the methods above have a significant impact, then getting data labeled by humans is the next step. Although costly and arduous, this step will bring your model as close as possible to human-level performance.", "Building an AI system is an iterative process. It is important to build fast, test, and improve. Do not aim to build a very complex system at first, but do not build something too simple.", "I hope this helps you better manage and plan your AI project. The potential of AI is huge in many industries and seizing this opportunity is important. Having a clear AI strategy will help you surf the wave instead of being engulfed.", "Your home for data science.
