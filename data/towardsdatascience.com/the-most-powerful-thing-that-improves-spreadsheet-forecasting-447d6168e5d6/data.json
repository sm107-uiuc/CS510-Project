The topic had turned to forecasting budgets and schedules when the instructor suddenly asked, \u201cHow many of you have ever taken a proofreading class?\u201d No hands in the air. The next question was more rhetorical and went something like \u201cmost of you will be doing most of the time is reviewing and proofreading, yet you have never been trained in it?\u201d It had the desired effect \u2014 over the next few years, I took several classes in proofreading textual documents, plans & specifications, and spreadsheets.", "The single biggest thing you can do to improve your spreadsheets is to develop a proofreading checklist. I know that is both boring and old school. There is some truth to that. On the other hand, I am not suggesting a gut-wrenching standard format, or a burdensome quality assurance program, or even highly technical debugging protocols. Just a simple Proofreading Checklist that you follow every time you develop a spreadsheet will provide reliable, understandable, and insightful results.", "A checklist is defined as a list of items required, things to be done, or points to be considered, used as a reminder. In practice, checklists are used to better organize assignments and to easily verify the most important tasks. In business processes, checklists help reduce errors and ensure consistency and completeness. Checklists are not substitutes for policies or procedures.", "Your grocery list is the simplest example. It reminds you what is important and helps you to not forget something; however, it doesn\u2019t help is developing the policies of what you should (or should not) eat nor does it instruct you on how to travel to the store or the order to proceed with your shopping.", "There are three major areas and several sub-areas that should be included in a proofreading checklist.", "An influence diagrams is a visual display of a problem that depicts objectives, key elements, and dependencies. Influences among the different aspects are shown by connecting arrows. Influence diagrams are a normal part of most advanced computer programming but are woefully overlooked or skipped in the world of spreadsheets. Influence diagrams are important because they enable someone who is proofing the spreadsheet to visually (and easily) understand the problem and its boundaries.", "Use \u201cInfluence Diagram\u201d as the single line in your Proofreading Checklist. The most important thing is to build the visual diagram on what you are setting out to accomplish with your spreadsheet. Yes, there are other preliminaries like problem statement, boundary conditions, data verification, choosing the right tool (i.e., do you really want to use a spreadsheet?), and validation of results. Let the influence diagram keep it simple, concise, and visual.", "The top level of Proofreading Checklist is made up of three primary categories: the model calculates results without crashing; the model calculations do what is intended (logic errors); and, the model is well constructed and easily transferable to someone else. There are many ways to address each of these categories. The most important issue is that the review activity includes at least one activity in each category. Great minds will differ on the detailed activities and, as always, it is a matter of preference in some cases.", "The most finesse associated with making sure the model calculations do what is intended is to stress test the model with a full range of inputs. In other words, it is often difficult to understand full functionality with just examination of the base case. Otherwise, Excel does a good job of providing error messages and clues for fixing the basic calculation issues.", "Identifying and treating logic errors is the most difficult aspect. Some activities under this activity can include: creating separate summary charts, especially when time-series analysis is being performed; examine performance ratios outside those calculated in the model; recalculating and re-aggregating outputs differently and compare sensibility against model; and performing sensitivity analysis. Spotting logic errors requires a structured approach, some extra work \u2018outside\u2019 the model, and an instinct as to what intuitively makes sense.", "One more unique and underutilized approach related to sensitivity diagrams, including those used probabilistic methods. A common form of sensitivity diagram is the tornado diagram which depicts more important sources of uncertainty with wide bars at the top and less important sources of uncertainty with narrow bars at the bottom. The proofreading check is that all the bars should touch the central vertical line that represents some form of total cost or revenue. If a bar does not touch the vertical line. Then that input has no impact on the outcome of the model. There is a good chance the model is not working as intended. Create the tornado diagram and look for the \u201cflying bars\u201d.", "Reviewing a model to determine whether it is well constructed, understandable, and transferable to someone else is a function of good practices, documentation, and version control. Some of these will be discussed in the subsequent section. However, the overarching takeaway is the recognition that the spreadsheet will be passed onto someone else for use and review.", "The third and final level of the Proofreading Checklist includes 5 to 10 items that an organization or analytical team agree are most important. Again, there are numerous spreadsheet standards that are very detailed and with which there is much debate. The point here is to have some basic standards and not every possible standard included. Remember checklists are used in practice to better organize assignments and to easily verify the most important tasks. Checklists are not intended to be full policy documents or standard operating procedures.", "Eight potential candidates for good practices include:", "1. Include an input tab and a results tab", "2. Color code cells differently for inputs, outputs, and calculations", "3. In equations, use input names rather than cell references (Battleship language)", "4. Input names should be one or two words", "5. Lower case letters should be used in all equations", "6. Use a working model, and label the working model different than master version", "7. Specify code review tools and approaches that are used for quality assurance", "8. Identify if (and where) legacy code was imported and utilized", "The single biggest thing you can do to improve your spreadsheets is to develop a proofreading checklist. There are many standards for spreadsheet development and many more for debugging code. However, as the old saying goes, don\u2019t miss the forest for the trees. In practice, we commonly abandon the most important aspect of a quality analysis. As with models, start simple and build complexity. Develop and maintain a basic Proofreading Checklist.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Creator of www.communicatingwithfinesse.com.
