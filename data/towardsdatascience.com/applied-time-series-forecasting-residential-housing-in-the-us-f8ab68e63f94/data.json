New residential house construction was down to about 1 million in April. As of July 1.5 million new houses are under construction (for comparison, in July of 2019 it was 1.3 million). The Census Bureau report released on August 18 shows some pretty good indicators for the housing market.", "New house construction plays a significant role in the economy. Besides generating employment it simultaneously impacts timber, furniture and appliance markets. It\u2019s also an important indicator of the overall health of the economy.", "So one might ask, how will this crucial economic indicator play out the next few months and years to come after the COVID19 shock?", "Answering these questions requires some forecasting.", "The purpose of this article is to make short and medium-term forecasting of residential construction using a popular time series forecasting model called ARIMA.", "Even if you are not much into the housing market but are interested in data science, this is a practical forecasting example that might help you understand how forecasting works and how to implement a model in real-world application cases.", "The objective is forecasting the construction of residential housing units in the short and medium-term using historical data obtained from census.gov database. Note that in the Census Bureau database, you\u2019ll see there\u2019re several datasets on housing indicators including \u201chousing units started\u201d and \u201chousing units completed\u201d; I\u2019m using the latter for this article.", "Census Bureau is a great source of time series data of all kinds on a large number of social, economic and business indicators. So if you are interested in time series analysis and modeling and want to avoid toy datasets, the Census Bureau is a great place to check out.", "I am doing the modeling in R programming environment. Python has great libraries for data science and machine learning modeling, but in my opinion, R has the best package, calledfpp2, developed by Rob J Hyndman, for time series forecasting.", "There are many methods for time series forecasting, and I have written about them in a few articles before (you can check out this and this), but for this analysis I am going to use ARIMA. Before settling on ARIMA I ran a couple of other models \u2014 Holt-Winter and ETS \u2014 but found that ARIMA has a better performance for this particular dataset.", "The only library I am using is fpp2. If you install this library all required dependencies will accompany.", "After importing data in the R programming environment (RStudio) I call the head() function.", "I noticed that the first few rows are empty, so I opened the CSV file outside of R to manually inspect for missing values and found that the first data did not appear until January of 1968. So I got rid of the missing values with a simple function na.omit().", "As you notice in the dataframe above, it has two columns \u2014 time stamp and the corresponding values. You might think it is already a time series data so let\u2019s go ahead and build the model. Not so fast, the dataframe may look like a time series but it\u2019s not in a format that is compatible with the modeling package.", "So we need to do some data processing.", "As a side note, not just this dataset, any dataset you use for this kind of analysis in any package, you need to do pre-processing. This is an extra step but a necessary one. After all, this is not a cleaned, toy dataset that you typically find on the internet!", "The codes above are self-explanatory. Since we got rid of the \u201cPeriod\u201d column, I had to tell the program that the values start from 1968 and it\u2019s an annual time series with 12-month frequency.", "The original data was in long-form, now after processing it is converted to a wide-form so you can now see a lot of data in a small window.", "We are now done with data processing. Was that easy to process data for time series compared to other machine learning algorithms? I bet it was.", "Now that we have the data that we needed, shall we go ahead and build the model?", "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) may not seem like a pre-requisite, but in my opinion it is! And it\u2019s for two reasons. First, without EDA you are absolutely blinded, you will have no idea what\u2019s going into the model. You kind of need to know what raw material is going into the final product, don\u2019t you?", "The second reason is an important one. As you will see later, I had to test the model on two different input data series for model performance. I only did this extra step after I discovered that the time series is not smooth, it has a structural break, which influenced the model performance (check out the figure below, do you see the structural break?).", "The nice thing about the fpp2package is that you don\u2019t have to separately install visualization libraries, it\u2019s already built-in.", "It\u2019s just one single plot above, but there is so much going on. If you are a data scientist, you could stop here and take a closer look and find out how many bits of information you could extract from this figure.", "So much information you are able to extract from just a simple figure and these are all useful bits of information for building intuition before building models. That is why EDA is so essential in data science.", "The overall trend in the series is already visible in the first figure, but if you want better visibility of the trend you can do that by removing seasonality.", "After seeing the general annual trend if you want to only focus on seasonality you could do that too with a seasonal sub-series plot.", "There is a nice way to show everything in one figure \u2014 it\u2019s called the decomposition plot. Basically it is a composite of four information:", "The random data part is in this decomposition plot is the most interesting to me, since this component actually determines the uncertainty in forecasting. The smaller this random component the better.", "We could also zoom in on a specific part of the data series. For example, below I zoomed in to see the good times (1995\u20132005) and bad times (2006\u20132016) in the housing market.", "Enough of exploratory analysis, now let\u2019s move on to the fun part of model building, shall we?", "I already mentioned the rationale behind choosing ARIMA for this forecasting and it is because I tested the data with two other models but ARIMA showed a better performance.", "Once you have your data preprocessed and ready to use, building the actual model is surprisingly easy. As an aside, it is also the case in most modeling exercise; writing codes and executing models is a small part of the whole process you need to go through \u2014 from data gathering & cleaning, to building intuition to finding the right model.", "I followed 5 simple steps for implementing ARIMA:", "1 ) determining the predictors series", "4 ) making a point forecast for a specific year", "Below you get all the codes needed for model implementation.", "Like I said before, I ran ARIMA with two different data series, the first one was the whole data series from 1968 to 2020. As you see below, the forecasted values are kind of flat (red series) and come with a lot of uncertainties.", "The forecast looked a bit unrealistic to me given the trend over the last 10 years. You might think it is due to COVID19 impact? I don\u2019t think so, because the model shouldn\u2019t have picked up that signal just yet since COVID impact is a tiny part of the whole series.", "Then I realized that this uncertainty is because of the historical features in the series, including the uneven cycles and trend and the structural break. So I made the decision to use the last 10 years data as a predictor.", "The figure below is how it looks like once we use a subset of the series as a predictor. You can just visually compare the forecast area and the associated uncertainties (in red) between the two figures.", "Below is more a quantitative way of comparing the performance of two models based on two input series. As you can see both the AIC and RMSE have dramatically declined to give the second model a solid performance.", "Enough about the model building process, but this article is about doing an actual forecast with a real-world dataset. Below are the forecast values for new residential house construction in the United States.", "If the residential house construction continues along with the trend, 300K new residential housing units are expected to be built over the next 5 years. But this needs to be closely watched as the impact of COVID19 shock might be more apparent in the next few months.", "I probably could\u2019ve gotten a better model by tuning parameters or finding another model, but I wanted to keep it simple. In fact, as the adage goes, all models are wrong but some are useful. Hopefully, this AIMA model was useful in understanding some market dynamics.", "Your home for data science.
