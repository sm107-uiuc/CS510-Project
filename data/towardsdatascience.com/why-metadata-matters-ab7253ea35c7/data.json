Blockchain technology is evolving rapidly, unlocking new opportunities for science and scientists.", "At Frankl, we\u2019re excited about the possibilities for the not too distant future. But our immediate concern is to provide pragmatic solutions that can be implemented today.", "Our first step towards a blockchainified science involves metadata. By that we mean data about the data (when it was collected, what software was used, where it\u2019s stored and so on) but not the actual data itself.", "It sounds simple \u2014 and possibly quite boring). But putting metadata on the blockchain is ultimately a very powerful remedy to one of science\u2019s biggest and oldest problems.", "When we look at problems affecting science today, one of the most pressing issues is disappearing data.", "Scientific data can go \u201cabsent without leave\u201d for a number of different reasons:", "The end result is what\u2019s become known as the \u201cfile drawer problem\u201d. The published scientific literature represents only a small and biased sample of the research that has actually been conducted. The rest is stuffed away at the back of the metaphorical filing cabinet.", "There\u2019s a lot of wasted effort here \u2014 data collected and then not used. But the bigger problem is the bias in what is published.", "An example of this \u201cpublication bias\u201d comes from my own research on autism.", "In 2011, my colleagues and I published a study in which we gave a group of university students a simple \u201cvisual search\u201d task that involved locating small objects in a complex display. We found that students with high levels of autism-like personality traits performed better on the task than those with fewer such traits.", "It was an interesting finding because many studies have shown that people with an actual clinical diagnosis of autism also perform very well on such tasks. So our results were consistent with the idea that autism lies on a continuum that fades into the general population.", "Another group in Western Australia reported similar findings around the same time, so we felt confident that this was a real effect. But a few years later, I was asked to peer review a study by researchers at Cambridge University. They had followed our methods exactly but with a much bigger sample \u2014 and found absolutely no effect.", "At this point, I started asking other researchers in the field if they had looked at the same question. It turned out that several labs had done so, but hadn\u2019t published their results because they didn\u2019t find an effect.", "This is just one example. But publication bias is a major problem throughout science. If we want to know whether an effect is real or not \u2014whether that effect involves correlates of autistic traits or the efficacy of the latest cancer drug \u2014 we need to see the data in its messy totality. We don\u2019t just want the data that tells a good story.", "Scientists waste a huge amount of time and money on research that is effectively redundant \u2014 because the research has already been done but was considered unpublishable, or because it\u2019s attempting to build on research that itself doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny.", "In a 2016 survey of over 1500 scientists, published in Nature, \u201cSelective Reporting\u201d was rated as the most important cause of irreproducible results.", "The first step is that we need to know about all the data. And this is where blockchain can play a really important role.", "At Frankl, we\u2019re building apps that facilitate open science by design. Data collected using Frankl apps will be archived on the fly (no more relying on dodgy hard-drives). Sharing data then becomes a simple exercise in changing the access privileges.", "Where and in what form that data is archived will depend on a number of factors including the size of the data files, its private or public nature, as well as any ethical and legal considerations such as GDPR compliance. This will naturally vary from project to project and will evolve with technology.", "But whatever happens to the actual data, the default setting will be for the metadata to be written to the blockchain. Whenever a Frankl app is used to collect data, a smart contract within the application will write a short message to the blockchain. This could include:", "[The hash is a short character string derived from the data. You can\u2019t recover the data from the hash. But if have the data, you can match it to the hash in the metadata and confirm that it hasn\u2019t been altered.]", "Writing metadata to the blockchain is a simple and easy first step. It depends only on existing technology (there\u2019s no reliance on tech that is still in beta version). The metadata itself is small so the cost (i.e., \u2018gas\u2019) involved in writing to the blockchain is also small. And because there\u2019s absolutely nothing that would allow anyone to identify the subjects of the research, there should be no ethical or privacy issues to contend with.", "Yet even this small step is incredibly powerful. Because the blockchain is public and immutable, there\u2019s no pretending that inconvenient data don\u2019t exist. If scientists exclude data from their reported analyses, they have to justify it.", "Public, immutable metadata helps prevent the actual data disappearing. It makes it easier to conduct meta-analyses that combine the results of different studies looking at the same effect (which can now include studies that haven\u2019t been published and perhaps never will). It also provides a mechanism by which scientists can demonstrate their contribution to a collaborative project.", "The beauty of metadata is not just its simplicity but its generality. We can employ the same structure to the metadata regardless of how large the related data file is, how it\u2019s organised, where it\u2019s stored, or even what scientific field it pertains to.", "Metadata on the blockchain can be the thread that links all Frankl projects, the foundation on which all future developments build. It\u2019s the first small but important step towards a blockchainified science \u2014 and away from science as normal.", "At Frankl, our mission is to make open science easy and rewarding for scientists. If you\u2019d like to know more, the best place to start is our Medium page.", "You can also read our whitepaper, check out our website, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or join our Telegram channel.", "We love feedback (positive and negative), so please let us know what you think \u2014 write a response or just hit the \u2665 button and share this post with friends and colleagues.", "Your home for data science.
