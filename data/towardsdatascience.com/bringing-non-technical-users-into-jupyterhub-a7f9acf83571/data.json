JupyterHub is a separate project that can be configured on a web server, allowing an organisation to centrally manage a server which hosts multiple Jupyter notebook environments \u2014 one or more for each member of a data science team. As well as standardising the users\u2019 development environment and taking the maintenance burden off individual data scientists, JupyterHub provides an authentication framework \u2014 for example, enabling single-sign-on access based on corporate email accounts.", "There have always been ways to share file systems with other team members, but JupyterHub is usually seen as a way to organise data scientists\u2019 experimentation \u2014 and non-technical colleagues aren\u2019t invited. Maybe a data scientist talks a client through a notebook while they are both looking at the same screen. And maybe sometimes, most likely ill-fated, a non-technical user is given a JupyterHub account with instructions to shift+enter their way through a notebook so they can study the results for themselves\u2026", "New projects over the last couple of years have come together to allow JupyterHub to do much more. This article describes how you can bring other free open source projects into your JupyterHub to turn it into a useful tool for showcasing your notebook results in a secure, automated, and user-friendly fashion.", "Crucially, if you or your IT department have the resources to configure a JupyterHub then you only need to extend the configuration in order to bring in this extra functionality.", "The workflow we are trying to achieve:", "The key piece of technology that brings this magic to JupyterHub is Voila, a user-friendly version of the Jupyter server that hides the code cells and runs the notebook as a web app.", "A few other obscure open source projects also contribute to making this happen, and all of the glue is mixed together by a new JupyterHub extension called Dashboards.", "There are three main ways to install JupyerHub on a server(s) for your organisation:", "We\u2019ll mostly assume you are going with TLJH, but steps for your own manual installation will be similar.", "The initial installation and setup of TLJH is described for various cloud providers (or your own server) in TLJH\u2019s Installation docs.", "Docker is a truly revolutionary technology that allows us to run each Jupyter notebook server as an isolated (and lightweight) virtual machine such that we don\u2019t need to worry about the JupyterHub process itself, or our multiple users\u2019 servers, conflicting with each other.", "This virtualisation is possible to set up without Docker \u2014 indeed, the default TLJH installation builds carefully-constructed process isolation natively on the server. The real genius of Docker from Dashboard\u2019s point of view is being able to easily instruct Docker to take a snapshot of the Jupyter environment so we can instantly spin up a new clone of it, except this time starting it with the user-friendly Voila front-end instead of the regular Jupyter interface.", "We need to instruct JupyterHub to start up new individual Jupyter servers using \u2018DockerSpawner\u2019.", "If your TLJH installation isn\u2019t running Docker yet, please see the instructions here.", "UPDATE: The latest version of ContainDS does not require Docker! Instructions for installing without Docker are here.", "Everything so far has given us a standard The Littlest JupyterHub setup.", "The final configuration step is to install ContainDS Dashboards. This adds an extra \u2018Dashboards\u2019 menu to JupyterHub where you can create or view dashboards that other users have made.", "SSH into your server, if not still there, and run:", "Add an extra piece of config telling TLJH to load in the Dashboards piece:", "Into the vi editor, paste the following:", "(If not familiar with the vi text editor: when it starts, press \u2018i\u2019 for insert mode; paste the text; press escape then type \u2018:wq\u2019 and enter to write the file and quit.)", "To try this out and check your JupyterHub is working:", "Access your JupyterHub installation from a web browser and see that it\u2019s all still running as expected.", "In your JupyterHub, click into \u2018My Server\u2019 to access your Jupyter notebook server. Create whatever prototype or visualisation you might want to produce and share. To follow along with this tutorial, you can find a simple example here to paste into your notebook cells or just upload as an ipynb file.", "When you\u2019re ready to share, click back to the \u2018Control Panel\u2019, and then into the new \u2018Dashboards\u2019 menu:", "Click \u2018New Dashboard\u2019 and fill in the screen:", "The most important things are to enter a name and then to select the Jupyter server you were working on to clone into a dashboard. In this case, there is only our \u2018Default Server\u2019 to choose.", "You will see ContainDS build out the new dashboard. When it\u2019s ready, you\u2019ll be able to click into it to see your shiny new user-friendly dashboard:", "The process to create the dashboard is simple, but the real power of this setup shines through when your non-technical colleagues or clients get to see your work for themselves \u2014 and not in a way that involves them reading through your code!", "When another user logs in to JupyterHub and clicks on the Dashboards menu they will be able to see all dashboards created by other users. See our \u2018Graph\u2019 dashboard under \u2018Dashboards from others\u2019:", "The other user can click into the dashboard and interact with it in the user friendly form \u2014 all securely, and without having to shift+enter through your code, or even see any of it!", "Behind the scenes, ContainDS Dashboards used Docker to clone the original Jupyter server as an \u2018image\u2019. It then started a new server based on that image, except this time running it through Voila\u2019s server rather than the regular Jupyter server.", "Whichever user owns the dashboard can see the dashboard version of the server on their Home page:", "If they stop and/or delete it, that\u2019s fine. A new dashboard server will be started if any other user attempts to view the dashboard again.", "As far as JupyterHub is concerned, the dashboard server is just another Jupyter server, and it\u2019s now running independently of your original Jupyter server. That means you can go back and make changes to your notebooks without impacting the dashboard. And users of the dashboard won\u2019t affect your original notebooks.", "There are options in ContainDS Dashboards configuration allowing you to hide the dashboard servers list so your users don\u2019t need to worry about them.", "Everything here is built upon established technology \u2014 most notably Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub. That means the core of the infrastructure described here is easily accessible to you or your IT department.", "A few recent developments have arisen to make this dashboard solution possible: Voila itself, and a small project called jhsingle-native-proxy that provides the Jupyter-Hub authentication around Voila. Then of course, ContainDS Dashboards ties everything together.", "In a project-based data science team, each data scientist may be best placed to tackle the problem brief in their own Jupyter environment. Often, a disruptive ad-hoc process is used to move the results into a web server or other deployment system so non-technical clients or colleagues can fully appreciate the models demonstrated in the notebooks.", "My hope is that this new ability to produce secure and reliable \u2018dashboard\u2019 versions of the notebook will make it enjoyable and informative for data scientists to involve non-technical stakeholders. Being able to do this automatically and instantly means that sharing results does not need to wait until the very end of a project \u2014 and then become a long and painful process which risks the reliability of the results themselves.", "Your home for data science.
