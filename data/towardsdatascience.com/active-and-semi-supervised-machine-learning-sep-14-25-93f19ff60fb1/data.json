The basic idea is that the data (both labelled and unlabelled) is represented by nodes in a graph, and the relationships between datapoints correspond to the graph\u2019s edges. In this blogpost from Google AI, the task of assigning emotion labels to words is considered. First, words are represented by their embeddings, then edges are drawn based on the similarities between the different embedding vectors. This being semi-supervised learning, some of the nodes are labelled, but most are not. The labels (e.g., \u201cfunny\u201d, \u201csad\u201d, etc) are then made to propagate throughout the graph, looking roughly like this:", "So, that is the basic idea, now let us get back to what made it to the arXiv over these past two weeks. Graph-based semi-supervised learning + convolutional networks, does life (at least, that of a machine learning engineer) get any better? Well, it just might! Enter contrastive learning:", "Contrastive learning is a class of self-supervised approaches which trains an encoder to be contrastive between the representations that depict statistical dependencies of interest and those that do not.", "The vanilla contrastive learning in itself cannot help you when it comes to supervised tasks (e.g. classification). Fortunately, the authors of Contrastive and Generative Graph Convolutional Networks for Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning found a way around that by incorporating the information about the available labels into the loss function:", "It is well understood that in the end, your model can only be as good as your data. Among other things, this means that whatever biases were present in the data, they will be very much a part of the model as well. So if you consider our history, it is no wonder that Fairness is not only one of the six pillars of the moral foundations theory, but also a subject of active research in the field of AI. The metrics to determine the fairness of a system tend to be fairly ad hoc, but usually amount to determining certain characteristics that the results should not depend on, and making sure that it is indeed the case. You know, like race and gender vs. whether the person will be called in for a job interview, that sort of thing. Anyway, there are certain differences between how this subject is approached in supervised and unsupervised scenarios, so I am happy to see that the semi-supervised community is looking into it as well:", "Something that is common across many different semi-supervised learning approaches is the idea of clustering. You take your data, group it into clusters, then assign labels based on the datapoints that are annotated. There is one assumption in this process that we often take for granted in machine learning: that is, having datapoints. Namely, separate data instances, rather than having a, for lack of a better word, lump of data. What if you are dealing with sequential data though? For instance, the kind of data that your smart devices are constantly collecting about you and your environment: e.g. your sleep tracker. In order to perform clustering on this kind of data, the sequence first needs to be broken up into segments. Both segmentation and labelling are costly tasks to carry out, so there is a clear need for semi-supervised approaches fit to handle sequential data. In Semi-supervised sequence classification through change point detection, the authors apply \u201cchange point detection methods \u2026 to identify points within a sequence corresponding to likely class changes\u201d:", "The performance of a machine learning model trained in a semi-supervised fashion often strongly depends on the choice of which training samples had been annotated. However, the quality of those annotations is equally important: in fact, the fewer labelled samples we have, the more it matters. In the real world, annotations are hardly 100% accurate, and this problem must be dealt with in order to achieve the optimal performance of the final model. The authors of Identifying noisy labels with a transductive semi-supervised leave-one-out filter propose a method to remove the labels deemed likely to be incorrect:", "the authors considered two training approaches to pool-based active learning: incremental and cumulative. For each iteration of the active learning loop, incremental training corresponds to fine-tuning the model on the newly added labels only, whereas cumulative training means that we retrain the model on all of the currently available labels from scratch. In my own implementation, I actually used something in between: fine-tuning the model rather than retraining, but on the entire updated labelled set. I found this to work reasonably well:", "But, back to the preprint! The authors take MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, start labelling them 120 images at a time, and compare the performance of the models obtained via incremental and cumulative training methods for three query strategies: random (not much of a strategy per se), margin, and entropy uncertainty samplings. By the way, if you would like a reminder of what the latter two are, might I interest you in:", "When it comes to data annotation, we are usually after the labels. However, the reasoning behind the annotator\u2019s choice can provide valuable insight into the nature of the task. This kind of information is not easy to include in the machine learning process, which makes the following work all the more interesting:", "How does ALICE function, exactly? Let\u2019s say you are doing active learning for a bird classification problem. The model will first pick out those images, for which it is having a hard time deciding between two classes. (Kind of like margin sampling, except that in the paper they consider the distance between training instances in the feature space rather than the class probabilities predicted by the model.) Then it will ask the annotator to not only label the image, but also to say how she differentiates between the two classes:", "This information will then be parsed into a machine-friendly form, and used to increase the model\u2019s performance.", "These are the preprints that stood out the most to me in these two weeks. What about you, any of these caught your eye? Was there anything that I missed?", "Your home for data science.
