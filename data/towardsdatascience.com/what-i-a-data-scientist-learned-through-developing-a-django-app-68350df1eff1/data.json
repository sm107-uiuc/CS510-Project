Although Covid-19 immediately impacted on our economic system, I was still feeling safe in my smart working data scientist role. I was wrong.", "My work was to produce machine learning models for a famous cruise brand, that aimed to keep under control environmental impact during fleet navigation. As you can imagine, cruises business had a rough stop during the current pandemic and a lot of related activity with them.", "With all the activity stopped, I started to invest my time in studying more, elaborating new technologies and trying to build a bigger network.", "My company had a trump card in store for me, though. To continue a full-time job, they proposed to me to develop the backend of a fantasy tennis application with whom we were collaborating.", "I wasn\u2019t entirely convinced, because of my lack of software development expertise, in particular using the famous Django framework. However, I would never have tried my hand at building an application, but I would have continued on my path as a data scientist. This unexpected change allowed me to do something I wasn\u2019t going to do and maybe learn new useful notions that would complete me as a professional working in the world of data and technology in general.", "This intuition proved to be correct, and since I will soon be a scientist again, I want to tell you what I have learned from these months of Django development in a few brief considerations. Don\u2019t worry! It is a few minutes read.", "I\u2019ve read it so many times and, I\u2019ve always tried to write neat, legible code. However, nothing makes you understand how important it is to follow good-programming rules better than to change code written by others before you, without too much documentation or a thorough handover before you start.", "Many of you who read this will say that they are very good at it, just like I used to say. I have found, however, that the way data scientists program is focused on data, the ETL process and the result. We usually operate in a defined and limited context. Contributing to the development of software has widened my view of programming and made me understand many small unspoken rules that will surely help me in my daily work.", "What rules? To name a few: intelligent comments; order of functions in the code and nomenclature of variables; the subdivision of classes into packages; making good imports, not reinventing the wheel etc.", "You can check out this GitHub repo that contains a python adaptation of Clean Code famous book.", "Lately, I have read many posts and various news about the diffusion of tools for the development of data science applications and prototypes through the different IDEs in circulation. However, for both laziness and convenience, I have always used Jupyter notebook to build my prototypes. Notebooks are a crazy and immediate tool and, as much as in the past I wanted to be \u201ccool\u201d and program using real IDEs, in the end, I gave in and went back to my dear old Jupyters.", "We can consider this point a subset of the previous one. I have personally used PyCharm for development and, I enjoyed it very much, especially in the help this tool gives you in writing higher quality code. With all the advice (and typos correction) that this tool provides, you get the impression that you have a helper next to your chair who shows you where you\u2019re going wrong. Not bad indeed.", "One point in favour of IDEs is the possibility to insert breakpoints and follow the flow of our program and how the variables are populated with extreme ease.The result is a clear and more immediate debugging compared to all the print and log lists that can be manually inserted inside the code (and that we can forget inside).", "Will I use PyCharm also for the development of machine learning models? Definitely not in the initial phase, but it\u2019s a good choice when the initial explorations and machine learning models are defined and, you move on to code reinforcement phase and pipeline building.", "If interested in IDEs for python programming, you can take a look here.", "I\u2019ve always been a Git fan, but, I\u2019ve often worked alone or with a few colleagues, each of whom had their own portion of the project and their reference notebook. Rarely did the code written by one person impact the work of the others. Most of the time, I just needed Git to save my code somewhere safe.", "During this project, I needed to pay attention to code versions and learned what are the potentialities of a powerful tool as Git is. I had to do immediate interventions in production, to go back to previous and safer versions and go bug hunting. I had direct control over the code and made the necessary changes between a run and another. Now it is a different story.", "The possibility to create branches parallel to the main version of the software avoids the production of many files named in several different ways, as we data scientist are used to, like \u201cetl_production.ipynb\u201d, \u201cetl_with_new_feature.ipynb\u201d, \u201cmodel_new_v2_I_hope_this_is_the_last.ipynb\u201d etcetera. It is a huge upgrade, indeed.", "You can read an interesting article from Anne Bonner if you want start using Git and GitHub.", "It may seem trivial, but producing APIs is a good way to understand how things work back there. This project helped me understand what are the user\u2019s needs, the format in which it is best to provide the required information and how to optimize the parameters of the request itself.", "In the past, I had to build web services to provide the output of some machine learning models. Both for simplicity and lack of organization I had produced large APIs responsible for entire model training processes and production of results. Each of these calls needed a lot of parameters, and, the chances of confusions were high. My mistake was to assume that on the other side there was a human user who had to fill in manually every single request.", "Now I tend to develop small, understandable and debuggable APIs that can be cascaded and are easy to incorporate into an application.", "Also, I finally understand how important it is to handle all the different exceptions the request can go through and help the user in understanding the problem and maybe to formulate a correct request. Always check HTTP status codes.", "I definitely consider myself a better machine learning engineer now!", "Actually, I don\u2019t have any reference for this point, can you suggest me something interesting?", "There is a subtle feeling of superiority in the network that data handlers have over developers. What I can assure you is that developing is a hard job and that surely having one or more development experiences would be gold for many data scientists. I have always had the idea that the data scientist must be a link between purely technical figures and business. However, knowing how to do different things is a plus and helps you to anticipate the effort and complications of a project or a simple idea when you put it into practice.", "If you have the time and the possibility to code, so do it!", "Have you ever had similar or contrasting experience? You can tell me about them via Linkedin or below in the comments.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Bioengineer from Italy, Data Scientist at Boehringer Ingelheim.
