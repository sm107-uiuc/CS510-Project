For the past 15 years, I was doing independent Oracle consulting, mainly related to Oracle Developer tools and Java. I love to share my knowledge with the community, I posted 1030 blog entries with sample code from 2006 till 2020, most of them were Oracle technology related. My blog is well known in the Oracle community, I\u2019m Oracle Groundbreaker Ambassador and conference speaker (I was presenting every year from 2007 till 2018 at Oracle Open World and Oracle Code One conferences in San Francisco). When I was doing my Masters back in 2004, I was researching Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. However, it happened I moved to the enterprise domain and started to work with Oracle tools. It was an awesome time with Oracle, as an independent consultant I traveled the world, met many wonderful people and worked in Canada, USA, South Africa, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and European countries. In late 2017 I decided to change the way I work and start my own product Katana ML development (business automation with Machine Learning). Since then I decided to focus on Open Source and TensorFlow in particular. Getting TensorFlow Developer Certificate helps to come closer to my goal to move from traditional programming to become Machine Learning developer.", "Why did I decide to jump into Machine Learning? I believe Machine Learning is the programming model of the future. This is the main reason for me. Of course, it would not replace all traditional programming use cases, but it opens a completely new way to build software. See this excellent explanation diagram by Laurence Moroney, taken from his Youtube video \u2014 Machine Learning Foundations: Ep #1 \u2014 What is ML?:", "This diagram summarises the key difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning. Perfect example \u2014 with traditional programming you could calculate when a person is walking, running, or biking (using speed). But how to calculate if a person is playing golf? This is where Machine Learning strength is coming into play \u2014 it can handle these complex cases, which otherwise would be simply impossible to code. This example is from Laurence Moroney video \u2014 Machine Learning Foundations: Ep #1 \u2014 What is ML?:", "Your first stop should be TensorFlow Certificate program website. There you will find the candidate handbook. This document lists all the skills required to pass the exam. This list is pretty long, but don\u2019t get scared \u2014 it is doable.", "I wasn\u2019t doing micro-planning for exam preparation, I\u2019m not a big fan of using various planning apps. I prefer to follow the high-level plan which I keep in my mind, quite convenient :)", "My high-level plan was, which I followed closely (I should mention, I already had \u00b12 years working experience with TensorFlow) to pass the exam successfully:", "Item 3 is strongly recommended on the certificate website. I would recommend going through items 4 and 5 too, in case you don\u2019t have time to read books 1 and 2. You should go carefully through the material on Coursera. Don\u2019t jump and skip any notebooks. Don\u2019t copy-paste code, learn to implement use cases by yourself from scratch. This will help during the exam.", "It wasn\u2019t the only goal simply to pass the exam. I was studying in detail and spending a fair amount of time to improve my TensorFlow skills, this was the main point to take the exam for me (very good motivation to study).", "Do your coding in PyCharm while preparing for the exam. If you will be confident with PyCharm, this will definitely help during the exam. PyCharm offers API autocomplete and this is a big deal \u2014 it will speed up your coding and reduce mistakes.", "It took me around 6 weeks of focused study before I was confident to take the exam. I wasn\u2019t studying full time, I do work too. I help to look after my 9 months son, and you may know \u2014 sometimes it can become pretty hectic :)", "After completing the preparation, I didn\u2019t go for the exam immediately. I planned to have an exam in the next 3 or 4 days. I did this on purpose, to settle knowledge in the brain, and go to the exam with a fresh mind.", "I didn\u2019t have any issues with Python or PyCharm IDE during the exam. I was running training on my MacBook Pro CPU (2,4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9) and 64 GB RAM, without using Colab GPU.", "You get five tasks, to build five models during the exam. The time of the exam is 5 hours. The time counter starts as soon as you initiate an exam session through PyCharm plugin for TensorFlow certification. Tasks are ordered from simplest to the most complex. Your work is graded accordingly, the simplest task brings fewer points.", "Task 1: I implemented it fast, submitted \u2014 but the grading result wasn\u2019t perfect. I adjusted some tuning (I will not go into specifics as this would not be fair), resubmitted saved model and got the top score", "Task 2: I got stuck with this task. It was supposed to be not too complex, but I was constantly getting errors during model training. At some moment I thought \u2014 OK, probably I will fail with the exam. But then I managed to find a workaround, train the model and get top score from the grader. I looked at the time counter, 3.5 hours left. This means I spent 1.5 hours on the first two tasks", "Task 3: This task was going better for me, and I regained my confidence \u2014 there is still a chance I could pass the exam. However, the model training accuracy rate wasn't improving as fast as I would want. After spending 30 mins on this task, I decided to switch to tasks 4 and 5. At this moment it was 3 hours left. I spent 1.5 hours on tasks 4 and 5, then returned back to task 3. After working 30 mins more on this task, I managed to find solution, when model training accuracy started to improve rapidly. However, I still wasn\u2019t getting a top score from the grader. I realized training needs to run longer, to get better model accuracy. It was 55 mins left, I configured model to train for 40 mins (I was risking at that point, if training would fail for any reason, I would not have a chance to run it again). Luckily training completed on time and I still had 10 mins left to submit model. This time I got a good score and submitted my work", "Task 4: Completed this task in 45 mins, implemented model and got top score from the grader", "Task 5: Similar to task 4, implemented model in 45 mins, submitted to the grader and got a top score", "In the next moment, I got an email with the text \u2014 \u201cCongratulations, you have passed the TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam!\u201d", "I\u2019m a software developer who decided to move into Machine Learning. If you are like me \u2014 a software developer who wants to jump into Machine Learning, hopefully, this post will give you motivation. Invest time into studies, work hard \u2014 and it will pay off.", "Your home for data science.
