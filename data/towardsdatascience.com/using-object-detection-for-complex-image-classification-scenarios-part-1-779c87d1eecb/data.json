Code for the series can be found here.", "Recent developments in computer vision have changed the computer vision landscape. Many scenarios that were once considered possible only in sci-fi have recently become as easy as consuming an API.", "For example only four years ago the following comic appeared on XKCD.", "Back in 2014 the ability to perform basic image classification was considered near science fiction to the average developer, just three years later, not only can we determine whether a picture is of a bird we can also tell you the birds species, where in the picture the bird is and track in real time the birds migration patterns.", "In this series we are going to review a real world computer vision use case from the retail sector and are going to compare and contrast some of the different approaches and technologies available to solve the problem.", "A little over a year ago Microsoft partnered with a large manufacturer of confectionery products in Central & Eastern Europe, to build a machine learning model which validates whether distributors are stocking chocolates correctly. The company we worked with has a huge distribution network of supermarket chains across over fourteen countries. Each of these distributors is required to arrange chocolates on their stands according to standardized policies. Each policy describes what shelf a given chocolate should be on and in what order it should be stocked.", "There are huge costs associated with \u201croutine\u201d audit activities to enforce these policies. Our partner wanted to develop a system in which an auditor or store manager could take a picture and be told immediately whether the shelf was stocked correctly, like in the image above.", "Even with state of the art methods this is challenging for many reasons such as:", "Even though some images of misstocked shelves such as the above on the right are flagrant violations of policy and easy to classify, others such as the off by one violation below are more subtle cases and harder to classify correctly.", "In this series we will building a complex policy classifier similar to the one outlined the above scenario. For an image to be stocked validly it must be stocked in the following order.", "Microsoft provides a spectrum of AI services that can be used for solving Computer Vision Tasks like this one, each solution can be operationalized on Azure.", "From Azure Cognitive Services to the Azure DSVM and Azure Machine Learning each technology and approach has different advantages and trade-offs that fit the spectrum of computer vision use cases.", "Azure Cognitive Services are a set of out of the box API\u2019s and high level services that help you get started with AI tasks with out needing any domain experience.", "The Data Science Virtual Machine is a virtual machine (VM) image on Azure. It has many popular data science and deep learning tools already installed and configured. These images come with popular data science and machine learning tools, including Microsoft R Server Developer Edition, Microsoft R Open, Anaconda Python, Julia, Jupyter notebooks, Visual Studio Code, RStudio, xgboost, and many more. Instead of rolling out a comparable workspace on your own, you can provision a DSVM \u2014 saving you lots of time on the installation, configuration, and package management processes. Once your DSVM has been deployed, you can immediately begin working on your data science project.", "For more information on what you can do with a DSVM, see Data science with a Linux Data Science Virtual Machine on Azure", "The Azure ML Service Enables you to build and train machine learning models faster, and easily deploy to the cloud or the edge with Azure Machine Learning service.Use the latest open source technologies such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Jupyter. Experiment locally and then quickly scale up or out with large GPU-enabled clusters in the cloud. Speed up data science with automated machine learning and hyper-parameter tuning. Track your experiments, manage models, and easily deploy with integrated CI/CD tooling.", "Typically deep learning engineers don\u2019t implement the matrix algebra operations all by hand. Instead, they use frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or Theano. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.
