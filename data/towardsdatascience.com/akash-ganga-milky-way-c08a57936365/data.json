Fast forward: we have footsteps on the moon and will soon have footsteps on Mars! Humankind has made tremendous progress in the little time we have had on Earth. We have discovered the origins of the universe and have made simulations to map out the future of the universe.", "Our initial studies of the night sky were done with our naked eyes, and then, using simple telescopes that enhanced our vision. These studies used what is known as \u2018optical light images\u2019 of the night sky.", "In addition to optical light images, images can be made with any type of electromagnetic radiation. For example, when you visit a doctor with a broken leg, the doc might photograph your leg with \u2018x-rays\u2019 instead of \u2018optical light\u2019.", "In the image below, we have two pictures, one using optical light and another using infrared light.", "With the development of ground-based telescopes and satellites (The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990), we can take pictures of the universe with the different type of electromagnetic radiation. In the image below, we see the picture of the same galaxy but with five different types of light.", "With advanced telescopes, astronomers have collected numerous images of the night sky. Their work has helped us develop maps of the universe in the electromagnetic spectrum and these images and maps have taught us much about the universe. If we keep studying these images and maps, we are bound to continue making groundbreaking discoveries.", "The only problem is that there is far too much data for our astronomers to process. The image below, called the eXtreme Deep Field, taken from 1 degree of the night sky, has over 3000 galaxies! It is a considerable challenge to classify and label all the galaxies in these images (let us not even think of labelling all the stars we see/do not see, inside these galaxies).", "Our current approach to label and classify the galaxies in these images is to crowdsource the images: get the help of civilians to help classify galaxies (GalazyZoo). However, using a computer to help with the classification might be a better approach. Once trained with machine learning, computers will be a lot more competent in this task.", "The aim of our project, Akash Ganga, is to create a machine learning model to help with galaxy classification.", "Some groups have tried to train ML agents in the past to perform galaxy classification by training ML agents from scratch. For this Akash Ganga, we used Transfer Learning to train our model.", "Transfer Learning is the concept of taking a pre-trained ML model, such as Google\u2019s Inception net, or VVG16, and modifying the model\u2019s end layers to suit the new classification needs. The benefits of Transfer Learning is that the trained models such as VVG16 have had thousands of hours of training. A lot of this training might actually be involved in teaching the model basic feature extraction of the images. By using the pre-trained model, we already have weights ready for feature extraction. All that is left to train, is any of the new layers added to allow for classification of the new classes.", "For training our ML model, we used the EIFIGI dataset. The EIFIGI dataset has images of galaxies in the five ugriz and light bands, and composite colored images made using the five bands (for more information on ugriz light bands and their wavelengths, refer to Wikipedia\u2019s article on Photometric Systems).", "Instead of grouping all the light bands of one image together as usually done, we decided to leave them separate while training. This a slightly non-traditional approach as ugriz bands, when combined together, provide more information to understand a specific image. This decision was made to make the Akash Ganga ML model robust to light bands (so that regardless of the light band used to take a picture, the ML model can still classify the galaxy in the image).", "Additionally, the dataset has a large skew: the number of images for dwarf galaxies is very small compared to the number of images for spiral or elliptical galaxies. To prevent misclassification of dwarf galaxies, we decided to generate new images of dwarf galaxies by shearing the dwarf galaxy images so that the number of dwarf galaxy and other galaxy images were comparable.", "The base of our ML model is the pre-trained VVG16 (also called OxfordNet) model. We added a few layers at the end of this model and trained the additional layers with the EIFIGI dataset to distinguish galaxies into elliptical, lenticular, spiral or irregular galaxy types.", "On training the model for 60+ hours on Google Colab, our accuracy reached 70% and had plateaued at that value. This told us that maybe transfer learning is not a suitable approach to galaxy classification and that maybe all the different bands are crucial to galaxy morphology.", "Models like VVG16 are trained to differentiate between very different classes (for example, dogs and chairs) which are complicated (an image of a dog can be very complex). On the other hand, the images of galaxies contain simple shapes (most of the times, just basic shapes like ellipses, spirals, etc). Hence, using transfer learning might be a hindrance since, for galaxy classification, complex feature analysis may not be required.", "As mentioned before, a traditional approach to galaxy morphology involves grouping data from several different bands of light before training ML models. Maybe our model was unable to improve its training accuracy due to the lack of data present in other bands. Trying to group the light bands and then training might be a method to improve the model's accuracy.", "All of our code is freely available at this project\u2019s repository. We hope that this work can act as a base for anyone interested in Galaxy Morphology!", "Your home for data science.
