But few companies actually have ever implemented more than a dozen successful products. According to a recent study, 65% of companies with investments in AI have not seen any business returns on them. In the same study, high costs are reported as a major hurdle. So let\u2019s see how we can go about lowering the costs of AI products and develop faster thanks to a simple matrix.", "Let\u2019s take a look at your company. Ever wondered how expensive it would be to build a recommendation engine for your business? Or a forecaster for your traffic load? Or a classification system for your customer service tickets?", "Today those kinds of products all involve machine learning. All of them are built by machine learning engineers or data scientists. And all of them can be of great use. However estimating the costs, especially if your company only has implemented fewer than a dozen such products might be pretty overwhelming.", "In a presentation given by Ville Tuulos, I stumbled upon four classes that characterize the four main cost categories that today's machine learning solutions fall into. In my eyes, to understand the cost of a product like a recommendation engine, you simply have to answer two questions:", "For every quadrant, you might be able to think of a typical product that fits into that quadrant. If not, no worries let\u2019s explore all of those quadrants in detail, and what cost is associated with each. This seems pretty obvious, so let\u2019s explore the main cost drivers, business values, some examples and then how you can actually lower the cost of the higher demanding products.", "These products take in data all the time and infer all the time. If they break, serious money is lost, workflows are blocked, decisions cannot be made. A typical example is the NetFlix personalization engine. It\u2019s what provides you with the view above and of course many other aspects of what makes NetFlix such a pleasure to use.", "Every second it runs, it increases NetFlix's most important metric, the number of new videos started each second, by some percentage points. Indeed something like 70% of all videos watched on NetFlix is due to some form of recommendation. But as a result, every second this system is not working in real-time, it actually costs serious money. Every second it has to ingest what you just watched and update its inference process.", "Another example would be price forecasting for automobile buyers & resellers like the german \u201cwirkaufendeinauto.de\u201d.", "Prices in the automobile markets are very volatile and change on a daily basis. Thus if their pricing system is not forecasting properly, they indeed lose money.", "Typically the business value of such a machine learning product is calculated via the usual product manager magic:", "\u201cCTR x conversion x value of conversion\u201d.", "Cost: Real-time inference & updates are tough. It typically has two main cost drivers on such products:", "Cost guess: Those solutions need small to large teams to work on them constantly.", "Let\u2019s consider the case which is, of course, less expensive, that is if we don\u2019t have the real-time constraints but can go to a batch model.", "Typical Example: A customer e-mail classification & sorting system. Such systems take the 1,000s of e-mails that are sent for instance to \u201cinfo@wordpress.com\u201d and sort them into \u201cqueues\u201d which are then worked on by more specialized customer personnel, depending on the topic. If something is not sorted right, then a human has to sort it. Additionally, context switch costs usually occur.", "Other products in this quadrant are customer classification for marketing, churn prediction and the likes. For all those products, batching sorting classifying and predicting in regular intervals like an hour, using new data for an update once a week or a month is usually fine.", "Again for the business value, you\u2019ll go about this with a formula like \u201clikelihood of retrieving a churning customer x lifetime value\u201d or \u201csorting time saved x value\u201d and the likes.", "Cost guess: work of a team, a few weeks to some months. Constant work not required, the tuning process will take a couple of iterations, but no more.", "Typical Example: Those products typically are meant for decision-makers to look at. They are not in a critical process, but they have a very big impact if a decision is made using the information. As such, cash flow forecasts, analysis of \u201cmain drivers of customer views\u201d or \u201cchurn prediction\u201d on an aggregate level are all good examples.", "The business value is typically in the decision that can be made. Those decisions are typically hard to price, so the goal here is to iterate very closely with an exec to get him to use this often and reliably.", "Cost guess: one person a few weeks.", "Typical Example: The data science unicorn. That\u2019s a prototype a jupyter notebook, an analysis with some training and evaluation. Maybe even an excel list of results. It\u2019s what a data scientist usually produces before he tackles the large product. But even those one-time static results can be deployed into a full product.", "Business Value: It\u2019s either pure prototyping, \u201ccan this work?\u201d; Or it\u2019s somewhat of a one-time run on something we don\u2019t think will change in the future like \u201clet\u2019s run a guess on the main factors of churn in 2020\u201d.", "Cost guess: 1- a few weeks, one to multiple data scientists.", "So our complete matrix looks like this:", ". The chain of costs are like this:", "Unicorn < real time & cost high < batch & serious money < real-time heavy load thing.", "The magic is for almost any product you currently have in mind, you can probably choose a cheaper one, with roughly the same business value on the first iteration. Not in later iterations of course, but that\u2019s the main point. You can always use the first iteration to get feedback and a better estimate of the business value.", "The real-time, high-cost product: An example would be the mentioned sales algorithm of \u201cwirkaufendeinauto.de\u201d. The idea is, that when you take your car to a \u201cwirkaufendeinauto.de\u201d shop, they need an accurate estimate of what this car would sell for tomorrow. So what could they do instead of updating that every minute based on price data?", "Let\u2019s turn this into a batch product: Of course, they could start batching just every night or so. That means intraday price changes are not used. But still, the estimates would be pretty good. To mitigate these effects, and to make the solution more robust, they could simply apply a 1\u20132% discount on all prices to account for this fact.", "Let\u2019s further turn this into a batch with no serious costs on loss: So this solution is still pretty expensive, we could turn it into a cheaper one by using it differently. How would that work? You would employ actual people who do the price estimates (by looking at a bunch of websites e.g.) and let them use the \u201cprojected prices\u201d supplied by your solution that is updated every day. This way, if the machine learning solution breaks, people can still price cars roughly right, and no serious money is lost.", "Let\u2019s finally see with what we could start with as a unicorn: Of course, we would start this with a first very rough guess and give that to the people doing the price estimations. They could use the \u201cprojected price on 2020.01.01\u201d and if they find it useful, you will go on to develop the batch process.", "Using the same process you can turn almost any full-fledged idea into a unicorn.", "Now it\u2019s your turn to build your machine learning products!", "Your home for data science.
