Yes, that\u2019s so true!

How to make sense from this mess?", "To perform analysis and get accurate results from our data, you should first, be aware of the different formats and second, know how to import them into Python. In this blog, I am going to touch upon a few basic file structures that you might be familiar with and mention different yet common python libraries that are used for importing data.", "Mastering these file formats is critical for your success in the field of data. So where does everyone begin with? Oh yes, the omnipresent csv file.", "The most common flat file structure for storing data is the Comma Separated Values (CSV) files. It contains tabular data in plain text format separated by comma (,) delimiter. To identify a file format, you can usually look at the file extension. For example, a file saved with name \u201cdatafile\u201d in \u201cCSV\u201d format will appear as \u201cdatafile.csv\u201d.", "Pandas library is used for reading the data from a csv file in python. The read_csv() function from the Pandas library is used to load the data and store it in a dataframe.", "Flat files are data files that contains records in tabular row-column format without any numbered structure. CSV is the most common flat file. But there are other flat file formats which contains data with a user specified delimiter such as tabs, space, colons, semi-colons, etc.", "The Tab Separated Values (TSV) files are the second most common flat file structure. The same read_csv() function from the Pandas library is used for reading these files, you just need to specify the right separator to the parameter \u2018sep\u2019 of the read_csv() function.", "A file with the .xlsx file extension is a Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (XLSX) file created by Microsoft Excel. These files are files used in Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet application that uses tables to organize, analyze, and store data.", "Each cell of the spreadsheet is positioned by rows and columns and can contain text or numerical data, including incorporating mathematical formulas. Spreadsheet files made in earlier versions of Excel are saved in the XLS format.", "The read_excel() function from the pandas library is used to load the excel file data into python.", "XLSX files organize data in cells that are stored in worksheets, which are in turn stored in workbooks (files that contain multiple worksheets). For reading all the sheets, we use pandas ExcelFile() function. Now we can read a particular sheet from the workbook by just specifying the name of that sheet in the parameter sheet_name of the read_excel() function.", "A file with the ZIP file extension is a ZIP Compressed file and is the most widely used archive format you\u2019ll run into.", "A ZIP file, like other archive file formats, is simply a collection of one or more files and/or folders but is compressed into a single file for easy transportation and compression.", "We often get our csv or excel files in zip format as it saves storage space on the server and decreases the time it takes for you to download it to your computer. The zipfile module in python is used to extract the .zip files.", "The basic conceptual structure of a plain text format is that the data are arranged in rows, with several values stored on each row. Plain text files (also known by the extension TXT) consist of characters encoded sequentially in some particular character encoding.", "Python provides various functions to read the data from the text files. Each line of text is terminated with a special character called EOL (End of Line), which is the new line character (\u2018\\n\u2019) in python by default.", "Python file operations, specifically opening a file, reading a file, closing a file and various other file methods are something you should be aware of for accessing the text files. The built-in Python function open() has arguments such as mode, encoding, etc. which are used to open the text files correctly in python.", "Python provides us with three built-in methods for reading data from a text file, read([n]), readline([n]) and readlines(). Here \u2019n\u2019 is the number of bytes to be read. If nothing is passed to n, then the complete file is considered to be read.", "The read() method just outputs the entire file if the number of bytes (n) is not given in the argument.", "The readline(n) outputs at most n bytes of a single line of a file. It does not read more than one line.", "The readlines() method maintains a list of each line in the file which can be iterated using a for loop.", "The above gives a basic idea about reading the text file in python. But again, data is never placed in front of us in an easy to access format. Suppose you want to find the 10 most popular restaurants as per the reviews near you.", "Assuming there are 1000 restaurants and the data for this is present in 1000 individual text files and you need the restaurant name, review url and review text present in these files. To read the data from multiple files into one dataframe, Python\u2019s glob library is used.", "The Python built-in glob module is used to retrieve files/pathnames matching a specified pattern. The pattern rules of glob follow standard Unix path expansion rules.", "The /* is the wildcard in the glob statement. An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in a segment of a name. You need to always specify the encoding in the open() function for reading the file correctly.", "Here, the text files had restaurant name on the first line, restaurants review url on the second line and rest of the lines had review text. The readline() and read() functions were used accordingly to extract these data.", "In this blog, I have covered the most common and popular file structures that are used by people in the data industry. This should prepare you for your next frustrations when dealing with data gathering and messy file structures. There are many other that I intend to cover in my forthcoming blogs.", "If you enjoyed this blog post, leave a comment below and share it with a friend!", "Your home for data science.
