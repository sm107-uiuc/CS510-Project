As it is getting more and more popular, I wanted to do this article to give you an in-depth overview of why and how to get started with Machine Learning in Julia.", "The main advantage of Julia over other Machine Learning languages is speed. Two main reasons for Julia\u2019s speed advantage are, firstly, that it is a compiled language. Secondly, it has been designed for parallelism.", "Despite the speed advantage, Julia's syntax is not very complicated. It feels much like a scripting language and it is relatively easy to switch to Julia from a Python or R background.", "Julia is gaining traction and it is becoming more and more mature. With this growth, the community is also growing. Although still far smaller than the Python community, it is a good sign to see growth in both community and the number of libraries available.", "Another great thing about Julia is, that it can be run in Jupyter notebooks. And it\u2019s very easy to install! Here\u2019s how to install Julia into Jupyter notebook:", "Before getting to the real Machine Learning part, it is necessary to get the data imported and prepared. I will cover only three basic steps here: importing a csv file, one hot encoding a categorical variable, and making a train-test split.", "The first step to getting started in Julia is to import data. In this case, we use a csv file with the Iris data. For importing a csv file as a Data Frame, you will need to add the libraries \u201cCSV\u201d and \u201cDataFrames\u201d as shown below. Then, you use the \u201cCSV.File\u201d function to read the csv file and the DataFrame function to convert it to a data frame.", "For some models, you will need one hot encoding for the categorical variables. You can use the \u201cLathe\u201d library for this. It has a OneHotEncode function that will convert the data frame into a OneHotEncoded data frame. After that, you can remove the original column using the \u201cselect\u201d function.", "For model evaluation, you will need a train test split. The following code does this using the library \u201cRandom\u201d. Basically, it selects a random subset of indexes and treats these as the train set, while the non-selected indexes will be the test set:", "The resources for Machine Learning in Julia are still relatively distributed over different packages. Julia being not (yet) as popular as other programming languages for Machine Learning, it can sometimes be a bit of work to find specific models. It can also be more effort to find (or write) certain basic data preparation functions that are easily available in Python and R.", "The good news is that there are initiatives to regroup Machine Learning models in larger libraries. At this point, there are two libraries that are seriously competing for becoming the go-to Machine Learning library in Julia: MLJ and Scikit Learn.", "Those two initiatives are great, but they are not yet totally complete. As a result, for some models, they simply provide wrappers to other, much smaller, Machine Learning libraries. Because of this, I find it important to also cover two of those smaller libraries: \u201cGLM\u201d for Generalized Linear Models and \u201cDecisionTree\u201d for many tree-based models. I will start with the smaller libraries and finish with the larger initiatives.", "The following example fits three Logistic Regression models using the GLM library on the Iris data. GLM uses the \u201cformula\u201d interface, which is common in statistics-oriented libraries. We can specify a family (Binomial in this case) and a link type (Logit Link in this case) in order to create the type of GLM that is desired. This is done in the first part of the below code snippet.", "At the end of this snippet, the predictions of the three models are horizontally concatenated in order to prepare for the application of a One-Versus-All multi-class classification.", "Here are the concatenated predicted probabilities printed out (this is what is in the \u201cpreds\u201d variable):", "In the following snippet, we convert the three predicted probabilities for each row into one class prediction per row. This decision is based on the highest predicted probability between each of the three predicted probabilities:", "This is what the reclassified \u201cpreds_cat\u201d Array looks like:", "As a final step, here is how to compute the accuracy of our GLM prediction on the test set, using a short for-loop:", "In the following code snippet, you will see how to fit a Decision Tree in Julia. Firstly, it re-imports the Iris data, because the Decision Tree supports the use of Categorical variables. As stated in the introduction, this is an advantage of using Julia.", "Then the model is created as an instantiation of the DecisionTreeClassifier. We can give several hyper parameters, as for example max_depth used in this example. The fit syntax is quite special with the exclamation mark.", "The last two steps are prediction on the test set using the predict function and computing the accuracy, as in the previous model.", "As you will see, the Random Forest Model is applied in almost the same way as the Decision Tree. It may be confusing at first, but the Random Forest model is also part of the Decision Tree library!", "Now that we have seen how to use two great, but small, libraries for Machine Learning in Julia, let\u2019s get to the larger libraries. As stated before, there are two main packages that compete for becoming the go-to ML library in Julia: Scikit Learn and MLJ. Let\u2019s check them both out.", "Many of you will know Scikit Learn from Python. It is the package for Machine Learning in Python, and it is great to have it in Julia as well. It requires much less effort if we can just use the same syntax as Python!", "Let\u2019s see an example of Scikit Learn in Julia. This code snippet starts with importing the Scikit Learn library. The next step is loading the model you want to use (in this case a Logistic Regression). Using the \u201cfit!\u201d syntax (attention to the exclamation mark), the model is trained.", "After that, the predict function is used to predict the test set with the trained model. Finally, the accuracy is computed.", "Using Scikit Learn in Julia also has its disadvantages. For example, a large part of the Scikit Learn library that we can use in Julia is actually just a wrapper around Python. Apart from a few models that have been implemented in Julia, the Julia models actually use Pycall to call Python code.", "However, if we want to switch to Julia, it should be for having the benefits of Julia. One of the main benefits of Julia being a speed advantage over Python, calling Python code is really not what we should be doing here. If it\u2019s just a Python wrapper, we might as well stay with Scikit Learn in Python directly.", "Another disadvantage is that the Python models in Scikit Learn have no support for categorical variables. Apart from encoding them, there is really not much that can be done in Scikit Learn and that really is a negative point (especially for tree-based models). As you have seen throughout the examples, Julia allows us to treat a categorical variable as one variable, rather than as a set of one hot encoded dummies. So that advantage of Julia would also go away when we use Julia as a mere Python wrapper.", "A competitor for Machine Learning in Julia is the MLJ package. It promises to solve the problem of categorical variables and it is pure-Julia. This makes it very interesting to explore. It also has serious support from the Alan Turing Foundation, which makes me believe that this library could be here to stay.", "Let\u2019s now see an example of MLJ for Machine Learning in Julia in the below snippet. There are a few things that are different from usual. Especially, the creation of a machine is a choice of syntax that will be new for many. Then what\u2019s unusual more is the fact to have to load a model, rather than importing a package.", "But after those syntactical differences, the use of the MLJ library is not fundamentally different. MLJ syntax is easy to learn and there is good documentation on MLJ\u2019s documentation website.", "In this article, we have seen four libraries for Machine Learning in Julia. Two of those libraries (MLJ and Scikit Learn) seem to be real competitors to take over the Machine Learning landscape in Julia.", "Scikit Learn has the big advantage of the familiar syntax from the Python implementation and it has trust from its community. On the other hand, Scikit Learn is often simply calling Python code, which takes away most of the advantages of using Julia in the first place.", "MLJ has the big advantage of being a real Julia project. Its syntax is slightly new, but the differences seem minor. The real challenge for MLJ would be gaining trust and popularity by a larger community.", "I hope this article has given you all that you need for getting started in Julia and I wish you good luck doing so!", "Your home for data science.
