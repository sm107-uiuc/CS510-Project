What does it mean?\u201d There are two ways to answer the questions:", "\u201cThere is 95% probability/plausibility/likelihood that the population parameter lies in the interval.\u201d", "\u201cIf we repeat the experiment infinitely many times, 95% of the experiments will capture the population parameter in their confidence intervals.\u201d", "If you answer the first way, unfortunately, you\u2019ve pretty much failed the interview. Most people can\u2019t tell the difference between the two statements, and can get away with it. But as a data expert, you cannot. The first statement is interpreting Bayesian credible interval. The second, frequentist confidence interval.", "If you have never taken a statistics inference class, you may think the second statement is just a paraphrase of the first. In fact, the difference is profound. This boils down to two opposite ideologies about probability: frequentist and Bayesian.", "The Bayesian defines probability as a \u201cbelief.\u201d A belief can be strong or weak, and is modified continuously as new evidence emerges. The belief itself is described by a probability distribution. For example, my belief about average user checkout time can be something like this: \u201cThere is 3.5% probability that average check out time is between 44~46s; 34% probability that average checkout time is between 11~24s.\u201d Notice that I\u2019m not making a statement about what the average check out time is precisely, I\u2019m making statement about different ranges, and the probability of the ranges.", "The frequentist defines probability by \u201cfrequent trials.\u201d A frequentist believes that a population parameter is fixed (for example, diabetes rate, conversion rate, average checkout time), and the only way to find it is through many experiments. Because real world experiment is often expensive, we use central limit theorem to derive from a single experiment the same sampling distribution we would get by conducting many experiments.", "One major source of confusion is that frequentist don\u2019t do frequent experiments in the real world. They do one experiment and produce one confidence interval, just like the Bayesian do. This is only because central limit theorem gives them a handy shortcut to saves tons of money from repeating experiments!", "Confidence interval is like a ring toss game. The post is fixed just like population parameter. And you throw ring at the post. Sometimes you miss it, sometimes you catch it. You choose a large enough ring so you can catch the post 95% of the time. The ring size is like your 95% confidence interval size.", "Similarly, frequentist conducts experiment infinitely many times, and builds one point estimate (e.g. sample means, proportion), one confidence interval for each experiment. The distribution of the point estimate is called sampling distribution. In the animation below, population mean is fixed at 0.078, blue dots mark upper bounds, and orange dots mark lower bounds of confidence intervals. Most confidence intervals will capture the population parameter. Some intervals will not (when blue dots drop below red line, or orange dots rise above red line). The frequentist will choose a large enough interval that capture the population parameter 95% of the time.", "Bayesian does not care about sampling distribution. They model their beliefs about the population parameter as a posterior distribution. A classic example is assessing whether a coin is fair. As you continually flip the coin, your become more confident about its probability of landing head/tail.", "In the example below, each iteration is a coin flip. Head is counted by \u237a. Tail is counted by \u03b2. Because head count and tail count are almost always equal. We are more and more confident that the probability of landing head is 50%. This probability distribution about a probability is modelled by beta distribution (see tutorial here).", "Suppose we flip a fair coin 10 times. Unfortunately we get 7 heads and 3 tails. The evidence that the coin is fair is weak. The posterior looks like this: the peak occurs at 70%, because we get 7 heads out of 10 trials.", "To build credible interval, we simply truncate a left tail, or a right tail, or both, from the posterior distribution, so that the remaining probability mass (called \u201cplausibility\u201d) is as desired. For example, we can truncate 5% from either tail, and get a 90% credible interval [0.436, 0.865]:", "Either case is a valid 90% credible interval, because each enclosed 90% probability mass (plausibility). Which do you think is more useful? Obviously it\u2019s the narrower one we want. The narrowest credible interval is called highest density interval.", "On the other hand, to construct confidence interval, we must rely on central limit theorem to build the sampling distribution, look up the t-score/z-score, and then add/subtract some multiple of standard errors from the point estimate.", "One advantage of credible interval is that we can build rules into the posterior distribution itself. For example, the beta distribution ranges between 0 ~ 1, offering a nice bound for probability. On the other hand, the sampling distribution is always normal, and its range is infinite. So in this context, it is obviously flawed because a coin\u2019s probability of landing head cannot be greater than 1, or less than 0. This is problematic when the sample size is small, and a large mass of normal distribution lies outside the range [0, 1].", "Another advantage of credible interval is that we can take into account a prior before conducting the experiment. If someone else has previously thrown the coin 50 times and recorded 20 heads, we already know something about the coin. So the beta posterior\u2019s peak (mode) rises faster, and narrows down faster than the sampling distribution. As a result, the credible interval narrows down much faster than the confidence interval.", "\u201cSo far so good. Why not always use credible interval?\u201d You may ask. The trouble is that not every experiment has a elegant posterior distribution. Although there is a beta distribution to model conversion rate, diabetes rate, or any other probability. There is no elegant posterior for check out time, ETA, bodyweight, height, blood sugar. In fact, the beta distribution is an exception, not the norm. In the messy real world, normal distribution is the norm.", "Fortunately for the frequentists, we live in the world of internet. Where traffic is cheap, central limit theorem always triumphs, and the difference between the two methods diminishes. In contrast, the advantage of credible interval is most valuable when the sample size is small, and consequence costly, for example, subjecting 10 patients to two different types of medical treatments.", "The following blogs covers topics relevant to AB testing, and more in-depth review of key concepts mentioned in this article.", "Your home for data science.
