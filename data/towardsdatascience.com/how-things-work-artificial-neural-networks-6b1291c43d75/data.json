They became the core of just about everything we do, including language translation, virtual recognition, text summarization, autonomous vehicles, speech recognition, game-playing, and so on \u2014 it\u2019s up to your imagination. For instance, there would be no apple pencil or voice commend assistants(siri, alexa, etc.) without neural networks.", "Since they power almost anything that we use, I think it\u2019s necessary to understand some of the general terminologies and get a slight idea of how it works.", "Neural networks may seem an exceptionally complex concept, but it\u2019s really not. To get through this complexity, we need to understand what\u2019s going on inside the hidden layers. Alright, first things first, let\u2019s start by defining the neural networks.", "Fran\u00e7ois Chollet states an extract and simple definition in his book: \u201cAn effort to automate the cognitive tasks normally performed by humans.\u201d", "Artificial Neural networks(ANNs) are the workhorses of this effort. The concept of the ANNs started as an attempt to utilize the architecture of the human brain to perform tasks that conventional algorithms had little success. So these workhorses are based on the principles of the human brain.", "ANNs have become a hot topic in this century but actually, it\u2019s a concept that was firstly introduced in the 1950s. Back in those days, we called that algorithm a perceptron. Alright, but what exactly is a perceptron?", "Well, the perceptron is a single-layer neural network. Briefly, it\u2019s a function that takes in a set of inputs, performs some mathematical computation, and then outputs the result. Okay but, if we have them over 70 years, why are they became a big deal now? The main reason is computers were not fast enough and not enough data until the 21st century. Nowadays, our computers are getting faster and faster, and with the help of the internet, we have all kinds of data being shared for public use.", "A neural network contains many neurons and the connections between those neurons. So modeled after the structure of the human brain, artificial neural networks have the goal to mimic how the brain works. Thus, we can use them as multi-layer networks of neurons to classify things, make predictions, and so on.", "The picture above shows us the basic architecture of an ANN, this is the main building block that all complex systems are based on. Let\u2019s explain it.", "Well, a neural network consists of 3 types of layers:", "Before we dive into the how it works section, I want to introduce some common terminologies.", "Disclaimer \u2014 I don\u2019t want to tire you with the math behind, so this will be a simple explanation.", "As I said before, the weight values are the backbone of the network. The right values for the weights determine the strength of the prediction. At first, the weights of the network assign randomly. Naturally, the first prediction of the network is far from what it should normally be. Thereby our loss score is also very high. So we have to fix it, but how?", "Well, we do that by training \u2014 the process of optimizing the weights from the input data is known as training the ANNs. This process composed of 2 types of algorithms:", "Alright, let\u2019s recap. Firstly, we initiate the input data and an arbitrary amount of random weights. Then the feedforward comes, after that process, we get an output value, our prediction. To measure loss score, we compare our prediction and the real value. This calculation is done with the loss function. Now, the next station is backpropagation.", "Backpropagation is, simply, updates the weights by calculating the derivative of the loss score for each and every weight in the ANNs. We call these derivatives gradients. This gradient-based optimization is the engine of the ANNs. Thanks to backpropagation, we can reduce the loss score via an update of the weights.", "This whole process is called the training loop. To get the best result from our network, we repeat these loops typically tens of iterations over thousands of examples. Ideally, our network should learn the ideal set of weights to predict output with the least error.", "So, the actual learning performs by the training loop. In simplified terms, training means to feed inputs to a neural network, collect its outputs, compare them with the expected outputs, and modify the weights to correct the outputs. This simple but effective idea allows us to solve a remarkably broad range of intellectual tasks, from speech recognition to healthcare applications.", "Anyone who heard about neural networks also heard about deep learning. These are relative concepts but with an important difference. To put it simply, deep learning is a specific subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layers in an ANN. I mentioned earlier that perceptrons are the simplest form of a neural network, so deep learning is just a much more complex perceptron system. And the \u2018deep\u2019 in the deep learning is a reference to the number of hidden layers.", "Although perceptrons were introduced in the 1950s, deep learning has only risen to prominence popular in the last decade. That\u2019s partly because of the complexity of these networks and the inadequate computational speed of our computers.", "In the few years since the 2010s, deep learning algorithms achieved extraordinary results on perceptual problems such as virtual recognition, speech recognition, and autonomous vehicles.", "Today, deep learning is at a level of common interest and industry investment before more than any time in its history. It has so various application areas \u2014 game playing, robotics, finance, self-driving cars, entertainment, and so on. Let\u2019s examine some of them.", "Voice search and voice-activated assistants are some of the most popular usage areas of deep learning. Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant \u2014 nowadays, we all know and use them regularly.", "Thanks to deep learning, we could bring autonomous driving to life. Sure, there is still so much way to go, but also there are promising examples such as Uber, Waymo, and Tesla.", "Hopefully, these self-driving cars will be able to handle driving in an uncontrolled environment soon.", "Deep learning chooses for us what to watch or listen to next. Applications like Netflix and Spotify recommends us exactly the things we would like by the power of deep learning.", "Document summarization, answering questions, Twitter analysis, and text classifications are just a few examples of NLP applications.", "According to NVIDIA, \u201cFrom medical imaging to analyzing genomes to discovering new drugs, the entire healthcare industry is in a state of transformation and GPU computing is at the heart. GPU-accelerated applications and systems are delivering new efficiencies and possibilities, empowering physicians, clinicians, and researchers passionate about improving the lives of others to do their best work.\u201d", "With innovations in deep learning, it started to completely reshape medicine and healthcare as an industry from cancer detection to clinical researches.", "One of the biggest problems on the internet is fake news. Everyone seems to be encountered fake news one way or another. And examples like Cambridge Analytica shows us how fake news influence its readers\u2019 perception. So, deep learning helps to develop classifiers that can detect fake news and remove it from your feed and warn you of possible privacy breaches.", "This may be the most popular application area of deep learning. It aims to recognize and identify people and objects in images as well as to sort out them based on locations or events, etc.", "\u201cWorrying about AI evil super-intelligence today is like worrying about overpopulation on the planet Mars. We haven\u2019t even landed on the planet yet! \u2014 Andrew Ng\u201d", "Deep learning and AI applications already have a huge place in our lives, but what it pictures for the future? Well, it looks bright for now.", "We aren\u2019t sure yet if we ever achieve super AI systems that surpass human intelligence in every field. But with the development of advanced neural network architectures like GANs(Generative Adversarial Networks) and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 model, we\u2019re getting closer to build deep learning systems that can sufficiently mimic the complex functionalities of the human brain. We know one thing for sure, and that is the deep learning-based systems will be applied to almost every process that makes up our society and our daily lives, just like the Internet is today.", "\u201cSuccess in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Hawking", "Your home for data science.
