Just as\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["In this machine learning era, we\u2019ve seen a lot of hypes on using AI to classify whether an image contains a puppy, to do spam detection or to train self-driving car to recognize traffic-sign. Just as having the right model is important, it is even more crucial to be able to tell how well your model performs so that you can choose the one that is well suited for your task.", "In this post, we will go through:", "Suppose you are presented with an image above, the task is to decide if the image contains a dog or not. If you answer correctly, you get a point. If not, you will not get any. This is commonly known as classification task where you try to assign a specific label to a given data.", "This classification task is quite popular in machine learning community that they try to train their model and see if the current algorithm can fully distinguish between the objects. For this article, we will not focus on which algorithm to use. Instead, we assume that we have an algorithm already and we want to know if our algorithm performs well or not?", "One of the simple evaluation metrics is accuracy. Suppose you have 5 images and the model gets 4 of them right, then the score is 0.8. Thus, we can say accuracy is the number of correctly classified images over total images. That is simple and intuitive, but this is not enough.", "The accuracy itself has some downfall. Let\u2019s consider the example below. Suppose our dataset has 5 images: 4 are not-dogs and 1 is a dog. Also we have an algorithm as the following:", "The naive algorithm above assumes everything is not a dog without doing any computation on the given data. One thing to notice is that because coincidentally our dataset has 4 images that are not-dog, such naive algorithm gets the score of 0.8 . That\u2019s not what we want.", "2 concepts to combat such situation are precision and recall. Let\u2019s look at their brief explanations below.", "Let\u2019s start with recall. Among our dataset, there is only 1 dog and our algorithm classified that as not-dog. Therefore, recall=0/1=0.", "Whereas for precision, among the predictions, none of them are even predicted as dog. Thus, precision=0/0. Note that in some case, division for precision is not possible due to denominator being 0; thus, we can simply assume precision=0 in this case.", "Confusion matrix split the data into 4 categories: true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative as shown in the figure below.", "Commonly, when we want to compute precision and recall, confusion matrix is used. The calculation is the same as described in the previous section but it makes the numbers more easy to read. For this example, we will look at a different case where we attempt to classify 10 images instead.", "Ideally, we want both values to be as high as possible. However, that might not be possible. As we increase recall, precision will decrease and vice versa. Therefore, we need to decide which one is more important for the task. Let\u2019s take a closer look how this phenomenon can occur.", "The green box are the correctly classified labels and the yellow box are the incorrectly classified labels. Each image that is misclassified must go into one of the yellow box: false positive (precision) or false negative (recall). It of course can not be in both.", "Suppose our model will surely have 5 incorrect labels, if all the incorrect classifications fall into false-positive, then we will have low precision and high recall. However, if the incorrect labels fall into false-negative, we will instead have high precision and low recall.", "Therefore, when you train your machine learning model, you need to decide which metrics is more important. For instance, if you were asked to build a model for financial institution where they want classify whether the borrower is a good candidate or not, you may prefer your model not to give the loan recklessly. Therefore, you rather classify the good people as bad people (false negative) rather than to classify the bad people as good one (false positive).", "In other word, false negative (recall) is more preferable the false positive (precision).", "So, next time you are presented with a classification task, make sure not to just pick accuracy as metrics and jump into designing the model right away. Of course, playing around with the model is exciting but it\u2019s important to take some time to have a clear picture of what kind of problems you are tackling and which metrics are most suitable for the task. Once you get that out of the way, you can be certain that your model you are building will be the right one for your task.", "That\u2019s it. We have reached the end of this article. Just to recap on what we just discussed, here are some key takeaways from the article:", "Your home for data science.
