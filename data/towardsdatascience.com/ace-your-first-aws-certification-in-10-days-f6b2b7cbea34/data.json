But I seldom ever thought about how I can operationalize it. It was intimidating to spin up clusters, databases, and design fault-tolerant data pipelines. Over time, I realized that these things aren\u2019t as difficult as I\u2019d assumed. When I passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (AWS CCP) exam in July, I learned how cloud service providers have made data pipelines easier than ever before.", "I want to share how I prepared and passed this exam in two weeks, with no significant cloud experience.", "AWS CCP is the most sought after, and the easiest of all the AWS certification tests. There are several online resources and study guides. I\u2019ve listed those that I found to be the most useful. If you follow only this exam guide, I guarantee that you will fly through the exam.", "What is this exam all about?", "The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner examination is intended for individuals who have the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively demonstrate an overall understanding of the AWS Cloud, independent of specific technical roles", "This certification is an excellent first step for anyone who wants to leverage or even understand managed cloud services. If you are not sure which cloud platform is best for your use case, I highly recommend this exam since all cloud providers have very similar infrastructures, and AWS is the most widely used cloud service.", "I took the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam in July 2019 after about ten days of preparation and 3\u20134 days to make a plan. It is easy to get overwhelmed due to the number of online resources and exam preparation guides. So, I\u2019ve taken the best guidelines, blog posts, and technical resources and listed them here to help you make a solid study plan.", "As an initial step, I explored many available resources. I\u2019ve listed and organized the most useful resources here into three sections-", "If you go through all of these, you will be ready for a little more than just the AWS CCP exam. If you get a good grasp of precisely what you are expected to know, you will be able to differentiate between what\u2019s relevant at this stage and what\u2019s not.", "Go through this sequentially. Start with understanding the exam, its objectives, and some sample questions (section 1). After this, dive into preparation (section 2) and finally test your knowledge (section 3).", "Section 1. Understand the exam pattern and objectives", "Here are the best resources to understand the exam pattern and exam objectives. These will help you differentiate between what you should know and what is beyond the scope of this exam.", "2. Jeanne Boyarsky\u2019s recommendations for exam preparation, what to expect on the day of the exam are helpful to draw a clearer picture of the exam. Jeanne is an accomplished developer and a Java champion.", "3. In this video by Steep Technologies, Jose shares his exam preparation experience-", "By this time, you should have a good idea of what the exam is like and what you need to know to do well in the text.", "1. How to Pass the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam \u2014 What to Study by Peter Fessel", "In this 34-minute video, Peter covers every topic the test includes. I suggest making a list of all of these topics.", "2. A Cloud Guru\u2019s AWS CCP course", "Register for a free AWS account, set up alarms, deploy an S3 bucket, and launch an EC2 instance. If you have never done this before, it\u2019s useful to watch someone else do it and follow along. The course is exhaustive. Sometimes Ryan dives deeper than needed. If you are not interested in learning anything that is beyond the exam\u2019s scope right now, the list from 2.1 will help identify which topics from this course are not important for now.", "I highly recommend all four of these official AWS whitepapers. I\u2019ve listed them here in order of importance, starting with the most important.", "Read about only the relevant products and services.", "I struggled to understand some things during my first read. I had to reread it and then read the highlights. This exercise was beneficial.", "You will have made the most of this whitepaper even if you read just the introduction and the factors that determine billing of some of the critical services.", "I skimmed through this, reading the headings and very rarely the details.", "4. Know the shared responsibility model well; I got about ten questions on this.", "Memorize this cold. There will be some straightforward questions in the exam that will test your memory.", "Section 3. Links to practice tests and sample questions", "I only took the first four because I read some online reviews that tests 5 and 6 had a lot of questions that were out of the scope of the exam.", "2. I also bought AWS\u2019s official practice test, which gives you 25 questions for $20. These were at least ten times easier than the actual test.", "That\u2019s the plan. I\u2019m sure this will save a lot of your time looking for what\u2019s best for the exam. The exam itself is not designed to be very difficult, so this preparation will prepare you for the worst. But, make sure you judge your preparation based on section 3.", "If you think you are well-prepared for the exam, as per your evaluation in section 3, go ahead and schedule the exam. If you follow most of this study plan, you should be able to get a good score.", "Congratulations on taking the first step in your cloud career! There are many paths you can take from here. You can now read about other cloud service providers and compare which one is the best for your needs. Since I come from a Machine Learning background, I\u2019m interested in building end-to-end machine learning services. So, I\u2019m preparing for the AWS Machine Learning specialty before preparing for the AWS solutions architect certification. Microsoft Azure is catching up fast with AWS, and it\u2019s worth learning and exploring. It has some excellent certifications too.", "After this exam, you\u2019ll also be able to understand complex AWS architectures and learn how people build custom solutions for their use-cases. You can also play with deploying some services, like Hadoop clusters using Amazon EMR, use on-demand Lambda functions to trigger code as a response to events, or use Amazon Polly for its cool Text-to-Speech capabilities.", "Your home for data science.
