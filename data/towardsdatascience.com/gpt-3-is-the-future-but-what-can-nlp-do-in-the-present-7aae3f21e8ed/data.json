Because not-so-good results just wouldn\u2019t make the news.", "Even bearing that in mind, I\u2019m still blown away by what I\u2019ve seen of GPT-3. But right now there\u2019s no way I can get my hands on it for any practical purposes \u2014 it\u2019s only available to a few researchers at the moment. What about us mere mortals? Other than playing AI Dungeon of course\u2026", "For now, we can play with GPT-3\u2019s older brother, GPT-2. A few weeks ago I wrote easy_text_generator, a tool to generate text of any length from language models in your browser. You can use GPT-2 or a few pre-trained or distilled versions of it (downloaded from huggingface) to generate different kinds of text, like movie scripts, Star Trek scripts, IMDB movie reviews, or just text in general.", "Or if you want something with zero install, you can generate text directly from huggingface\u2019s site, just with limited length. For example, try out GPT-2 here.", "As I said, most examples of GPT-3 you may have seen have been cherry-picked. To make a reasonably fair comparison, I\u2019ll run each language model 5 times and cherry-pick one output for each model.

Here\u2019s what it spat out after about 10 minutes:", "In short, neural search is a new approach to retrieving information. In an ideal world, there would be lots of new data to search, but most of it is already stored in a relational database. That\u2019s why most of the time it\u2019s best not to store any information in the database at all. And in the future, what we want is that the information is simply searchable. But even if the information is readily searchable, there is still the problem of how to combine multiple search terms in the database. One way to combine search terms is to have search engines, but when we search for something on Google or any other search engine, they can often be quite good, but sometimes they\u2019ll make mistakes, and they\u2019ll only show some of the results, and sometimes they won\u2019t show all of the results or they\u2019ll say something very specific but you can\u2019t look it up in that particular search. One of the most important goals of neural search is to let them search even more easily so they can make better decisions. But there\u2019s still one issue: some types of problems don\u2019t lend themselves to it and this can lead to a lot of lost information if the search engine doesn\u2019t have the right tool in the right place. Nurture Now, I think we can take some lessons from neural search to solve this problem...", "Looks somewhat coherent to me, though it doesn\u2019t keep a clear narrative going, and Dear Lord, some of those run-on sentences!", "distilGPT2 is a more efficient version of GPT-2 that had some excess neurons pruned away. Judging by its outputs, maybe a few too many neurons! It took about a minute to generate each result:", "In short, neural search is a new approach to retrieving information. But in recent years, the field has gained little traction, and now there is evidence that it is more accurate in detecting and analyzing neural networks on human skin. Here is the gist of this story. The researchers of the Chinese National Scientific Research Foundation (CSRF) have teamed up with researchers from the University of California, San Diego, who are working on a neuroimaging and learning network that will map up and reconstruct neural networks on human skin. This brain project aims to look into the brain\u2019s visual cortex, so that it can learn from individuals without losing information. The CSRF will also use a neural network to map the brain\u2019s sensory cortex and the cerebral cortex, as well as the anterior and caudate cortex, which is part of the brain\u2019s central cortex. But this may not be the first step in the quest to decipher neural networks, a method used to search for patterns of information on a wide variety of people, including those who are not on the receiving end of a drug. Researchers at University of California, San Diego (USDA) in collaboration with scientists at the Chinese National Scientific Research Foundation (CSRF) in collaboration with CSRF, have developed a technique that allows the scientists to search for patterns of information on skin.

We can also see it understands character lines and stage directions. And just like every netizen out there, it has a thing for cats. (If it seems a little short compared to other samples, it\u2019s because it adds a lot of spacing (for magins) that Medium strips out.", "One of my dreams is to create Star Trek episodes fully generated by an AI.
