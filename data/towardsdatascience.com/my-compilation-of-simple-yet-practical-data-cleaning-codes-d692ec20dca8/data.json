Feel free to check out my previous article \u2014 The Simple Yet Practical Data Cleaning Codes for more codes for data cleaning.", "In the following code snippets, the codes are written in functions for self-explanatory purposes. You can always use the codes directly without putting them into functions with a small change of parameters.", "When faced with column names that have capital letters or space in between, very often we need to change the column names and replace them with lowercase and underscore \u2014 to be more clean and Pythonic. Also, we want to make the column names as explicit as possible such that your friends will roughly know what a column contains just by looking at the column name.", "You may think that list comprehension is so common and wonder how that could be considered as part of data cleaning. Well\u2026 To me, list comprehension is so elegant and clean that you can abstract your logic in a single line of code without having any for loops, and compute that much faster than for loops.", "Typically, I\u2019d use list comprehension if I want to get a list of values based on certain conditions to append to the existing dataframe or use that for further analysis.", "This is useful when you want to output a dataframe with all the available data that a column has.", "For example, you have a dataframe with all customers\u2019 information and you want to output an updated dataframe with all the available customers\u2019 ID and remove the rows with missing customers\u2019 ID. In this case, the code should look like this: df = df[df['id'].notnull()].", "Similar concept can be applied to time series data where the column is timestamp.", "Using back the dataframe with all customers\u2019 information and adding a column of timestamp for each id.", "Now each id is not unique and it\u2019s repeated throughout their respective time period. For each id you want to get the last row of the id because you only care about the final customers\u2019 information for each id.", "This is when you can use the code snippet above to drop all duplicated id and just keep the last row. This makes sure that we always get the final customers\u2019 information with unique id. Again, this can be done with just a single line of code!", "This is one of my favourite tools when it comes to converting numerical values in a column to discrete intervals based on the range specified. I highly recommend you to use pd.cut if you want to convert a continuous variable to a categorical variable.", "For instance, in the code snippet above, we have a rating column that consists of numerical values from 1\u201310. What if we want to convert these rating values to certain groups within given their values and specified range? We can bin the values in discrete intervals and label them as bad, moderate, good, strong given the range specified using pd.cut.", "Another common use case of pd.cut would be to convert ages to groups of age ranges where you can categorize each age to a label.", "By the end of this article, I hope you\u2019ll find these little tools useful to your common data cleaning tasks and that would make your work much productive and of course, life much easier for someone who has to deal with messy data from time to time.", "Again, the codes by nature are relatively simple to implement. I hope this updated toolbox of data cleaning \u2014 together with the one that I shared in my previous article \u2014 gave you more convenience and confidence to perform data cleaning as well as better ideas of how datasets typically look like based on my experience.", "As always, if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave your feedback below or you can always reach me on LinkedIn.
