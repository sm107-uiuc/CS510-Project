exhibited symptoms or not \u2014 by the current SARS-COVID-19 pandemic in different countries, as well as providing a central estimate to get closer to the actual numbers. Taken together, those bounds and the central estimates indicated that the disease has not spread as far as some have claimed, and that all countries are still quite far from the possibility of herd immunity. My conclusions and main points in that post have been confirmed by several recently published studies. However, in a private response to that post, my friend and fellow linguist Boban Arsenijevi\u0107 noticed an error with my upper bounds. In this piece, I further refine the upper bounds for the disease\u2019s spread addressing Boban\u2019s criticism. I show that, despite that error, the main conclusions of the previous post still stand, even reinforced by more recent data. Here, I also consider additional important details, such as the accuracy of tests, which were intentionally left out in the previous post for simplicity\u2019s sake. Using these new refinements, I provide finer grained bounds for the pandemic\u2019s spread using more recent data, and I investigate what these tell us about the testing policies followed in different countries.", "In my previous post, I used the proportion of tests that come out positive in a population\u2014 the positive testing rate \u2014as an upper bound for the number of people that are infected by the disease \u2014 the lifetime prevalence. The reason that this relationship holds is the testing bias: People are more likely to be tested when there are already indications that they might have been infected, either through explicit symptoms, or by close contact with other people known to be infected. For this reason, on any given day, there will be a higher proportion of positives among the people tested than among the general population.", "The above relation holds on any given day but \u2014 as Boban Arsenijevi\u0107 kindly pointed out to me \u2014 it needs not hold for a longer period. The problem is that people only remain testing positive for a certain amount of time after they recover from the infection. For instance, if we had a population of one hundred people, and for five days we tested ten of them each day, obtaining each day two positives, we could infer that on any given day, there were no more than twenty percent people infected, which would be correct. However, this estimate could only be extended for the whole five day period if we assumed that the people who tested positive on day number one would have also tested positive on day number five. When this is not the case, we would need to add up which proportions of the population had been infected on non-overlapping days. Notice that the solution to this problem is not as simple as adding up the positives on different days. If we did this, we would count some infected people several times, as many as days they remained testing positive. In short, if people test positive for a long period, the upper bounds from my previous post would be more or less correct. However, if people tested positive for shorter periods, I would severely underestimate the upper bound.", "In order to address this problem, one needs to know for how long do people continue to test positive after they become infected, even after they recover. In a recently published study, Du and colleagues investigated the length of time for which people test positive for SARS-COVID-19. They found that this duration depends on the viral load with which someone has been infected (i.e., the severity of the initial infection), and on the age of the patients (older people remain positive for longer than younger people). Of the 161 people they studied, they found one patient that tested positive even fifty days after being infected. More generally, they found that 25% of people remain positive for less than 17 days, 50% tested positive for at most 21 days, and 75% tested positive for 28 days or less (in technical terms these three numbers are referred to as the quartiles of the distribution).", "The numbers reported by Du et al. fit well into a Weibull probability distribution (plotted in Figure 1 besides). This is a two-parameter distribution of waiting times commonly used in reliability analyses (e.g., estimating the expected time until a piece of equipment fails) and survival analyses (e.g., estimating the effects of treatments on expected future lifetime of a medical patient). Interestingly, the shape parameter of the fitted distribution reflects what is called in statistical parlance an \u201caging process\u201d (k>1): In our case this implies that the longer a person tests positive the less likely we are to find that very person testing positive for even longer; in other words, the probability of testing negative increases with time.", "The key to accumulating the positive testing rates along a period lies on adding up each day only the positive tests that do not correspond to the part of the population that already tested positive in a previous day and remains positive. In other words, each day only the new positives should be added up. Accumulating the new positives for a period will give us a true upper bound for the prevalence. In practical terms, this implies repeated application of the curve in Figure 1: On the first day of the pandemic we add the whole positive testing rate. On the following days we only accumulate the portion of the positive testing rate cases that fall below the curve in Figure 1 for any previous day. This accumulation procedure avoids missing those patients who tested positive in the past, but have since become negative, and ensuring non-overlap by repeated curve application prevents counting twice those who remain positive. I will refer to this measure as the partially accumulated positive testing rate.", "Notice that the accumulation process sketched above requires sufficiently detailed daily testing data, whereas the measure used in my previous post could be computed using just the accumulated number of tests and the corresponding cumulative cases. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to get a reliable upper bound estimate for countries that do not report daily numbers of tests performed, but report instead cumulative batches aggregated along multiple days, as do Germany (currently reported in eight batches) or Spain (currently reported in four batches).", "An additional factor that needs to be accounted for is that, as accurate as they might be, no test is ever perfect. There are multiple providers of CoV-2 tests, and the different tests provided differ in multiple properties. According to a report by Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, the available tests\u2019 sensitivity \u2014 i.e., the \u201ctrue positive rate\u201d, the proportion of infected people that test positive \u2014 ranges between between 87% and 93% in the different tests. The same source puts the specificity of the tests \u2014 i.e., the \u201ctrue negative rate\u201d, the probability that somebody who is not infected tests negative \u2014 goes between 95% and 100%. As high as these numbers might seem, they can in fact change the testing results. For instance, consider that we have tested one hundred people, and we have obtained eighty positive results. We would be tempted to conclude that there are eighty people infected, and twenty people not infected. However, if we put ourselves in the worst case of test accuracy \u2014 87% sensitivity and 95% percent specificity \u2014 we should in fact expect that:", "Taking the above into account, with a positive testing rate of 80%, the sensitivity and specificity of the tests tell us that we should expect 79.57+11.89=91.46% people infected and 8.11+0.43=8.54% not infected. In other words, had we used the testing data directly, our estimates would have been off by more than ten percent. Even if we cannot easily know who in particular was a false positive or a false negative, we can know with reasonable certainty how many of misattributions there were. In general, one can correct the positive rate directly using the equation shown beside.", "I used the testing data available from Our World in Data for computing the new upper bound measure, combining the partial accumulation method and the testing accuracy corrections described above (assuming the worst precision situation of 87% sensitivity and 95% specificity) for all countries that have reported a series of daily positive testing rates of at least 45 days.", "Figure 2 shows how the partially accumulated measure results in a constant accumulation over time. Most importantly, comparing it with the cumulative positive testing rate \u2014 the upper bound for the prevalence that I proposed in my previous post \u2014 this latter measure peaks at the point when the disease is most prevalent in a country, after which is consistently decreases. Such a decrease reflects how the cumulative positive testing rate fails to account for many resolved cases of the disease \u2014 i.e., we shouldn\u2019t expect a lifetime prevalence measure to ever decrease. In contrast, the new upper-bound measure behaves as one would expect it to: It grows rapidly until the disease peaks, and it stabilizes afterwards into a slower increase. The only decreases (attenuated using a seven day running average) appear as a result of the noisy oscillations of the daily testing rate.", "The red triangles in Figure 3 (above) show the computed upper bounds for countries for which more than 45 days of daily testing results were available. Only for three countries \u2014 in descending order the United Kingdom, Senegal, and Panama, and Belgium, could possibly have lifetime prevalences of SARS-COVID-19 above 60%, with the great majority of countries well below 30%. As I discuss below, however, the upper bounds are in fact extremely lax. Once one takes testing biases into account, these figures become substantially lower.", "Unfortunately, many countries are not reporting daily testing data \u2014 e.g., Spain or Germany \u2014 and others have only begun to provide such daily reports only too recently for allowing reconstruction of the upper bound with some reliability \u2014 e.g., Chile or France. We can, however, still approximate the upper bound for those countries relying on its correlation with the cumulative positive testing rate. Figure 4 (besides) plots the relationship between the median of the cumulative rate and the upper bound measure for those countries for which sufficient data were available (red dots). Note here that that regression would be even more accurate using the mean cumulative rate. However, I used the median instead as it is more robust for countries for which very few data points are available (as in Spain\u2019s only four batches). I used the regression line plotted by the dashed line for interpolating the value of the upper bound for the remaining countries (blue dots in Figure 4). Notice here that \u2014 in contrast with the extrapolation that I used in my previous post \u2014 this remains an interpolation within the regression\u2019s training range, and it is therefore much more reliable.", "The red dots Figure 5 plot the upper bounds interpolated through regression for those countries for which it was not possible to compute them directly. As before, only three countries (Iran, Spain, and The Netherlands) can \u2014 in an absolutely worst-case scenario \u2014 possibly have prevalences above 50%, which the great majority being well below 30%.", "I will now take a short \u2014 but necessary \u2014 detour into mathematical notation, as this will be crucial for disentangling the relationship between testing bias and the and prevalence measures.", "In terms of probability theory, we can define the testing bias as the ratio between the probability of testing somebody infected with the disease to that of testing a non-infected person. Ideally, a measure of bias should be exactly zero whenever no actual bias in either direction exists \u2014 i.e., an infected person is exactly as likely to be tested as is a non-infected person. This is achieved by defining the measure B in Equation 1 (above) in logarithmic scale. Equation 2 follows from Equation 1 by applying Bayes\u2019 Theorem \u2014 one of the fundamental rules of probability, stating that for any events A and B, their conditional probabilities are related by P(A|B) = P(B|A)\u00d7P(A) / P(B) \u2014 and cancelling out the resulting P(tested) terms. Finally, applying another basic rule of probability \u2014 P(not A)=1-P(A) \u2014one arrives at the crucial Equation 3. This last equation establishes that \u2014 for a given day \u2014 the bias is the difference between the log odds ratios (i.e., the betting odds) of the upper bound and the true prevalence.", "[\u2026] Equation 3 [\u2026] necessarily implies that the daily positive testing rate is a strict upper bound for the daily prevalence", "A positive value of B represents a bias towards testing people who have the disease, which is the situation in which all countries are. As I discussed in my previous post, all are naturally giving priority to testing people who have indications of having been exposed to the virus (see for instance the USA\u2019s Center for Disease Control criteria on COVID-19 testing). We can therefore be quite certain that for all countries B>0. Note that the opposite would mean that non-infected people are more likely to be tested than infected ones, which would not make sense in any possible scenario \u2014 other than the testing authorities intentionally avoiding to locate the SARS-CoVID cases, which would be somewhat surprising.", "In turn, by Equation 3 this necessarily implies that the daily positive testing rate is a strict upper bound for the daily prevalence. Equation 3 can be extended into a period longer than a particular day by replacing the positive testing rate term with the partially accumulated positive testing rate described above, and the daily prevalence for the lifetime prevalence of the infection.", "From Equation 3 above we can also infer that the log odds ratio of the true prevalence is just the upper bound minus the bias. Therefore, for bounding the true prevalence, it suffices with bounding the value of the bias B. We can combine the available data with some common-sense assumptions \u2014 what I call statistically informed common-sense \u2014 to get a better picture of the prevalence across countries.", "First, it is by now well-known that a large proportion of people infected with CoV-2 never develop any noticeable symptoms, although the exact proportion of such asymptomatic patients remains under investigation (see here for an overview of different proportions reported by different studies). The highest proportion of asymptomatic infections reported is of about 70% (coming from testing the whole three thousand inhabitants of Vo\u2019, in Northern Italy).", "Now suppose that 60% of a population \u2014 the bare minimum that experts estimate necessary for achieving herd immunity \u2014 has at some point been infected by CoV-2. In a worst case scenario for assessing the prevalence, let us assume that only 30% of infected people exhibit any symptoms \u2014 as was the case in Vo\u2019. I take this very high asymptomatic percentage intentionally as a lower bound for the bias (and therefore upper bound for prevalence). Taking any lower asymptomatic percentages would result in substantially larger testing biases. What upper bound value for the prevalence do we need to observe for having reached that 60%?", "Let us set up two plausible scenarios:", "These scenarios can be used for guessing the true prevalence rate that would be necessary for observing a certain upper bound value, as plotted in Figure 6. In both scenarios, except for the upper bound value close to 100%, true prevalences must lie substantially below upper bounds, often by a factor of four or five.", "The results of applying the guessed biases from both scenarios are plotted by the blue (Scenario 1) and yellow (Scenario 2) dots in Figure 3 (for the upper bounds computed directly) and Figure 5 (for the upper bounds interpolated through regression). Importantly, except for the United Kingdom, Senegal , and Panama \u2014 of the countries with reliable daily series \u2014 , and for Iran and Spain\u2014 of the countries estimated through regression \u2014 the great majority of countries are expected to have prevalences below 20% even in the very low bias Scenario 1. Under the more realistic bias of Scenario 2, only the United Kingdom, Iran, and Senegal, can have lifetime prevalences above 10%.", "The two scenarios described above combine rough common-sense guesses of how large the bias can be, with a statistically sound upper bound measure. One can certainly doubt the common-sense component of the estimates. Note, however, that common-sense reasoning lies at the heart of probability theory. As put by Pierre-Simon Laplace,", "[\u2026] la th\u00e9orie des probabilit\u00e9s n\u2019est au fond, que le bon sens r\u00e9duit au calcul.  \u2014 Pierre-Simon Laplace, Essai Philosophique Sur les Probabilit\u00e9s, 1814", "Probability Theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculus. This idea was later more formally proved in a celebrated theorem by Richard T. Cox (Cox\u2019s Theorem), indicating that common sense and intuitive knowledge can be codified and the rules of Probability Theory then provide the most \u2014 in fact the only \u2014 reasonable way of making inferences on such knowledge. The common-sense scenarios I have put forward are just a plain overt quantification of our previous knowledge, that CoV-2 testing is biased towards infected people in most countries. The method used here enables to \u2014 if one has reason to believe that the biases should be higher or lower \u2014 just plug a new prior guess in and obtain the results that are most consistent with such assumptions. We can now use the data from countries for which we have reliable estimates of the true prevalence rate for investigating what are the true positive testing biases across countries.", "[\u2026] in Spain an infected person was exactly 127 times more likely to be tested than a non-infected person.", "Recently, Spain\u2019s Instituto de Salud Carlos III released the preliminary results of the first round of its ENE-COVID19 Study (the link is in Spanish, see here for a summary in English by Reuters). This is a large-scale seroprevalence study looking for CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples from more than 60,000 Spanish residents, sampled randomly between April 27 and May 11, carefully chosen to provide an accurate cross-sectional representation of Spain\u2019s population. They report that about five percent of Spanish residents would have been infected by the virus, with a 95% confidence interval of between 4.7% and 5.4%. This is extremely close to Spain\u2019s estimate under Scenario 2, which was of 4.64%. It seems however that Spain\u2019s testing bias is in fact even higher than that guessed for Scenario 2. Considering Spain\u2019s estimated upper bound for the prevalence (49.32%), together with a 5% true prevalence, using Equation 3, we would have a testing bias of B=3.00, identical to Scenario 2 to the second decimal place. This would imply that, in Spain, infected people would have been about 20 times more likely to be tested than non-infected people. Notice, however that, rather than the 70% worst case I intentionally took, according to the ENE-COVID19 study, only 2.5% of people that had CoV-2 antibodies did not exhibit any symptoms, and an additional 4.6% showed two or less symptoms (the minimum required to suspect a person might be infected was three symptoms). This by itself would account for the move from Scenario 1 to Scenario 2.", "More detailed facts about Spain\u2019s testing bias situation can be inferred from the data reported in the ENE-COVID2 study. The study reports having taken samples from 60,640 people who had not previously received a CoV-2 tests, and from 247 people who had already been tested. Among these, only 4.7% of people who had not been tested had CoV-2 antibodies, compared with 87% of people who had been tested before. With these numbers, by applying Bayes\u2019 Theorem, we can directly use Equation 1 and compute Spain\u2019s true bias to be B=4.85. In other words, in Spain an infected person was almost exactly 127 times more likely to be tested than a non-infected person. The increase in one full logarithmic unit in testing bias indicates that Spain\u2019s upper bound \u2014 interpolated through regression \u2014 was actually underestimated, and should lie at about 87%, rather than the 49.32% interpolated by the regression.", "Part of the mismatch above could be attributed to the use of regression. However, there is another \u2014 more worrying \u2014 reason behind it. There is a large variability on the testing data reported by different countries (see here for details on each country). Some countries report number of tests performed, some countries report number of samples taken, others report number of people tested, some report several of those measures, and some do not clarify at all. In Spain\u2019s specific case, what is reported is number of tests performed \u2014 but note that often several tests are performed on a single person. The cumulative positive testing rate is computed as the ratio of confirmed cases to number of tests. For Spain this was, as of today, of 11.95%. However, the upper bound of 87% coincides exactly with the positive testing rate in number of persons reported in the ENE-COVID19 study. In other words, the upper bounds will likely be severely underestimated in all countries that report only number of tests performed, without mention of the number of people actually tested.", "A note on Spain\u2019s testing strategy is due here. That 87% of people tested were actually positive \u2014 and note that this is probably higher, as many of those who died soon after being tested could not take part in the seroprevalence study \u2014 reveals a rather questionable testing strategy. The bias is so high that is only being used for confirming whom we already are almost certain that is infected. Notice that that positive testing rate actually approaches the sensitivity of actual tests \u2014 this could well be a test with 87% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity. In other words, in Spain the very fact of being tested for the disease constitutes in itself a test for the disease, about as reliable as the tests themselves! I do not find this a very useful application of the tests.", "[\u2026] in Estonia, infected people were around 68 times more likely to be tested than were non-infected people", "Similarly, on May 6 the University of Tartu, Estonia, released the results of the first wave of its national COVID-19 serological study. They tested 2,007 adult residents of Estonia during seven days beginning April 24, and they found three cases with CoV-2 antibodies. This represents a prevalence of around 0.15% of the Estonian population (95% confidence interval [0%\u20130.32%]) by May 1. This is remarkably close to the estimate for Estonia under Scenario 2, which was of 0.51%. As before, combining the antibodies datum with the Estonian upper bound (9.32%) the bias estimate for Estonia would be B=4.23. This amounts to saying that, in Estonia, infected people were around 68 times more likely to be tested than were non-infected people. This is indeed consistent with the Estonian Government\u2019s COVID-19 testing guidelines, which generally recommend testing only patients with symptoms, and specially when they are considered at risk (in addition to running separate batches of random testing for gauging the extent of the disease\u2019s spread across the country). Unlike Spain\u2019s regressed upper bound, Estonia\u2019s estimate was computed directly from the daily testing data, but it is still based on numbers of tests performed \u2014 not people tested \u2014 so it is likely underestimated. This would imply that the testing bias is in fact probably higher than this, perhaps as high as Spain\u2019s.", "Moreover, Estonia\u2019s seroprevalence estimate might not be that accurate due to the relatively small number of samples on which it was computed. The reason why I suspect this rate is twofold: First, its 95% confidence interval would include 0% and more than double the rate. Second, the current number of confirmed cases in Estonia actually amounts to 0.13% of its population, and \u2014 as I argued in my previous post \u2014 this is the absolute minimum for the lifetime prevalence. Having just a 0.15% prevalence is so close to the minimum that it would suggest that Estonia is rather unique in having detected virtually all of its SARS-COVID-19 cases.", "[\u2026] infected people in France were \u201cjust\u201d 7.79 times more likely to be tested than non-infected people.", "Recently, researchers from France\u2019s Institut Pasteur published a detailed study in Science Magazine modelling the prevalence of CoV-2 among the French population, using very detailed demographic data. This is a step below a national prevalence study, but it is nevertheless a very reliable estimate. They concluded that, by May 11, about 4.4% of the French population \u2014 with a 95% confidence interval ranging between 2.8% and 7.2% \u2014 have at some point been infected by CoV-2. This lies very just slightly below the estimations for France under Scenario 1 (5.64%). Using France\u2019s interpolated upper bound (26.39%), would imply that France had in fact a quite low testing bias of B=2.05; infected people in France were \u201cjust\u201d 7.79 times more likely to be tested than non-infected people. We should, however, take this bias estimate with a grain of salt, as France\u2019s upper bound were \u2014 as Spain\u2019s \u2014 obtained by regression on numbers of tests performed, and we know from Spain\u2019s data this results in strong underestimation.", "As of finishing this post, on May 15, 2020, the United Kingdom stands out among the countries for which the upper bound could be computed directly from the daily testing rates. Its upper bound lies at a staggering 77.8% maximum possible lifetime prevalence. Britain reports daily numbers of people tested \u2014 not tests performed \u2014 and therefore the upper bound is most likely not underestimated. Although, as I have shown, even the introduction of a very small testing bias reduces this amount dramatically \u2014 e.g., 36.87% under Scenario 1, already quite far from any hope of herd immunity\u2014even the high bias Scenario 2 leaves Britain with an estimated prevalence of 14.91%. I suspect that the United Kingdom\u2019s true prevalence is in fact well below this number, probably more in line with Spain\u2019s 5% (as it has very similar numbers in terms of deaths). This would put Britain\u2019s testing bias at B=4.25 \u2014 almost identical to Estonia\u2019s, indicating that an infected person is about 70 times more likely to be tested than a non-infected one.", "While correcting the upper bound measures and taking a more detailed look at an explicit measure of positive testing bias, I must reiterate the main point I argued on April 29 \u2014 which as seen above, has been rather corroborated with the results of real prevalence studies beginning to be available: Herd immunity is very far away, and it will take a long time to reach it until a vaccine becomes available. It is important therefore that countries \u2014 even when they have managed to get their peaks under control \u2014 remain very careful to avoid future resurgences of the infection. Clearly, lifting some of the restrictions will become both an economic and a public health imperative in most countries \u2014 as I mentioned in my previous post, deep economic crises are also known to cause many deaths. However, attempting a full return to plain pre-pandemic normality before a vaccine is available would be reckless. It would risk repeating \u2014 or worse \u2014 the tragic scenes that have been lived in Milan\u2019s, Madrid\u2019s, London\u2019s, or New York City\u2019s hospitals.", "The argument that \u201ceventually everyone will get it anyway, so there is no point in trying to stop it\u201d is in itself reckless \u2014 especially in the mouth of public health officials. It overlooks the evidence that it is not the same to experience a gradual leakage of cases \u2014 that can be controlled well by health services in many countries \u2014 as it would be experiencing sudden overwhelming avalanches of cases, as we have already seen in Italy, Spain, and several other countries. The cost in lives will certainly be much higher in the second scenario.", "The calculations made here have also underlined the importance of having available daily testing data. This is something that some countries are not currently doing, but it is a crucial piece for monitoring the progress of the pandemic across countries. In turn, this is crucial for assessing the efficacy of different policy choices used for controlling the pandemic. Moreover, as it has been made clear by Spain\u2019s released ENE-COVID19 study, it is crucial that countries report both the number of people that has been tested and the number of tests that have been performed. Only in this way we will be able to compute reliable cross-country data.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
