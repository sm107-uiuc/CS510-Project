There are many more important parts of the interview process. That being said, a great resume can win you an interview and help you to avoid rejection before a company ever gets to meet you. Usually, resumes are a screening criteria. If employers don\u2019t see certain things they are looking for, they will toss yours in the rejection pile. Avoid the following mistakes if you want to increase your chances of getting to the first round of the interview process.", "Your resume is so much larger than just a piece of paper. In 2020 and beyond, it is your entire online presence. You should include a link to your github, your kaggle profile, and your LinkedIn if you want to give yourself the best shot. I know many data science managers who will automatically pass if they don\u2019t see at least one of these on a resume.", "The best way to evaluate someone\u2019s future work potential is to inspect the past work that they have done. Your github or your kaggle are the most practical places for interviewers to gain this understanding. If you are active on these platforms, this will greatly boost your probability of getting an interview.", "Your resume should be catered to the position where you are applying. Employers are looking for candidates to fill a specific role. Some skills will be extremely relevant to the role, while others may not be. You should focus on highlighting your experience associated with the relevant skills.", "One way to do this is to have a master resume where you have 5\u201310 bullets for each project or experience that you have had. For each job choose ~3 that best fit the position.", "Data scientists are important because of the business value that they create. I see many data scientists focusing more on what methods they used rather than the results of their work. It doesn\u2019t matter what complex algorithm that you used if it produces a poor result. All of your bullets for your project and work experience should include the end result of your analysis.", "As a data scientist, you need to focus on measurable outcomes. Rather than saying that you increased your company\u2019s website traffic, you should say that you increased it by 5% over 3 months. Quantification is an integral part of data science, and you need to exhibit it in your resume.", "Much like Mistake 4, you want to focus on how you are presenting information. You should be showing employers that you have a skill rather than telling them. This builds additional credibility. Rather than telling me that you are good at python, show me that you have done 5 projects using the language. Showing is far less subjective and it helps to build your personal story.", "You want your interviewers to remember you. The best way to do this is to include things that make you stick out (in a positive way). You can do this through unique projects/work experience, or through sharing something interesting about yourself. Including extracurricular activities from school, volunteer work, or an interests section can help leave an impression on an interviewer. I am an avid reader, so I usually include 5 of the best books I have read in the past few months.", "While I am definitely guilty of this in my blogging, this is something that is unacceptable in a resume. As a data scientist, you need to be detail-oriented in your work, and improper grammar or terminology can be a huge mark against you.", "This is particularly important if English is not your first language. I recommend having friends read your resume over to avoid any phrasing errors.", "If you are truly passionate about data science as a profession, I believe that you should at least do a little bit of it in your free time. Projects can show your level of organization, interests, and creativity.", "If you\u2019ve read any of my other material, you know that I believe that these are what will separate you from the pack. If you would like to learn more about data science projects, give this a read: The Projects You Should Do to Get a Data Science Job", "If you correct these errors, I believe that you will greatly increase your chances of getting to the first round interview. During the interview process, you get asked many questions based on your resume as well, so make sure you can talk at length about your experiences.", "If you would prefer to watch a video:", "Your home for data science.
