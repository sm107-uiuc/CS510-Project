A machine learning model\u2019s prediction performance is normally conducted :-", "Out-of-sample forecast performance is generally considered more trustworthy and empirical evidence based compared to in-sample performance. In-sample performance tend to be more sensitive to outliers and data mining. Out-of-sample forecasts also better reflect the information available in real time. However, it can be noted that, in-sample return predictability does not necessarily imply out-of-sample return predictability. The key is that, model which learns from training set, whether able to generalize new data.", "Let us explore and see how our real-life case study works in the scenario of never before seen data. We will use Dow Jones industrial index data for our investigation.", "Quantile forecasts are central to risk management decisions because of the widespread use of Value-at-Risk (VaR). It is the product of two factors:-", "Hypothesis: daily returns are normally distributed. We can visualize the distribution plot on daily return as shown below.", "Method: analytic quantiles by curve fitting to historical data here, Student\u2019s t distribution", "Notice here from the above plots that, Gaussian White noise has constant volatility. The periods of high & low volatility and the extreme choppiness of the returns. Moreover, we also can see how volatility appears to be time dependent; periods of high volatility persist and periods of low volatility persist.", "We will be generating the Dow Jones price movement based on the historical volatility. With this historical volatility, there will be an element of randomness.", "Formula used to generate the next day\u2019s price:", "The last days price and multiplying it by 1 + a random shock which is created by drawing a sample of the distribution given the historical volatility.", "Let us view the prices a year (252 days) back.", "We run a simulation with 10,000 run to obtain the below output.", "The above plot indicates that, Dow Jones price was almost stable since last 1 year; starting Adj Close price was $ 28745, and the average final price over 10,000 runs is almost similar ($ 28759). The red line indicates the VaR at the 99% confidence interval.", "We are going to perform ML to predict the future Adj Close price. Let us do some feature engineering which are critical for the performance of the model.", "Time series components are highly important to analyzing the variable of interest in order to understand its behavior, what patterns it has, and to be able to choose and fit an appropriate time-series model. Time series predictors, on he other hand, may help some models to recognize additional patterns and improve the quality of forecasts. Both time series components and features are key to interpreting the behavior of the time series, analyzing its properties, identifying possible causes, and more\u2026Roman Josue de las Heras Torres", "Interested may visit here to get details technical indicators.", "We have created target variable to predict future 15 days values which are not available in the current data-set.", "No, let us fit a linear (OLS) model as base model and observe the model we obtain:", "We fit the model using XGBRegressor and subsequently check the confidence level on test set, also obtain the predicted values (15 days). XGBoost has the ability to deal with missing values in data. Moreover, data scaling is not necessary for tree based algorithms.", "Though the performance has improved from base model, but we are not quite there considering we have used regression algorithm. At this stage we can go back look into the features and work more on relevant features.", "Once we are satisfied with the accuracy, we may work on future forecast using the forecast data kept separated. The procedure is shown below.", "We need to have dates with the above values for better understanding. Actually, we have predicted for 2 weeks as shown below. Below lines of codes generates future dates for the obtained predicted values.", "The plot adding observed (last 2 months) and predicted values (future 1 month) helps us to understand if the model is been able to capture the pattern from historical data. The future forecast looks realistic here.", "We can clearly see a poor prediction from above plot.", "Besides working on features, we need to revisit and look at our target variable which is not shifted in this experiment and we may have induced look ahead bias by doing so. We can try experimenting with df[\u2018Adj Close\u2019].shift(-1) which gives future prediction.", "When we\u2019re ready to forecast the future in real time, we should of course use all the available data for estimation, so that the most recent data is used.", "We may try other algorithms like support vector or random forest. Although, XGB can learn much more complex nonlinear representations but need more data set to perform better. We have not applied any fundamental variables, all the predictor variables used here are likely having a linear relationships with target variables.", "Tree based algorithms are best among the supervised machine learning algorithms for prediction problems. These methods are able to capture complex relationships in the data by learning many simple rules, one rule at a time.", "Cross validation and algorithm optimization techniques need to be applied to finalize a robust model performance. By looking at the bias/variance we may adjust over-fitting or under-fitting issues; we may also introduce early stopping rounds which have not been exercised here. It would be a good idea to test few other model and may introduce an ensemble of best models to check the performance and accuracy score.", "Moreover, holding data out for validation purposes is an important diagnostic test because it gives the best indication of the accuracy that can be expected when forecasting the future. It may be a good practice to hold out at least 20% of data for validation purposes. However, with a lot of data availability, holding out 50% can also be tried.", "Your home for data science.
