At first, as a student and even a professional data scientist, I tended to stray away from GitHub because it was confusing and something that did not seem like I needed to know as a data scientist. But, over time, I came to realize that, in order to scale your code and model, especially if there is more than one person involved (which usually there is), as well as employ accurate version control, Git and GitHub are essential. While you can choose to do most of your work in a Jupyter Notebook, once your model becomes ready for deployment, the number of files will increase, and because .py files that will most likely be all object-oriented, where the code is not research-focused, but efficiently software engineer-like coded, GitHub will be the solution to that process. Below, I will discuss GitHub and its very useful Git commands that will help you become a better data scientist.", "GitHub [3] is a tool for, in this context, data scientists to collaborate and employ version control through the use of Git. It can be used for research purposes but is mainly allocated to the deployment code of your machine learning models. The best way to use it is through the use of pull requests. These help to ensure that multiple people, which is an editable field, review and approve your code changes. The above image is the general setup of creating your first repository. I will not focus on this as much, because we will be discussing useful Git commands, but it is important to note this is the first step in the overall process before using the described commands.", "The setup code is found here for creating a repository from your terminal:", "Once your repository is established you can follow these useful Git commands for moving throughout your repository within your terminal. Since multiple people will be working on the same repository, it is important to create branches, which will be your working space that will ultimately be merged into the main repository once the pull request is approved. Here are the code examples of common data science commands along with their respectful information.", "This branch command returns all the branches of your repository, which after time could be upwards of 20, so this command will highlight in green versus the other branches being white, your current branch that you are on. This command is vital so that you do not accidentally push incorrect code to your master branch \u2014 by making sure you are not on the master branch.", "To duplicate the master branch and create your own, use the above branch command. This ensures that you are working on a separate branch that can also be merged in with new code changes after the pull request is approved. Change the name_of_branch to the name of the branch you would like to have.", "While checking your branch, and switching to the master branch, this command will pull in all new code changes and your master branch will be completely up-to-date. It is recommended that you perform this pull command frequently.", "Once you get really in the thick of things in your repository and switch between files and create changes, you will need to know what you have changed. Checking the status of your changes is useful before making those new code changes to the master branch.", "These next 4 commands will be consecutive commands in order to add changes, commit them, and push them to your GitHub respiratory that it will be compared to your master branch, ultimately becoming merged in once approved.", "The above add command is an example of the directory of three folders that house the file that you are adding, so feel free to replace those folder names with the names of your actual folder, as well as changing the file.py to your actual .py file.", "The commit command is step two in this process that not only names the change that you are making, but commits the code change as well.", "To compile all of the previous steps together, you will use the push command to send the file(s) with its changes to the repository. Note: you do not have to do a pull request after, but it is usually the step most people would take in this process.", "If you have been working on your branch locally and this is the first time that you will be hosting it as a shared and public (within your company) branch, you will have to use this push command, which will be prompted automatically as a suggestion. The name of branch will be replaced with the branch that you already named.", "While this code is simple, it is incredibly powerful and will allow you to be a data scientist who uses a controlled system with checks and balances in your code. You can now compare your code changes with other data scientists or software engineers who are also working on the same model. Lastly, you will see a green icon that will ask you if you want to \u2018create a pull request\u2019. You will then be able to create, visualize, and see how your code compares to the master code. After the code is approved by say, two people, you can merge your changes into master and delete your branch.", "This article has described quickly setting up your repository for use on your local computer, while then also being able to be applied to the overall master branch that will house the production-level code of your data science or machine learning model.", "Using the discussed common Git commands, you will be able to successfully apply code changes to your data science GitHub repository.", "Your home for data science.
