Although I don\u2019t remember any of the specific problems, I remember the level of panic in class the following days. The whole class was shocked because previously we only encountered at most quadratic equations \u2026 Now he wants us to solve problems involving these mythical creatures that can go up to as much \u201cn\u201d as they want and who knows if they even have analytic solutions ? (Galois knows. They mostly don\u2019t)", "The next thing he taught us about was generating functions and recursions. He showed us the general formula for Fibonacci numbers, and how Euler derived his famous summation of the Basel problem.", "Then, I did my first degree in math. To my absolute surprise, I never really encountered any of these stuff again. Back in high school, I was sure this was what Mathematics is all about, but now as a more mature and educated scholar, I knew these were ancient math and children games.", "Imagine my second surprise when deep into my Masters degree, dealing with problems related to Game theory, these exact subjects of polynomials and recurrences came back up in the most natural way ..!", "Cutting away from my heartwarming personal story, I wish in this post to give a few nuggets of the place of experiments in math, and how you can \u2018Do math like a data scientist\u2019. Of course it\u2019s considered total heresy to think of math as experimentation \u2014 That\u2019s the induction fallacy, right ? But actually the art of guessing has a lot of place in Mathematics, and if you can later wrap your guess with a complete argument then you could end up rigorously valid.", "Let\u2019s start with some pre-requisite software. There is a lot of symbolic mathematics software out there \u2014 coq and sage and maple and what have you. In this world you can not be picky in the way you can be picky in the software development startup world \u2014 For any specific use that you wish to make of the software, if it\u2019s not totally standard, good chances are there is only one implementation out there \u2014 so whether it\u2019s in Maple, Matlab or in a proprietary framework someone developed in assembly for microwave chips \u2014 you are going to have to learn to use it. Anyway for the purposes of following this post I recommend you have python, Mathematica and Matlab installed. In case you don\u2019t, you can still follow up on the simple code explanation and results.", "In the RISC institute down in Linz, Austria they developed the amazing RISCErgosum package for Mathematica. This package can basically prove any identity you can think of. Let\u2019s see it in action proving an Euler paper from 250 years ago \u2014 as described in this nice article summary.", "In the article, Euler was deriving a general formula for the so called central trinomial coefficients, by methods of finding a recurrence they satisfy. He dedicates a full chapter to a failed attempt he had where a simple recurrence based on Fibonacci series seemed to hold, but by computing enough terms of the series Euler eventually managed to see this recurrence does not generally hold and found the correct expression. We can follow up on his efforts with Mathematica with the following simple 10-liner code:", "Here are the code and results:", "I only cheated a little bit \u2014 FullSimplify is not always trustworthy, and can actually make mistakes. But given the recurrence it is possible, whether by computer algebra or by hand, to verify it does indeed hold in general. The \u2018hard part\u2019 is the guess.", "Let\u2019s see another example of an experimental approach applied in solving a question in Renewal processes. Imagine the following petting zoo managed by a bored teenager.", "Kids get turns in going in the petting zoo. Every time a group of kids is let in, with i.i.d intervals T1,T2,T3,\u2026 which are distributed Geo(p), since the teenager sometimes does his job, but sometimes also slacks off for longer and longer times. But since he knows he\u2019s going to slack off, he enters a number of kids Nk so that Nk-s are independent but the conditional distribution of Nk given Tk+1 = n is Uni{1,\u2026,n+2}. So even though he\u2019s slacking off, more kids will go in, so it should be ok. The question is, what is the average time in the long run that kids will spend in the petting zoo ?", "Solving it analytically is not too hard \u2014 You define a matching reward-renewal process and by the reward-reneal theorem and some summations you eventually arrive at the formula", "p being the geometric distribution parameter. But this requires some knowledge in stochastic processes analysis and basic probability. Even if you are sure of your analytic abilities, it\u2019s nice to compare it with a simulation. So, even without knowing much, you can write the following code:", "Here is a simple python code to implement this procedure:", "We run this code for different values of p. We then have an estimation of a function in p of the solution. But how can this give us a formula ? Well, even without doing the exact calculation you can be quite sure that the formula we\u2019re looking for is a rational function. That\u2019s because it\u2019s going to be some ratio between expectations that involve uniform and geometric distributions, which probably will be low order polynomials in p. We can then use any tool to fit a rational function to our acquired simulation data, I used cftool of Matlab -", "You can see the fit is actually great. In real life, I didn\u2019t use cftool, but rather since I kept having arithmetic mistakes in the analytic calculation, I used the simulation to determine the exact expression by doing some value guessing. If I had a harder time in the first few guesses though, I would resort to some kind of rational functions fitting program.", "Now, maybe the most important question about conducting experiments is when to stop. How many tries is enough ?", "For some algebraic entities that have a notion of degree or dimension we know the answer. A polynomial of degree n is determined by n+1 points. Thus, it\u2019s enough to sample n+1 points of the polynomial to uniquely determine its complete form. A similar thing applies to a recurrence of order n \u2014 if we know the recurrence holds for our series, and we have n points where our series expression identifies with a solution of the recurrence, then given that nothing too bad is going on with the recurrence expression, we can roll on inductively and get a true identity.", "As for renewal processes and generally Markov Chains, simulation can yield very accurate numbers, sometimes with much less effort than analytic calculation, and with guarantees as are given here:", "I will cite one result from there, which is cool:", "When you want to get an equidistributed deck of cards, the \u2018safest\u2019 way to do so is to pick up a random card to go first, then a random card of the remaining ones to be second, and so on. But this would require you to make a choice out of 52 cards in the first step, 51 in the second \u2026 You will end up needing to choose one deck of cards out of possible 52!.", "But, what happens in real life too, is you take a deck of cards that is not random, and you trust that after a few shuffles it will be as good as random. It\u2019s obvious that if you only move one or two cards around in the deck it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. And also it\u2019s obvious that if you go on doing this forever and a day, the deck of cards will be randomized. When is the right time to stop ? Read the overview and you will see that about NlogN ~ 400 single card replacements should do the trick. Here they came up with the number 277. Of course, if you do a rifle shuffle it can take much less as in every \u201cshuffle\u201d you get much more single steps happen.", "If this post got you even a little bit interested in computer algebra, experimental math or stochastic simulation, I highly recommend these as further reading:", "A=B, a great book on the art and science of proving identities using recurrence relations", "An experimental math manifesto by Doron Zeilberger, an author of the A=B book", "A great and practical book about stochastic simulation done right by Asmussen", "Your home for data science.
