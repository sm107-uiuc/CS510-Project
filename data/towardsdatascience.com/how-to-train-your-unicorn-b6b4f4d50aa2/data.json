Just like Full Stack Developers have a horizontal knowledge that goes from back-end to front-end, Data Scientists need to have an understanding of everything between Data Engineering and Business Domain. Such a professional needs to be proficient in several areas, like Data Engineering, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Statistics. Moreover, he/she needs to be a Subject Matter Expert.", "I believe that someone that is starting his/her journey in this world can have two main challenges to face:", "My perfect mix for learning includes both theoretical study and practical experience, but proportions are definitely skewed towards the latter, as I am a learning-by-doing type of person. I also think that \u201cdoing stuff\u201d can help during job hunting (in particular for those who are at the first experience); what answer would you like to give between:", "Degrees and courses are absolutely necessary and you should take as many of them as you can, but you may agree that some practical examples to showcase your skills could help!", "What I am sharing in this article are five datasets that I think would be super helpful for both learning and practice purposes. The idea behind this selection was to have data coming from different domains, easy to use but not without challenges. Let\u2019s dive into them!", "A very nice dataset is the Kaggle Best Artworks of All Time, uploaded by the user Icaro (download). As stated in the description, this dataset contains three files:", "The resized pictures are handy to speedup preprocessing if this data is fed into an AI model (most neural networks will require very small images). Note that \u201cdata was scraped from artchallenge.ru during the end of February 2019\u201d [1].", "An idea on how to use this dataset could be experimenting with ConvNets to build a classifier that, given an image, can identify the author; another application could be to use the artworks to implement a Neural Style Transfer GAN. Images are also a basis to build nice data visualizations: why not implementing a graph that connects artworks according to some logic? A few years back, I had fun with a similar dataset, analyzing Pollock paintings.", "To show what can be done in a couple of hours, in the following example I used ResNet50 trained on ImageNet to extract the features from each artwork. This is done by removing the last layer of the neural network and collecting the output of the neurons just before that top layer; that output will be our \u201cfeatures vector\u201d (we are going to have one vector for each image).", "After feature extraction, I used a combination of PCA and tSNE to project the high dimensional vectors on a 2-d space. Finally, I ran DBSCAN to identify some clusters; as you can see from the GIF below, even though I did no fine-tuning, the algorithm is capable to make sense of the input images (faded thumbnails are those marked as noise by DBSCAN).", "If you want to download the full results, this is the link.", "I think this dataset is interesting given the fact that it has a fair amount of dimensions. It contains statistics on the use of force from the Metropolitan Police Service of London (download). Each row set represents the use of force by an officer on one subject. This row set is not a count of incidents. Where more than one officer has used force on the same subject, this will be shown on separate rows of data [2].", "This data could drive to very catchy dashboards, and, with a bit of effort, also to ML models (e.g to predict outcomes of Police interventions that involve the use of force). Note also that the time dimension is a nice-to-have to do time series analysis.", "I wanted to include in this list some Census data. A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population [3], and most of the countries have some kind of Statistics Agency that, periodically, collects data about the whole population. What I am suggesting here is the Italian 2011 Census dataset (download).", "There are two main reasons why I wanted to include this kind of data:", "To start playing around with the database, visit the link I provided and download the file below:", "The zip archive contains one file for each of the 20 Italian Regions the name template is R<n>_indicatori_2011_sezioni.csv, where R<n> is the Region number. Columns are described in a file named tracciato_2011_sezioni.csv.", "Unfortunately, the dataset appears not to be available in English, so you can either choose to exploit Google to translate the names of the columns, or use a Census from another country :)", "The fourth dataset comes from an old Kaggle competition (download). The host provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:", "The objective was to create a model to predict the probability of each type of toxicity for each comment [5].", "I believe this is a good starting point if you want to delve into NLP and Deep Learning with Recurrent Neural Networks. To make the modeling spicier, you could try different preprocessing techniques, network topology, and data enrichment (why not using the Google APIs to translate the Wikipedia comments in another language, and then re-translate back to English to have more training data?).", "A plus of this dataset is that you are going to have tons of material available from the Kaggle community.", "The dashboard below has nothing to do with deep learning, and it\u2019s just a brief exploration of the dataset (the script after the dashboard is what I have used to extract the info from the raw comments).", "If you want to challenge yourself with some Data Engineering and feature extraction, as well as big volumes of data, I suggest you the Loghub dataset from Logpai (download).", "Loghub maintains a collection of system logs, which are freely accessible for research purposes. Some of the logs are production data released from previous studies, while some others are collected from real systems in our lab environment. Wherever possible, the logs are NOT sanitized, anonymized, or modified in any way. All these logs amount to over 77 GB in total. We thus host only a small sample (2k lines) on Github for each dataset [6].", "As you can see from the description they provided on the Github page, we are talking of about 77 GB of data. Although those would not be a problem on a cluster, they might be challenging if running code locally: I think this is a plus for learning purposes!", "I hope you enjoyed!
