Big companies such as Twitter, Google, or Facebook invest in GNN research as it proves superior to other machine learning models that work with graph data.", "Since this field has been evolving rapidly, the knowledge behind GNNs is not that easily available yet. At the moment, you can find the GNN theory scattered around the internet in the form of research papers, articles, or blogs. What we lack is a GNN book, or a compilation of online resources to help people start in this field.", "After doing a bit of searching, I found that there are actually a few quite good resources that explain the GNNs in an approachable way. I hope that it will be useful for people new in this field. Let\u2019s get started!", "This book is a game changer and is currently available as pre-publication that can be downloaded online. It starts with beginners topics such as graph theory and traditional graph approaches to more advanced topics such as novel GNN models and state-of-the-art GNN research. It is a well designed and self-contained material that has most of the required theory for graph neural networks.", "It is a Stanford University course specialising in machine learning on graphs. It has publicly available slides from their lectures as well as recommended reading. Good if you want to follow a well-structured course on a systematic basis.", "It is an interactive book available online that focuses on the graph and networks theory. While it doesn\u2019t discuss GNNs, it is an excellent resource to get strong foundations for operating on graphs.", "An excellent blog created by one of the most famous researcher in the field of GNN \u2014 Dr Thomas Kipf. In his article, he gently introduces GNNs, provides a literature review of novel methods and discusses findings from his paper \u2014 Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks.", "Michael Bronstein is a professor at Imperial College London and the Head of Graph Learning Research at Twitter. Recently, he has started posting articles at Towards Data Science. His blog posts focus on a mathematical perspective of the GNNs and on the recent development in this field. He tends to cite many other articles on GNNs which might help you discover other interesting articles.", "While this position is not exactly about GNNs, part of this book provides practical applications of the GNN models. It explains how the GNNs can be applied to molecular datasets using a deep learning library for life sciences \u2014 Deepchem. It also discusses different preprocessing methods that are required for GNNs.", "Flawnson published a few introductory articles on GNNs at Medium. They are aimed at beginners who would like to get a basic understanding of the theory behind graph neural networks. Good if you want to get a glimpse of what GNNs are.", "It\u2019s a compilation of the recent GNN papers that contains most of the published papers in this field. They subdivided the list into separate topics such us. Worth checking out if you are looking for papers in a specific niche applications of GNNs.", "Paperswithcode is a well-know website that shares research papers together with its code. It\u2019s a good place if you want to find GNN models that already have a code implementation that you can use.", "This research paper summarizes most of the important findings in the GNNs, provides a short overview of the history behind GNNs, and discusses different types of GNN architectures.", "I am an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Amsterdam. In my spare time, you can find me fiddling with data or debugging my deep learning model (I swear it worked!). I also like hiking :)", "Here are my social media profiles, if you want to stay in touch with my latest articles and other useful content:", "Your home for data science.
