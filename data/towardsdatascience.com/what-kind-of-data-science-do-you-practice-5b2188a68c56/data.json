But what if we shifted our focus to a part of data science that gets relatively less attention? What if we began to color our conversations with the type of data we work with? Doing so could resolve a number of ambiguities about data science while contextualizing discussions of data science careers.", "The job of a data scientist is decidedly hot. But perhaps due to the variety of activities data scientists engage in, everyone seems to have a different definition. Many of the descriptions concern the skill-set a data scientist possesses \u2014 math, programming, visualization \u2014 or the tools they use \u2014 machine learning, statistics, big data ecosystems. Some focus on the scientific method: ask a question, form hypotheses, test, evaluate, repeat. Others relate data science\u2019s outsized impact with terms like insight, discovery, and data mining.", "Focusing on tools, methods, and impacts is useful in providing a picture of the data scientist. Indeed, description by skill set played a major role in shaping the view of data science we currently hold. The early designers of data science Venn diagrams recognized a movement taking place among quantitatively minded individuals and the outsized impact they were making\u00b9 \u00b2, placing into overlapping arrangements several core disciplines that are already pretty well defined. These early attempts at defining burgeoning data science helped set it on its path. However, there is more to data science than algorithms, thoughtful visualizations, and programming skill. It also requires an intimate understanding of the data, which might also be referred to as domain expertise.", "If you were to take the descriptions of a data scientist and attribute them to a prototypical scientist, a plain vanilla non-data scientist (if there is such a thing), they would be consistent and maybe accurate, but ultimately relatively uninformative. Those descriptions wouldn\u2019t be so much a highlight of the job as just the day-in day-out of doing science. Rather, the prying question for non-data scientists is what do they study? In fact, the kind of data a scientist observes is the one thing that broadly and narrowly differentiates one science from another. Comparing the major branches of science, the targets of their professional interest lay in different data domains, in different fields of observation. Can we talk about data science along a similar vein?", "Most companies have a business model, including those that hire data scientists. These models produce data unique to its business. Finance, self-driving vehicles, route optimization, pharmaceutical engineering, subscription services that stream audio and video, recommendation engines at the personal level; these areas produce various data that lead to different data scientific activities. Does your work focus on methods for visual object tracking? Prediction? Recommendation? Multi-modal forecasting? What kind of data science are you doing?", "One of most common questions for budding data scientists concerns how to begin. While university programs and bootcamps for data science have begun to assemble curricula for would-be data scientists, there are still a number of questions that need to be addressed. Learning a few programming languages and the basics of machine learning is a good start, but doesn\u2019t provide much direction for additional knowledge that would help newcomers secure positions. Defining a data scientist by the type of data they work with can help individuals to identify professional targets, narrow the set of skills to focus on developing\u00b3, and from the other side, encourage standardization of the language appearing in job descriptions. When applying for data science jobs, it would be helpful to be able to speak to the type of data you are applying to work with.", "Similarly, having descriptions of the kind of data a data scientist works with as part of their title would give greater meaning to an otherwise generic Data Scientist label. With this information, businesses that share data types but live in different industries would be able to more quickly assess the fit of individuals looking for positions. Similarly, it would help give data scientists awareness of areas outside of their own experience in which their skills could be effectively applied. Data scientists are valued if anything by the impact they make, and the greater their knowledge or intuition of a domain, the greater this can be.", "The proposed way of thinking about data science is not original. Previous writers have discussed the comparison of data science to science\u2074, while others have suggested defining what \u201cdata science is by its usage \u2014 e.g., what data scientists get paid to do,\u201d\u2075 or by the output they create\u2076. These all very much resonate with the idea of borrowing from the established taxonomy of science and finding lines of similarity along the axes of observation. And along these axes, additional delineating characteristics are still going to be needed, which could be according to the type of work performed\u2077 or duties required.", "As the field of data science and the areas in which data scientists find themselves occupied evolve, the language we use to describe what it is that data scientists do will also need to evolve. The suggestion presented here is to begin including terms that reflect the type of data, observations, or purpose, that are most relevant to the type of work being done.", "Your home for data science.
