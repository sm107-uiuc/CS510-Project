For example: Diabetic Retinopathy, Mood or Sentiment Analysis, Digit Recognition, Cancer-Type prediction (Malignant or Benign) etc. These problems are often solved by Machine Learning or Deep Learning. Also in Computer Vision, projects like Diabetic Retinopathy or Glaucoma Detection, Texture Analysis is often used now-a-days instead of Classical Machine Learning with conventional Image Processing or Deep Learning.

In other words, it can also be framed in a way that a particular instance (data-point in terms of Feature Space Geometry) needs to be kept under a particular region (signifying the class) and needs to separated from other regions (signifying other classes). This separation from other regions can be visualized by a boundary known as Decision Boundary. This visualization of the Decision Boundary in feature space is done on a Scatter Plot where every point depicts a data-point of the data-set and axes depicting the features. The Decision Boundary separates the data-points into regions, which are actually the classes in which they belong.", "After training a Machine Learning Model using a data-set, it is often necessary to visualize the classification of the data-points in Feature Space. Decision Boundary on a Scatter Plot serves the purpose, in which the Scatter Plot contains the data-points belonging to different classes (denoted by colour or shape) and the decision boundary can be drawn following many different strategies:", "Exemplar Implementation of Single-Line Decision Boundary:", "Here, I am going to demonstrate Single-Line Decision Boundary for a Machine Learning Model based on Logistic Regression.", "Going into the hypothesis of Logistic Regression -", "where z is defined as -", "So, h(z) is a Sigmoid Function whose range is from 0 to 1 (0 and 1 inclusive).", "For plotting Decision Boundary, h(z) is taken equal to the threshold value used in the Logistic Regression, which is conventionally 0.5.
