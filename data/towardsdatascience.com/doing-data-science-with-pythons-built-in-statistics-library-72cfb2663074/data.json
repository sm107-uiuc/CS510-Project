If a standard library can achieve a result, there\u2019s no need to import something fancy.", "While most data scientists rush for Scipy, Python contains a number of statistics function\u2019s in its standard library. The question is whether it\u2019s enough.", "Let\u2019s go on a tour through Python\u2019s standard statistics library. We\u2019ll import a dataset to play with and then walk through functions in statistics.", "Then import the dataset we\u2019re going to play with and drop it into a dataframe. The dataframe has nothing to do with statistics but makes it easier for us to look at.", "The arithmetic mean. The sum of values in a set, divided by the number of values in that set. While it\u2019s the most well known, it\u2019s just one measure of the centre of a set of values.", "It can also be highly misleading if the data is not balanced. For example, let\u2019s compare the distribution of \u201cMalic acid\u201d in the dataset with it\u2019s mean.", "Notice how the mean is skewed up by a few outliers on the high end.", "A quick way of thinking about harmonic mean is as a conservative average which gives extra weight to lower input values.", "We use harmonic mean all the time when evaluating machine learning models. An f1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.", "In a model evaluation scenario with precision of 0.65 and recall of 0.8, we could use harmonic_mean to calculate the f1 score.", "That said, we\u2019d have to write our own functions to calculate precision and recall if we weren\u2019t using sklearn to begin with.", "The median is the middle value in an ordered set of data.", "Median is interesting because it\u2019s not as skewed up by a few large or tiny values in a set. For this reason, I always consider it important to look at in addition to arithmetic mean.", "Median returns the middle number for a set with an odd number of values, and takes the average of the 2 middle values if the set has an even number of values.", "Let\u2019s look at \u201cmalic acid\u201d again so we can see the difference between mean and median.", "Almost exactly the same as median but it takes the lower middle number if the set has an odd number of values.", "Takes the higher middle number if set has an odd number of values.", "Finds the median of continuous classes where the width of each class is the size of the interval (interval=1, by default).", "I\u2019ve illustrated an example above that corresponds to the data we\u2019re using the function on below.", "Note how much easier it is to use the function than calculate it ourselves.", "Returns the most frequent data point from a set.", "A measure of the spread of data in a population.", "The value will be large if the data is widely spread and small if the data is grouped around a point. It\u2019s calculated as the square root of variance.", "0.81 tells us the data is highly centered. It\u2019s more apparent if we visualize it in a histogram and see alcohol levels entirely between 11 and 15.", "Another measure of the spread of data.", "But note it\u2019s slightly more common to report on the standard deviation of the data as it\u2019s more closely related to the mean.", "It\u2019s almost calculated exactly the same as the population standard deviation except that we use n-1 as the denominator instead of N. Khan Academy has a great video on why we do that, here.", "We use this when calculating standard deviation on a sample instead of the population.", "The variance we calculate on a sample instead of the total population. n-1 vs N applies the same here.", "We have some useful functions in statistics, but it's clear that numpy and pandas blow it out of the water. That said, it doesn\u2019t hurt to understand what Python can do out of the box.", "Not everybody calculating statistics is doing data science and for working on an app, mean and standard deviation are probably more than enough.", "That said, Python 3.8 added a few new functions I didn\u2019t cover here so who knows what they\u2019ll add in the future.", "Your home for data science.
