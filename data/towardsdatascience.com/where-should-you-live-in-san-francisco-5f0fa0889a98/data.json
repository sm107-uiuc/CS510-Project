Housing is a big chunk of that, so it\u2019s important to get the most value out of your housing situation whether you\u2019re a renter or homeowner.", "In this project, I explore Zillow data in R to identify high-value San Francisco neighborhoods for 1) prospective renters and 2) investors looking to buy rental property. We\u2019ll explore home prices, monthly rent, and a ratio of the two \u2014 price-to-rent \u2014 to find candidate neighborhoods.", "Thanks to Ken Steif and Keith Hassel for their great tutorial on exploring home prices in San Francisco. They inspired the following plots and graphics. Code for this project can be found here.", "Since my analysis is done with respect to neighborhoods, here\u2019s a visual reference.", "Neighborhood home prices are stagnant between 2007 and 2011 due to the subprime mortgage crisis. In the Shipyard, housing prices even decrease during this time period.", "From 2012 onwards, housing prices take off. This rise in housing grows in the center of San Francisco, then propagates outwards. Housing is consistently most expensive near the Presidio and Twin Peaks areas.", "This is a better view of change over time. Housing prices decrease during the subprime mortgage crisis, then shoot up after 2012 and split into a trimodal distribution.", "The plots above includes all home types \u2014 condos, single-family, multi-family \u2014 and home sizes \u2014 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, 3-bedroom, etc.", "The typical home price was a little under $1 million and typical rent was roughly $4,000 per month from 2010 to 2018. There are also rare neighborhoods where the median home price exceeds $3,000,000 and median rent exceeds $6,000.", "Home price and rent follow a similar distribution.", "Average yearly home price explains 89.5% of the variation in average yearly rent. Still, rent can vary at a fixed home price: at $2.5m, the minimum rent is $5250/mo and maximum is $9506/mo.", "In the scenario above, I fixed home price. Say you fix your rent budget instead. What is the highest home value you could get for that budget? If you\u2019re purchasing rental properties, what\u2019s the highest monthly rent you could get for a fixed purchasing budget? These questions launch us into the next analysis.", "These are average neighborhood price-to-rent ratios from 2010 to 2018, where price-to-rent ratio is", "Price-to-rent is home price divided by a year's estimated rent. You can view it as the estimated years to payoff rental property. Maximizing this ratio would give renters good value; minimizing this ratio (fewer years to payoff) would give landlords good returns.", "If you\u2019re renting an apartment, you want to maximize price-to-rent. These neighborhoods have higher bang for rental buck. Highest 10% neighborhoods are marked in the right panel.", "If you\u2019re investing in rental property, you want to minimize price-to-rent so you get quick returns on investment. Lowest 10% price-to-rent neighborhoods are marked in the left.", "Saint Francis Wood, Sea Cliff, and Presidio Heights are high-value neighborhoods to rent in. Because they\u2019re affluent neighborhoods, home values are likely to be higher in those neighborhoods. If you can find reasonable rent in these areas, you\u2019re probably getting high value from this renting situation.", "As a sanity check, I found nice Craigslist listings in Saint Francis Wood and Presidio for about $1500/br, and the apartments looked nice. That\u2019s super reasonable for the area.", "Bayview has historically high crime rates but has grown $400k in average home price from $500k to $900k based on Trulia data. There are coffee shops and eateries sprouting up in that area that cater to young professionals, making it an increasingly accessible neighborhood with a (relatively) cheap price tag.", "It looks like it takes roughly 16 years to pay off a rental purchase in that area. That\u2019s as good as it gets in the city, so consider starting your investment search there.", "Next, we will look at change over time.", "Looking at change over time, we see that Downtown actually has the lowest current price-to-rent, so we should add that to the list of rental property investment candidates.", "To recap, we\u2019ve identified neighborhoods that provide high values for renters, and high returns to prospective landlords. If you\u2019re looking to rent, start your search with Saint Francis Wood, Sea Cliff, and Presidio Heights. These are affluent and safe neighborhoods and you\u2019ll be surprised to see some affordable rental candidates.", "If you\u2019re looking to buy property and rent it out, you want to earn back your investment as quickly as possible. Bayview, Visitacion Valley, and Downtown offer the best return on investment for rental property estates.", "This post is just one approach to thinking about housing in San Francisco. I plan to extend the housing market analysis by focusing on specific house types, examining general trends about San Francisco\u2019s housing market, and comparing housing markets in different cities.", "And a note for those interested in making these graphs in R: learning how to map the neighborhoods was the trickiest part of this project. I recommend studying Ken Steif and Keith Hassel\u2019s tutorial (linked above) carefully. And learning how geom_polygon() works is super helpful.", "Thanks for reading!
