The Norwegian national strategy was released on the 14th of January, the very day this article was written. I will attempt my best to give an overview of the pathway leading to the strategy, suggestions made, summary and review of the Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation\u2019s published document the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence.", "If you want to read a summary of other AI strategies in Europe you could read another of my articles linked underneath, or you could go back to it after reading the Norwegian summary.", "There were different reports preceding the national strategy for artificial intelligence. These were outlined by the government on their pathway to the strategy:", "Thus prior to the launch of the strategy, there was a growing engagement for artificial intelligence in Norway from different sectors as well as from government agencies.", "Over 2019 the Minister of Digitalisation travelled around in Norway (March-September) to get suggestions from different communities. Additionally, there were close to 50 written statements from a variety of businesses and government agencies that sought to give comments to what the strategy should contain.", "The National AI Strategy in Norway was launched the 14th of January 2020.", "The government was so kind as to issue their key points from the strategy in Norwegian that I have translated to English:", "That is what the state says.", "However, let\u2019s look more closely at the report.", "The strategy is aimed at both public and private sector.", "This is important to note as it differs from some other strategies such as the British AI Sector deal as an example.", "The strategy uses the definition of AI by the European Commissions High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence:", "\u201cArtificial intelligence systems perform actions, physically or digitally, based on interpreting and processing structured or unstructured data, to achieve a given goal. Such systems can also adapt their behaviour by analysing and taking into account how their environment is affected by their previous actions.\u201d", "In addition to this they use the \u2018strong\u2019 or \u2018narrow\u2019 as is present in the Elements of AI training course online.", "They start the strategy by presenting the different understanding of concepts within artificial intelligence, and this seems like a good approach to bring in someone who has no prior knowledge regarding the subject.", "Another early indicator of goodwill and trust is the reuse of data. Sharing is a theme that runs clear through the strategy:", "\u201cNo statutory obligation currently requires public sector data to be made accessible for use by others, but the goal is for data that can be made openly accessible to be shared so that it can be used by others (what we refer to as \u2018reuse\u2019).\u201d", "There is an outlined Nordic collaboration:", "\u201cThe Nordic countries share many interests and values with respect to artificial intelligence. The Nordic countries therefore cooperate through the Nordic Council of Ministers in several areas related to AI. One of these areas concerns data. A working group has been formed to identify datasets that can be exchanged between Nordic countries and create added value for Nordic enterprises \u2014 public and private alike \u2014 while still respecting the ethical aspects and the trust and values particular to the Nordic countries.\u201d", "It may be useful to mention in this context that there is an existing collaboration in the Nordic-Baltic area that has been declared by the Nordic Council of Ministers:", "It is important that the data behind research results are accessible for as many as possible both government and businesses. Better access to research data can improve innovation and value creation through researchers can look at new use cases. More research datasets should be made available. There are three principles in this connection:", "There is 1,4 billion Norwegian kroner (NOK) that go to research, innovation and advanced use of ICT in the Research Council of Norway. Funding for artificial intelligence, robotics and information handling has increased drastically in the last few years.", "There is a mention of several centres of excellence and the national collaboration Norwegian AI Research Consortium (NORA).", "Norway increasingly funds for industry relevant PhD positions. Positions within artificial intelligence had the highest growth within ICT overall.", "Norwegian Open AI Lab established by Telenor is a private research initiative that is mentioned in particular (50 million NOK in gift to establish).", "The programme for a digital Europe (DEP) has \u20ac9,2 billion and Norway is part of this initiative.", "In the report, it is explicitly said that artificial intelligence in a cross-disciplinary university environment is necessary with a mention of Bergen and Oslo as early adapters in this process.", "The government outlines the possibility to take an active role in facilitating collaboration (a very Norwegian approach) or imposing the need to share if need be if it is in the public interest:", "In this context, they mention the German IDS framework (International Data Space) that some Norwegian entities are part of.", "In Norway there is a sharing of data in the oil industry and within geodata, both closely linked to Norway\u2019s main income from the extractives industry.", "Sharing of data is a big focus for the strategy and it mentions different methods to do so. They mention five different ways:", "When you read the report there are several examples along the way of different projects that are being undertaken or information from other government documents. One striking example is the electric autonomous ships that are being piloted in Norway (shipping being an important aspect of Norwegian industry).", "There is a section in the report dedicated to infrastructure and specific mention of the transition to 5G networks and in connection to that expansion of 5G infrastructure. It mentioned that this will help enable:", "The international collaboration EuroHPC is mentioned (HPC \u2014 High Performance Computing). It is clearly outlined that the continued Norwegian collaboration in EuroHPC will depend on continued support of Horizon and DEP.", "The Norwegian government wants Norway to become an attractive destination for data centres.", "There has been an increased establishment of data centres in Norway over the last year according to the strategy. This is attractive also because it can provide \u2018scalable sustainable energy\u2019.", "One great initiative that has been rolled out elsewhere in the Nordics is the course Elements of AI, and this has been taken by more than 1% of the Finnish population. Sweden started competing on the amount of people that could take the course and now Norway is following after (finally).", "There are current mechanisms in the government such as Innovation Norway and Siva. There will be an increased focus on artificial intelligence. There are several Digital Innovation Hubs connected to the EU commission launched in 2016, and this commitment to greater hubs and connectivity is likely to increase in a broader EU strategy for 2021\u20132027 according to the Norwegian strategy. There is a committee that is working on addressing the questions in regards to standardisation and requirements in Norway (as well as influencing or participating in the work on international standards).", "It is outlined by the government that AI can contribute to:", "The government wants different agencies and units to start experimenting with artificial intelligence (particularly proof of concepts).", "The Norwegian government buys services for approximately 500 billion NOK yearly, and it must be possible for some of these to be innovative. There is an initiative in the Norwegian state to increase the collaboration between the Norwegian state and startups.", "The last section of the reports is ethics (a bit worrying that it comes as an afterthought).", "Consumer rights, GDPR and international collaboration on ethics is mentioned (UN, EU and OECD etc.), although only briefly.", "What is very important in the light of this being a public report from the government is its focus on requiring the sharing data if it is in the interest of the public. In addition, the citizen is afforded more considerations and protections than in most other reports. This is certainly a strong point for the report and must be commended strongly. Alongside this the collaboration between public and private sector shines through, with initiatives that are outlined in several places dotted along in the strategy through examples.", "The focus on including indigenous Sami language as well as different variations of Norwegian in the development of AI is a good consideration too. Overall this seems like a well thought out strategy with few \u2018crazy numbers\u2019 incessantly focused on the amazing benefits AI will bring to everything, rather instead it is very much a practical approach to understanding how the government can work to facilitate. It is fair to congratulate Norway on such a strategy.", "The strategy opens with climate change yet says nothing about how this issue will be addressed throughout most of the strategy. The opening statement by the minister of digitalisation sounds like the following:", "It is difficult to predict the future, but we know that Norway will be affected by the age wave, climate change and increasing globalisation, and that in the coming years we must work smarter and more efficiently to remain competitive and maintain the same level of welfare. Digitalisation and new technologies are the key to achieving this, and artificial intelligence will be a vital component.", "Thus it is mentioned in the very first sentence, and it should be expected that it follows up in the national strategy.", "The blatant lack of clear responsibility for climate crisis or sustainability in supply chain within the national strategy for artificial intelligence is worrying, ahistorical, backwards and nonsensical. Indeed perhaps even ignorant of our time, this is not a new approach from the Norwegian government as they often say one thing broadly and do something entirely else in practice in regards to the climate crisis.", "That being said it is not an uncommon thread in other strategies that the perhaps most important success factor (if we consider society and environment) is completely ignored in most national strategies. How does it address the current climate crisis? An important exception in this regard is the French strategy.", "I mentioned previously that there were comments in this strategy process.", "The government should have taken a cue from the comment that Circular Economy submitted to the government the 2nd of August 2019. The society for engineers and technologists in Norway (NITO) made a similar comment in regards to climate and the environment. There has to be a consideration of the life cycle of services and this includes electronic products. This comment was on all accounts completely ignored, and it would have strengthened the strategy greatly if it was included.", "That being said and all critique aside:", "Congratulations to Norway on a National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence!", "I am incredibly excited to see how this will be followed up in the coming time.", "It will without a doubt be very exciting and bring many communities together.", "It feels unfair in a review to give such a harsh criticism to such a great strategy, however, it is important that we put focus on the right area: restoring our planet together doing everything we can in every industry we work.", "This is #500daysofAI and you are reading article 224. I am writing one new article about or related to artificial intelligence every day for 500 days. My current focus for 100 days 200\u2013300 is national and international strategies for artificial intelligence.", "PS: you may notice the day on the article says 15th of January, but that is because I sat up writing this article on the day of the launch into the evening.", "Your home for data science.
