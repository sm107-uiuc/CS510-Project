In this article, we will discuss some of the key concepts widely used in machine learning.", "Probability and statistics are related areas of mathematics which concern themselves with analyzing the relative frequency of events.", "Probability deals with predicting the likelihood of future events, while statistics involves the analysis of the frequency of past events.", "Most people have an intuitive understanding of degrees of probability, which is why we use words like \u201cprobably\u201d and \u201cunlikely\u201d in our daily conversation, but we will talk about how to make quantitative claims about those degrees [1].", "In probability theory, an event is a set of outcomes of an experiment to which a probability is assigned. If E represents an event, then P(E) represents the probability that Ewill occur. A situation where E might happen (success) or might not happen (failure) is called a trial.", "This event can be anything like tossing a coin, rolling a die or pulling a colored ball out of a bag. In these examples the outcome of the event is random, so the variable that represents the outcome of these events is called a random variable.", "Let us consider a basic example of tossing a coin. If the coin is fair, then it is just as likely to come up heads as it is to come up tails. In other words, if we were to repeatedly toss the coin many times, we would expect about about half of the tosses to be heads and and half to be tails. In this case, we say that the probability of getting a head is 1/2 or 0.5 .", "The empirical probability of an event is given by number of times the event occurs divided by the total number of incidents observed. If forntrials and we observe ssuccesses, the probability of success is s/n. In the above example. any sequence of coin tosses may have more or less than exactly 50% heads.", "Theoretical probability on the other hand is given by the number of ways the particular event can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So a head can occur once and possible outcomes are two (head, tail). The true (theoretical) probability of a head is 1/2.", "Probability of events A and B denoted byP(A and B) or P(A \u2229 B)is the probability that events A and B both occur. P(A \u2229 B) = P(A). P(B) . This only applies if Aand Bare independent, which means that if Aoccurred, that doesn\u2019t change the probability of B, and vice versa.", "Let us consider A and B are not independent, because if A occurred, the probability of B is higher. When A and B are not independent, it is often useful to compute the conditional probability, P (A|B), which is the probability of A given that B occurred: P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B)/ P(B).", "The probability of an event A conditioned on an event B is denoted and defined P(A|B) = P(A\u2229B)/P(B)", "Similarly, P(B|A) = P(A \u2229 B)/ P(A) . We can write the joint probability of as A and B as P(A \u2229 B)= p(A).P(B|A), which means : \u201cThe chance of both things happening is the chance that the first one happens, and then the second one given the first happened.\u201d", "Bayes\u2019s theorem is a relationship between the conditional probabilities of two events. For example, if we want to find the probability of selling ice cream on a hot and sunny day, Bayes\u2019 theorem gives us the tools to use prior knowledge about the likelihood of selling ice cream on any other type of day (rainy, windy, snowy etc.).", "where Hand E are events, P(H|E) is the conditional probability that event H occurs given that event E has already occurred. The probability P(H) in the equation is basically frequency analysis; given our prior data what is the probability of the event occurring. The P(E|H) in the equation is called the likelihood and is essentially the probability that the evidence is correct, given the information from the frequency analysis. P(E) is the probability that the actual evidence is true.", "Let H represent the event that we sell ice cream and Ebe the event of the weather. Then we might ask what is the probability of selling ice cream on any given day given the type of weather? Mathematically this is written as P(H=ice cream sale | E= type of weather) which is equivalent to the left hand side of the equation. P(H) on the right hand side is the expression that is known as the prior because we might already know the marginal probability of the sale of ice cream. In our example this is P(H = ice cream sale), i.e. the probability of selling ice cream regardless of the type of weather outside. For example, I could look at data that said 30 people out of a potential 100 actually bought ice cream at some shop somewhere. So my P(H = ice cream sale) = 30/100 = 0.3, prior to me knowing anything about the weather. This is how Bayes\u2019 Theorem allows us to incorporate prior information [2].", "A classic use of Bayes\u2019s theorem is in the interpretation of clinical tests. Suppose that during a routine medical examination, your doctor informs you that you have tested positive for a rare disease. You are also aware that there is some uncertainty in the results of these tests. Assuming we have a Sensitivity (also called the true positive rate) result for 95% of the patients with the disease, and a Specificity (also called the true negative rate) result for 95% of the healthy patients.", "If we let \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2212\u201d denote a positive and negative test result, respectively, then the test accuracies are the conditional probabilities : P(+|disease) = 0.95, P(-|healthy) = 0.95,", "In Bayesian terms, we want to compute the probability of disease given a positive test, P(disease|+).", "How to evaluate P(+), all positive cases ? We have to consider two possibilities, P(+|disease) and P(+|healthy). The probability of a false positive, P(+|healthy), is the complement of the P(-|healthy). Thus P(+|healthy) = 0.05.", "Importantly, Bayes\u2019 theorem reveals that in order to compute the conditional probability that you have the disease given the test was positive, you need to know the \u201cprior\u201d probability you have the diseaseP(disease), given no information at all. That is, you need to know the overall incidence of the disease in the population to which you belong. Assuming these tests are applied to a population where the actual disease is found to be 0.5%, P(disease)= 0.005 which means P(healthy) = 0.995.", "In other words, despite the apparent reliability of the test, the probability that you actually have the disease is still less than 9%. Getting a positive result increases the probability you have the disease. But it is incorrect to interpret the 95 % test accuracy as the probability you have the disease.", "Descriptive statistics refers to methods for summarizing and organizing the information in a data set. We will use below table to describe some of the statistical concepts [4].", "Elements: The entities for which information is collected are called the elements. In the above table, the elements are the 10 applicants. Elements are also called cases or subjects.", "Variables: The characteristic of an element is called a variable. It can take different values for different elements.e.g., marital status, mortgage, income, rank, year, and risk. Variables are also called attributes.", "Variables can be either qualitative or quantitative.", "Qualitative: A qualitative variable enables the elements to be classified or categorized according to some characteristic. The qualitative variables are marital status, mortgage, rank, and risk. Qualitative variables are also called categorical variables.", "Quantitative: A quantitative variable takes numeric values and allows arithmetic to be meaningfully performed on it. The quantitative variables are income and year. Quantitative variables are also called numerical variables.", "Discrete Variable: A numerical variable that can take either a finite or a countable number of values is a discrete variable, for which each value can be graphed as a separate point, with space between each point. \u2018year\u2019 is an example of a discrete variable..", "Continuous Variable: A numerical variable that can take infinitely many values is a continuous variable, whose possible values form an interval on the number line, with no space between the points. \u2018income\u2019 is an example of a continuous variable.", "Population: A population is the set of all elements of interest for a particular problem. A parameter is a characteristic of a population.", "Sample: A sample consists of a subset of the population. A characteristic of a sample is called a statistic.", "Random sample: When we take a sample for which each element has an equal chance of being selected.", "Indicate where on the number line the central part of the data is located.", "The mean is the arithmetic average of a data set. To calculate the mean, add up the values and divide by the number of values.The sample mean is the arithmetic average of a sample, and is denoted x\u0304 (\u201cx-bar\u201d).

If there is an even number, the median is the mean of the two middle data values. When the income data are sorted into ascending order, the two middle values are $32,100 and $32,200, the mean of which is the median income, $32,150.", "The mode is the data value that occurs with the greatest frequency. Both quantitative and categorical variables can have modes, but only quantitative variables can have means or medians. Each income value occurs only once, so there is no mode. The mode for year is 2010, with a frequency of 4.", "The mid-range is the average of the maximum and minimum values in a data set. The mid-range income is:", "Quantify the amount of variation, spread or dispersion present in the data.", "The range of a variable equals the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

This difference occurs because the sample mean is used as an approximation of the true population mean.", "The standard deviation or sd of a bunch of numbers tells you how much the individual numbers tend to differ from the mean.", "The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance: sd = \u221a s\u00b2.
