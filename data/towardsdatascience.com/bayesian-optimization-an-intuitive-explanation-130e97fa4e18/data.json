Why? Linear regression, minimizing the error sum of squares. Logistic Regression, minimizing the negative likelihood. Support Vector Machines, minimizing the negative distance between the two support vectors.", "Instead of an explanation heavy with math definitions and equations, let us understand about Optimization in simpler terms. \u201cIt\u2019s the last day of the month and you are left with only $30. You are craving to have some delicious food. You wanted to have at least one variety among a pizza ($5 per piece), a burger ($3 per piece) and a coke ($1 per piece). You can\u2019t have more than 4 pizzas and should order at least two burgers\u201d. There you go! A real-life optimization problem: Maximizing or minimizing an objective function subject to some constraints\u201d", "Is the above problem a Linear or a Non-Linear Optimization? Linear Optimization involves objective function made up of only linear terms (or first-degree terms) and if it has any second-degree terms or nonlinear equations, then it\u2019s a nonlinear optimization.", "We shall only worry about the non-linear optimization paradigm in this article \u2014 these problems are much more complex to solve than their linear counterpart..", "Let\u2019s play a game! There is a function f(x), which I won\u2019t reveal. This function takes real numbers. The task is this: You have to approximate the minimum (lowest) value of the function in the interval [-150, 350]. I will tell you the value of the function at any value x that you ask. But here\u2019s the catch, you have only limited asks and to be exact, only 5. Well in between -150 and 350 there are infinite real numbers, so choose carefully.", "Let\u2019s say your first ask is the nice-and-easy 0.", "Now anyone rational would choose one positive and one negative number, so let me do that on your behalf. I will share f(x) at x = 150 and x=-50", "That\u2019s an interesting set of points, isn\u2019t it? Are you thinking what I am thinking? Choosing next point around -50 to check if our function might have its minimum value around there? In optimization terms it is called Exploitation. Its like,when you know that the function value at a point is close to our desired value when compared to other values, you will keep on exploiting that region. I do not want to waste my last two chances by exploiting. May be in between 0 and 100, I might have our desired value, the region which we haven\u2019t even explored yet. In optimization terminology this is called as Exploration, you already know what your function outputs for few values, so instead of exploiting around the known values, we will explore new regions to find our desired value. A good optimization algorithm should strike a balance between exploration and exploitation.", "Having discussed the above, let\u2019s use our last two guesses: One to exploit and one to explore. Let us take x as -100 and 100.", "Exploitation paid off and we now have a minimum value (with respect to the 5 guesses we made) at x=-100 but we still do not know if it is the true minimum.", "This phenomenon of intelligently choosing the next point in the iteration to find the desired value is what Bayesian Optimization does elegantly.", "Without much math, I will try to explain how it evaluates using graphs. And for the last time, I promise there is no math.", "How does a n\u00e4ive optimization algorithm calculate where the function has its minimum value? It has to iterate through all the values in a given range and evaluate the function value for each \u2014 just a grid search. This is extremely tedious and hugely inaccurate especially if it\u2019s a multivariate function or one with many local minima.", "Now we shall see how Bayesian Optimization tackles just the way humans think but in a statistical sense.", "So, when I gave the first input as x=0, we got the corresponding f(x) value. The Bayesian Optimization uses Gaussian Process to model different functions that pass through the point. And what is a Gaussian process? It is out of scope of this article (may be next one). But for now, think that you have a point in the space and I am asking you to draw various lines passing through the point.", "Well if you could closely observe, there is a light blue shade and it\u2019s very light that you might not see but still try to think why is that not present at the values we know the output for? That\u2019s my confidence in the graph that I have plotted, i.e, I am not that confident that the actual function\u2019s graph will look like this, but if you see at exactly at the known value I do not have any variance, it\u2019s because I know the exact value of f(x) at that point.", "Now let us use our imaginations and approximate graphs when we get new values.", "Earlier I told you that I had used my imagination to plot the above weird lines passing through the points we guessed, right?\u201d Well I was sort of using Gaussian Process to model the curves. In this way, Bayesian Optimization approximates the function graph after every new value. The intelligent way of choosing what point to pick next based on previous values is through something called as acquisition function which strikes a nice balance between exploration and exploitation. This is just an intuitive intro to why you should chose Bayesian optimization and I hope you got some idea about how it works. In order to understand it in depth, we need math, like lots of math which I will try to cover in the subsequent articles.", "Finally, I am giving away the graph that we are trying to find the minimum for,", "Reach out to me on LinkedIn for any clarifications/feedback or if you want to collaborate on data science projects", "And before diving into Bayesian, I would recommend you to get well versed with traditional optimization methods such as Newton Raphson and you can find my articles here, Newton Raphson Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3", "Your home for data science.
