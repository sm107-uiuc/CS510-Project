So what do you do when you have limited data? You go for data augmentation. Data Augmentation techniques enhance training datasets' size and quality such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. In this article, we shall look at some of the standard image augmentation techniques and some popular libraries that help achieve these augmentations.", "Augmentations can be broadly classified as, i.e., Offline and Online Augmentations based on when they are performed in the pipeline.", "Before jumping into the augmentation libraries, let\u2019s first have a look at some of the image augmentations technique:", "Unlike humans, computers perceive images as data points. An image is nothing but a standard Numpy array containing pixels of data points. More the number of pixels in an image, the better is its resolution.", "Keeping this very fact in mind, let\u2019s explore the dataset we shall be working in this article. The dataset belongs to the Plant Pathology 2020 \u2014 FGVC7 hosted by Kaggle in March 2020 and consists of manually captured 3,651 high-quality, real-life symptom images of multiple apple foliar diseases.", "Given a photo of an apple leaf, can you accurately assess its health? This competition will challenge you to distinguish between leaves which are healthy, those which are infected with apple rust, those that have apple scab, and those with more than one disease.", "We\u2019ll only use the images from the training dataset for this article.", "After having uploaded the dataset, let\u2019s look at some of the images in the training set", "You can think of pixels to be tiny blocks of information arranged in the form of a 2 D grid, and the depth of a pixel refers to the color information present in it. Let\u2019s look at an arbitrary image in the dataset.", "Colored images are represented as a combination of Red, Blue, and Green, and all the other colors can be achieved by mixing these primary colors in the correct proportions.", "A grayscale image consists of 8 bits per pixel. This means it can have 256 different shades where 0 pixels will represent black color while 255 denotes white. For example, the image below shows a grayscale image represented in the form of an array. A grayscale image has only 1 channel where the channel represents a dimension.", "There are a lot of image augmentations packages. However, in this series, we shall cover some of the popular ones like:", "We shall use the above five libraries to demonstrate the basic augmentation techniques with code examples. Each library is pretty vast and deserves an article of its own. Hence, I\u2019ll dedicate an article to each of the libraries starting with the well-known scikit-image library.", "Scikit-Image or skimage is an open-source Python package that works with numpy arrays. It is a collection of algorithms for image processing. The code is maintained by a team of collaborators and is completely community-driven while maintaining the quality of the code and promoting research-based education.", "scikit-image can be installed as follows:", "Let\u2019s load the requisite modules that we shall use for the various image manipulation operations. The skimage library consists of various modules containing functions like rotate, rescale, resize, etc, which are used for the manipulation of images.", "Flipping can be both horizontally as well as vertically. The function used to flip an image,, or technically an array is numpy.flip(). There are two variations of this function. While the fliplr() function is used to flip any array in the left or right direction, the flipud() function flips an array in the up/down direction. This implies fliplr() flips the order of columns of pixels in the matrix while flipu() reverses the order of rows of pixels in the matrix.", "Similarly, we can rotate the image in the clockwise direction or an anti-clockwise direction. The rotation is made possible by transform.rotate(); a function that rotates an image by a certain angle around its center. The user can specify any rotation angle of choice.", "For cropping an image, you can define a utility function - randRange(); to generate random float values in the desired range. You can then pass these generated range values into another function called randomCrop(), which takes the image as input and crops it in the center from a desired margin from the borders", "P.S: The code below has been adapted from this Kaggle kernel.", "The exposure module is used for brightness manipulation. The function adjust_gammaperforms Gamma Correction on the input image. The higher the value of gamma, the darker is the resultant image.", "The transform.resize()function transforms a given image to match a specific size. This function can either interpolate to up-size or down-size an image. Make sure to enable anti-aliasing should when down-sizing images to avoid aliasing artifacts. Anti-aliasing is the smoothing of jagged edges in digital images.", "The resize() function also serves the same purpose except that it allows specifying an output image shape instead of a scaling factor.", "The random_noise() is a function from the skimage\u2019s util\u2019s module. It is used to add random noise of various types to an image. Noise is a kind of imperfection that is added to images to introduce some kind of variability.", "Data augmentation has been shown to produce promising ways to increase the accuracy of classification tasks. It is especially important in situations of limited data availability. Python provides a robust library in the form of a scikit-image with many algorithms for image augmentation. It is available free of charge and free of restriction, having an active community behind it. Have a look at the documentation to learn more about the library and its use cases. In the next few articles, we will discuss other commonly used augmentation libraries. Stay tuned!", "Your home for data science.
