In this article, we shall be looking into data visualization and how it can reveal the data\u2019s deepest and darkest secrets. Next, we are going to build our first machine learning model to get an idea of what the hell is it anyway!", "Imagine your favorite bedtime storybook when you were an innocent little monster. You remember it used to have small sentences but really captivating pictures, right? Let\u2019s change that thing for a while and make our favorite colorful bedtime storybook into a white page with lines and lines of the story written in black ink. You be like ~", "In data science, all you have is a thousand rows of data and an overwhelming number of columns to look after. Just imagine the horror if you had to go through every record and understand the significance that it holds in that dataset. But, if you visualize or plot your data into best-suited charts, you get the significance of each data point in a second.", "Data Visualization is so bad-ass it has a different dedicated job profile for itself. So here we are with an understanding of what is visualization without even reading a single boring definition! Haha! \ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\ude09", "Matplotlib is a data visualization library available for python platform. It provides 2D representation in the form of bar charts, histograms, box plot, and several other basic charts.To get started you should know that you\u2019ll never know enough of data visualization, you\u2019ll always keep learning and growing. There are multiple other great libraries like Plotly, Bokeh that gives you enticing representations. But understand the basics in matplotlib and then you can master the other ones gradually.", "I thought visualizing on actual data would make more sense that any dummy data points. For this purpose, I have used the Crime in India dataset from Kaggle. A line chart is a 2D representation that shows the trend of one variable with respect to another variable.", "Hmm...The number of burglary cases goes low very steeply around the year 2003! I wonder what happened then? Maybe the burglars grew rich enough and decided to retire?! Then they spent their fortunes gambling so they had to steal voraciously again in around 2004?", "Matplotlib.pyplot library stores methods that look like Matlab. In matplotlib.pyplot, certain states are preserved about the plot figure(here,plt) and the plotting area. Whatever further methods might be used are assumed to be for this particular plot itself.", "Bar charts are used to display the frequency or measure of the categorical variables.", "In matplotlib.pyplot, we use the bar() method to build a chart. the bar method needs two mandatory parameters, one is the x-axis labels and the other is the height of those labels.", "The above bar chart is great but we can\u2019t figure out how much proportion of the cases recorded comes under which state. For that matter, to get a clear conception of what is the percentage of each state we build a pie chart.", "Here, the pie() method mandatorily needs two arguments, one is the label and the second is the size or angle that will be assigned to that particular label. The autopct attribute is used to give labels to the pie slices.", "Scatterplots are used to check the distribution of variables or how variables are related to each other. Hence we need at least 2 fields to be plotted on x-axis and y-axis. I have used a random number generator that simply assigns to a color.", "Histograms are a great way to see the distribution of a variable. The concept of bins or buckets is very important is a histogram. The bin size defines the extent to which data can fall into that \u201cbin\u201d. Say the bin size is 10, so the representation would be 0\u201310,10\u201320,20\u201330 and so on. Now say the bin size is 50, the representation would be 0\u201350,50\u2013100, etc.", "We can interpret that the majority of the cases were a robbery of fewer than ~2000 items.", "Boxplot is used to plot the distribution of a variable and detect its outliers. All the outliers are pointed out in circles. While the rectangular box states where the maximum concentration of data lies, it also states the min, max and the inter-quartile range along with a line that is actually a median.", "This boxplot conveys the data is heavily skewed along with the presence of multiple outliers. This is exactly what the histogram conveys but in a different representation. Here, we got a clear sense of outliers and their quantity but it wasn\u2019t the same clear picture in a histogram.", "According to me, both boxplot and histogram can be used to consider the distribution of a variable. It depends on you to decide which one to choose!", "For now, knowing these handful charts are enough to go ahead. Trust me you will improvise as you proceed!", "At this turn, we are standing at a point where we have acquired the primitive knowledge about python and how we can make it work for us. But what you gonna do with knowledge alone?! A wise person once said\u2026.", "Knowledge is knowing what an electric switch is. Wisdom is not to put your wet finger inside the socket!", "What I meant by that quote is that after coming so far into learning Python, we now need to APPLY it! Let\u2019s get wise.", "Let\u2019s go back to the 1950s, you are a popular and talented actor\u2019s personal assistant. Now this famous celebrity receives literally thousands of letters, say from his fans, admirers, directors, producers, advertisement agencies, fellow actors, etc. Now that celebrity is busy doing his job, while your job is to bring him all the important and urgent letters at sharp lunchtime. So your entire morning goes in skimming through and reading a stack of letters and filtering the important ones for the Big Fellow. That\u2019s when you sigh and say, \u201dI wish I had a magic wand that could align these letters and I could have my pancakes for breakfast peacefully! Alas!\u201d. That\u2019s when the angel appears and says, \u201cAs you wish poor thing!\u201d.", "Fast forward 60 years, That magic wand is what machine learning is today. Although building a machine learning model isn\u2019t as easy as swirling the magic wand, if done right, the outcome is indeed magical!", "Back to the technicality, Machine Learning is automating the handling of volumes of data, learn from the data and produce something valuable out of it.", "Consider an email spam filtering program that blocks all the emails that contain the word \u2018New Life Insurance\u2019. We develop a machine learning algorithm to find all likely words as \u2018New Life Insurance\u2019 and then throwing them into the spam box. But wait, I can write a simple IF-THEN statement and get my job done. Why the machine learning showoff?", "Machine Learning is making a system or machine think like a human so that humans don\u2019t have to waste time filtering out stupid spams from their inbox.", "In real-life scenarios, the data is never so sorted and precise. There is a scaring degree of variation in each new set of data. We humans have the intelligence to separate the relevant from the irrelevant. We try to replicate such intelligence into machine learning models. The machine learning models evolve themselves and try to learn from each new data pattern they get.", "Your teacher teaches the structure of a flower; what is a Corolla, what is a calyx, a petal, etc. You learn and write a test. The teacher checks the answers and tells you how you performed. She supervises you. Similarly, in supervised learning, we already know what the outcome variables are for the given set of input variables. We have to train the model over the input data so that it produces the desired target. The model keeps learning and adapting until it reaches the near-perfect result.", "2. Unsupervised learning: Learning without a teacher.", "Have you noticed the \u201cYou may also like..\u201d section on Amazon? It is a solid example of Unsupervised learning. The learning here is without a supervisor and it is used to dig out the gold hidden in gold data mines. So when you purchase a whiteboard from Amazon, it runs a model that automatically clusters all the other relevant objects like a marker, a duster and several other objects as a recommendation. These recommendations quickly change if the object of purchase changes too, right? See, the model doesn\u2019t already know if the recommendation will be a dishwasher or an Air conditioner, it simply learns and provides the result.", "Scikit-learn is an opensource library that houses several methods that let us perform machine learning on the given data. It is dependent on SciPy and NumPy libraries so make sure you have all the guns loaded before we start using it. Though sklearn comes installed when you install Anaconda, still if you face any issues, kindly use", "We shall work on the iris dataset to get more hands-on experience with scikit-learn. You will learn all the necessary jargons and what they mean as we go I promise.", "Imagine there is a passionate botanist, she loves collecting the iris flower. So she goes into the wild every morning and as she strolls she collects all possible irises she can. Then when she gets back home she measures the petal\u2019s length and width, also the sepal\u2019s length and width. Based on these four lengths she distinguishes the collected flowers into either of the three species: Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica. This means given an input set of measurements our botanist is certain to which species it might belong to. Let\u2019s assume that only these three classes are available in the wild.", "Our mission is to build a machine learning model that can correctly tell us the species of the flower based on the measurements. Since we already know that the output will be either one of the three classes of irises, this is a supervised learning problem. Additionally, it is a classification problem as you see we are classifying a given flower into pre-defined classes(species). More precisely this is a three-class classification problem. Let\u2019s meet the data:", "You can find the ipynb notebook here.", "2. Import the iris dataset: Find the dataset at UCI repository for Iris or at my Github repository\u2019s dataset folder. As the dataset itself doesn\u2019t provide the column headers, we first put the column labels in a list called columns and then use the read_csv function to load the dataset along with the columns just declared.", "Okay, so we have declared the dataset as measurements for petals and sepals and a target class. But for a layman, what are petals and sepals?", "Sepals are the leaves protecting the flower bud and keeping the petals in place. Petals, as most of us know are the modified leaves that form a flower and surrounds the reproductive part of it. As for the iris flower, these lengths define the kind of species they belong to.", "The shape() method outputs the number of rows and columns in our dataset. Here (x,y) where x is the number of rows and y is the number of columns.", "The describe() function tells us a summary of the numerical variables. Here we can see the count of each column is 150, ie. there are no nulls. Then we have the mean, std, min, max for each column.", "4. Data visualization: Finally we use what we learned earlier!", "4.i. Univariate Analysis to better understand each variable. Here we create a boxplot of all the measurements.", "4. ii. Multi-variate analysis to check the relationship between variables. We use the seaborn package to see this analysis. Seaborn is another superb plotting package which is actually based on matplotlib.", "pairplot() method plots all the given 4 measurements and tries to establish a relationship between them. Each measurement is compared with every other measurement and with itself.", "From the given chart, we can clearly see that the measurement of each flower is concentrated on a specific range of numbers. Hence, we can successfully run a classification algorithm and get the desired iris species.", "Before starting to build a machine learning model on these parameters, we need some confirmation that whatever output we produce as the \u201cclass\u201d of the flower is correct. But logically, we cannot use the same data we had used for training the model for testing the model too. We need unseen fresh data that actually has it\u2019s predicted output class variable. We are going to run our model over this fresh data and get the result class. If the result class and the stored output class are same, Voila!.", "For this purpose, it is a general rule in machine learning to train any model on 75% of your data calling it the training data or training set. The rest 25% of the data is the test data, test set or hold-out set.", "Python provides an in-built function to handle the splitting, the input takes the two important parameters, that is the input X columns and the output y variable. The default test_size is 0.25 that is 25% of whole data is testing data, we used random_state = 0 that enabled us to jumble the data and then randomly choose the splits. Suppose if we take the last 25% of our data as test data, we would have only iris-virginica outputs. That would be highly misleading for training, hence the random splitting.", "P.s: It's just a convention to use a capital X for input variables and a lowercase y for outcome variable.", "Now we move to the final and most interesting step that is to build a machine learning model to learn these values.", "For this dataset, we would be using KNN classification model.", "KNN Algorithm: KNN stands for K-nearest neighbors. Have you ever heard of the belief that you are an average of the five people you spend most of your time with! Apply this analogy to understand KNN algorithm. KNN considers the neighbors of a given data point and according to what class these neighbors belong to, the given datapoint\u2019s class is decided. The \u2018K\u2019 in this algorithm is the number of neighbors that we are considering for our analysis, say k=3 tells to use 3 neighbors.", "But training the model isn\u2019t enough, we need to test it!", "Using the testing vector, X_test we deploy the trained knn model on it. The score() method calculates the mean accuracy of the given test data. It takes the testing data points and their testing data labels and outputs the accuracy. For our model, we got an accuracy of a whopping 97% .Pat your back fellas! You deployed your first machine learning model.", "First of all congratulations on your first ever machine learning model! A couple of months ago I patted my back for the same reason\ud83d\ude04. With this piece, I conclude the Python for Data Science Series. This much python is enough for you to sail the rough sea on your own.", "I would like to thank the diligent reader and my motive behind these publications is to grow by sharing whatever feeble knowledge I have.", "I believe even if one single person is able to learn a single topic from my publications, I\u2019ve given something back to the community.
