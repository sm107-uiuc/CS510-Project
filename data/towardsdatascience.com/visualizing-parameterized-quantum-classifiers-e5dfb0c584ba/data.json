Here is a more detailed article.", "All the figures have been created with the library QuTip.", "Here is an example of quantum states represented in the Bloch sphere.

We have this label observed for a set of states called the training set, and we wish to construct a function which predicts the label of a new quantum state. We wish to construct a parameterized unitary operator U(\u237a) such as", "The probabilities are estimated by measuring the quantum state. One can then compute a cost function, and update the parameters \u237a with a classical optimizer.", "We will not talk about that in this post, the objective is to visualize the effect of a parameterized classifier on the Bloch sphere.", "Fortunately, in the one qubit case, the unitary operators are quite simple, and can be fully characterized by 3 parameters. The general form is given by the following formula.", "It means that we only have to look at this family of matrices to find our candidate classifier. Moreover, we can prove that the parameter \u03d5 has no influence on the final probability. It reduces us to the final following form.", "The border is defined by the set of points for which P(y=0) = P(y=1) = 1/2.
