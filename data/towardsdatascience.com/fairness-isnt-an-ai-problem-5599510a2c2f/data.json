Unfortunately, the trolley cannot be stopped. The only thing possible is to flip the switch and move the trolley on a side track where a single innocent bystander stands. Kill one to save the many, or come what may and let the many be killed.", "This is the classic example of the trolley problem which is regularly referenced in the case of machine learning in self-driving cars:", "How should self-driving cars deal with this situation: drive over five people, or instead swerve and kill the innocent bystander?", "A huge problem for AI, right? Or is it?", "Major consulting names are nowadays selling frameworks on \u2018trusted AI,\u2019 \u2018transparent AI,\u2019 and \u2018fair AI.\u2019 Companies around the globe are started to help companies in becoming more \u2018fair.\u2019", "It seems then that the technical difficulties around analytics and machine learning have been overcome and consultants are sent to the meta-realm.", "Governance and process are important, don\u2019t get me wrong. However, in the same breath transparency, explainability and fairness are often mentioned. When such projects take off in the companies, the terms are often conflated. People assume that fairness is transparency/explainability. And, implicitly, they assume that fairness is an AI problem.", "Transparency and explainability are technical terms. Fairness is a normative claim.", "This difference is more pronounced than people typically give it credit.", "What is fair? Your notion of fairness will typically vary strongly with your political views: equal opportunities or equal outcomes? Proper competition or quota for leadership positions? Higher incarceration rates for over-represented groups in crime statistics or mitigating measures to reduce their overrepresentation?", "However, we don\u2019t even have query peoples attitudes. Nor go down the rabbit hole of political inclinations.", "We can simply ask what people think is the right thing to do in case of the trolley problem to understand the wide divide on \u2018fairness\u2019 orientation. As it turns out, these attitudes vary wildly across the globe.", "The researchers suggest that: \u201cCountries with more individualistic cultures are more likely to spare more lives.", "In fact, scientists have done so: visit https://www.technologyreview.com/, for some amazing differences between countries on their respective stances. The results are quite interesting.", "Note already that explaining what happens in the model does not necessarily relate to what is considered the right thing.", "Consider for a moment the example of pricing insurance products and a person being part of a clear minority. Due to unfortunate (?) circumstances, they are part of a group that is a clear minority. This can be a physical minority, or simply a minority w.r.t. a certain product (women tend to buy less motorcycle insurance, for instance).", "In the machine learning\u2019s dataset, this would mean a smaller amount of data points on this group. In turn, this will lead to higher variance or \u2018fuzziness\u2019 in this groups behaviour (a single outlier might skew the group dramatically up).", "Now, imagine you are tasked with pricing these customers. We are asked to make smart and accurate predictions on the pricing of our customers. For the customers that we have lots of data on, this is an easy task. We can be quite sure that we have the \u2018correct\u2019 price.", "However, due to to the nature of the task you\u2019ll have more uncertainty on the minority group. Smart pricing means that you\u2019d have to take the variance into account and price the customer higher. Is this fair? (Perhaps, is it fair to the company if you don\u2019t?)", "Accounting for these types of unfairnesses is rather simple; omit the variable that identifies them as being part of a small subsection of the customer pool. By this logic omitting variables and people might never end, leading ultimately to an unsustainable insurance company.", "But where does that stop? When does it become fair? What threshold should you adhere to? What level of variance is acceptable?", "These questions should neither be an afterthought nor an AI.", "Understanding how something works doesn\u2019t tell us what is right or wrong.", "In our case of pricing unbalanced datasets, higher price where higher variance occurs might be technically right, yet could be considered unfair.", "Another complication: ideas of fairness differ from country to country and person to person.", "What can be explained or understood about Machine Learning doesn\u2019t resolve our fundamental normative questions about what is fair. Should AI be answering these questions, should Data Scientists?", "I don\u2019t think Data Scientists should be responsible for making fairness claims on behalf of big companies, it\u2019s a joint effort and should be approach as such.", "Possibly we are treating AI unfairly by burdening it with the \u2018fairness\u2019 proof? We haven\u2019t even discussed the fundamental question of whether or not a machine learning model can be fair or unfair.", "Fairness in AI \u2014 or in machine learning \u2014 is an important topic. One that\u2019s often left post hoc, we create our models and discuss the implications after.", "Echoing a personal hero of mine, Kate Crawford:", "\u201cWhen we are thinking of fairness as a purely a technical issue we are already missing part of the picture.\u201d", "Fairness is everywhere, in how we view the world, in the training data, gathering data, in our decision of what to model, in our upbringing, and our current moral outlook. Our moral outlook can change over time, from person to person or from country to country.", "There is no doubt that the field needs to get better at explaining and interpreting ML model results. Looking under the hood holds valuable clues about possible ways the models can err. (There are definitely model-biases that need to be rooted out, here we interested in the inherent fairness of models).", "However, the question of fairness cannot be reduced to these technical explorations. Our models are simply a complicated interpretation and reflection of observed patterns. (Or the model is optimized with respect to a certain, perhaps unintended, goal. At any rate in some way it reflects our intentions, behaviours, or goals). It means that any fairness pre-exists and is simply inherited by said model.", "And, if you agree with me up to this point, then it must be reasonable to say that these biases are inherent in the data the models take in. That the data reflects our social fairness and that it would take intentional effort on behalf of the modeller to overcome a certain mismatch between what is and what we want it to be. At which point we\u2019ve arrived at the beginning: fairness is in the eyes of the beholder and it\u2019s a social issue. Therefore, putting the burden of proof on the data scientists seems unreasonable.", "Solving fairness as an afterthought to ML doesn\u2019t address the root causes nor does it help us understand the complexities.", "Ultimately, fairness isn\u2019t a machine learning problem, it\u2019s a social issue first.", "Your home for data science.
