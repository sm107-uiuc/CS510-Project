So when I state Data Scientist then you know I am talking about you, not 2 years later version of you.", "It is very common for data scientists to use a majority of their time exploring and cleaning data in a very casual style and not following a definite guideline, though it helps to invest time to keep your code in DRY(Do not Repeat Yourself) guideline and following a process to keep a big picture in mind, that\u2019s where CRISP-DM appears.", "CRISP-DM process can make your project streamlined, easy to understand, and ready for deployment.", "To make the CRISP-DM process easy to understand, I am using insights from data analysis done on StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017 dataset.", "CRISP-DM stages are very flexible, it is not super essential to follow them in the same order as presented. For example, your data understanding might shift after modeling the data. Any new business understanding can improve the way you have prepared your data, therefore you might need to adopt various strategies to handle missing data or any other data issues you faced earlier.", "These stages are self-explanatory, but I would like to demonstrate their value in StackOverflow analysis.", "In general, we need results for a few questions as part of business problem-solving. I will be covering below 3 questions from StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017 dataset to explain this process better.", "These questions pose a problem-statement to data scientists where they need to make use of data to bring insights on the table so that business users can make decisions.", "This stage challenges me the most. For me, the right choice is going through the whole dataset once holistically and outline a pathway for me to maximize the potential of data to solve posted problems.", "You might choose to do that or start learning the data with a few basic steps:", "\u2026. and more questions like those.", "Data Scientists generally spent 80% of their time to prepare data. I have performed the below steps to do the data preparation.", "There was a lot more I could have done to transform the data, but we have to start somewhere, and then we can always iterate. Try to follow DRY principle.", "Finally, we train a model using a Machine learning library like scikit-learn to pick an appropriate algorithm and built a model that can make a prediction using a validation set, within your desired accuracy.", "Once we reach an acceptable prediction accuracy, we can finalize that model for the deployment. Currently, I am not using predictive analytics in this dataset for demo.", "Communication is such an important part of the role of a data scientist. You generally share the outcome of your analysis at this point using some visualizations or statistics. Sometimes, you might change your modeling algorithm or data preparation techniques, based on the outcome. Let\u2019s jump to the results of the EDA I did on StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017.", "How did other developers suggest breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?", "Close to 30% developers recommend taking online courses is a way to become a developer and only 12.7% developers consider bootcamps is a way to enter the IT field.", "What factors about an individual contributed to salary?", "21% of Developers who are already employed recommend taking online courses is the best solution to become a developer and only 7.6% of those developers consider bootcamps to enter the IT field.", "What was the state of bootcamps for assisting individuals with breaking into developer roles?", "Generally, we assume that bootcamps are for those who are unemployed and looking for a path towards developer jobs. These statistics show, that 46% of Bootcamp graduates were already employed in a developer role. And 36.5% combined got a developer job within starting to 3 months after graduation time-frame.", "Deploying can occur by moving your approach into production or by using your results to persuade others within a company to act on the results.", "Once you reach this stage, you probably assumed that \u201cmy job is already done and all I need to do now is to put this code in production and get it over with\u201d. Though, it is not that straight forward, but not that complex too.", "If you have analyzed for yourself then indeed your job is completed but if you are a data scientist who is working for a company/team, you need to follow few more steps for deploying the code in production. For example following steps like these:", "Once your code is ready to deploy, always check if the destination python environment has your Data Science libraries installed or not. If not, you need to create a virtual environment and get all your necessary libraries installed before you deploy the code.", "If you want your code to run on a schedule, then you might need a scheduler like Airflow, Autosys, Cron or Windows-based scheduler.", "In this article, we looked at how CRISP-DM helps to maintain a bigger picture while doing data analysis or training a machine learning model. Insights from StackOverflow Developer Survey 2017 support to get the idea of the CRISP-DM process.", "This article is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project.
