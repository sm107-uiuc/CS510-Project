My first term as a masters data science student was over, and with sweet relief I went on a brief (but respectable) Netflix bender before switching into diving into technical interview prep. I was feeling confident. Cocky, even. Like Han Solo who had just saved the galaxy while still being cool.", "Oh, how quickly that cockiness was about to fade.", "Technical Interviewer: \u201cGiven the data table attached, determine if there is a relationship between fitness level and smoking habits.\u201d", "My heart raced as I reached through my piecewise stats knowledge for the answer. Regression or scatter? But what would the axis be? Logistic regressions involve categorical variables\u2026but that doesn\u2019t make sense either.", "There would be no scatter, because I was the one scatterbrained. My newfound confidence began to melt faster than an ice cream cone on asphalt.", "I probably stared at this question for 20 minutes before throwing my hands up in the air, so kudos to you if you gave up (or somehow answered it) faster than that. If this had been a real technical interview, I knew I would have face planted hard core. Now let\u2019s talk about the answer in case you looked at that and were just as stumped as I.", "Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables from a single population.", "This was one of these times where if you don\u2019t know the specific test to employ, tough cookies, and I just didn\u2019t know what to use because no class had (yet) taught it to me.", "Turns out when you have two categorical variables, the go-to hypothesis test is actually as easy at pie\u2014 or should I say chi (please excuse the bad pun). Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables from a single population.", "To see if these two categorical values are related to each other, all we have to do is employ this single test. With that knowledge, let\u2019s go back to the graphic again:", "Based on this graphic, we can see that the categorical variables are (1) smoking level and (2) fitness level. We will use Pearson\u2019s chi-squared to see if there is a significant association between them. As usual, we first formulate a null and alternative hypothesis and set our significance level:", "If the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (smoking and fitness level are significantly associated). If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we will fail to reject the null (smoking does not affect fitness level and vice versa) based on the results of our analysis.", "At the standard significance level of 0.05, we find the p-value to be highly significant (given as 6.339e-11 in R, which translates to .00000000006339 in human speak). Based on this, we can reject the null in favor of the alternative \u2014 fitness level and smoking do seem to be associated in this case.", "And with that, the interview question was aced.", "Finally, if you\u2019re looking to dive more deeply into the mathematical explanation of Chi-Squared, I found these sites (here and here) to be quite helpful.", "Thanks so much for reading my little, Star Wars-themed article today. Let me know if you, too, are currently navigating the extensive process that is the data science job search, if you\u2019ve recently found your dream job or perhaps if you\u2019re just the casual observer of all things data-driven.", "(And if you\u2019re an HR manager looking to hire a young, witty junior data scientist, you can find my LinkedIn in the author bio \ud83d\ude09)", "Your home for data science.
