Such conditions, resulting from infectious agents that weren\u2019t present at the time of admission but developed later on, are termed healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).", "Tracking the spread of HAIs is difficult, but necessary. Unanticipated infections that develop during the course of medical or surgical treatment may prolong the duration of hospital stays, result in significant patient illnesses and deaths, and necessitate additional therapeutic interventions, which generate added costs.", "One of the most common HAIs is Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), a disease of the large intestine. It cause symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of the colon. The main sources of transmission are patients with symptomatic infection, who shed large numbers of spores and bacteria in the feces, resulting in widespread contamination of their skin, bed linen, and nearby environmental surfaces. The spores are highly resistant to heat and the usual chemical cleaning agents and can therefore remain in the environment for weeks or months. Spores can then be picked up on the hands of patients and healthcare workers.", "Because of the variety of possible transmission routes, it is beneficial to consider how variability across units, or suites of rooms shared by patients requiring similar kinds of care, in the hospital might impact the contribution of individual cases to onward transmission. These differences include factors such as compliance with hand hygiene, cleaning practices, and patient turnover, which are closely tied to physical location.", "Knowing that a new infection in a particular hospital unit might strongly trigger further events, as well as understanding how long these effects would linger, could guide contact precaution and isolation measures, especially those for high-risk units.", "In 2011, an estimated 476,400 CDI cases were reported in the United States alone, which accounted for 12.1% of all healthcare-associated infections nationwide. Rates have since begun to show some decline, though CDI has continued to be classified as a major health threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) due to recent emergence of epidemic strains. Continued efforts to improve adherence to infection prevention measures, in combination with findings from computational models, can go a long way in further reducing CDIs.", "In modeling the spread of an infectious disease, it is critical to understand the patterns of diffusion as quickly as possible. In such situations, the amount of data can be intrinsically limited. The data available for this study, primarily timestamps and unit labels associated with CDI incidences at a large urban hospital, was fairly low volume as well. This prompted addressing some small data issues associated with capturing patterns in time series data, while ensuring that learned patterns from short sequences were reliable.", "To learn various characteristics of CDI influence, we model infection spread using a particularly interesting class of stochastic processes that have been applied in diverse areas, from earthquake modeling to financial analysis. These are point processes whose defining characteristic is that each event arrival increases the rate of future arrivals for some period of time. We ask:", "What will happen if we apply a powerful modeling tool well-established within the financial literature to an important healthcare problem?", "Using both simulated and real medical data for experiments, we conduct studies to test the effectiveness of the priors we place on the model parameters and run experiments to assess the model\u2019s quality, robustness, and resistance to overfitting. Following this, we train and test our model on CDI event data, resulting in a learned characteristics for each unit and infectivity measures for all unit pairs. Below, we provide background on our modeling approaches.", "Events that are observed in time frequently cluster naturally. Given a collection of event sequences, we can characterize each event in a sequence by its timestamp and its type. Termed marked point processes, these sequences hold several pieces of useful information. For example, we can learn triggering patterns among events, depicted by the red arrows in the diagram below. We may also wish to uncover clusters of similar event sequences, given by the blue and green timelines. Using these learned characteristics, we can even predict events into the future.", "We denote by s = {(t\u1d62, c\u1d62)}, where i ranges from 1 to n, an n-event temporal point process, where t\u1d62 is the timestamp and c\u1d62 \u2208 {1, . . ., C} is the label of event i. Each point process can be expressed as an equivalent counting process, in which we count the occurrences of each event type. We apply an intensity function \u03bb to each counting process that collects historical events of all types before time t and outputs the expected instantaneous happening rate of type-c events. The key to learning a temporal point process is parameterizing and estimating its intensity functions.", "Here, we work with Hawkes processes, which are special point processes used to model complicated event sequences in which historical events influence current and future ones. Hawkes processes are self-exciting, as event arrival rates depend explicitly on past events.", "We express the intensity of a Hawkes process in a particular form, with two main components: an exogenous intrinsic intensity, independent of the history, in conjunction with an endogenous intensity capturing the self-exciting and mutually-triggering patterns hidden within event sequences. We refer to the influence of historical type-c\u2019 events on subsequent type-c events as the infectivity of a Hawkes process. The triggering kernel measures the time decay of the infectivity and models the dynamics of how previous events trigger future ones.", "We model infection spread using Hawkes processes to learn various characteristics of infection influence. Specifically, we fit Hawkes processes to event sequences at the unit level, where each new infection increases the rate of future infection onsets for some period of time.", "We design and implement a model to capture the dynamics of multiple event sequences jointly and also systematically uncover clustering structure among sequences. To improve our estimations of unit infectivities, intrinsic intensities, and decay rates (i.e., the model parameters), we incorporate prior knowledge about influence patterns into our learning framework. Our experimental results show that doing so improves parameter estimation as compared to multiple baseline methods. We also integrate the ability to learn an arbitrary triggering kernel, as current state-of-the-art approaches tend to assume specific kernel functions, e.g., exponential decay.", "The data used in this work consists of timestamps of CDI-positive diagnoses along with unit labels. An event is defined as the date on which a patient\u2019s CDI test resulted in a positive diagnosis, along with an indication of the unit in which the patient resided at the time of the diagnosis. In the table below, we provide details about the hospital\u2019s units and their room compositions.", "In the following plot, we visualize the distributions of events by unit, in descending frequency order. Unit labels incorporate their types, one of GMU, ICU, OU, MU, or EMD. We note that event counts differ greatly across units, but that events tend to cluster in interesting ways regardless of event count.", "We propose a model to learn both the triggering patterns of each event sequence and the structures across various sequences together, where each event sequence includes multiple types of events. The model parameters fall into two groups: (1) a global triggering kernel g shared by all the sequences, which reflects influential effects from past events, and (2) a local infectivity matrix and local intrinsic intensity vector, both associated specifically with sequence a sequence of positive CDI events associated with each unit.", "For a system in which U is the number of sequences and C the number of event types, we denote by A, measuring C\u00b2 \u00d7 U, the flattened infectivity matrix obtained by concatenating U individual C \u00d7 C infectivity matrices. We let \u03bc, measuring C \u00d7 U, the intrinsic intensity matrix formed by concatenating U individual 1 \u00d7 C vectors.", "To enable pattern learning across sequences, sparse and low-rank constraints are imposed on A. The sparsity constraint encompasses the idea that typically within each sequence, only a subset of event types occurs and triggers others. The intuition behind the low-rank constraint is to derive clustering structures when the overall triggering patterns of multiple sequences are similar and thus yield similar unit infectivity values. We also impose a low-rank constraint on \u03bc, as we hypothesize that intrinsic intensity values could be similar across several units. These constraints enable us to incorporate prior knowledge about infection influence.", "We learn the Hawkes process model with maximum likelihood estimation. The parameters A, \u03bc, and g can be learned by solving the following optimization problem:", "where the first term denotes the negative log-likelihood of the model and the second term regularizes the triggering kernel to ensure it is smooth. The parameters \u03bb\u2081, \u03bb\u2082, and \u03bb\u2083 control the strengths of the low-rank regularization on A, the sparsity regularization on A, and the the low-rank regularization on \u03bc, respectively. The negative log-likelihood can be expanded as:", "Above, u denotes a particular unit, c denotes a particular event type, and a is an element of A. n\u1d64 is the number of events in and T\u1d64 is the greatest timestamp of the sequence associated with u. Recall that \u03bb is the intensity function, taking the form:", "An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme with a majorization-minimization step at each iteration is applied to solve the optimization problem. The outputs are learned values of A, \u03bc, and g. The learning algorithm and parameter updates are detailed here, along with a robustness analysis. The code is linked here.", "To characterize each unit\u2019s CDI influence patterns, we fit a Hawkes process to the hospital as a whole, inputting 20 sequences, one for each unit with more than 20 events, in which all event labels are same, corresponding to positive CDI diagnoses (U = 20 and C = 1). We train a model on the first half of the data in time. We then test the model on the remainder of the data. We obtain a learned (A\u1d58, \u03bc\u1d58) pair for each unit u and a single triggering kernel associated with all units.", "These intensity and infectivity values are plotted, with one unit of each type labeled. We interpret the learned infectivity values as measures of the degree to which CDI events in the unit u trigger further CDI events in u. The intrinsic intensity values describe the arrival of events triggered by external sources.", "A key results is the EMD exhibiting the highest infectivity of all the units. That the emergency department is a key player in spreading CDI is not surprising, as it is a location where proper cleaning and disinfecting can become difficult given a constant influx of patients and high patient turnover. Moreover, issues with overcrowding make isolating patients tough.", "We also see that general medical units tend to differ slightly in terms of room layout, so it is understandable that, overall, they exhibit varied infectivity and intrinsic intensity values. A closer look reveals that the GMUs that have high infectivites also have high intrinsic intensities. The low A values are likely reflections of good isolation practices, where patients are treated in private rooms after they begin showing symptoms of CDI. Varying \u03bc values could be explained by GMUs providing care to patients of various demographics with differing underlying disease profiles.", "Units with private rooms are expected to have low infectivity values, as physical divides decrease the transmission of spores. Indeed, we see that all oncology units and most ICUs shown have low infectivity values, indicative of good isolation practices.", "The model identifies that MUs exhibit relatively moderately high A values perhaps because several CDI patients are routinely moved to these units, suggesting that the isolation and cleaning protocols of these units be revised. Points positioned in especially unexpected locations, e.g. ICU-1, were reported as such to the hospital.", "At the hospital level, we seek to generate infectivity values for all pairs of units. We do so by fitting a Hawkes process to a single sequence with all CDI events in the dataset, with a label denoting the unit with which an event is associated (U = 1 and C = 20). As before, we train the model on the first half of the data in time and test on the second half.", "We achieve the hospital-level infectivity matrix given below, where each cell measures the infectivity of type-u\u2019 events to type-u events for the receiver unit u and the influencer unit u\u2019. Visually, the cell values correspond to how much the units on the horizontal axis influence CDI events in the units on the vertical axis. We see that the infectivities when u = u\u2019 tend to be the highest, since patients are more likely to become infected due to the unit environments in which they reside than because of effects from other units. As shown, we cluster the influencers on the horizontal axis by the distributions of their infectivites across units. We group the receivers on the vertical axis by the distributions of the CDI influence effects they receive from other units.", "From the matrix, we identify the top five influencers as the EMD, MU-1, ICU-1, GMU-2, and GMU-6. This aligns with the results presented in the previous section, i.e., that these units were most influential in triggering future events linked to themselves.", "We identify the top five receivers as EMD, ICU-1, GMU-6, GMU-2, and OU-3. That several other units influence CDI cases in the EMD is reasonable, given the high activity it incurs from frequent patient movement. That ICU-1, GMU-6, and GMU-2 are top receivers, but that the CDI influence effects they experience are primarily due to themselves, is useful to note in terms of checking their isolation protocols. While we expect OU-3 to be labeled as a low influencer due to its self-infectivity value, it is surprising that is also a high receiver. The infectivity matrix indicates that OU-3 experiences moderate CDI influence effects from several GMUs, which is noteworthy and motivates its reporting to the hospital for further investigation.", "To evaluate the relative performances of the unit-level and hospital-level models, we plot various test log-likelihood values as the training set size increases. We run each experiment ten times, plotting the average result with single standard deviation error bars.", "Above, we see that the model with nonzero regularization parameter values consistently achieves significantly better performance than the one with no regularization, which is particularly evident when the training set contains fewer events. The unit-level results demonstrate that by learning from multiple sequences concurrently, the model with strategic regularization is able to leverage information from other sequences for the units with fewer events, effectively lessening overfitting.", "We applied a model involving Hawkes processes to characterize the influence patterns of infections within and among patient care units, incorporating prior knowledge about CDI transmission patterns by proposing regularizers for infectivity and intrinsic intensity. We also included the ability to learn an arbitrary triggering kernel. We look to extend the model by incorporating patient demographics data, with the goal of building an end-to-end CDI risk prediction model.", "It is exciting that data consisting only of timestamps of positive infection diagnoses effectively captures systematic differences between the triggering patterns of individual units.", "In the medical setting, having access to up-to-date infectivity values and insights into units\u2019 changing infectivity capacities can be of value.", "We hope that the work presented here motivates further inquiry into characterizing infection influence, with the goal of helping clinicians develop more effective programs to reduce patient risk.", "A.
