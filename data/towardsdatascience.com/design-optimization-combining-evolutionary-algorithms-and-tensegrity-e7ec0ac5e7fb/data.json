A structure apparently impossible, yet completely real and physically feasible.", "Here the central rope of the structure is holding all the weight, while the lateral ones provide balance by acting as suspension ropes.", "This principle, called tensegrity or tensional integrity, is based on the combination of tensions and compressions to generate mechanical stability.", "The term was coined by Buckminster Fuller in the 1960s and the concept can be often seen applied in art installations, but occasionaly also in architecture. One noteworthy example is the Kurilpa Bridge in Brisbane, Australia.", "I was amazed, and decided to try and build a small tensegrity table by myself.", "As I started thinking about the creation process, the engineer that\u2019s in me started posing questions like:", "As always, Python was the tool I needed to find all these answers. However, since there are no libraries specifically made to simulate tensegrity structures, I had to start from scratch.", "I scouted the libraries that allow to perform physical simulations in Python and opted for PyChrono, a physic-engine library that can simulate pretty much anything.", "Mechatronic systems, finite element analysis and fluid solid interactions are just some of the things that can be modelled with this library.", "The first step was building a tensegrity table using PyChrono, I\u2019ll call it tensortable from now on. For simplicity I opted for a cuboid structure, linking together parallelepipeds to build the rigid components.", "Adding the cables was a bit harder, and required the pychrono.fea module. This module uses finite element analysis to model flexible parts such as cables, wires, tires, airbags or even biomechanical tissues.", "The tensortable was implemented programmatically. Given some input parameters, a function generates the positions and dimensions of each block. This will come in very handy later on, because it allows to easily deploy different configurations.", "The parameters that can be configured are:", "The only thing that was missing was a method to evaluate the stability of these tensortables. Adding an earthquake to the simulation is an easy and fun way of doing it.", "A simple earthquake can be modeled using a sinusoidal function that acts on the floor. The parameters of this sinusoidal function are:", "We will use these parameters to modulate the strenght of the earthquake.", "By now, it is already possible to appreciate the fact that the physics engine is doing its work correctly.", "The tensortable with only three cables is able to stand if no forces are applied, but the equilibrium is lost as soon as there is a small oscillation.", "On the contrary, with five cables it is able to stand even if external forces are applied.", "At this point I could have manually simulated a dozen of configurations, figured out the best one, and called it a day. But since the simulator was working well, I decided to go a step further by creating a search algorithm that can find the best configuration in a smart and autonomous way.", "This seemed the perfect occasion to use an Evolutionary Algorithm to evolve tensortables towards their optimal shape.", "Evolutionary Algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution. As in the biological evolution of species, concepts like selection, reproduction and mutation are the building blocks of these algorithms.", "The idea is very intuitive: a population of tensortables will be tested for stability, the best ones will survive and used as parents of new generations, and the process is then iterated.", "In practice, these are the steps of the evolutionary algorithm:", "After each update, all the parameters are bounded between a minimum and maximum value, avoiding negative measures.", "At this point the process can be iterated, simply repeating the steps of Fitness evaluation, Selection and Mutation. Each generation will be based only on the best individuals of the previous generation, granting a gradual evolution towards better stability.", "We can now let the program run and collect the results!", "Here I used the model with five cables. It was already standing well, but I wanted to see what are the optimal proportions.", "We can see that the evolution converges towards tensortables that are short and have a large base, which makes totally sense in term of stability.", "Convergence is achieved quickly, which again is something that we can expect from the modest complexity of this problem.", "And here we can enjoy the increased stability of the final configuration in presence of a stronger earthquake, the top half is barely moving.", "So here we have it: an algorithm that can find the best configuration in an autonomous way.", "I built also a physical one.", "Some wood, screws, a bit of patience to calibrate the cables and the structure was up and standing. Ironically, after all this work I still opted for the initial design I had in mind: symmetrical and with five cables. Well balanced but also pleasing to the eye.", "Ultimately, good design is not only about functionality, but also about elegance and presentation.", "I believe the same is true for data science.", "I\u2019ve been intentionally light on math and code, but if you are interested in the technical aspects don\u2019t worry, I will add a link to the code (as soon as I clean it!).", "Any questions?
