One unusual thing, if you come from Python, is that variable names may contain points \u201c.\u201d and you get variables like \u201cmy.data.vector\u201d. This is actually very common in code snippets found online.", "Functions in R are similar to Python functions :", "The following small function named prod_age, takes creation_date as argument.

We use it to apply an operation to a blob of structured data, so it\u2019s not limited to dataframes. Of course, every point must have the same type.", "When working with dates, the first step is to go from a date string to a date object. The as.Date function does exactly this, and parses with the specified format. At the end of this article, you will find every date formats available for the format argument.", "Several built-in functions allow to write dataframes as files. A very common format is CSV. However, the RDS format is optimized (serialized + Gzip compression) to store any R objects.", "Just like Python, R comes with several libraries for plotting data.

It enables to gain quick insights on a dataset, such as feature importance, as we will see below.", "For this part, we need those specific libraries :- xgboost : Let\u2019s work around XGB famous algorithm.- caret : Classification And REgression Training, includes lots of data processing functions- dplyr : A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects, both in memory and out of memory.", "Once the dataframe is prepared, we split it into train and test sets, using an index (inTrain) :", "What the following function does :- Take our train/test sets as input.- Define a trainControl for cross validation .- Define a grid for parameters.- Setup a XGB model including the parameter search.- Evaluate the model\u2019s accuracy- Return the set of best parameters", "Once the parameter search is done, we can use it directly to define our working model, we access each element with the $ operator :", "Here again, a lot of functions are available in the xgboost package.
