Ever felt handicapped because of not being able to re-use an older iteration of your classification model which was offering the best accuracy score? Are you still following the old school version control approaches (remember V 0.1, V 0.2 V 1.0\u2026)?", "If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, then this tutorial is for you.", "This tutorial assumes that you already have a GitHub account and the Git Bash application installed on your system (assuming Windows system). If not, there are a lot of tutorials out there that can help you with that. The GitBash screen looks something like below:", "Git is a free and open-source version control system that enables tracking source code (or any file you upload on it) changes locally.", "To promote the concept of collaborative development, companies like GitHub (a Microsoft subsidiary) have built a cloud-based platform (GitHub platform) on top of Git. Other than supporting version control (standard Git feature), these platforms enable additional features like wikis, bug tracking, task management, etc.", "Before learning to use GitHub, let\u2019s understand some common terminologies which you will encounter throughout this tutorial:", "This scenario applies when you are working alone on your repositories for purposes like storing your codes, files, projects etc. Your repository has no authorized collaborators or you are not an authorized collaborator on someone else\u2019s repository.", "Creating a repository is the first thing you will do when working with GitHub. The process is very simple and demonstrated below:", "Cloning downloads the content of your cloud (GitHub) repository into your system folder. Using this process, you can download the content not only from your GitHub repository but from any public repository created by other developers. This is where we will start using Git Bash:", "The Keyword \u201ccd\u201d is an abbreviation for change directory. This followed by folder location or double period (..) instructs the console to change its working location from the current directory to the provided folder location or the previous folder in the folder hierarchy respectively.", "The Clone link in the above command is the link we copied in step 1. This command will create a new folder (with the same name as GitHub repository) in your folder location. This new folder will have all the resources of the cloud repository we have cloned. Two important points to note here:", "Knowing the above 2 is important as this will be useful when we are pushing or pulling the latest version to/from the GitHub repository.", "Once cloned, a copy of the cloud repository is available for us to modify. To create versions at every checkpoint, we will take the following steps:", "Git status will list down all the files you have modified in your local repo. The ones which are added to staging will be green in color whereas the ones not added to staging will be red.", "Please note the command line option \u201c-m\u201d followed by \u201cmessage\u201d. The message here is a free text comment explaining the changes made in the committed version.", "This is it, a new version of your file got saved on Git repository (but on your local system).", "Until the last step, we created a new version of the file by committing it to our local repository. In this step, we will push our local repository (with updated file versions) to the cloud repository. The command to do that is as follows:", "For first time access to the cloud repository, we used the process of cloning. Given the cloud repository will be accessible to the whole community, there can be multiple updates to it (commit in git terminology) and your locally cloned repository might not be updated with recent changes. To download the latest version from the cloud repository use the following command.", "Note that the command remains the same as the push command with the only difference that the word push is replaced with pull.", "Did you know that for a lot of technical job roles, employers now expect you to be an active GitHub member with multiple repositories and contributors?", "In our next chapter on GitHub, we will learn about how to collaborate with the developer community using GitHub.
