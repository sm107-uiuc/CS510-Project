Today, I\u2019ll address the issue of explainability and transparency of the so-called \u201cblack box\u201d models.", "To trust, one must understand. This is true of relationships between human beings. It is also true when it comes to adopting systems that augment human capabilities to generate insight and make decisions. It\u2019s a partnership between humans and machines. Like in all partnerships, trust is the key.", "It is perhaps no surprise that explainability of AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has become one of the most discussed and researched topics in the field.", "What does it meant for an algorithm to be explainable? It means that the system can convey useful information about its inner workings, the patterns that it learns and the results it provides. Interpretability is a softer, lighter version of explainability. A system is interpretable if we can see what\u2019s going on and if we can reasonably predict the outcome based on input variables, even if we do not necessarily know how the system reached its decision.", "Some model types, like decision trees and linear regressions, are quite simple, transparent and easy to understand. We know how changing the inputs will affect the predicted outcome and we can justify each prediction.", "Unfortunately, the same complexity that gives extraordinary predictive abilities to \u201cblack box\u201d models such as deep neural networks, random forests, or gradient boosting machines, also makes them very difficult to understand (and trust). The workings of any ML technology are inherently opaque, even to computer scientists. By its nature, deep learning is a particularly dark black box.", "The problem is made worse by the large volumes of data used to train those models, making it difficult to figure out which data points have more influence on the outcome than others. The fact that ML algorithms evolve over time also makes things hard, because the algorithms keep learning from new data.", "At the end of the day, it is a trade-off between accuracy and explainability. The question is how much we are prepared to compromise on either. Unfortunately, we have not reached the point where we can have models that are both highly accurate and fully transparent, although we are moving in that direction.", "There is growing skepticism and mistrust towards black box models. As a result, engineers and data scientists are working hard on the interpretability problem. The regulator is also looking into this. In 2018, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduced some fundamental rights for individuals to be informed about automatic decision making, to object about the output of those decisions, and to be given some meaningful information about the logic involved. However it fell short introducing a right of explainability. More recently, the EU has appointed a team of experts to tackle this complex issue. This effort already resulted in the publication of high level guidelines for a trustworthy AI.", "Explicability is definitely on top of minds, but does it always really matter?", "In this brilliant article, Elizabeth A. Holm takes a more balanced view by making the case for black box models, at least in three cases:", "In most other cases, however, explainability is a necessary condition to ensure the adoption of AI applications.", "How can you trust something if you don\u2019t know how it works?", "Achieving a high degree of accuracy in making predictions will not be enough to justify the lack of explainability of ML algorithms.", "Let\u2019s take an example in the healthcare sector.", "The potential benefits of AI in a domain like healthcare are enormous. For instance, computer vision can be used to assist doctors to identify tumors from a scan, increasing the accuracy of a diagnosis. Similar techniques can be used to predict diseases before any symptoms appear. However, those systems are doomed to failure if they cannot provide some level of explanation to practitioners and patients. Who, after all, would care to start invasive surgery or treatment with challenging side-effects, just on the back of a computer prediction?", "In 2015, a research group at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York applied deep learning technology to the hospital\u2019s vast database of 700,000 patient records. Hundreds of variables were used to train a system called Deep Patient. It proved to be incredibly effective at predicting illnesses such as cancer or psychiatric disorders. Without any expert instruction, Deep Patient discovered patterns hidden in the hospital data that seemed to indicate when people were developing those conditions. The challenge is that the tool could not offer any clues about how it reached its conclusion. Without a rationale, the predictions made by the system were simply not usable.", "Plenty of people and organizations are busy experimenting with AI and ML, pushing the boundaries of what the technology can achieve. However, I predict that only systems that can offer some level of explainability and transparency will survive.", "Fortunately, there are ways to make black boxes more transparent, and algorithmic techniques that can improve the explainability of ML.", "The most basic approach is to use proxy methods. ML models, which are typically difficult to interpret, are used as a benchmark for more interpretable model types.", "More sophisticated methods involve applying post-modeling diagnostic techniques, such as:", "It strikes me to see that, in order to tackle the issue of complexity, we end up adding another layer of complexity. However, this seems to be the price required to make the black box a little more transparent and trustworthy, and therefore more useful. Perhaps the main challenge is not so much the technology, but the culture and practices of the data science and engineering teams. Everything depends on their willingness and readiness to incorporate explainability requirements into the design, development and deployment of AI applications.", "Creating transparency and trust in AI goes beyond the explainability of black box models. This is only one aspect of the end-to-end analytics life-cycle, from data, to discovery, to deployment, to decision.", "Processes and tools need to be able to establish the traceability and lineage of data, models and decisions. This is a prerequisite to build trust in AI. It is also often an IT compliance or regulatory requirement.", "Organizations committed to trustworthy AI must be able to answer a number of questions.", "Building trustworthy AI applications goes far beyond model explainability. It requires us to embrace the principle of transparency in both the technology used and the organization and business processes. It must be a deliberate, proactive effort to ensure that data-driven innovation is followed by effective business outcomes and ethical use of AI technologies.", "For more, read my 2 other blogs on this topic:", "Your home for data science.
