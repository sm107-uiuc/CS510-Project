However, many critics have suggested that this relationship has broken down, particularly in recent decades. This project will explore a fixed-effects regression to analyze the link between productivity and wages in a panel of OECD countries.", "This project does not intend to be comprehensive \u2014 but rather, more of an experiment that provides some evidence on the topic from a variety of countries.", "All of my data will come the OECD database. I download three data series in CSV files: labour productivity (GDP per hour worked), average annual wages, and average annual hours worked. I take the time period from 1990\u20132018, since this is the most data available from all three data-sets.", "The full code and data-sets are available on my Github here.", "First, I will bring each data-set into R. I also load a couple of standard packages I use in almost any project I undertake.", "As is normal for almost any project, the data will come in exactly the form we want it. The data from OECD is well laid out, but still requires some work to get it in the format needed. For each data series, I will rename a couple columns for ease of readability and then delete columns that I don\u2019t need.", "From here, I can combine the data-sets into one data frame:", "This data-set includes the OECD as a whole as a country, which I don\u2019t want to include (since I\u2019m looking at individual countries). I need to remove these observations from my data. There is a few ways this could be accomplished, but I found a neat way to create a \u201cnot-in\u201d function that is easy to use in this case.", "Lastly, I want to create a new column that contains the average hourly wage as opposed to the average annual wage I have right now. To do this, I can simply divide my \u201cWage\u201d column by my \u201cHours.a\u201d column to create a new column.", "At this point, the data is in a format that I can work with.", "To start, let\u2019s just produce a standard ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with the data:", "Summary then provides the following output:", "The coefficient of 0.466 (meaning that for every $1 increase in labour productivity, wages increase by $0.466) is statistically significant.", "We can also visualize this regression. While I could use the default plot function, most people find the ggplot package much more appealing.", "However, due to heterogeneity between countries, this is not the best way to analyze the data.", "The first step will be to check if the panel is balanced (meaning we have the same time periods for all countries). I already know the panel is not balanced, but we\u2019ll show the code anyways. To do this, we will use the \u201cplm\u201d package.", "This function has confirmed our panel is unbalanced. Luckily, this package also has a function to balance our panel. However, we must choose how to balance our panel (the function provides three options). I will choose option that keeps all available time periods, dropping countries for which they are not available.", "This piece of code tells me my panel currently has 35 countries.", "The new data-set now has just 15 countries, a considerably smaller sample of countries. Confirming the new panel is balanced:", "The panel is now balanced. Now, I will produce a visualization of the countries in the remaining panel.", "Now we can run a fixed-effects model on our panel.", "The coefficient is now 0.486, and still statistically significant. We are able to produce a plot showing the within country regressions:", "While our panel has too many countries to produce a visually appealing plot, this can be useful for data-sets with fewer entities. However, we can still see that virtually all countries show a positive relationship.", "First, I re-run the OLS on the balanced data-set. Now we can test the fixed-effects model against the OLS to see if it better explains the data:", "We can reject the null hypothesis; the fixed-effects model produces results that are significantly better than the OLS.", "I will test to see if the model has time-fixed effects.", "A p-value of 0.029 is difficult \u2014 it provides good, but not conclusive evidence of time-fixed effects. This suggests that this model might be a better fit.", "While I won\u2019t perform them here, there is a variety of other test you could perform. One of particular concern is cross-sectional dependence. You might also test for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity.", "Your home for data science.
