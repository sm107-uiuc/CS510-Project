Out of the numerous data structures present, binary search trees play an important role when it comes to efficient operations. Since I received a lot of interest and kind responses for my previous article 8 Common Data Structures every Programmer must know, I will briefly explain about self-balancing binary search trees (BSTs) in this article.", "If you have read my previous article on data structures, you know that a binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where data is organized in a hierarchical structure.", "A binary search tree exhibits a unique property known as the binary-search-tree property.", "Let x be a node in a binary search tree.", "A self-balancing binary search tree (BST) is a binary search tree that automatically tries to keep its height as minimal as possible at all times (even after performing operations such as insertions or deletions).", "If you have gone through the Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet, you can see that the average time complexity of BST operations is \u0398(h), where h is the height of the tree. Hence having the height as small as possible is better when it comes to performing a large number of operations. Hence, self-balancing BSTs were introduced which automatically maintain the height at a minimum. However, you may think having to self-balance every time an operation is performed is not efficient, but this is compensated by ensuring a large number of fast operations which will be performed later on the BST.", "Hence, for self-balancing BSTs, the minimum height must always be log\u2082(n) rounded down. Moreover, a binary tree is said to be balanced if the height of left and right children of every node differ by either -1, 0 or +1. This value is known as the balance factor.", "Balance factor = Height of the left subtree - Height of the right subtree", "When it comes to self-balancing, BSTs perform rotations after performing insert and delete operations. Given below are the two types of rotation operations that can be performed to balance BSTs without violating the binary-search-tree property.", "When we left rotate about node x, node y becomes the new root of the subtree. Node x becomes the left child of node y and subtree b becomes the right child of node x.", "When we right rotate about node y, node x becomes the new root of the subtree. Node y becomes the right child of node x and subtree b becomes the left child of node y.", "Note that, once you have done rotations, the in-order traversal of nodes in both the previous and final trees are the same and the binary-search-tree property holds.", "Given below are a few types of BSTs that are self-balancing.", "Self-balancing BSTs are used to construct and maintain ordered lists, such as priority queues. They are also used for associative arrays where key-value pairs are inserted according to an ordering based only on the key.", "Many algorithms in computational geometry make use of self-balancing BSTs to solve problems such as the line segment intersection problem efficiently. Moreover, self-balancing BSTs can be extended to perform new operations which can be used to optimize database queries or other list-processing algorithms.", "Adelson-Velskii and Landis (AVL) trees are binary trees which are balanced. All the node in an AVL tree stores their own balance factor.", "In an AVL tree, the balance factor of every node is either -1, 0 or +1.", "In other words, the difference between the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree cannot be more than 1 for all of the nodes in an AVL tree.", "In Figure 4, the values in red colour above the nodes are their corresponding balance factors. You can see that the balance factor condition is satisfied in all the nodes of the AVL tree shown in Figure 4.", "After performing insertions or deletions in an AVL tree, we have to check whether the balance factor condition is satisfied by all the nodes. If the tree is not balanced, then we have to do rotations to make it balanced.", "Rotations performed on AVL trees can be of four main types that are grouped under two categories. They are,", "The diagrams given below will explain each rotation type.", "In this type of rotation, we move all the nodes to the left by one position.", "In this type of rotation, we move all the nodes to the right by one position.", "As the name implies, this type of rotation consists of a left rotation and a right rotation.", "This type of rotation consists of a right rotation followed by a left rotation.", "Consider the AVL tree given in Figure 4. We want to add a new node 105 to this tree. Figure 9 denotes the steps carried out to insert the new node and rebalance the tree.", "After adding node 105, there will be altogether 12 nodes in the tree. If we calculate the height possible for the tree to be balanced,", "However, the height of the resulting tree after insertion has a height of 4. Moreover, the balance factor of node 102 is -2. From these facts, we can see that the resulting tree after insertion is not balanced. Hence, we have to balance it by doing rotations. You can see that the subtree rooted from node 102 should be rotated and an RL rotation should be used. After performing this rotation, we get a balanced tree with a height of 3.", "I hope you found this article useful as a simple introduction to self-balancing binary search trees where we discussed AVL trees as an example.
