Luckily, a few groups like Socratic Coffee and Compound Coffee have compared refractometers which is equally important given their cost. This is an collection of data from Socratic Coffee, Compound Coffee, and my data to discuss refractometers. This is the third part in a series, the first focusing on Pre-Infusion, Pressure, and Water Temperature, and the second focusing on Grinding, Distribution, and Tamping.", "To measure solubility, one uses a refractometer. This measures Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and if you have the weight of the beverage, it determines how much coffee is in your cup. Once you know how much coffee is in your cup, you can compute the Extraction Yield (EY) by dividing by the input coffee weight. EY is the percentage of coffee you extracted. Typically, 30% of coffee is capable of being extracted, and good espresso extraction is between 18% and 22%, roughly.", "The standard VST Digital Refractometer costs ~$700, and even a lower priced one is still $300 (Atago). Eventually, I bought a $20 Brix meter, and later, I finally decided to get a more expensive one (Atago). I also collected data to help understand how well the Atago works and how it compares to a cheaper tool brix meter.", "Any refractometer needs calibration, and typically, one uses distilled water. Socratic Coffee investigated the different between the VST and Atago meters using Distilled Water and the Brew Water.", "They found a downward trend related to the temperature of coffee, but when comparing the two meters, there did not seem to be much of a trend.", "If we look at the samples were filtered or not using a syringe filter, the unfiltered samples end up having a higher TDS. Socratic Coffee did a nice investigation, and on a small sample on my own, I was able to see a similar trend with cruder syringe filter.", "More data on filtering shows that sample per sample, a filtered sample has a lower TDS. This makes sense considering what a filter does (it\u2019s filtering out larger particles which impact the refractometer).", "As they looked another time at the difference between the filtered and unfiltered samples, there was a clear effect on EY as well. However, I\u2019m not convinced a filter is worth the cost or effort.", "Socratic Coffee compared the VST refractometer to the Atago, and the results were interesting. First, the VST_II is offset to the VST_III by a constant.", "They took another look at the two, and one thing we can do is to combine all the data. In doing so, there is a clear trend between Atago and VST meaning that they are equivalent in measurement ability. The two distributions are sizable, and using a two-tailed t-test, they have a p-value of 0.9842 which means they are the same distribution.", "Socratic Coffee presents most of their data as TDS instead of Extraction Yield (EY), and it\u2019s important to note that slight differences in output weight carry over into EY. So I calculated EY based on the expected output per shot and the actual for this one study they did on the impact of a distribution tool.", "The most noticeable difference is that EY using the 40g output is an underestimation to the actual EY.", "I did this analysis for part of the VSTII/III vs Atago as well. There are some slight differences that concern me enough to stay in the realm of EY rather the TDS. Ultimately, I don\u2019t think it has an impact on potential conclusions.", "Compound Coffee compared the cheap brix meter to look at sugars. They may not have been aware that there is a straight conversion from Brix to TDS (typically TDS = 0.85 * Brix or Brix = 1.176 * TDS). Their data not only shows that, but it also shows that using a Brix meter is equivalent to using a TDS meter. For their data, the equation is slightly different (Brix = 1.1367 * TDS + 0.6102), but still very close.", "I did a fun study over a larger number of shots where I took a TDS measurement using an Atago meter and a Brix measurement using a cheap refractometer. I found the two had similar distributions that was statistically significant as I collect at both the 1:1, the second half of the shot, and then calculated the final TDS for the 3:1 ratio mark.", "The data for these refractometers is very exciting because this helps justify buying a cheap refractometer for the home baristas. Having a refractometer is currently the main tool to quantify and differentiate one espresso shot from another, and typically it has only been used by professional baristas.", "My hope is people thinking about using one could buy a cheap Brix meter instead to see if this information is helpful for their routine before they shell out a few hundred dollars.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
