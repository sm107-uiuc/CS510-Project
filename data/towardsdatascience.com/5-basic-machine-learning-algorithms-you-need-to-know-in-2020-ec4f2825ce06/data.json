It is a branch of technology that allows computer systems to learn from vast amounts of data, identify patterns within images and text and make statistical decisions with minimal human intervention.", "At its most basic, Machine Learning uses pre-programmed algorithms that receive and analyze input data to predict output values within an acceptable range. As new data is fed to these algorithms, they learn and optimize their operations to improve performance, developing \u2018intelligence\u2019 over time.", "Choosing the right Machine Learning algorithm depends on several factors such as data size, quality and diversity, as well as the supporting the business goal from our prediction. I have compiled a top 10 most used machine learning algorithm list which will help to find the most appropriate use cases for any specific challenge.", "Linear regression is a part of supervised learning that attempts to model the relationship between any two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. A linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept.", "Once a linear regression model has been fit to a group of data, the examination of the residuals (the data points deviations from the fitted line to the observed values) allows the modeller to investigate the validity of his or her assumption that a linear relationship exists.", "The most common method for fitting a linear regression line is the method of least-squares. This method calculates the best-fitting line for the observed data by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations from each data point to the line (if a point lies on the fitted line exactly, then its vertical deviation is 0).", "The k Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is an instance-based or a lazy learning method. It has been regarded as one of the simplest of all machine learning algorithms. The rational of k-NN is that similar samples belonging to the same class have high probability. The key idea of the k-NN algorithm is to first select k nearest neighbours for each test sample, followed by using the learnt k nearest neighbours to predict this test sample.", "k-NN is often said it is part of \u2018lazy learning\u2019. Lazy learning means that the algorithm makes no generalizations. This implies storing all training data and waits until having the test data produced without having to create a learning model. Hence, all of the training data is used in testing when using k-NN.", "The repository below explains how can k-NN be used to classify different types of flower in the popular Iris dataset.", "k-NN algorithm classifies an unlabelled test sample based on the majority of similar samples among the k-nearest neighbours that are the closest to the test sample. This is done by using what something called as the \u2018distance metrics\u2019 where the distance between the test sample and each of the training data samples is determined. In common practice, Euclidean distance is used.", "There are certain features of k-NN that might be interesting to researches:", "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating\u2019 hyperplane\u2019. In other words, given labelled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples into multiple groups depending on the classification goal.", "The SVM aims to optimize a linear discriminant model representing the perpendicular distance between the two classes by training the hyperplane to an optimum amount.", "In Python, there are lots of commonly used libraries to implement SVM with the most popular one being scikit-learn. It is a widely used library for implementing machine learning algorithms. Scikit learn has tons of built-in applications (import library, object creation, fitting model and prediction) to assist in creating a prediction class using SVM.", "Support vector machines have strong theoretical foundations and excellent empirical successes. They have been applied to various tasks such as handwritten digit recognition, image/object recognition, text classification, NLP and more.", "Random Forest is one of the most popular and most potent Machine Learning algorithms. It is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm called Bootstrap Aggregation or \u2018bagging\u2019. The algorithm builds a \u2018forest\u2019 that is essentially an ensemble of multiple decision trees.", "One of the significant advantages of the random forest is that it can be used for both classification and regression problems.", "Random forests are a way of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, intending to reduce the variance. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally dramatically boosts the performance in the final model.", "\u2018Random forests are like the pulling together of decision tree algorithm efforts \u2014 Teamwork of many trees will improve the performance of a single random tree. Though not quite similar, forests give the residual effects of a K-fold cross validation\u2019", "Random forest algorithm has quite a several features such as:", "Logistic regression or sometimes called the logistic model or logit model analyzes the relationship between multiple independent variables and a categorical dependent variable and estimates the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic curve. There is two modes of logistic regression \u2014 binary and multinomial regression.", "Binary logistic regression is mostly used when the dependent variable is measured, and the independent variables are either continuous or categorical. Logistic regression does not require many of the principle assumptions of linear regression models that are based on the least-squares method.", "Logistic regression also can handle non-linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables since it applies a non-linear log transformation of the linear regression.", "There are tons of algorithms that are truly important in the Machine Learning domain. However, you don\u2019t have to know all the available algorithms to get started in Machine Learning.", "If I have managed to retain your attention to this point, please leave a comment if you have any advice for this series as it would significantly increase my knowledge and improve my way of writing.
