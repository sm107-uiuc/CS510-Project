It is hard to learn programming.", "Many people would agree, but some do not. I did not believe that.", "This was because I could always discover subtle approaches to do whatever I would like in different programming languages. I thought I had mastered them. But I was wrong. You can do anything in your codes, but you should not do anything you want.", "I soon realized that those \u2018subtle\u2019 methods I tried were bad practices. But how can a working piece of code be bad? I get used to adopting these bad (and subtle) practices and it came back to haunt me. I learned that the hard way.", "Before sharing 4 common mistakes that every Python newbie should know, make sure you are familiar with some Python built-in features in the following article.", "Every Python newbie does this, regardless of their proficiency in other programming languages. There is no escape.", "Given a list list_, how would you access elements in the list one by one using a for-loop? We know that lists in Python are indexed, and therefore we can access the i-th element by list_[i]. We can then create an iterator for integers ranging from 0 to len(list_) for the for-loop as shown below:", "It works. There are no problems with the codes. This is also the standard way to construct a for-loop in other languages such as C. But we can actually do better in Python.", "Do you know that lists in Python are iterable? We can produce much more readable codes by leveraging its iterable nature as shown below:", "Traversing multiple lists in parallel in a for-loop can be achieved by zip function, whereas enumerate can be helpful if you insist on getting the index number (i.e. counter) while iterating over an iterable object. They are both introduced and explained in 5 Python features I wish I had known earlier.", "A global variable is a variable declared in the main script with a global scope, whereas a local one is a variable declared within a function with a local scope. Using the global keyword in Python allows you to access and make changes to global variables locally in a function. Here is an example:", "Many beginners love it, as using global seems to save you from passing all the arguments you need for the function. But this is actually not true. It simply hides the actions.", "Using globals is also bad for debugging purpose. Functions should be treated as block boxes, and should be reusable. Functions that amend global variables might bring side effects to the main scripts that are very difficult to spot, and it is likely to cause complex spaghetti code and is much harder to debug.", "Modifying global variables in a local function is a poor programming practice. You should pass the variable in as an argument, modify it, and have it be returned at the end of the function.", "*Not to confuse global variables with global constants, as using the latter is perfectly fine in most scenarios.", "This is perhaps the most common surprise for new Python learners, as this feature is quite unique in this language.", "There are two kinds of objects in Python. Mutable objects can change their states or contents during runtime, whereas immutable ones cannot. Many built-in object types are immutable, including int, float, string, bool, and tuple.", "On the other hand, data types like list, set, and dict are mutable. So you can change the contents of elements in a list e.g. list_[0] = 'new'.", "When default arguments in functions are mutable, something unexpected would happen. Let\u2019s take the following function as an example where a mutable empty list is the default value of the parameter list_.", "Let\u2019s call the function twice without feeding an argument for list_ such that it takes its default value. Ideally, a new empty list would be created every time the function is called if a second argument is not provided.", "It turns out that default arguments in Python are evaluated once at the time where the function is defined. That means calling the function does not refresh its default arguments.", "Therefore, if the default argument is mutable, and it is mutated every time the function is called. The mutated default argument would stick for all future function calls. The \u2018standard\u2019 fix is to use (immutable)None as the default value as shown below.", "The concept of copy might be foreign or even counterintuitive for learners. Let\u2019s say you have a list a = [[0,1],[2,3]], and then you declare a new list by b = a. You now have two lists with the same elements. By changing some elements in list b, it should not have any (side) effect on list a, right?", "When you \u2018copy\u2019 a list using assignment statement i.e. b = a, any modification made on the elements of one list is visible in both. The assignment operator only creates bindings between a target and an object, and therefore both lists a and b in the example share the same reference, i.e. id() in Python.", "If you want to \u2018copy\u2019 objects and only modify values in the new (or the old) object without the bindings, there are two methods to create copies: shallow copy and deep copy. Two objects will have different references.", "Using our previous example, you can create a shallow copy of a by b = copy.copy(a). A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements. This might sound complicated, but let\u2019s take a look at the following example:", "Right after creating a shallow copy of a nested list a, which we call it b, two lists have different references id(a) != id(b), with notation != denotes \u2018not equal\u2019. However, their elements have the same references, and thus id(a[0]) == id(b[0]).", "This means changing the elements inside b does not affect list a, but amending the elements inside b[1] does affect a[1], and therefore this copy is shallow.", "In short, any changes made on elements within nested objects in b will appear in a if b is a shallow copy of a.", "If you want to copy a nested object without any bindings between their elements whatsoever, you need a deep copy of a by b = copy.deepcopy(a). A deep copy creates a new object and recursively creates copies of nested objects in the original elements.", "In short, deep copy copies everything without any bindings.", "There you are \u2014 4 common mistakes Python beginners should avoid.
