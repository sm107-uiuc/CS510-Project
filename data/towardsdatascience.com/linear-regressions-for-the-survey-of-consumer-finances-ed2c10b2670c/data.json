Although they provided a good summary of what\u2019s changed since 2016, what is on everyone\u2019s mind now is COVID-19\u2019s impact on the economy, and all that got in the Fed\u2019s summary was a footnote.", "Despite that, the SCF can provide a good baseline of the before-times for future analysis of COVID\u2019s impact on our financial wellbeing. Over 90% of the surveys conducted for the 2019 SCF happened before February of this year. The only real kink in any analysis is understanding how exactly to analyze one of the SCF\u2019s most unique features: it has five complete datasets you can use for analysis.", "Why exactly does the SCF provide five datasets? It mostly has to do with the fact that when people are interviewed for the survey they don\u2019t provide complete answers.", "To deal with those missing values, instead of simply making one guess at what the value could be based on a household\u2019s answer to other questions, the SCF makes five guesses at what their answer could be. This way researchers have a better understanding of the distribution of possible answers.", "Although this solution help solve the problem of missing values, it introduces a kink when it comes to performing statistical tests on the data. It\u2019s akin to missing a part for your new IKEA desk and instead of being sent a replacement part you\u2019re given five new sets of the same desk. How would you deal with all those Arkelstorps?", "The same issue happens when you\u2019re trying to run regressions on this data. Do you just use one set, use them all, stack them on top of each other? Even trained researchers have issues with trying to analyze the data. Things have been made easier with some updates to statistical packages like SAS and Stata, but Python requires a little work. Let\u2019s take a quick look at what the SCF shows.", "At the bottom of this section you can see a gist of the code I use to download SCF data into a Pandas data frame. For the sake of example, let\u2019s look at some income data and market value of stock ownership for one household and all of its implicates.", "Here is an example of how the defined functions in the gist would work and their output.", "As you can see the first five rows of the 2019 dataset are the five implicates for the first household. It appears that this household definitely does not hold any stock and that its income has been imputed in five different ways.", "Another thing to note here is the weighting. For each implicate the weighting represents the number of households the household would represent in the total population. So if you added up all the weights of the households in one of the five datasets you\u2019d get a number close to 128.6 million, the approximate number of households in the U.S.", "With this data it\u2019s still possible to make inferences, but you might have to stray a bit from the traditional methods. The SCF codebook notes that Montalto and Sung (1996) provide a user-friendly introduction to how to make inferences with datasets with multiple implicates.", "First, before that can happen, a few operations need to be performed in order to make our repeated-imputation inference (RII). One thing that needs to happen is making a new column identifying which dataset each row belongs to. Thankfully IDs for imputed data is constructed from household IDs and can be made into a new column. Also, the weights need to be divided by 5 to account for the fact that we\u2019re creating an inference for the U.S. population across all the datasets.", "Below is an example of the code implemented based on the methods described in Montalto and Sung (2006). Essentially it takes the coefficients and variance-covariance matrices for regressions run on each of the implicates and produces p-values for the independent variables. For the sake of example, a model predicting total income of a household based on the market value all of its stock assets shows a p-value near zero, which is to be expected. The oversized, statistically-significant intercept, on the other hand, needs to be investigated further.", "This post will get you a long way on performing regressions on SCF data, but if you\u2019re looking to perform some other types of calculations, I recommend reading up on the academic literature out there. Montalto and Sung (2006) will definitely provide a good base upon which you can build more statistical tools to analyze the SCF in the ways that you need.", "Your home for data science.
