For example, a 2017 study conducted by Burning Glass, IBM, and the Business Higher Education Forum found that the projected five-year growth for data scientists and data engineers is 39% based on data from the top 20 metropolitan areas. To put that in perspective, the annual employment growth rate was 1.4% between 2010 and 2018.", "It\u2019s also one of the most competitive occupations with the fewest barriers to entry. In what other high paying and in-demand job can you participate in a low-cost coding bootcamp to bulk up on concrete skills that you can literally apply the next day at work? And, there\u2019s no shortages of bootcamps!", "Data science is one of the best jobs to have as a young professional because it allows you to practice a wide array of skills that are directly linked with value creation in a diverse set of industries. For example, you learn how to not only collect and analyze data, but also apply the results to drive strategic decision-making that helps serve clients better. You also learn how to communicate these results to marketers, managers, among others.", "Data science is one of the best jobs to have as a young professional because it allows you to practice a wide array of skills that are directly linked with value creation in a diverse set of industries.", "People in these jobs also have much higher satisfaction and engagement than their counterparts. Using new data from Gallup\u2019s Great Jobs Demonstration Survey, I related measures of job satisfaction with digital skills. Job satisfaction is a function of ten job-specific dimensions, ranging from pay to benefits to career advancement; digital skills are measured according to my prior work with University of British Columbia coauthor, Giovanni Gallipoli.", "The figure below documents the strong association between job satisfaction and digital skills. When you dig deeper, you see that the positive association is driven by a couple specific dimensions: satisfaction with pay, control over hours, career advancement, and the power to change things that you think are wrong. That last job characteristic says a lot. So often, we find ourselves wanting to make an improvement to the system, rather than sticking to the status quo. Data science often equips you with the tools to make the change!", "You have to know how to work with and clean data in whatever shape or size it comes in. Sometimes the data is unstructured. Sometimes it\u2019s got lots of missing values. And, sometimes it contains sophisticated forms of measurement error that can undermine prediction and causal inference.", "That last type is especially challenging to circumvent. I remember, for example, working with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a dataset that tracks individuals over time since 1967. One of the challenges with household survey data is that respondents don\u2019t always tell the truth, or sometimes they simply don\u2019t know the answer to the question. If you\u2019re asked how many hours you worked last year, what would you say? The problem is that this measurement error isn\u2019t random: it\u2019s probably correlated with other characteristics about the outcome that you\u2019re trying to predict.", "Whatever the problem is with the data, you\u2019ve got to figure out how to clean it to make it useful for decision-making. Here\u2019s a great article on cleaning data.", "Whatever the problem is with the data, you\u2019ve got to figure out how to clean it to make it useful for decision-making.", "Evaluate what types of estimators are suitable for your setting and scrutinize their assumptions given the context. One of the biggest mistakes we can make in data science is applying a sophisticated algorithm, like random forests, to a situation that\u2019s not particularly suited for it.", "One of the biggest mistakes we can make in data science is applying a sophisticated algorithm\u2026 to a situation that\u2019s not particularly suited for it.", "For example, if you\u2019re trying to understand how the introduction of a new product might influence demand, and you\u2019re looking at historical data based on prior product launches, then maybe you\u2019re more interested in causality than you are in prediction. If so, then you care more about what is driving the movements in your right-hand-side variable than simply getting a high R-squared. See this for comparisons between data science and economics.", "Remember that you\u2019re not just stuck with a single dataset: the world is your oyster. It\u2019s so easy to focus just on a single dataset \u2014 perfecting it and running all sorts of permutations of with the variables. But, the beauty about data science is that it is ripe with creativity. Sometimes linking up datasets is the most productive thing you can do.", "The beauty about data science is that it is ripe with creativity.", "For example, one of my forthcoming papers in Journal of Law and Economics quantifies the effects of right-to-work (RTW) laws on worker well-being using Gallup\u2019s U.S. Daily Poll. To answer that question, I simply had to merge data on the time at which different states adopted these RTW laws. In a more complicated example, one of my other papers investigated the effects of foreclosure on home mortgages during the financial crisis on community and social well-being, finding that there were meaningful effects even among individuals who were not foreclosed on directly, but simply lived around others who were foreclosed upon.", "The field of data science is constantly changing. Even when you think you know enough, don\u2019t forget to keep learning more. I\u2019m struggling myself between learning new techniques and deploying existing human capital, but that\u2019s a struggle worth fighting. The minute we think we know it all, that\u2019s when we\u2019re missing the potential to create even more value.", "Christos A. Makridis completed his doctorates in management science & engineering and economics at Stanford University and serves as a Digital Fellow at the MIT Sloan Initiative on the Digital Economy, a non-resident fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Cyber Security Initiative, a non-resident fellow at the Baylor University Institute for Studies of Religion, and a senior adviser at Gallup.", "Your home for data science.
