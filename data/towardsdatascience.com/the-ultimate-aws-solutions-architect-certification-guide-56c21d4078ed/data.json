A fantastic choice! You\u2019re ready to level up in your career and dive deeper into the fascinating world of AWS.", "The only problem is you have no idea where to start because you\u2019ve never prepared for a certification like this and/or have no experience with AWS.", "Do not worry. I was in the same boat not too long ago.", "Before starting preparation for this exam, I had very little exposure to AWS. The most I had done was host a static site using an S3 bucket.", "Also, I had never worn the hat of a Solutions Architect \u2014 at least in a professional setting.", "Less than two months later, I\u2019m certified.", "So what made this certification easy? The online learning materials.", "The online learning materials are a game-changer when it comes to studying for these certifications. They will make your life significantly easier.", "I went through tons and tons of resources while preparing for this exam, and I have curated the ones that will help you get the best possible results.", "Some resources will be free, and others will cost you. I\u2019m usually a huge advocate for free resources, but in this space, you pay for what you get. Every penny was worth it. Without paid resources, this certification would have taken months to obtain.", "You are lucky you found this article because it\u2019s about to change your life!", "Note: If you are looking for tips on how to pass the AWS Cloud Developer Certification, click here.", "Help you pass your AWS Cloud Solutions Architect Associate Certification exam (SAA-C02).", "I saw this as an incredible opportunity to learn, and it proved to be precisely that. In these two months, I was able to gain a holistic understanding of just about everything there is to know about being a solutions architect.", "I have only worn the \u201cdevelopers\u201d hat so far in my professional career, so it was fun seeing how the applications I work on are architected at an enterprise scale.", "It truly gets you thinking about how you can design your application to be highly performant, resilient, secure, and cost-optimal (yes, those are the four objectives you are tested on in the exam :).", "Furthermore, everything is touched on spanning infrastructure, architecture, development, deployment, monitoring, serverless computing, security, best practices, etc. The list goes on and on regarding what you can get out of this certification.", "If the thrill of learning isn\u2019t enough for you, the average salary of AWS Certified Associates and Professionals is well over $100,000 (cha-ching!). Of course, certification is not equal to competence, but it\u2019s certainly a good start.", "I tried out quite a few study resources. A couple proved to be incredibly valuable. I\u2019ll list them in order of usefulness.", "You can either purchase this as a course on Udemy or through the ACloudGuru learning portal. I bought it on Udemy for $13. Wait for it to be on sale \u2014 you don\u2019t want to spend $150.", "ACloudGuru was the perfect place to start for me. They give lectures and hands-on labs that are informative and will keep you engaged.", "They also do their best to keep their content up to date. Since the AWS landscape is continuously changing, it can be challenging to find current resources.", "Something that worked for me while going through this course was to watch the section summaries first and then watch all the lectures. This technique helps you focus on the most critical parts of each lecture.", "With the ACloudGuru course comes the community. And this is one of the best assets out there. They have a discussion forum where people talk about their experience with the exam. If it weren\u2019t for this, I would never have discovered Tutorials Dojo.", "Here\u2019s an example of a forum post that is helpful. Always make sure you\u2019re reading the most recent posts!", "This resource, in conjunction with ACloudGuru, will get you about 50% of the way there. If you already have experience with AWS, TutorialsDojo alone could be enough to prepare you.", "Tutorials Dojo offers almost 400 practice questions that explicitly focus on the relevant topics for this exam.", "The package was about $15, and it was the best $15 I\u2019ve ever spent.", "Tutorials Dojo not only gives you an abundant supply of questions but gives incredibly detailed explanations of why each answer is what it is.", "Also, they give links to the relevant AWS documentation and cheat sheets that will help further explain the concepts. These cheat sheets were handy for this exam.", "This study guide was especially helpful during the early stages of my preparation. It helped me conceptually wrap my head around many of the core services.", "Yes, I know this is a study guide for the Developer exam. I took both exams because there was so much overlap between the two. It truly is an exam on the same content with a different perspective.", "The value of this resource is the digestibility of the content. It\u2019s written in a way that provides excellent technical depth with minimal ambiguity. The AWS documentation and whitepapers can be a bit tough to get through sometimes. This study guide offers a layer of abstraction that doesn\u2019t skimp out on any of the details.", "I will say, however, that some of the review questions in this study guide are slightly dated. But there is no such thing as wasted knowledge. It\u2019s all good to know. And sometimes, understanding the historical context will provide a deeper appreciation for the current ideologies and methods.", "I was able to get this for free through an O\u2019Reilly Learning subscription that I have through work. If you don\u2019t have this, it\u2019s $33 on Amazon. If you do not want to spend this money, no worries, you can still succeed without it.", "Also, the O\u2019Reilly Learning Portal provides a good practice exam through Pearson. I highly recommend checking it out.", "If you are ever confused about a particular subject or concept, the best place to clear up that confusion is at the source itself.", "The AWS documentation and whitepapers are the most current resources you will find. All of the materials I have listed before derive from here.", "I found the \u201cBest Practices\u201d and FAQ sections to be the most useful.", "This one, for Amazon FSx, was responsible for three or four questions on the exam. Luckily, I read through this piece of documentation right before taking the exam!", "Always be wary of any API call or limit you read about from other sources. Since AWS is ever-changing, these values will change as well. An API call that was recommended in 2016 may now be deprecated. The same goes for the limits. AWS Lambda functions used to have a max execution time of five minutes, and now it is 15.", "The documentation is the best place to get the most up-to-date information for stuff like this.", "I paid for the practice exam, and this was mostly a sanity check to ensure I was studying the right content. It was $20 for 20 questions. Was it worth it? Maybe not, but it gave me the confidence I needed to schedule my exam.", "The questions you see on the practice exam are very similar to the ones in the Tutorials Dojo package.", "Also, they don\u2019t tell you which questions you got wrong. They just give you a percentage for each section (similar to how they present results for the real exam).", "This resource was also helpful for me: Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Solutions Architect \u2014 Associate. It provided a different perspective on the AWS core services as well as practice questions that are similar to what you may see on the exam.", "I wouldn\u2019t say either of these resources are \u201crequired\u201d to do well on the exam, but it\u2019s always good to see different perspectives on the content. And this comes straight from the creators of the exam.", "Study, study, study your core services!", "I recommend learning everything there is to know about EC2, VPC, IAM, ECS, DynamoDB, SNS & SQS, Lambda, API Gateways, the CI/CD tools, Kinesis, CloudFormation, CloudFront, CloudTrail, FSx, EFS, S3, EBS, the Load Balancers, etc.", "From the list above, there is a considerable emphasis on the compute services and the different types of storage available for each.", "Security played a significant role in this exam as well. You don\u2019t need to be a security master, but you need to have at least a solid understanding of how it all works. Knowing IAM, Cognito, STS, VPCs, subnets, security groups, Network ACLs, etc. is essential in doing well on this exam. This cheat sheet from Tutorials Dojo was beneficial for learning about VPC\u2019s and security related topics.", "Make sure what you are studying is up to date if you are taking the SAA-C02 exam. Tutorials Dojo helps you to understand what new services will appear on this exam.", "A fair warning: scenario-type questions appear frequently. This type of problem tests your comprehensive knowledge about a specific service or a collection of services and how they work together. This is more of an applied understanding, so memorization won\u2019t help you here.", "If you were planning on just memorizing the Tutorials Dojo practice questions, I wish you the best of luck. That is not the correct approach here. Take time to learn about each of the services and what they do.", "This is why I urge you to get as much hands-on experience as you can. Although I didn\u2019t utilize this resource myself, I\u2019ve heard Qwiklabs is excellent for this.", "Know all there is to know about CloudWatch and how you can use it with your on-prem applications (this specific topic tripped me up on the exam).", "What now? You sign up and ace that exam!", "The exam is $150, and you now have the option to take it in your own home. Make sure you go to the bathroom before, as they don\u2019t allow you to leave your workspace for more than two hours.", "It\u2019s almost impossible to know when you\u2019re truly ready. For me, once I got through the Udemy course (which took about a month), I went ahead and scheduled my exam two weeks out. Then if I felt like a need another couple days, I would reschedule and push it back (you can do this up to 24 hours before your scheduled exam time).", "This technique put a little fire under my butt and provided me with the motivation I needed to get after it. Putting the money down and having it on my calendar forced me to be accountable.", "During the two weeks after the course and before the exam, I did nothing but reinforce the knowledge I acquired from the Udemy course by taking practice exams on Tutorials Dojo and utilizing the resources I mentioned above.", "I wish you the best of luck! If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to leave a response, and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as possible.", "Director of Engineering @ Startup.
