To start out in machine learning and AI, it is probably enough to study a few online courses and introductory books. However, in order to get better, you will need to study more. Much more.", "Most of the information about state-of-the-art approaches in AI is contained in papers published on top-tier conferences such as ICML, NeurIPS or ICLR as well as on arXiv. Most of these papers require in-depth knowledge in their respective field and (often) quite deep mathematical understanding in order to be able to read them. What\u2019s more, the entire field keeps progressing at a blazingly fast rate. Therefore, it is not only imperative that you are able to read these papers, but also that you read them fast and extract the most important pieces to be able to decide if the information contained within is useful to you or not.", "In this post I gathered 10 books that I would recommend to anybody who wants to gain more insight into state-of-the-art techniques as well as more mathematical and programming experience. Mostly, these books are relevant for anybody who wants to work in the field. I did not include books that cover a particular topic such as NLP, computer vision or medical image processing. The post is structured into different categories based on the particular topic. A couple of these books are also available online for free so there are no excuses not to start learning more right now!", "As you will no doubt agree, a good foundation in statistics is extremely important for any data scientist. This book delivers a comprehensive but down-to-earth explanation of the most important concepts in statistical learning. Meanwhile, it does not require you to be an expert in math to get the concepts. The authors cover supervised as well as unsupervised learning, including SVMs, neural networks and decision trees, random forests, LASSO regression and much more. For me, this is the go-to reference for any standard ML algorithm.", "Available for free here or on Amazon as paperback.", "Designed as a second-course book on linear algebra, this book really dives deep into the mathematical foundations of linear algebra. It assumes you already understood the basic concepts and instead presents the subject in a more theoretical way. While it is definitely not necessary to be extremely knowledgeable in linear algebra in order to understand most papers in the deep learning area, I found that it can often be very helpful in not only reading, but also doing your own research.", "Buy this book on Amazon as hardcover or paperback.", "This is comprehensive and rigorous book on probability theory. And when I say rigorous, I mean it: it is meant for people already having some experience with probability theory. As all mathematical courses on probability, it opens up with a chapter on measure theory. However, only the most relevant measure-theoretic concepts are covered. Afterwards, the book dives into the concepts of independence, conditional probabilities, martingales, Markov chains, stochastic processes and stochastic integrals. As this is a book mostly for mathematicians, everything is properly proven (although some proofs are left as an exercise!) and you have to take your time to understand the theorems. However, the book also provides a lot of examples and figures for better understanding. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to understand probability from a mathematical perspective.", "The book is available on Amazon as hardcover.", "This is THE AI bible. It provides a very good overview of the field while being extremely clear and concise, requiring surprisingly little math background. This book also manages to cover a huge amount of material: it starts out talking about intelligent agents, search algorithms and constraint satisfaction, continuing with an easy-to-read introduction to logic and ending with topics such as learning, probabilistic reasoning, NLP and robotics. These last few chapters were only added to the book in the third addition and I feel that the information they contain does not really harmonize well with the rest of the content. I can, however, wholeheartedly recommend the rest of the book to anybody who wants to expand his AI horizons.", "As all the other books, this one is available on Amazon as paperback and hardcover.", "This book has by now become the standard book in deep learning, convering topics from the very basics such as an introduction to linear algebra and probability and feedforward networks as well as more advanced topics like CNNs, RNNs, regularization and autoencoders. An overview of graphical models and Monte Carlo methods is also included.", "I recommend this book if you just finished some basic machine learning courses and want to get a more in-depth introduction to deep learning.", "This book is available online for free at deeplearningbook.org. A hardcover version is sold on Amazon.", "If you ever did a proper machine learning course in your life, this book has probably been recommended to you. In fact, one of the top guys in the field, Nando de Freitas, based his course (available on YouTube) on this book. Mind you, this book is not easy to read, not is it meant to: it covers optimization, probability, SVMs, Gaussian models, Bayesian and frequentist statistics, linear and logistic regression, graphical models, expectation-maximization, Gaussian processes, variational and Monte Carlo inference, clustering and deep learning all in one book (wow!). The main theme of the book, and the reason for the \u201cprobabilistic\u201d in the title, is the inclination of the author to Bayesian methods. If you thought linear regression is easy, just read the chapter on Bayesian linear regression! The book serves me as a reference for all the research that\u2019s been done on the subjects in the past decades. It doesn\u2019t cover the subject of deep learning nearly as well as other books I mention here, but it also isn\u2019t meant to. There are other books designed to do that.", "Once again, Amazon offers this book (as hardcover). However, considering the price of this book, you might also be inclined to borrow it from your college library.", "This one is a relatively new book on deep learning. I picked it up just to find out if it contained any information I didn\u2019t read elsewhere yet and because I\u2019ve read another book from the author already (Machine Learning for Text). Boy was I surprised! The first chapters in particular very extremely refreshing to me and made me rethink the entire area of ML. In these chapters, Dr. Aggarwal establishes the link between SVMs, regression, SVD and other classical ML algorithms and explains that these are really just special cases of neural networks. Very interesting! The rest of the book is dedicated to the foundations of neural networks, explaining backpropagation, regularization, CNNs, RNNs and autoencoders in great detail, while also briefly looking at state-of-the-art stuff such as the attention mechanism.", "To be found on Amazon as hardcover.", "In my opinion, everyone working on ML should at least know what reinforcement learning is, as it currently seems to be our best hope to make progress towards general AI. \u201cReinforcement Learning\u201d covers the subject if not exhaustively (impossible), then at least very widely. The best thing about this book is it\u2019s simplicity and clarity. While reading this book, I never had the feeling that the authors left out something that could help me understand the subject better. It really is a joy to read. While it does become rather mathematical in some parts, the more involved stuff is always marked as such and you can skip it if you like (although I would recommend pushing through).", "This book is available for free online here. You can also buy a printed version at MIT press.", "While including this book may feel odd in my list as it covers a rather limited subject, I feel that it deserves a place here, mostly because causal inference is quickly becoming a major topic in AI and Judea Pearl is the leading researcher and the inventor of the theory of causal inference (among his many other accomplishments). In this book, you will find out what causal inference is and of course you will learn all about causality vs. correlation. It serves as an introduction to the field of causality and therefore provides the reader with concepts rather than exhausting details. It also contains many examples and thought-provoking questions as a motivation to think more deeply about the subject. The discussion on counterfactuals was especially intriguing and refreshing for me.", "You can buy this book on Wiley or Amazon.", "IMHO, every deep learning scientist or data scientist needs to be able to write clear and concise Python code. While designing huge code architectures usually isn\u2019t the main part of our job, writing easy-to-understand algorithms is. This book really helps you develop your Python skills. I discovered a lot of Python features I didn\u2019t know beforehand while reading this book. One that I really use almost daily is the concept of metaclasses. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t find such a clear description of the Python data model anywhere else. If you want your colleagues and GitHub followers to be in awe of the elegant code you\u2019ve written, pick up this book!", "Amazon offers this one too, of course. You can also buy it through O\u2019Reilly\u2019s website.", "There are so many resources out there for learning about AI and machine learning that it is easier than ever to acquire deep knowledge about the subject. The books I provided are just examples for the myriad of high-quality materials you can use. I hope that this list will serve you as a guide and give you some idea about what is out there.
