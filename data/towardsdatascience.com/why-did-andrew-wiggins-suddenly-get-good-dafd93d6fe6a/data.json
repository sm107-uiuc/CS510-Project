Coming into the league, Wiggins was a highly lauded high school and college prospect. After being taken first overall in the NBA draft, he won the Rookie of the Year award in his first NBA season, showing the potential to be one of the league\u2019s premier two-way players. Seeing this potential, the Minnesota Timberwolves gave Wiggins a massive contract extension, cementing him as a cornerstone of their young rebuild.", "Then, things took a turn for the worse. Wiggins\u2019 progress seems to stop in its tracks, and his play noticeably regressed in many areas. Just this summer, Andrew Wiggins 5-year $148 million max contract was considered unmovable\u200a\u2014\u200asome began to speculate it was among the worst contracts in the league. After 5 seasons in the NBA, Wiggins was beginning to look like a massive bust.", "Sure, almost anyone would concede Wiggins could score some points\u200a\u2014\u200ahe carried a solid career average of 19.7 points per game. However, that was about all he did. His scoring efficiency was poor (a career average True Shooting percentage of 52%, while the league average is above 55%). He wasn\u2019t good at rebounding or passing. Worst of all, his defensive potential has turned into nothing\u200a\u2014\u200ain fact, advanced stats showed he was a decidedly negative presence on defense.", "Even more concerning, there looked to be zero hope of improvement: his last two seasons had been his worst since entering the league. Before the start of the season, ESPN ranked the top one hundred players in the league; Wiggins was left off the list entirely (an odd feat for someone earning about $27.5 million this year).", "Then, almost as a switch had flipped in his mind, Andrew Wiggins got good at basketball. Through 20 games in the 2019\u20132020 season, Wiggins is posting per-game career high\u2019s in points, rebounds, assists, and blocks. The improvement across almost all categories has been impressive (blue represents the 2019\u20132020 season, while grey represents last season).", "This chart can be reproduced with the following code in R:", "Wiggins is even turning the ball over less, with the lowest turnover percentage of his career. His transformation has also extended to his scoring efficiency. Despite substantially upping his shooting volume, his TS% of 54.1% also improved by a large margin (he shot just 49.3% last year).", "The improvement is showing up in overall impact stats too. For the first time in his career, Wiggins has a positive Value Over Replacement Player (VORP).", "And he\u2019s also posting the best Win Shares Per 48 minutes played of his career:", "Out of nowhere, Wiggins seemed to find his game.", "These charts can be reproduced with the following code in R:", "What insights can we gain from his improvement? And is it sustainable?", "Although defense is notoriously difficult to quantify, the indicators we do have generally show Wiggins hasn\u2019t changed too much here. His defensive potential remains elusive.", "And despite improving his overall efficiency, his basic shooting stats don\u2019t show any huge improvements.", "What has changed, however, is his shot selection. That is to say, it has become much smarter.", "These charts can be reproduced with the following code in R:", "The \u201clong two\u201d has long been derided by the analytical types. It carries nearly all the difficulty of a three-point attempt with none of the reward. Wiggins plays an old-school game that relies heavily on long two\u2019s and mid-range shots. However, this past season his game looks much more modern.", "Wiggins has successfully converted most of his long two\u2019s into three point attempts or shots closer to the basket. Last season, 18.1% of his shot attempts were long two\u2019s (and it peaked at over 25% in this third season). This season, less than 9% of his shots are long two\u2019s, and 32.2% are now three-pointers \u2014 the highest rate he has ever posted. As a result, he now shoots 6.6 three-pointers a game, against 4.8 last year and just 3.4 on his career average.", "Wiggins remains a mediocre three-point shooter (just 33.6% this season), but the fact that he has maintained his percentage on substantially more attempts is a positive.", "That Wiggins increased efficiency is mostly from improved shot selection is likely a good thing; he isn\u2019t riding a hot shooting streak that will cool off. He has fundamentally changed his playing style for the better.", "So where does this leave Andrew Wiggins?", "Wiggins is undoubtedly playing the best basketball of his career; and there aren\u2019t any strong signs that it\u2019s unsustainable. In past years, advanced stats have not been kind to Wiggins, often painting him as a negative overall for his team. This season looks to be a major turning point for him; he\u2019s now a positive force for the Timberwolves\u2019 playoff hopes.", "Does that mean Wiggins\u2019 contract is justified? Likely not, even in light of his improvements. 538 still places his 5-year market value at just above $58 million, well below his actual salary. However, still shy of his 25th birthday and possessing extraordinary athletic abilities, there is plenty of room to grow for Wiggins. What areas could Wiggins look to improve the most?", "Despite improvement, Wiggins remains less efficient than the league-average player overall. Further increasing his offensive efficiency would bolster his on-court value. Luckily, Wiggins has some low-hanging fruit here.", "These charts can be reproduced with the following code in R:", "Largely because of improved shot selection, Wiggins is shooting a respectable 51.1% on 2-pointers. His free-throw shooting, however, is something of a mystery.", "Through his first 3 seasons in the NBA, Wiggins averaged almost spot-on 76% each season. Over his fourth and fifth season, his average inexplicably dropped to just 67%. This year, his free throw percentage has recovered to 72.6%. However, improving this percentage closer to 76% could be a plausible avenue to improving his overall efficiency.", "There could also be hope for improving his three-point shot. While Wiggins is a sub-par three-point shooter, other players have showed later-career improvement.", "Lastly, one big area for improvement remains to be his defense. Most stats still show defense to be an area of weakness for Wiggins. It\u2019s likely too much to hope that Wiggins becomes the lock-down defender he once showed promise as, but at least improving to a neutral defender could make Wiggins a more dangerous player.", "Your home for data science.
