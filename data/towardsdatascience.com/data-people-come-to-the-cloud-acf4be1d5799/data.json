The cloud is already here. Newer companies make sure that they don\u2019t set up their own data centres and use one of the cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. There are some niche players too like Databricks, DigitalOcean and so on. Most older companies will eventually have to move to cloud platforms one way or the other. Some will operate using a hybrid (cloud + on-prem) model. What I mean to say is that the work of a data person will depend on their level of comfort with the cloud.", "Now, there are hundreds, maybe thousands of courses that would teach you about these cloud technologies. Having done a lot of such courses myself and having used cloud platforms for about seven years now, I can testify to what are some of the things one should do to get started with their journey to the clouds.", "First of all, get to know the major cloud providers, the major services they provide and their strong areas and markets. As per my understanding, there are three clear contenders \u2014 AWS, Azure and Google, as mentioned in the beginning. All these cloud providers have certification programs. Although getting certified is no guarantee that you\u2019ll be an expert in that platform, it does mean that you\u2019d have to go through the basics of the platform \u2014 which is more than enough to get started.", "These three certification and related documentation is, as I said, more than enough to get you started with the cloud. This is in no way suggesting that you have to take this path to learn about the cloud. Certifications are overrated. I didn\u2019t do them all just until recently. Nassim Nicholas Taleb has this great quote \u2014", "For real people, if something works in theory, but not in practice, it doesn\u2019t work. For academics, if something works in practice, but not in theory, it doesn\u2019t exist.", "Practice always trumps theory. So, choose your own path. But this can be a good start.", "All the major cloud providers offer an account where you can use some limited services for a restricted amount of time per month for free. You don\u2019t have to pay anything. You probably would need a credit card to set the account up though. The best place to start is getting an account. If you don\u2019t want to do that, you can also use several cloud learning websites which provide labs access to these cloud providers. One of the examples is Qwiklabs (from Google).", "If you have gotten yourself started with one of the basic certification learning paths, you probably know about all the services related to data in the cloud. The first step is to get your hands dirty with the simplest, most basic services like \u2014 relational databases and graduate to data warehouses, pipelines, orchestrators and MPP systems later. A couple of weeks ago, I tried to list all the major technologies and concepts that a data engineer should know. All that, in 10 words or less. It contains almost all the cloud data services worth knowing for a beginner.", "If you\u2019re completely new to this, I highly recommend reading this great three-part introduction to data engineering by Robert Chang of AirbnbEng \u2014 part 1, part 2, part 3 before you get started with playing around in the cloud. If you\u2019re done with the beginner stuff, there are data specific certification tracks designed by all of these cloud providers to upskill you. Azure has the Azure Certified Data Engineer program, Google Cloud has the Google Cloud Data Engineer program and AWS has AWS Certified Data Analytics specialty.", "There is a flood of courses about cloud computing on popular websites like Udemy, Pluralsight, DataCamp, Coursera, Educative, edX, YouTube, ACloudGuru and so on. There is no shortage of content for learning. None of the cloud platforms haven\u2019t been able to crack the training formula yet so there\u2019s an excess of freelance or third-party trainers in the market. However, there are programs like Google Authorized Trainer, AWS Ambassador, AWS Hero for people who are really active in the community and promote their respective services.", "At this point, I would say that the quality of learning content produced by individual freelance trainers is much better than the official training videos. Having said that, I won\u2019t reject the official videos completely. Here\u2019s a great introduction to data engineering on Google Cloud posted by Google Cloud on Pluralsight.", "I recently cracked all these three exams listed above and I took different paths to crack them. For AWS, I used ACloudGuru\u2019s premium content and Andrew Brown\u2019s free course on freeCodeCamp. For Google Cloud, it was some random course on Udemy but mostly documentation. And for Azure, it was almost all documentation. Azure has really done a brilliant job with the documentation.", "Start with one but know all of them. The technology world is moving towards a multi-cloud setup. Most companies will use more than one cloud providers to tackle their workloads. And that makes perfect sense as different cloud providers specialize in different categories of workloads. For instance, Google is the expert with handling big data. No other company has ever seen that much data. AWS was first to the cloud market, many years before Microsoft and Google even thought about it. So, they have the advantage of having really mature products. Azure has the Microsoft advantage. Most commercial computers still run Windows.", "So, I would say that you should start with any one of them but go on learning about them all and more up and coming cloud platforms like Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud and so on. If you\u2019re looking to learn something very specific like Spark \u2014 go and learn it using Databricks cloud offerings. I recently cracked the Databricks Spark Developer exam and found their cloud platform to be really slick.", "While you\u2019re learning all these things about the cloud, it is really important not to miss how much it costs to be on the cloud. It can be argued that for most companies it is a better deal than having a dedicated data centres as it drastically reduces CapEx. Almost all cloud providers have a cost calculator included in their services which you can use to explore the costing.", "To become a complete, independent engineer, one must know and understand and be proficient in using cloud technologies. One other thing to notice about these different cloud platforms is that most of the tech jargon and implementation of technologies is pretty much the same in all of them. Conceptually, there\u2019s no significant difference if you think about it. Learning one cloud means you\u2019ve kind of learnt them all. So, know them all.", "Your home for data science.
