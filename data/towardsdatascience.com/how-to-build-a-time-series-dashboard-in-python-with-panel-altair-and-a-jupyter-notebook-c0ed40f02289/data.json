I love the built-in interactivity of the plots and the fact that the syntax is built on the Grammar of Graphics.", "Altair even has some built-in interactivity through using Vega widgets. However, I have found this to be limiting at times and it doesn\u2019t really allow me to create layouts the way I would want to for a dashboard.", "Then I found Panel. Panel calls itself a \u201chigh-level app and dashboarding solution for Python\u201d and it\u2019s part of the HoloViz ecosystem managed by Anaconda. I\u2019d heard of HoloViz before (and it\u2019s relative overview site, PyViz), but never really spent the time to dive into the landscape. So here we go!", "At first glance, what I love about Panel is that it is plotting-library-agnostic \u2014 it supports nearly all visualization libraries. So you don\u2019t have to be a loyal Altair user to learn a bit about making dashboards in this post. That being said, compared to the other code samples in the Panel example gallery, I think the integration with Altair feels really intuitive.", "Here are a few other really nice things about Panel:", "Here\u2019s what we are going to build: the simplest of little dashboards, composed of an area chart and two filters. We\u2019ll also add a title and subtitle for good measure. All within a Jupyter Notebook.", "This tutorial will break the code into chunks and walk through it bit-by-bit, but if you just want dive into the full code (with comments), the Github repo is here.", "First, as always, import those dependent libraries. Here\u2019s what you need:", "Updated August 27: please make sure that your Altair package is version 3.2 or above, otherwise you\u2019ll get some data formatting errors.", "Then we need to add two special lines of code, one for Altair and one for Panel. The first tells Altair to set the Vega-Lite rendered to Jupyter Notebook (if you\u2019re using Jupyter Lab, check the Altair docs for alternative). The second line tells Panel to accept Vega (which powers Altair) as an extension. You can learn more about how extensions work in the components section of the Panel docs.", "Since we\u2019re using some sample data from the vega_datasets package, let\u2019s preview our dataframe.", "Now the fun part: let\u2019s make some widgets! We\u2019ll be making a dropdown and a date range slider to filter our data.", "The dropdown widget takes two parameters: a title for your widget and the \u201coptions\u201d.", "Then we\u2019ll create the date range slider. You can access this using the same pn.widgets method. The range slider takes four parameters: start date, end date, default starting date and default ending date.", "Widgets done! Now let\u2019s add a title and subtitle, so it\u2019s clear to someone else what this dashboard is about. Panel uses Markdown so it\u2019s easy to specify headings.", "Note that we are just declaring variables at this point. Nothing has been built. But now, we start to get into the dashboard-building stuff.", "To create a reactive dashboard, we need to tell our Panel object what to \u201cdepend\u201d on. This effectively tells Panel to listen for changes in our widgets, and then reload the chart. This line will act as a decorator for the function: the ticker.param.value and date_range_slider.param.value will be used within our get_plot() function, specifically the Altair bit to manipulate the chart.", "We\u2019re reactive. Now it\u2019s time to create the plot directly below this line. Let\u2019s write a function that does all our plotting dirty work. This will contain all the data shaping/manipulating as well as the code that creates out Altair chart. We will split this code into three parts using comments: 1) format data, 2) create pandas filters and 3) create Altair object.", "Almost there! Now we need to create our final Panel object. Panel objects can consist of rows and columns. Since this is a simple little dashboard, we will just use two columns.", "First we create our single row. Then, we fill it with the contents of two columns. Our first column will contain our 1) title, 2) subtitle, 3) dropdown and 4) date slider. The second column will display the chart.", "And we\u2019re done! Simply call your dashboard variable and see your tiny little app in all of its beauty.", "Another cool thing about Panel is it\u2019s ability to deploy apps through a Bokeh server. For now, we\u2019ll simply take our dashboard and add it as a \u201cservable\u201d local app for Bokeh so we can test our dashboard functionality. For all the details on deploying, check out the extensive deploy and export Panel page and the Bokeh docs on running a Bokeh server.", "Will make your dashboard discoverable to Bokeh server. Now we\u2019ll need to pop over to the command line to start our server. Run the below code to start your server as a localhost. The \u201c \u2014 show\u201d command just tells Bokeh to pop open a new tab in the browser with your app displayed as soon as the server is ready. You can copy/paste this line into the terminal:", "And there it is! Our little stock price app. Of course, this is using a standard, demo dataset. But hopefully you can start to see how you can plug in your dataset and create a more useful application. Think of the three columns of the dataframe simply as placeholders:", "Even better, you can create a dashboard with multiple charts included. All without leaving the comfort of you cozy Jupyter Notebook.", "I\u2019m pumped to dive into Panel in more detail to start making more complex dashboards, quick prototypes, internal tools, etc. Happy coding!", "The Panel documentation has a fantastic gallery of examples to get started with, so head on over to see what else is possible. This tutorial relies heavily on the Altair example, but I have adapted the code to what I feel is a cleaner version which should help for adapting to different datasets and chart types. I also added the date range slider as a new widget. ICYMI full commented code is in this repo.", "Your home for data science.
