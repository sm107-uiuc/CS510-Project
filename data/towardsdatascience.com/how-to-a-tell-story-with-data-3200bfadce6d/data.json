One main soft skill is to learn how to tell stories with data. When I first became a data analyst I didn\u2019t know that meant. Years later I can finally answer the question \u201chow to tell a story with data\u201d and how you can develop this key skill to present data results effectively.", "I describe \u201ctelling a story with data\u201d as the ability to answer a business question and explain why it matters to the audience. The answer becomes a \u201cstory\u201d when you\u2019re able to \u201ctell\u201d how your results link to company KPIs and how changes in KPI trends impact the business.", "The best way I\u2019ve found to create a data story is identifying the KPIs impacted in the customer acquisition funnel. An acquisition funnel differs by business model but two main types are B2C ( business to consumer ) and B2B ( business to business ). B2C sell products or services for individual use while B2C sells to businesses. Companies can also have a combination of business models. Find out which business model or models your department supports to identify the relevant KPIs for your data stories.", "Let\u2019s assume you support the marketing department in an ecommerce company with a B2C model. A typical acquisition funnel will have these stages:", "Each department may have KPIs more important than others because they are responsible for a portion of the acquisition funnel. Marketing is normally responsible for top of funnel to drive new visitors but may also be responsible for customer loyalty which is further down the funnel after conversion to encourage customers to make repeat purchases. These are a few common KPIs for each part of the funnel.", "There are KPIs across the funnel such as conversion rate which is calculated using order count divided by unique visitors.", "Another component to presenting your story effectively is determining your story type. There are two main types:", "Knowing the story type helps you tailor your story for the audience. If the story is informational, you want to include new information as it relates to the aggregate KPI. For example if website visitors has always been aggregated you can first show the trend overall and then broken down by state. Marketing can use this information to run campaigns in states with low visitor counts to increase awareness and convert them to new customers. For actionable stories you want to include relevant data to support the recommended action. Note a story can be both informational and actionable. New information can be presented that leads to actionable recommendations to improve the business.", "Let\u2019s walk through a fictional use case at the ecommerce company. Marketing has noticed a recent drop in website visitors and would like you to research a possible cause. Website visitors ( awareness ) is at the top of the customer acquisition funnel and a common KPI to look at is website visitors by channel . You discover the visitor drop is from organic search and upon further investigation you discover there were website changes that occurred on the day the drop started. On the surface this may not seem to be a huge concern for marketing and senior leadership to take notice and have fixed immediately. This is where your knowledge of the customer acquisition funnel will help build your data story.", "In addition to researching the cause of the visitor drop you also segment visitors and sales by channel. It turns out visitors from organic search make up 20% of all visitors to the website but they account for 50% of total sales.", "With this information you\u2019ll be able to tell a compelling story to show stakeholders and senior leadership why the website should be fixed immediately. These are the key points to get across in your story to marketing\u2019s question \u201cwhy did website visitors drop recently\u201d:", "A visitor drop may only cause marketing to notice but any impact to revenue will make senior leadership pay attention because it\u2019s an important KPI that affects the company. In addition to answering the question, you showed the downstream impact, why it was important to fix immediately, and the cause of the problem. These are all elements of telling a story with data that ensures your results are presented successfully. Now that you\u2019ve seen an example of how to tell a story with data I hope this helps you craft your own data story.", "Your home for data science.
