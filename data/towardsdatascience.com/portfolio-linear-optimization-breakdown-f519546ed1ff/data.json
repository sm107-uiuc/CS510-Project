We learned the foundational concepts but never ventured into the hard skills required for advanced calculation. After some time studying python, I thought it would be fun to rework one of my linear optimization projects I originally did in Excel\u2019s solver. The goal of this article is to recreate the project in python\u2019s PuLP, share what I learn along the way, and compare python\u2019s results to Excel\u2019s.", "The real world benefits /applications of linear optimization are endless. I would highly recommend following along closely, at least on a conceptual level, and making an effort to learn this skill if you are not already familiar with it.", "According to Wikipedia, linear programming is \u201ca method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.\u201d These lecture notes from Carnegie Mellon University were very helpful in my own understanding of the topic.", "In my own words, I would describe it as being a way to solve minimum / maximum solutions for a particular variable (decision variable), intertwined with other linear variables, to an extent that it would be very difficult to solve the problem with a pen and paper.", "This is a linear optimization problem with regard to risk and return of a portfolio.

These are algebraically expressed below in the same order as we listed the constraints previously:", "In case you are confused about the \u201c7,500\u201d in constraint #2, that would be the 7.5% annual return we are looking for multiplied by our $100,000 investment.", "Now that we have the problem set up, let\u2019s upload the data into pandas and import pulp:", "Looking good. There are a few formatting changes that must be made in order to move forward, however.", "The first step using PuLP is to define the problem.
