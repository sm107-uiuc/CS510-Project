When we are pushed to wall or challenged, most often we try to get best out of us. If you refer to the quote from Edmond Mbianka below, that reflects something in line.", "\u201cGreatness is what happens when you aren\u2019t afraid to relentlessly push yourself to tear down all your walls of limitations\u201d - Edmond Mbiaka", "There is a strong delineation between Innovation and Data Science. The framework of successful end to end data science project demands for a structured thinking, iterative approach and multiple methods or experiments for successful impact. Innovation mindset is extremely important and is correlated.", "When we look for innovation, writing a disclosure or patent, we need to watch out for key aspects such as the following. This is very important in the context of data science.", "Above points resonate completely while dealing with a data science setup. We think about business problem, understand the objective, perform design thinking to speculate problems and solution methods, more importantly understand what every personas think and expect, correlate business problems to data problems, perform exploratory data analysis, perform data munging, data wrangling, data transformation for the \u201cneed\u201d, define or formulate features, use features to select on algorithms, experiment with various combinations of algorithms with variations, evaluate results, again iterate and continue until we get best results, present outcomes to measure impact and value creation, close the feedback loop and so on. Most of these are iterative and demand \u201cout of the box\u201d thinking during most part of the process, different methods which can be novel, selecting the \u201cbest method\u201d based on analysis.", "The culture of innovation, it\u2019s review process, thinking about multiple approaches to define a novel method are extremely critical to core of innovation. This reflects a lot when we deal with data science processes for solving any business problems. At the same time, we need to understand the process well. We need to guide ourselves during disclosure creation process for Data Science.", "The following are thoughts around key dimensions which can be considered as checklist items:", "Checklist 1: Check if the idea is \u201cNew\u201d / \u201cNovel\u201d", "a) Is it similar to any of the products, methods I have developed or used? Is there anything similar available in my knowledge?", "b) Is it similar to any technique I have learned? Are there any correlations to my related learning techniques?", "c) Perform search on some sites such as Google patents, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, CiteSeer, IEEE Electronic Library, ACM Digital Library etc and see if anything closer to the idea already exists.", "d) You may not have used these products before, however they may be applicable in some form or the other. Can we check that aspect?", "e) Let us refer to Patent databases where we will get some similar methods described. Are they close to this invention?", "f) In any firm, there will be local IP attorney or related authorities who can assist in the process. Better to go to them with some of these findings, information to resolve any queries one may have.", "While working on disclosures, prior art search is extremely important. We need to ensure we search for prior arts that are relevant and close to our method and how our method or idea differentiates other prior art(s). Prior art may be in many different forms such as publications or existing products, or services or some blog write ups with an approach of formulation etc. Examples of publications (which are probably most accessible types of prior art) could be patents itself, user manuals, web pages, product brochures, textbooks, published patent applications, magazines, journals, conference papers, doctoral dissertations and similar artefacts. For us to consider a publication as a prior art, it\u2019s date of reference which must pre-date the filing date of our application.", "Checklist 2: Check if the idea is \u201cNon-obvious\u201d", "Non-obvious tends to trip up new evaluators because the legal notion of obvious is more precise than the intuitive notions of obvious. It takes some practice to understand and internalize the legal notion adequately.", "Some useful operational models for ordinary skill could be using various points such as associate\u2019s degree holder, specific level of engineering or computer science courses with training in relevant products, practitioner who understands SQL, stored procedures and their usage and so on.", "Checklist 3: Check if the idea is \u201cUseful\u201d or not?", "We can aim to see \u201cUsefulness\u201d aspect in our innovation and try to explore based on some of the following questions.", "Checklist 4: Check if the idea is in the mode of \u201cEnable Implementation\u201d or not?", "Lack of enablement of checklist points:", "Check for the following phrases in the idea:", "Checklist 5: Check if the idea has \u201cBusiness Value\u201d or not?", "If we plot a graph between anticipated business value and relevance of prior arts available for the invention that is/are in contention during the review process, we can categorise four broader areas such as the following:", "Cat1 or Category 1 \u2014 which has highest business value", "Cat2 or Category 2 \u2014 most inventions may fall in this category which has business value but less than Category 1", "Cat3 or Category 3 \u2014 somewhat low business value", "Cat4 or Category 4 \u2014 no business value at all and can be dropped", "Therefore to summarise, innovation and data science are inter related. The iterative approach helps in defining multiple methods and encourages experimentation based outcomes, refinement within outcomes for better success and impact in Data and AI. The entire framework helps to build innovation mindset while driving end to end data science program for success. Key dimensions such as novelty, usefulness, non-obviousness, enablement aspect, detectability, business value etc need to be taken into consideration. We also must look at how to create innovations in such a manner that may fall into category 1 and category 2 in above illustrative diagram which means the business value is higher and relevance of prior arts is lower relatively.", "Disclaimer: The postings here are personal point of views from my experiences, thoughts, readings from various sources and don\u2019t necessarily represent any firm\u2019s positions, strategies or opinions.", "Your home for data science.
