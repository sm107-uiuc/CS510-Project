Or you will someday. You have moved into a brand new position. You were hired or promoted for you work in a different part of the organization. In many instances, you had your first leadership role there leading a team of individual contributors where you also used to be one. Likely you made you way up the ranks there, learning the work, the culture, and the players in the organization.", "But now you are promoted into a different part. You have some familiarity with this section, but you don\u2019t really know it. You don\u2019t know the team, you don\u2019t exactly know what they all do and how they do it.", "You\u2019re used to thriving on training your team on their tasks because you used to do the tasks yourself\u2026now you can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t even always understand how they are doing what they do.", "This was me when I took a position managing a data science team. My background is in social science and policy. I never coded before outside of some Stata for my masters degree (and the use of \u201ccoding\u201d in Stata is arguable) and most of my math and statistics ware based on social science research. Honestly though, I usually leaned more on qualitative methods for my research and work.", "Now I was sitting down with a team trying to understand how they were pulling together data and compiling it into dashboards. Not only did I need to understand this in quick order, I was expected to help them do their jobs better and add value for the organization. I wasn\u2019t really certain where to begin.", "Luckily, I had recently began a doctorate program and had been getting more interested in performance measurements, evidence-based policy, and the realm of data analysis. This had at least made me familiar with the term \u201ddata science\u201d.", "Additionally, I had a good plan for myself coming into this position. I built this plan based on The First 90 Days by Micheal Watkins. One of the key takeaways is to set a learning schedule for yourself.", "This does three important things. First, it ensures you are intentionally learning about the people, things, and relationships that you need to learn in your new job. Second, it allows your new team to see that you are coming in with an open mind to learn from them, rather than just thinking you know it all already. Lastly, it gives you time and space in your day to really dive into learning what you team is doing and how they are doing it.", "Take advantage of this time, it will help you immensely later on. You will also be surprised by how much you will learn about the team and organization this way rather than just scheduling a march of one-on-one meetings. Really take advantage and get into the work, try to actually contribute rather than just going through the motions.", "In my own case, this is how I became more familiar with the tools the team was using. SQL, R, Python and Tableau were all foreign to me previously. It also allowed me to understand how I might be able to add value to the team. More about that later.", "Set this learning schedule up for yourself outside of the office too. Are there books you should read? Meetings or conferences you should attend? Courses you should take?", "Remember, you do not need to become the technical expert\u2026that isn\u2019t why you were promoted. But you need to have enough familiarity to understand what the team is doing and how they are doing it.", "As I worked through the learning schedule for my new position, I gained a lot of insights about what the team was capable of and what some possibilities were for future work.", "In my doctoral program research, I was also focusing on applying data analytics, decision science techniques, and machine learning processes to government policies and programs.", "Whether it was intentional or not, there became a beautiful overlap between my outside research and my work learning. I also benefited from understanding the organization structure of my team compared to some suggested optimums for data science based on a lot of excellent resources.", "Our team had a few members who had been with the organization a while and focused most of their efforts on providing descriptive statistics. We also had several new members who were brought on board for their technical skill sets for a couple of special projects involving machine learning and predictive analytics. What was lacking was a clear strategy for the team and key areas that we could make improvements for the entire organizations.", "This was my \u201clight bulb\u201d moment. It came many months after I started the job. This is my main point: It\u2019s really difficult to start a new position and not try to find early and clear successes to show your boss, your team, and yourself that you actually deserve to be in your role!", "In my experience though, the valuable work you will do as a leader takes longer than you would think. You need time to build the understanding and knowledge necessary to provide actual strategic vision or insight. Be patient and do the work, it will come.", "The next steps will also take time. Just because you have some strategic insight or vision, doesn\u2019t mean that you will quickly reorganize the team, turn them towards the tasks needed, and begin pushing in this new direction.", "One thing that was surprising for me to learn as a senior leader was how much work I had to put into \u201cselling\u201d my vision and explaining it to others on the team. It\u2019s more than just buy-in, the vision that is so firmly in your head is much more difficult for others to see. I had naively thought that my title alone might somehow do this work for me. I was wrong.", "In this phase there are two main strategies to follow:", "Directive. You can be very directive, simply pointing the organization or team towards your goal and closely monitoring all of the work to ensure it is meeting this design.", "Many will balk at this strategy as micromanagement or authoritarian, but its important to note this is viable and preferred in some situations.", "For instance, in crisis situations for an organization or when there are inflexible requirements and timelines this can be a very useful strategy. Steve Jobs was famous (or infamous) for utilizing this strategy. At times it lead to get successes, but also lead to some of his lowest moments. Be careful with this strategy!", "Supportive. Another strategy usually involves helping the team come together to discuss and decide of the strategy as a group. This can be done in a number of different ways but usually involves facilitated group work aimed at identifying members\u2019 perceptions of needed outputs and internal constraints to identify what they believe are achievable and justified goals for the organization.", "This will take longer than direction, but has the benefit of building a shared vision among the team based on all of their perspectives. This also helps leaders avoid making mistakes based on their ignorance of subtle nuances and information held by the team.", "In my experience, the supportive strategy is the path to follow in most situations. Keep in mind though that there are likely to be key team members that need some extra directive push to get them to disrupt their routines or acknowledge blind spots. Typically this happens with long-tenured team members but it is also common with new members who have deep technical knowledge but lack domain knowledge or understanding of the organization.", "As our team worked together to identify current work requirements and pain points, they coalesced around an understanding that we could leverage the new tools and skill sets on the team to improve and automate the data reporting requirements. This would free up our resources to then tackle many new projects there were not before possible.", "My vision and value to the team came in here. I made sure that the team understood how valuable their efforts were, but also explained how they could even better produce tools that would help the organization in ways they weren\u2019t aware of.", "I had learned enough about their knowledge and skills to explain to them different use cases for machine learning projects that directly tied into the organization\u2019s top priorities.", "Additionally, I helped them understand how we needed to present results and information from our data analyses for leadership so they could be used in decision-making.", "Lastly, I made sure that as we embarked on these new projects, I used my perspective and understanding to ensure all of the relevant stakeholders were involved, not just those we had good working relationships with.", "Throughout this weeks-long process, I was also communicating constantly with my bosses to make sure they understood, agreed with, and supported our strategy. This ensured that we had buy-in even before we presented our final strategic plan for their approval.", "This experience taught me a few valuable lessons.", "Don\u2019t be overwhelmed by your lack of knowledge when you join a data science team. Even if you have a data science background, there are areas you will not be strong in that others are. There are different skill sets and needed roles. Find yours and focus on adding value based on that. As a leader, you also need to focus on the goals of the team and make sure you have the diverse skills on the team to meet them.", "Be patient with yourself. Too often when we join a new team, we feel a strong need to be productive. As a leader and an individual, recognize the value is taking time to thoroughly learn before trying to jump into producing. You might feel like you are a burden on the team, but you will be more useful in the long run.", "Serve as the bridge. As a leader, especially of a data science team, make sure you are bringing the perspective and needs of the organization to the feet of your team. Help them see the priorities and goals, and then challenge them to find ways for their skills to help meet these goals. I didn\u2019t always succeed here, but even that mistake taught me how important this was.", "Your home for data science.
