Many governments in the world have seen this as an innovative strategy that could potentially bring a number of societal benefits. For instance, it could reduce the use of automobiles and hence reduce greenhouse gas emission and alleviate traffic congestion in city centres.", "Reports have shown that 77% of Londoners agree that cycling is the fastest way to make short-distance journeys. In the long run, it might also help increase the life expectancy in the city.", "I have been working on a data-driven cost-effective algorithm for optimizing (re-balancing) the system of Santander Cycles, a public bicycle hire scheme in London, which I should make a post about it once my paper is published (more info here). Before really working on the algorithm, I had to delve into loads of data and it would really help if I could somehow visualize them.", "TL;DR \u2014 Let\u2019s see how we can visualize a bike sharing system using graphs, maps, and animations.", "You can find web maps on this page. Most maps, animations, and source codes are available on GitHub. Data is now available on Kaggle.", "Originally published on my blog edenau.github.io. My work is inspired by Vincent Lonij and Dhrumil Patel. Check out their posts!", "I obtained data on bicycle journeys from Transport for London (TfL). Every single bike journey made in their system since 2012 was recorded and those open data are available online.", "A 36-day record of journeys made from 1 August to 13 September 2017 was analyzed. During this period, there were >1.5 million journeys made among >700 bike docking stations in London. From 2014, we have witnessed a >190% rise in bike trips made. The number of bicycles and docking stations in the system both increased more than twofold to accommodate the significant rise in cycling demand in central London and regional areas. Exact data will be shown in my soon-to-be-released paper. Stay tuned.", "I believed there would be a massive difference in journey patterns between weekdays and weekends. Let\u2019s do some coding and see if this is true. We first import data of journeys by pd.read_csv().", "Then we extract weekday data by date.weekday() and evenly divide a 24-hour day into 72 time slices, such that each time slice represents a 20-minute interval.", "We also need to check if those bike trips were made from/to abolished stations, as there are no ways to obtain information of those stations, such as locations, station name etc. (good job TfL). We labelled them as \u2018invalid\u2019 journeys.", "Finally, we only keep journeys that are \u2018valid\u2019 and made on weekdays, which turns out to be around 73% of the data.", "We finally delve into the visualization part! The simplest forms of data visualization are arguably charts. By a simple groupby('TimeSlice') function, we can see how frequent journeys were made in different hours.", "See? our hypothesis is right! Journey patterns on weekdays and weekends are so different, as we can see two peak hours on weekdays, where most people commute, but not on weekends. We can also observe the distribution of journey duration and speed in a similar fashion.", "Note that we assumed straight paths were taken due to data constraint (they don\u2019t track your movement), which would be shorter than the actual paths, and therefore the speeds computed with distances between start and end stations would be underestimated. If customers return the bike at the same station it was rent, the computed speed would be 0, which explains the rather strange spike spotted at 0 km/h.", "If charts are fancy, maps are fancier. We will use folium, which is a Python wrapper of Leaflet.js that makes interactive maps. Make sure you install the latest version by", "(or its conda install equivalent). I worked on Google Colaboratory and the pre-installed version is 0.2.0 with minimal functionalities.", "I built a simple template for generating a map with circle markers (with different colours!) using clusters.", "Why clusters? MarkerCluster() enables markers to cluster together when they are too close when you zoom out. You do not want your maps to be too messy, with markers overlapping one another.", "It automatically de-clusters/unfolds when you zoom in:", "But I promised you interactive maps. You can set the popup parameter and display station name and its capacity when you click on it. Bravo!", "The above code used a dynamic colour scheme that depends on the capacity of stations. We can also implement a dynamic radius scheme for those circle markers that is based on the number of departures and arrivals of each station. We can obtain what we called density maps that shows the net departures/arrivals of every station.", "I used a different colour scheme here (target red and tiffany blue are both trademarked colours in the United States) that shows if the number of departures at some station is more or less than the number of arrivals. Big circle markers represent a large departure-arrival difference.", "Let\u2019s see how density maps look like in morning and evening peak hours:", "All the aforementioned maps focus on stations but not journeys, but we can also visualize journeys by what we called connection maps, by simply drawing trips completed on the map. Without delving into many details:", "We can also add multiple layers of connection by folium.LayerControl() to separate layers of frequently and infrequently used paths.", "So far we have demonstrated how to visualize temporal and distributional information by charts, and spatial information by various kinds of maps. But what if we generate multiple maps on consecutive time instances? We can visualize spatio-temporal information using animations!", "The maps generated are web maps in .html files. The idea is to:", "Generate a map for every time instance, browse it on a web browser, take a screenshot and save the picture, and link all pictures together as a video or a .gif file.", "We are going to automate the web browsing and screen capturing process by selenium. We also need a web driver, and as a Chrome user I went for chromedriver.", "We can then make the video or gif by ffmpeg.

To create a .mp4 file, try", "Check out the animation of density maps throughout a day:", "And also the animation of journeys at different times:", "The bike sharing system in London is visualized using bar charts, density maps, connection maps, and animations.", "The abstraction of Python makes it a really nice and fancy tool for spatio-temporal data visualization (at the expense of computational time but whatever). I leveraged folium, selenium, chromedriver, brew, ffmpeg, and most importantly, part of the building blocks from Vincent\u2019s code to make this happen.", "If you are interested in Python or programming in general, the following articles might be helpful:", "Once again, a shout-out to Vincent Lonij and Dhrumil Patel for their demonstration of relevant works.", "This work was based on my Master\u2019s thesis regarding the optimization of station-based bike sharing systems.
