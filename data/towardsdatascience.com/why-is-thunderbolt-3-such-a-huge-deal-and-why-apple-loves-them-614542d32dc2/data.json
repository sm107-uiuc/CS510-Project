So much so that Apple decided to make it every single port on newer MacBooks (2016+) up until recently. Other laptop manufacturers advertise it as an absolute premium on laptops, sometimes charging hundreds of dollars more for this premium slot. Many people at the time were frustrated with Apple\u2019s abrupt switch, but have we ever asked why they made this change and never looked back?", "The first laptop I bought with a Thunderbolt 3 was a Dell XPS 15, the 2016 model, one of the first that offered this new technology. However, to my surprise, this was not actually a Thunderbolt 3, which supports speeds up to 40 Gbps (Or 4x USB 3.1s), it was a Thunderbolt 2 dressed up as being forwards compatible with Thunderbolt 3 protocols, meaning it only supported up to 20 Gbps.", "Dell did not acknowledge this until heavily questioned on the topic (and did not fix this until recent models), and \u2014 quite frankly \u2014 I did not initially even notice the difference. That was until I invested in an eGPU. An external GPU, or eGPU, is a separate enclosure that connects to your laptop via Thunderbolt to provide the laptop access to higher graphics capabilities. If you are curious, I wrote this article on exactly how to use an eGPU.", "I had an important question, however. What is the drop off between having an internal graphics card and utilizing one over a Thunderbolt connection? Turns out, the internet does not really know, I saw articles that said the difference might be 15%, but nobody had actual tests to prove this, and so I decided to create one myself.", "In order to test the bottleneck the Thunderbolt causes, I bought an external GPU with an Nvidia GTX 1080. I then ran a set of deep learning models provided by AI Benchmark, once on my old laptop (Thunderbolt \u201c2\u201d), once with my new laptop, a Gigabyte Aero 15, which contains a genuine Thunderbolt 3, and compared this to the test speeds AI benchmark compiled (which I verified as accurate by testing other GPUs). AI benchmark provides a speed test on these models, as well as a general AI score in order to decide how much better one GPU may be over the next. After running all of these tests, I compiled and charted the results.", "Do you see where the bottleneck is? I think these two pictures tell a very clear story. This taught me two things \u2014 how incredibly fast a Thunderbolt 3 port is, and how completely inadequate Thunderbolt 2 ports (and by extension, USBs are) for bandwidth-intensive connections. The Thunderbolt 3 versus utilizing a direct PCIe connection to the motherboard only saw a dropoff of LESS THAN 5%. That is incredible and far exceeded my expectations. This means that a Thunderbolt 3 is more than capable of supporting an external GPU. The bad news, especially for those who may not have a Thunderbolt 3, is the dropoff is steep. Utilizing a 20 Gbps connection saw a whopping 37% speed degradation. That means the 20 Gbps standard supported by Thunderbolt 2 is nowhere near fast enough to support a video card, and should probably be enough to dissuade from the advantages of purchasing an external GPU.", "This begs the question of where else the Thunderbolt 3 shows a vast improvement. To test this, I looked at external monitor support. I purchased on Amazon, a Thunderbolt 3 to 2x HDMI cable adapter. I then tested this on the Thunderbolt \u201c2\u201d, by pushing to 2x 1080p 60hz monitors, a reasonably simple task. To no surprise, the adapter supported the first monitor flawlessly. However, The second monitor did not display in full color and appeared washed. When the experiment was repeated using a Thunderbolt 3, both monitors were supported flawlessly. (note \u2014 this will not work on Macs as they are software locked to 1 screen, I tried).", "So why did Apple and other premium laptop brands decide to take the leap of faith into Thunderbolt 3? Because the bandwidth supported by just a single port far exceeds anything developed prior, and it truly makes any other port feel like a legacy port, especially now that 4K+ screens and RTX 3000 series graphics will soon become the new norm.", "Did you enjoy this article? I realize that the Thunderbolt 3 port is nothing new, but I hope I provided some answers to questions that have been seldom addressed before. If you enjoyed it, please follow and check out my other articles like this one where I compare my eGPU to Google Colab.", "Your home for data science.
