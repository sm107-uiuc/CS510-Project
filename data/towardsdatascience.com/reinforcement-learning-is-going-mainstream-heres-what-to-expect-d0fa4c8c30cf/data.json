Many people may think that the star of the show was Robert Downey Jr, but in my mind it\u2019s Simulation & Reinforcement Learning, which showed up in nearly every keynote speech at the conference:", "Day 1: Using Reinforcement Learning, Boston Dynamics robots have learned to do backflips, jump up onto ledges and lift data. Disney Imagineering has taken this to the next level with humanoid robots performing death-defying stunts.", "Day 2: Amazon uses simulation to train models on difficult scenarios in their Go Stores. Amazon fulfillment center robots are trained to sort packages using Reinforcement Learning. Alexa uses simulated interactions to automatically learn the flow of conversations. Amazon Drone delivery uses simulated data to train the model for detecting people below the drone. Companies like Insitro have started to use RL to solve biomedicine problems by generating bio-interaction data.", "Day 3: Andrew Ng calls out Meta Learning, where 100s of different simulators are used to build more generalizable Reinforcement Learning agents, as a \u201cnext big thing\u201d in AI. Self driving car companies Zoox and Aurora use RL & meta-leraning to address the complexities of driving in urban environments. DexNet is attempting to build a massive dataset of 3D models by to help with grasping problems using simulations. Jeff Bezos agrees with Daphne Koller that RL bioengineering will huge in 10 years.", "If the tasks in a field can be accurately simulated, Reinforcement Learning will dramatically improve the state of the art in that field over the next few years.", "If you read my earlier posts, you\u2019ll know that my first daughter is four years old. This puts her firmly into the \u201cWhy\u201d stage of life, where her brain shifts from simply learning tasks to wanting to understand everything about the world. Being the huge nerd that I am, I\u2019ve always joked that I\u2019ll be happy to take her all the way down the rabbit hole to physics every time she asks \u201cwhy\u201d. As it turns out, my parents were wrong, and there is a point where even a four-year-old gets bored asking \u201cwhy?\u201d and move on to something more interesting like coloring or pretending to read a book. Here is a typical exchange:", "I recently watched Jeff Dean\u2019s talk on the state of deep learning from this year\u2019s Google I/O conference. He mentioned that neural networks had been trained to approximate the results of physics simulators and come to results 300,000x faster, with the potential for researchers to test 100M molecules over lunch.", "This is a huge advancement, as it should allow us to use the same reinforcement learning techniques that were the star of the show at re:MARS to address a huge new range of problems. Prior to these advancements, the cycle time of running a full physics simulator for each potential reward would simply take too long for RL to ever reach a reward state. Now, RL should be able to learn the physical properties of molecules that will optimize the intended properties for chemical engineers.", "Given that everything can be reduced to physics, I am starting to imagine a world where it will be possible to build many more solutions from first principles. Going into the conference I had assumed that Biology was out of reach for simulations for years, but I just learned that there are already companies like Insitro starting to tackle this problem today.", "Other recent developments should only serve to accelerate us to the future state where RL can be used in \u201chigher level\u201d sciences like psychology:", "First off, you should go learn about Reinforcement Learning: There are many great tutorials and courses that can teach you the intuition and inner workings of RL, so we\u2019ll keep it brief here: RL agents get an interpreted sate of their environment, choose an action that affects the environment, observe new environmental state, and repeat the process. If that action leads to a positive outcome, the agent is given a reward, and is more likely to choose the same set of actions given similar states in the future.", "This is repeated for many episodes, and eventually, the agent becomes very good at getting rewards (and therefore at the task we were training it for). One of the best ways to supplement this experience with something hands-on is to use the AWS Deep Racer, which is a scaled down race-car that provides a simulated environment, a RL training setup, and a physical piece of hardware corresponding to the simulation. You simply play with the reward function to train your racer agent. From there you can", "Second, you should start actively searching ways to simulate systems in your business that could be optimized. Any existing simulators are an excellent place to start, but new simulators will likely be hugely impactful. Again AWS has a service called RoboMaker in this area, but there are many alternatives, most of which are based on Open API Gym. If you want to get an environment setup you can use Coach from Intel. It ties together agents, networks and memory and lets you choose between dozens of different pre-configured agents that are optimized for various tasks, and then connect them easily to OpenAI Gym environments.", "Finally, you should be on the lookout for new companies that are riding this technology wave. I expect that there will eventually be a series of open-source simulators developed to build upon each-other, with deep neural networks used to compress the key information that can be learned at each layer. Before that there will likely be proprietary solutions that leapfrog the state of the art in many fields. Over Time, this will unlock massive gains in scientifically based fields such as pharmaceuticals, material science, medicine, downstream oil & gas, and many others.", "If you\u2019re interested in getting up to speed, my colleague Ryan Keiper did a talk on the details of how he came up to speed on Reinforcement Learning to build a chess-playing agent.", "Your home for data science.
