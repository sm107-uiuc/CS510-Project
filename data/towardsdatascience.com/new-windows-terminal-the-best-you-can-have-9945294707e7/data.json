But myth and reality have a tendency to exchange ideas. Thus, once every so often a new kind emerges to rule them all.", "In my humble opinion, Terminator is a god-sent gift, which was my driver until recently. It offers everything you could ask from a terminal emulator, without the glitches of Cmder or Hyper. But myth and reality have a tendency to exchange ideas, thus, every so often a new king emerges to rule them all.", "This time, the king came out of nowhere, and it is the new Microsoft Windows Terminal. What I mean is, who would expect that Microsoft would develop a new terminal emulator, that combines anything you want a command-line tool to do, is open-source and highly customizable? In this story, we take a dive into the new Microsoft terminal, get acquainted with its features and see how we can customize it.", "Learning Rate is my weekly newsletter for those who are curious about the world of AI and MLOps.

It combines many command-line tools and shells such as Command Prompt, PowerShell and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Thus, in one application we can have Command Prompt and Powershell for Windows users, as well as bash for Linux terminal power users.", "The key features of the Windows Terminal include multiple tabs, where different command-line tools live, split areas, Unicode and UTF-8 character support, GPU-accelerated text rendering engine, and an easy way to change between themes and configuration options. Windows Terminal is an open-source project, which will continue to expand its features leveraging a growing community of contributors.", "Installation couldn\u2019t be more straightforward; just head to Microsoft Store and install the application. Windows Terminal will also continue to receive automatic updates through the store; thus, you will always have the latest stable version.", "The new Windows Terminal does not replace PowerShell or Command Prompt. They are both there, and you can use it as separate consoles. But it combines them in a new neat interface. You can also run other terminals as well as we will see, so, let us take a look at the key features.", "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows; the huge announcement back at //Build 2016 by Microsoft. Since then, we have come a long way. WSL 2 is now in GA, and a full Linux Kernel is running inside Windows 10.", "Thus, as an example, we will customize the Ubuntu Terminal running inside the new Windows Terminal. But first, if you need installation instructions and why you should do that, head over to the article below:", "Having this set and ready, it is effortless to make it look like the standard Ubuntu Terminal. Head over to Windows Terminal Themes and search for the Ubuntu theme.", "When you press the Get theme button, a configuration object is added to your clipboard. This object will look something like this:", "These are instructions for what each colour should look like in your terminal. Now, open the terminal settings and paste this object into an array called schemes. You will see that this object has a name: Ubuntu. Copy and paste that name in the object that specifies the Ubuntu terminal inside the list of profiles. Thus, this object should now look like the one below:", "As an added bonus, I have set acrylicOpacity and useActylic options to 0.75 and true accordingly. This sets a nice opacity to the window. Moreover, to use the Ubuntu terminal as the default terminal whenever you launch the application copy the guid code inside the defaultProfile at the beginning of the settings:", "And that\u2019s it. Now you have Ubuntu running inside Windows 10, with a beautiful terminal application that makes you feel at home!", "In this story, we looked at the new Windows Terminal, what it is, how to get it, what are its key features and how to make it follow your own style. There are many more options that you can set: background images, key bindings, custom prompts, etc. To fiddle with these options and much more head over to the official documentation, or star great GitHub repositories like this.", "Learning Rate is my weekly newsletter for those who are curious about the world of AI and MLOps.
