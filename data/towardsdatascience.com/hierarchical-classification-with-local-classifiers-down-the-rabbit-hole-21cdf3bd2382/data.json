As data scientists, we\u2019re already used to flattening it out, ignoring that natural taxonomy of the data so we could easily feed it to our machine learning models. But there is, they say, another way. One that preserves that precious information hiding within the hierarchy. One that could help us design our classification models to be more (artificially) intelligent, and better capture the unique distinctiveness of each predicted class.", "There are a few standard approaches when designing a hierarchical classification model. Here, we\u2019ll focus on one of them: building an ensemble model comprised of hierarchically-structured local classifiers. That approach could be implemented in different ways, each with its own assets and drawbacks. In the next 1,000 or so words, I\u2019ll cover the pros and cons of each local-classifier structure, the unique challenges it might present, and which problems it\u2019s most suitable for.", "In other words, this post is all about which local-classifier structure you should choose for your very own hierarchical classification project. Curious? Great. Let\u2019s get to it, then.", "Grasping the ins and outs of hierarchical classifiers does require some background knowledge. I will do my best to make this post as self-explanatory and understandable as possible. However, if you find yourself struggling with the core concepts of data taxonomy and hierarchical classification, you should go ahead and read about it \u2014 trust me, it\u2019s a page-turner.", "Throughout this post, I\u2019ll be giving examples based on this taxonomy of common house pets:", "Oh, hierarchically-structured local classifiers. Those clever ensemble models built with a hierarchy of smaller classifiers, thereby capturing the essence of hierarchical classification in a simple yet captivating way. Such charmers, am I right?", "If you\u2019re reading this, you might have also fallen for their undeniable appeal, which means you\u2019re now facing a difficult question: which of the available structures should you choose?", "Worry not \u2014 you\u2019ve come to the right place. Let\u2019s take a look at our happy bunch of options.", "A kind reminder - the three contestants are:", "This one is where you have a binary classifier for each node (e.g.: an individual classifier for each of \u201cCat\u201d, \u201cDog\u201d, \u201cUnicorn\u201d, \u201cSiamese\u201d, \u201cPersian\u201d, and so on; in our house pets example, we\u2019ll have a total of 13 binary classifiers). It is also the one most used in the literature, which makes it a real belle of the ball. So, what pros and cons should you consider?", "This is the one where each parent node (e.g., \u201cDog\u201d) gets one multi-class classifier (e.g.: one determining the breed of the dog).", "This is the one with one multi-class classifier for each level of the taxonomy. With our example, that would mean one classifier distinguishing between cat, dog and unicorn, and then another with all of the leaf-node classes: the specific dog, cat and unicorn breeds.", "This approach is the least used in literature. Moreover, it is mostly used as a baseline comparison method. Let\u2019s see why:", "I admit, I was biased from the start. LCL was never my favorite, and I had my doubts about LCN, as well. But that last one came through \u2014 if you\u2019ve got a multi-label problem, it\u2019s the natural choice. It might be a bit bulkier, but it makes up for it with that elegant ease by which it gives multiple labels (never thought you could have a Persian cat that\u2019s also a poodle, did you?).", "If it\u2019s a single-label problem, though, I\u2019d go with the LCPN approach. It\u2019s intuitive, not too bulky, and it does what it needs to do. Its inconsistency problem is also very easily solvable \u2014 and that solution is pretty intuitive, too.", "If you\u2019ve made it this far, you should already have an idea as to which local-classifier structure is the best fit for your project.", "There are still a few kinks to work out, though: how to handle inconsistencies and error propagation, what way you should define your positive and negative training examples, and even how one could attempt to measure such an oddly structured model. Those shall all be answered in my next posts \u2014 stay tuned.", "As always, I welcome questions, feedback and special requests \u2014 do feel free to share those in the comment section.
