The consensus is that the indicator can be used as a dynamic support/resistance level and that it can determine if a market is bullish or bearish. We will analytically confirm or deny if the asset or instrument reacts to this level or not.", "While more thorough and detailed research is usually conducted, the basic flow remains the same as the one described here so it will be helpful to people who want to understand a simple way to simulate trading strategies and ideas. I will use Python and daily data to make the article easier to follow, but the methodology described here can be applied to any language and any other timeframe.", "The moving average has a sound and logical motivation and it constitutes the basic item to build mean reversion strategies. Trading strategies can be built using diverse methodologies and reasonings (you can do even opposite things like buying the breakout \u2014 as they constitute the beginning of an initiation movement \u2014 or selling the breakout \u2014 as it is said that most of them are failed ones \u2014 ) and both will be valid depending on the conditions, but no matter which strategy you are building, almost all of them can be classified as either momentum or mean reversion.", "Momentum strategies operate the inertial trends and outbursts of the markets, the basic concept is that a trend tends to continue, sometimes fueled by the contrarians, others by the strength of the initiation movements made by large players who will keep the price going up (conversely down). Mean reversion strategies operate the fact that extreme price movements are followed by corrections and that, overall, the price of an asset or instrument tends to move towards its average mean. Said that it can be more easily understood that the moving average has the \u201dmagical\u201d property of acting as dynamic support and/or resistance, as it is a quantifiable figure to determine when an asset has reached its average point. Hence, the common conception that during trends price tend to react on this mean averages which, somehow, seems to be true.", "There are also strategies based exclusively on moving averages. Those strategies do not have a good reputation among seasoned traders but I have personally seen them working pretty well for some traders who had specialised in these kinds of systems. The problem with the moving average strategies is that it is tempting to implement them mechanically without a proper contextualization and some market regime reading. Additionally, like any highly mechanical strategy, you need to withstand large drawdowns.", "Mean reversion strategies can also have devastating effects when market regimes are strongly bearish (or strongly bullish) as you might face a point where all your entries are lost because the momentum is so powerful than mean reversion is systematically overrun. Understanding the nature of the strategy, reading correctly the market regime and having a sound understanding on the long-term strategy statistics (drawdowns, consecutive loses, etc.) is required to be profitable in this business; mean reversion is not an exception to this rule.", "Some people use also the 200-periods daily moving average as a simple indicator of the overall trend of the market. So it is often said that a market is considered bearish when the asset/instrument is trading below it and that the market is bullish when it trades above it. In that sense, the 200-periods daily moving average is being used as a market gauge or as a filter to rule out buy or sell trades. If the price is above the 200-periods moving average we can continue buying, if it is below, we shall either not buy or sell instead.", "The first step is to define the simulation conditions. In this case, I will analyse how assets from the S&P500 index react to 200-periods daily moving average. There are different routes to test this. One option is to directly use CME ES E-Mini S&P500 futures contracts; another one is to analyse the SPY ETF which tracks S&P500 and the last one to analyse the individual assets that conform the S&P500.", "To make the article easier to read and follow, we will use the ETF approach. Using the individual assets is possible but requires slightly higher effort and CME futures data is usually more expensive. Using the SPDR S&P 500 trust, commonly known by its NYSE Arca ticker (SPY), seems like a good approach for an introductory article.", "The SPY is widely traded by Hedge Funds all around the world, therefore by using it, we are getting a tradeable asset which accurately reflects the S&P500 US Equity index. An additional and relevant advantage of using the SPY is that we do not have to deal with settlement dates as in future contracts.", "Polygon.io has direct access to all major exchanges in the US and it provides both real-time (via WebSockets) and historical (using API Rest) market data. For Python there is a ready to use access client in GIT which can be installed in your Python distribution using pip:", "The supplied Python client simplifies access to the data and enables us to focus on developing the strategy.", "First, I will check which asset we would like to work on, in our case, as discussed, we will analyse the S&P500 SPDR ETF.", "The API is properly documented in polygon.io, but the client is not. However, source code is extremely simple to check as there is a one to one correspondence between the API methods and the client so in case you miss which method of the client object shall be invoked you can look it up directly in git.", "For example, if you want to retrieve historical daily prices of the SPY \u2014 as we intend in this example \u2014 we would look up in the API documentation to find that the REST method we need to use is Aggregates.", "The REST method provides the capability to retrieve aggregated (including daily) data for a given range of time. We will perform the analysis using the last 20 years of data which is the maximum historical period that can be retrieved.", "The client method to invoke is:", "Therefore our first Jupyter cell would be:", "Notice that we are getting our data adjusted for splits, something quite useful for stocks.", "The timestamps returned seem to be by default in Easter Time, which is what normally you get by data feed providers.", "Always plan and double-check your timestamps and timezones. Time zones are always prone to be troublesome and you need to ensure that no mistakes are being done. The simplest solution I have found so far is to always use Eastern Time for simulation \u2014 even for other time zones such as Chicago and Frankfurt instruments \u2014 .", "Use Eastern Time for both the source data and for the local time zone of the computer. This rule generates no issues for traditional market assets as daylight time savings take place on the night from Saturday to Sunday \u2014 market closed \u2014 , hence you can just use Eastern Time and forget about both timezones and daylight saving. For 24x7 trading crypto instruments, it would probably be better to use GMT.", "Therefore, we check that the first timestamp returned is (notice that we have requested data since 1980 \u2014 which in plain English means: give me everything you have \u2014 ):", "This means that we are receiving data in Eastern Time for the first day when data is available for the ETF SPY: January 29th, 1993. The SPY began trading on January 22nd, 1993 so it seems that we are getting everything we need and we can further proceed.", "To allow fast processing of the data we will convert the data into a NumPy array. We will:", "NumPy is used for three reasons:", "The three reasons can be resumed in one benefit: reducing the amount of time you need to simulate. This is not relevant for this example but it is for large parametric intraday simulations.", "The next step is to populate a simple moving average for the whole dataset. We will use some of the facilities that NumPy provides moving the inner operation (working out the summation of the close prices) into NumPy vector operations. I am in doubt if the outer loop could be avoided or not, but in this case, is irrelevant as it is less than 5000 iterations. A moving average could be also be implemented using some auxiliary libraries built around NumPy, which likely would improve performance, but just to keep both code and explanations as simple as possible we will use just a for loop.", "With this last step, I have prepared a dataset containing all the information that is needed to perform the analysis.", "The exact hypothesis to be tested is:", "To evaluate if the price rebounded we will check if the price for the next days is higher or lower. If the so-called rebound exists, there shall be a bullish trend for the next days after the moving average has been crossed. I will also analyse prices which are close to the SMA but do not touch it.", "This criterion is somehow a bit arbitrary, and of course, several other analysis could (and shall) be performed. But as the starting point is as good as any other. The idea is to keep the analysis simple to show how the process is done:", "In this case, I will generate a NumPy array of type bool \u2014 corresponds with type bool in the underlying C library \u2014 . This array contains the conditions to analyse and measure the hypothesis.", "A Pandas data frame could have been used (and it is normally used for larger strategies which require different data types). In other languages, the approach will be slightly different (in C I use linked lists of structs) but the pattern of adding columns with conditions and intermediate results to a dataset is the same.", "The first test will evaluate prices crossing the SMA200. Two different scenarios will be evaluated: price closes above the moving average and price closes below the moving average.", "The NumPy array is filled in with three columns, the first one contains True if the previous day price was above the SMA200. The second column stores True when the price low is below the SMA200 but the close price is above it. The third column stores True when the close price is below the SMA200. The three columns are generated independently. The conditions will be merged later using NumPy selectors to analyse the specific scenarios.", "In this case, a separate NumPy array is defined for conditions/results, but having a single Pandas Dataframe integrating both data and simulation results is also possible. In that case, extra columns are added to the simulation data.", "The first thing that can be noticed is that daily crossing of the SMA200 (when the previous day was above the SMA200) is not that common. Since 1993 it has happened only 98 times. So it happens three times per year.", "The second thing that can be noticed is that when price closes below the SMA the next day price direction is highly uncertain (46% vs 53%) so this will not provide any statistical edge.", "The third thing that can be noticed is that when price closes above the SMA, the next day tends to be bearish and not bullish, hence we are not noticing any rebound, at least for the next day after the moving average has been crossed. The consensus \u2014 and mantra \u2014 of the SMA200 working as dynamic support is, for this specific definition of rebound, not actually true. 64% versus 36% is actually a statistical edge and, in my opinion, must be taken into consideration.", "Here we might be interested in further testing with different rebound definitions. For example, we might want to analyse if next day opens higher than the close of the day when the moving average is crossed (so we can buy/sell the opening gap). This implies just changing the condition to:", "If that criterion is tested we get the following results:", "With these criteria, we have no clue on what the price will do the next day when price closed above the SMA. For the scenario when price closed below the SMA we can identify a statistical edge: the price tends to open higher.", "With these results, the very next day after the daily SMA200 has been crossed but the price has closed above it, I would definitively not look for long positions, which is against the consensus.", "We can also evaluate if the highest price for the next day is higher than the highest price for the day when the moving average has been crossed. These are the results:", "Again, no conclusive evidence (52% vs 47%) for prices closing above the SMA and a statistical edge (84% vs 15%) on price not exceeding the previous day high for prices closing below the SMA. The latest being a good scenario for a short position if the price reaches the maximum of the previous day. However, it is worth to notice that the current session low and high prices are not actionable because we do not know them in advance.", "It is important to always double-check every result to ensure that the model is accurately representing our trading hypothesis. Additional points such as the number of occurrences of the event \u2014 to get statistically valid results \u2014 , which statistical values do we get and how the model is defined are relevant to find an edge that can be actionable. Other aspects \u2014 not covered in this article \u2014 such as MAE, profit/loss ratios or parameter sensitivity shall be also covered.", "As results are not confirming the hypothesis, we shall question the model used to define rebound. Having a look at a daily chart of the S&P500 with a SMA200 might help:", "It seems clear that the SMA200 acts as a dynamic support/resistance. But if the chart is analysed in detail:", "Having seen the chart, we could define rebound as the next day\u2019s low is higher than the low of the day when price crosses the average. If such condition is analysed:", "With this new model when price closes above the average, 62% vs 37% of the times the next day\u2019s lowest price is higher than the lowest price of the day when the SMA has been crossed.", "On the contrary, when price closes below the SMA, 64% versus 35% of the times the next day\u2019s low will be even lower.", "While this matches the hypothesis and the idea of the moving average acting as a dynamic support it is important to understand that this new definition does not define a tradeable action, as we never know the low/high prices in advance (we do know the open/close, as we can always buy/sell the open or the close during the last or first minutes and we will be \u2014 on average \u2014close to the open/close prices).", "The idea I want to highlight here is that while everything begins with a basic and simplified model, iterations are usually needed. This needs to be done until something congruent with our experience and actionable is found or until the idea is discarded.", "More complex models can (and probably shall) be defined for this particular case. For example, thresholds and ranges around the moving average could be defined. Penetration ranges below the moving average and rebound ranges above the moving average could be also defined. By doing that, a potentially more accurate model might be simulated. Having ranges and values also allows doing parametric simulations to find tradeable strategies.", "Following the same procedure but inverting the signs, the SMA200 could be analysed as a resistance. For that case, we get the following results:", "Which could be analysed in a similar way as the previous ones.", "The second analysis evaluates if SMA200 can give us some information about the market overall trend and if it can be used as a filter to rule out buy or sell trades.", "Again an initial, actionable and measurable model needs to be defined. To keep it simple we analyse the impact of the price closing below the SMA200 and evaluate if that generates a lower price one week and one month later. The analysis is exactly the same but this time we create two additional columns which test the price 7 and 30 days after. The condition analysed is low prices of both current and one week/one month ahead prices.", "The scenario where the daily price closes above the SMA200 is even more bullish in the long term. 43 times versus 16 times the price was higher than when the SMA200 was crossed.", "When the SMA200 is crossed and price closes below it the scenario is still bullish in the long term but with less intensity. A potential outcome would be that when price crosses and closes below the SMA200 a bearish scenario is more likely.", "It is important to understand that every result must be questioned. Following our example, it is worth to mention that our last result \u201cproved\u201d that the 200 periods SMA worked as a dynamic support. This bias was more clear when the price closed above the SMA, but it was also present in the event of the price closing below the SMA (23 times the price is higher one month later versus 15 times the price is lower).", "Does this mean that the 200 SMA moving average works as dynamic support? Theoretically yes, but it is important to contextualize that we have analysed a largely bullish index (S&P500). Daily charts do not allow to have that many cases and extensive analysis, because even taking so many years as in this example, the dataset is not large. Market regimes are relevant, for intraday strategies you might want to focus both on bearish periods as in bullish periods. That will help you to understand how a given analysis or strategy behaves under different conditions.", "Another option \u2014 for this particular analysis \u2014 would be to run the same analysis for not so bullish indexes, such as Frankfurt\u2019s DAX or Sydney \u2018s ASX. The important takeaway, in any case, is that every result must be further questioned, especially when we do not deal with a large dataset or when the dataset tends to be biased (such as the case of S&P500 that has been strongly bullish during the analysed period).", "The analysis presented here is very simple and focused on introducing the general workflow on how quantitative analysis can be conducted in Python. In a real-life analysis aspects such as futher model definition, risk and parametric analysis would need to be covered in detail.", "Consultant, retail trader & lifelong learner | Linkedin
