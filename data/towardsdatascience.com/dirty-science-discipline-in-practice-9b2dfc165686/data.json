Sure, the junkyard might have a valuable antique in it and you might even stumble upon it. Then again, you might just spend the afternoon sorting trash. On the other hand, if you have a specific problem that can be solved with a variety of parts and you know what to look for, it could be worth sifting through the junk. The difference is having a clear objective so it\u2019s easy to accept/reject many items rather than assess the value of each.", "If you\u2019re in an organization that collects all possible data, you\u2019re not going to be like a scientist running experiments in a clean, white lab coat. You\u2019re going to be sorting trash, looking for parts, and (hopefully) assembling them into something useful. While you\u2019re not a pure scientist, the scientific method will help you with this process. If you\u2019re not willing to get your hands dirty though, cut your salary expectations in half and apply for some research grants.", "Carl Sagan wrote, \u201cfor me, it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.\u201d Too often, I see data scientists and analysts unintentionally acting as propaganda machines, weaving stories with data that unconsciously proliferate confirmation and hindsight bias. Claiming to be \u201cdata-driven\u201d is easy in a world full of data, but the reality is that without discipline, it often leads people to believe that a steaming pile of garbage is a hot, nutritious meal.", "Science aims to explain and understand the natural world. A major part of the process is obtaining accurate measurements and analyzing them to draw conclusions. When data is collected and analyzed in this fashion, it is incredibly powerful. Organizations that want to be data-driven should really be striving to use more evidence-based practices. The emphasis here is on striving because the standards of science are often unattainable outside of the lab and true randomized control trials.", "Without context and methodology, data is not evidence, it\u2019s just raw information that may or may not be useful. Our challenge as data scientists, is to apply the scientific method approximately by establishing context without creating unnecessary friction. This is a tough balance to strike, and you can\u2019t make everyone happy, but that\u2019s not the job. The job is to use data to explain and understand the world around you.", "This is hard enough so don\u2019t rediscover the scientific method through personal failure. Be disciplined and trust the 500 year old process. I try to remember that this is a dirty kind of science that\u2019s never going to be perfectly clean. So rather than hold a standard that might actually get me fired for slowing everything down, I think of it like sweeping the floors so other work can get done. Pushing the broom is following the steps of the scientific method.", "Always begin with curiosity. Identify an unknown that\u2019s motivating for your organization like why certain customers make repeat purchases. This can also be more specific like how might we design a better signup experience or develop an app to motivate healthy habits. The key to this step is clearly identifying the unknown and documenting it. This will provide direction and motivation for the rest of the process. We\u2019re all curious by nature so lean into it.", "Next, formulate a clear hypothesis. This is equivalent to declaring an explanation for the unknown identified in the previous step. The hypothesis should be written in the form of a statement like \u201csimplifying the signup process will improve conversion.\u201d When writing the hypothesis, keep an eye on the next step to help tighten it up. For example, \u201cthe signup process is too complicated\u201d doesn\u2019t lead to an obvious prediction while \u201csimplifying the signup process will improve conversion\u201d does.", "A good hypothesis is falsifiable, which means evidence can disprove or falsify it. The statement \u201can alien spaceship crashed in Roswell\u201d is not falsifiable because if it isn\u2019t true, there will only be an absence of evidence. However, \u201cno spaceships have ever landed in Roswell\u201d is falsifiable. Find a single spaceship and the statement is disproven. Too many organizations hold non-falsifiable beliefs like \u201cpeople are loyal to our brand.\u201d Pushing these kinds of beliefs is like using candy to calm a child with bad behavior. Don\u2019t take the easy way out. Be a scientist.", "Armed with a clear hypothesis, it\u2019s time to put the chips on the table and make a prediction. Take the logical consequences of the hypothesis and commit to an outcome that can be supported with evidence. For example, \u201cif we simplify the signup experience, conversion will increase by at least 1%\u201d is a prediction that could actually be tested. Predictions often map to multiple hypotheses or explanations so it\u2019s important to be specific and link it closely to the primary investigation.", "In practice, the predictions we want to make are often not feasible to test properly or they might pose a political challenge. This is where discipline is critical. Write down predictions as if anything is possible and then assess the feasibility of testing. Not taking this step is a slippery slope because it quickly leads to avoiding predictions altogether. The overwhelming majority of the predictions I make are impossible to test due to lack of time, resources or my inability to bend the laws of physics. Nonetheless, I don\u2019t limit my imagination and write things down.", "Now it\u2019s time to commit some time and effort to conducting an experiment. This is the gold standard for acquiring knowledge and doing it properly isn\u2019t trivial. For example, testing the impact of a simpler signup experience requires designing the new experience, deploying it in parallel with the current one, randomly assigning new users to different groups, and tracking metrics within each. This comes with hard development costs as well as the opportunity cost of the other things you passed on.", "Sometimes, these tests can be as simple as changing a button color or font, but in my opinion, there\u2019s not much knowledge to be gained there. Quick A/B tests like that are great for fine-tuning, but they don\u2019t give us much in terms of explaining or understanding our world. Meaningful discoveries have substantial cost and risk. We have to spend resources to acquire knowledge and risk being wrong about our hypotheses. Science is hard and this is usually where outside pressure poisons the process.", "On the other hand, not everything is science for us. It would be crazy to put every idea through a rigorous experimentation process. Sometimes, it\u2019s just better to simplify the signup experience and ship it with confidence because it\u2019s the reasonable thing to do. The competition moves quickly and being able to discern the value of new knowledge relative to the cost of acquiring it is a seriously advanced skill.", "Finally, data! If you did the hard work of defining a clear hypothesis, making a falsifiable prediction, and running a clean experiment, then this should be as straightforward as comparing two group statistics and sharing the results. In that case, the challenge is usually sorting out ambiguity and communicating statistical concepts to non-technical people. This is a great place for young data scientists and analysts to cut their teeth in the business world. More often than not though, it\u2019s not this clean.", "Things get dirty as you lose the important components of a randomized control trial. Maybe you can\u2019t randomize the group assignment or are unable to create experimental groups altogether. You might be forced to analyze time-series data or hunt for a natural experiment to detect the desired effect. In any case, the analysis should always come after a prediction has been made. If you can\u2019t run an experiment, make a hard commitment to what evidence will look like BEFORE you look for it and be extremely clear about the concessions you made.", "Statisticians often take pride in developing more and more sophisticated methods to deal with messy situations like these. This is a race to the bottom if I\u2019ve ever seen one. Sometimes, the data just isn\u2019t there and an inaccurate conclusion is worse than no conclusion at all. At least \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d is honest and leaves the problem open for further investigation. The further you get from a clean, properly randomized experiment for testing a prediction, the more uncomfortable you should be. That said, don\u2019t be afraid to get your hands dirty and try. Just be honest and protect your integrity by documenting the necessary concessions.", "I often hear very smart, well-intending people say things like \u201canything is better than nothing\u201d when it\u2019s not possible to follow the scientific method rigorously. I tend to agree with the sentiment, but would use for more careful language: \u201cmore accuracy is preferred but not always attainable.\u201d Would you rather have no ruler or a randomly inaccurate ruler? With no ruler, I have a well-posed problem: find a good ruler. With a flawed ruler, I might end up creating much bigger problems without realizing it.", "The goal of science is to explain and understand the world. The scientific method provides clear steps for identifying and acquiring the knowledge necessary to do this. Applying it in various contexts requires discipline and perspective. For us, science is a process that\u2019s mostly, but not always, useful and being able to tell the difference is a unique challenge. Data science is a dirty science.
