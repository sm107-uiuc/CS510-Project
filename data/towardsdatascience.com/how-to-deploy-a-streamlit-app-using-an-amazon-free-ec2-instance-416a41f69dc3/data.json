I still get confused in all that HTML, CSS, and Javascript with all the hit and trials, for something seemingly simple to do.", "Not to mention the many ways to do the same thing, making it confusing for us data science folks for whom web development is a secondary skill.", "This is where StreamLit comes in and delivers on its promise to create web apps just using Python.", "In my last post on Streamlit, I talked about how to write Web apps using simple Python for Data Scientists.", "But still, a major complaint, if you would check out the comment section of that post, was regarding the inability to deploy Streamlit apps over the web.", "And it was a valid complaint.", "A developer can\u2019t show up with his laptop every time the client wanted to use the app. What is the use of such an app?", "So in this post, we will go one step further deploy our Streamlit app over the Web using an Amazon Free ec2 instance.", "Before we start with using the amazon ec2 instance, we need to set one up. You might need to sign up with your email ID and set up the payment information on the AWS website. Works just like a simple sign-on. From here, I will assume that you have an AWS account and so I am going to explain the next essential parts so you can follow through.", "Whoa, that was a handful. After all the above steps you should be able to see the ubuntu prompt for the virtual machine. We will need to set up this machine to run our app. I am going to be using the same streamlit_football_demo app that I used in my previous post.", "We start by installing miniconda and adding its path to the environment variable.", "We then install additional dependencies for our app to run. That means I install streamlit and plotly_express.", "And our machine is now prepped and ready to run.", "As I am set up with the instance, I can get the code for my demo app from Github. Or you can choose to create or copy another app as you wish.", "Now you can go to a browser and type the external URL to access your app. In my case the address is http://35.167.158.251:8501.

But whenever you are going to close the SSH terminal window the process will stop and so will your app.", "TMUX to the rescue. TMUX allows us to keep running our sessions even after we leave the terminal window. It also helps with a lot of other things but I will just go through the steps we need.", "First, we stop our app using Ctrl+C and install tmux", "We start a new tmux session using the below command. We keep the name of our session as StreamSession. You could use any name here.", "You can see that the session name is \u201cStreamSession\u201d at the bottom of the screen. You can now start running streamlit in the tmux session.", "You will be able to see your app at the External URL. The next step is to detach our TMUX session so that it continues running in the background when you leave the SSH shell. To do this just press Ctrl+B and then D (Don\u2019t press Ctrl when pressing D)", "You can now close your SSH session and the app will continue running at the External URL.", "And Voila! We are up and running.", "Pro TMUX Tip: You can reattach to the same session by using the attach command below. The best part is that you can close your SSH shell and then maybe come back after some hours and reattach to a session and keep working from wherever you were when you closed the SSH shell.", "If your app is not hosting at 8501, it means that an instance of streamlit app is already running on your system and you will need to stop that. You can do so by first finding the process ID", "You will need to kill this process. You can do this simply by", "Streamlit has democratized the whole process to create apps, and I couldn\u2019t recommend it more. If you want to learn more about how to create awesome web apps with Streamlit then read up my last post.", "In this post, we deployed a simple web app on AWS using amazon ec2.", "In the process of doing this, we created our own Amazon ec2 instance, logged into the SSH shell, installed miniconda and dependencies, ran our Streamlit application and learned about TMUX. Enough learning for a day?", "So go and show on these Mad skills. To end on a lighter note, as Sten Sootla says in his satire piece which I thoroughly enjoyed:", "The secret: it\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s what you show.", "If you want to learn more about how to structure a Machine Learning project and the best practices, I would like to call out his excellent third course named Structuring Machine learning projects in the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization.
