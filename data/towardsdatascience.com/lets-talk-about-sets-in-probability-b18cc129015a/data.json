It may not be the most fun, but having an understanding of the math underlying all the amazing work your models do will allow you to better explain and better develop all of your models. In this post, I will specifically be talking about sets, and will be covering these topics:", "But first, what exactly is a set? Well, it\u2019s generally described as a well-defined collection of objects. In mathematics, sets are usually represented by \ud835\udc46. If you have an object X and it belongs to the set, then you would say that X \u2208 \ud835\udc46. But, if object X does not belong to the defined set, then you would say that X \u2209 \ud835\udc46. For example, if you define \ud835\udc46 as a set of odd numbers, and if X= 1, then X \u2208 \ud835\udc46.", "A universal set is all the possible outcomes for any given context. Universal sets are often represented by the Greek sign Omega, \u03a9. For example, the universal set for the number of cards in a deck, if each individual card is to be represented only by a number, would be \u03a9 = {1, 2, 3, \u2026, 50, 51, 52}, for the 52 cards that are in the deck. One thing to note is that, although it has the word universal, a universal set does include an infinite number of possible outcomes, but only all the outcomes possible within certain conditions. Going back to the cards example, the number of elements for which the number of cards in a standard deck would contain is limited to 52 because that is the maximum number of cards in the deck.", "Let\u2019s say you have two sets: set R and set S. We can declare that set R is a subset of set S if, and only if, every element in set R exists within set S. This can be represented with the notation R \u2286 S. But diving a little bit deeper, what you really want to look for are proper subsets. Technically, a subset can consist of the entire set, whereas a proper subset is only the specific elements that meet a specific condition. Example:", "To start with the understanding of set operations, let\u2019s first create two sets. Set A will be the first three multiples of 2, and set B will be the first three multiples of 3. So, set A = {2,4,6} and set B = {3,6,9}. The first set operation I\u2019ll go over is union. A union of sets would contain all the elements in A, B or in both A and B. That means that the union of A and B = {2,3,4,6,9}. The union of A and B can be written with the notation A \u222a B.", "The next set operation I\u2019ll go over is intersection. The intersection of sets A and B would consist of the elements in A that also belong to B. So, the intersection of sets A and B = {6} only, because it\u2019s the only number in either set that is a multiple of both 2 and 3. Mathematically, this would represented as A \u2229 B.", "Now, the next two get a little more complicated. The next set operation is called the relative complement, which is sometimes referred to as the difference. So, for A and B, the relative complement of A contains all of the elements of B that are not in A. The mathematical notation for the relative complement is represented with \\, so A\\B = {3,9}. 6 is not included because it is in both A and B. The relative complement is also sometimes represented with the symbol, -.", "Lastly, here comes the most confusing one, which is the absolute complement. The first thing I want to make clear is that absolute complements are only used in consideration with universal sets (\u03a9). So, going back to our set A, the absolute complement of A in regards to the universal set, \u03a9, is all of the elements in \u03a9 that are not in A. Confused? That\u2019s totally okay. Let\u2019s follow an example. To this point, we\u2019ve only defined what sets A and B contain and have yet to define what the universal set contains. So, let\u2019s define \u03a9 as all of the multiples of 2 and 3 all the way up to 15. This means that \u03a9 = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15}. The mathematical notation of the absolute complement is represented by \u2032, so A\u2032 = {3,8,9,10,12,14,15} because those are all of the elements from \u03a9 that are not in set A.", "When I was first studying data science, sets were probably the first thing that really made my brain hurt, which is why I wanted to write this blog post. So if you too are having trouble understanding sets, particularly the two types of complements, I hope this post helped clarify any confusion you may have. If not, that\u2019s okay \u2014 keep looking for resources that can help and just keep practicing. You will get it! Thank you for reading.", "Your home for data science.
