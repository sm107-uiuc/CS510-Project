This article does not contain questions, in whole or part, or answers, in whole or part, from the actual exam. When I use the term \u201cdefault answer\u201d or suggest an answer to a possible question I try my best to make sure the answer is correct based on the provided documentation or preparation materials, but I cannot guarantee that the answer is correct. Likewise, I cannot guarantee that the list of topics is either complete or fully corresponds to the actual exam questions \u2014 this is only my best effort based on the preparation materials. The goal of this article is to help you be better prepared, and I would advise against any form of cheating during the preparation or the actual exam.", "Update 2020\u201311\u201328: Added an awesome \u201cGCP ML modeling solutions diagram\u201d at the end of the article. Check it out!", "Yesterday, 2020\u201311\u201324, I passed the Google Certified Professional Machine Learning Engineer Exam (that\u2019s quite a mouthful, will refer to it as just the exam from now on). I feel obligated to share the experience with my fellow ML engineers because the road to that sacred PASSED result should not be as complicated as it is now.", "I had only two weeks of preparation, but I would recommend having at least one month for experienced engineers. I think in my case two weeks were enough because:", "Important notice: There will be no question or answer dumps \u2014 this is unfair, I don\u2019t want to spoil your fun.", "Important notice: be prepared that your preparation won\u2019t be enough to be prepared! This is also true for the Data Engineer exam: the sample questions, courses, and other preparation materials do not reflect the complexity of the actual questions! While the topics are the same, expect the real question to touch on the limitations of the services or even to present several applicable solutions with one being slightly more \u201cthe official way to do it\u201d. I guess this is where the requirement of 3 years of practical experience comes from.", "Important notice: I suppose Google picks the questions randomly so your mileage may vary.", "Exam format: 60 questions, 120 minutes. Most of them are single-choice questions, but there were fewer than 5 multiple-choice questions. You are not required to do any calculations, and you don\u2019t get a paper for notes. There are questions with code snippets in Python.", "I have selected an offline proctored exam at the testing center, because any small thing at home, like the connection break or a sudden cat jump, can spoil your attempt.", "When the exam started I was caught unprepared by the very first question, so my advice here is not to judge yourself until you\u2019re done with the exam. Just keep answering \u2014 the questions are in no particular order, so you might get something really complex from the start and easy questions will follow.", "Speaking of the complexity, the questions are more complex than the sample questions on average, but that\u2019s to be expected after the Data Engineer exam. I was not sure about ~10 questions and didn\u2019t know the answer for ~5 questions. Thus, I\u2019ve marked for review around 15 questions. It was rather hard to keep the speed of 2 mins/question, so in the end, I had to speed up myself and got ~6 minutes to review the marked questions. My advice here would be to watch your timing closely because, on this exam, you can easily get out of time. Besides, do not mark for the review the questions you are more than 70% sure about.", "I think I have figured out a useful strategy on how to read the questions. First, read the question in full, even if you think you already know the answer. Be sure if the question asks for positive statements (AI Platform does support\u2026) or for negative statements (AI Platform does not support\u2026). Second, read the question again and build a mental model of the problem: supervised or unsupervised problem, regression, binary or multi-class classification. Third, read the question once again (the last time, I promise) and now look for the requirements and limitations: \u201cis the dataset available and where is it?\u201d, \u201care there custom categories?\u201d, or \u201cis this something that ML APIs can pick up?\u201d, \u201care you required to code the model?\u201d, \u201cis there a rush in development/evaluation?\u201d and so on. Fourth, read each possible answer and argue why it might or might not be suitable. Remember \u2014 you have to read all the answers before you can select one. Google loves to give several applicable and perfectly working answers, but one of them will be slightly more suitable given the requirements in the question.", "And last, but not least, the answer to the question sometimes can be figured out just by comparing the answer options! If you see that some technology is repeated in two options, it might be the right thing. For example (not the real answers, just an example), if you see:", "But please, reside to this guessing only if you really don\u2019t know the answer to the question.", "Read on for the list of the preparation materials.", "The biggest problem of this exam is the absence of the preparation materials. Let\u2019s see what Google has to offer:", "I\u2019ll do my best but the list cannot be exhaustive. I will also include the default applicable answers where possible \u2014 again, not the actual exam answers, just what the documentation recommends, so beware :). The actual links to the relevant resources could be found in the next session.", "As general advice, while reading the problem statement try to understand whether you are dealing with regression, binary classification, or multi-class classification problems. This will help you to understand what methods and metrics are available to you.", "You might expect on the exam:", "I have compiled a flowchart and several comparison tables during my preparation and found them really useful, so enjoy!", "If you have anything to add to this diagram \u2014 please leave a comment!", "So, my dear learner, hope this knowledge will help you. At least it would have helped me if I had started from the beginning.", "I plan to update this article when I find more useful links and learning materials.", "Your feedback is appreciated, let\u2019s transform this article into a definitive guide to the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer!", "Wish you luck on your path,", "Your home for data science.
