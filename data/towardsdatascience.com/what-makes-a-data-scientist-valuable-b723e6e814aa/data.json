Many of us already have a good notion of what is important to build a strong data science career and increase your compensation. I personally, never have seen a systematic, data based, approach to that problem. That was the motivation of building a model to explain what makes a data scientist valuable to the market. Some results are pretty obvious, but many others might really help you boost your earnings.", "Click here to calculate your probability of earning more than USD 100k/year", "We only could get to this kind of study because Kaggle has released the data from its second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey. The survey was live for one week in October 2018 and got a total of 23,859 responses. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what\u2019s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field.", "With access to that data, we wanted to understand what affects a Kaggler\u2019s compensation (we are calling Kaggler anyone that answered the survey). Our idea was to give you precise insights of what is more valuable to the market, this way you can stop spending time on things that won\u2019t have a good ROI (return on investment) and speed up towards higher compensation. Following those insights, extracted from data, I hope one day you might find yourself laying down on a pile of money like Mr. Babineaux down here.", "Click here to access the full study, with codes to reproduce", "Before we go to the model itself, let\u2019s do some basic Exploratory Data Analysis. First let\u2019s look at how much each respondent earn.", "The salaries are accumulated at the lower range (up to USD 10k per year) and there is another peak around 100k. There are a lot of students that answered this survey, let\u2019s see how much they earn?", "As expected, students don\u2019t earn that much because they still don\u2019t have a job. With this information in hand we may remove students from our data and define how much the Top 20% most well paid Kagglers earn.", "From this data we defined our target variable for modelling as follows:", "We will calculate the probability of a Kaggler earn more than USD 100k per year.", "Before continuing to the model itself, I just want to let you know that there is gender imbalance at salaries for the Top 20%, but the bottom 80% earn almost the same. This means that men in leadership positions are better paid than women. See it in the chart bellow:", "You may see the full EDA here.", "To create the model we extracted features that could explain higher salaries from 29 questions out of 50 available. Together, those questions generated 138 features. After some data cleaning, we ran both a Logistic Regression and a Random Forest model.", "After evaluation the Logistic Regression performed better. This model also had the advantage of extracting feature coefficients. This allows understanding how each feature contribute to the final result (be in the Top 20% most paid). We did undersampling, cross validation and grid search, all code available for inspection here.", "Below we show the model performance on test data and the distribution of scores for both Top 20% and bottom 80% groups.", "After feature selection, our model had a total of 124 features. From their coefficients we may draw some ideas that might help you find your pile of money.", "Our model\u2019s intercept is 0. This means that everyone starts with a score 0. Then you may add or subtract \u201cpoints\u201d from your score, depending of the answers you give to each question.", "Takeaway: Have an attitude towards positiveness. Don\u2019t do negative stuff.", "Being a student might be a source of frustration and lower salaries. Get out and get a job! Being a Data Scientist is a great idea, but software engineers earn more. Why not be a Type B Data Scientist and deploy models into production?", "If you want to get rich, run from Academics/Education. In the complete study EDA you\u2019ll see that Academics/Education has the lowest average compensation compared to other industries, and this is confirmed by the model\u2019s coefficient. I feel bad that one of the most important areas for the future of data science is the one that has the lowest salaries. If you want to earn more, then working at the computers/technology industry will increase your likelihood of belonging to the Top 20% most well paid.", "Obviously, as you get more experienced, it is expected that you earn more. Be realistic, you won\u2019t be in the Top 20% with just 2 years of experience.", "When it comes to activities, try to build prototypes or Machine Learning services. Exploring the application of ML to new areas and using it to improve your products or workflows is the way to get closer to earning more than USD 100k per year.", "On the other side, if an important part of your role is to do Business Intelligence to analyze and understand data to influence product or business decisions, then you should expect to earn less. Same thing if you run the data infrastructure.", "Use cloud computing services! Get used to AWS, or other leading cloud providers, such as Google or Microsoft.", "There are some Machine Learning frameworks that might increase your market value. Learning and using SparkMLlib, Xgboost and TensorFlow will add weight to your resume.", "When it comes to the types of data that might increase your compensation, try to learn and get experienced on Time Series and Geospatial Data. Everyone works with Numerical Data, so learn the basics, then go to more advanced data types if you want to have good news on your pay check.", "Do you know how to do perturbation importance or sentiment analysis? If you don\u2019t, then it is time to learn. I hope this article is giving you some hints on examination of model coeficients.", "To see more results and ideas check out the public kernel on Kaggle. There we present 124 hints to help you find your money working with Data Science.", "Maybe one day we might find ourselves laying down on a pile of money. But unlike Mr. Babineaux, it will be our money. And it will be legal.", "Let me know if you have any critic or suggestion to improve this analysis!", "Your home for data science.
