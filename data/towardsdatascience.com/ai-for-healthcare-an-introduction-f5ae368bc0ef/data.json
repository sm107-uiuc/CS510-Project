More than half of the physicians reported experiencing time pressures when conducting physical examinations. Nearly a third felt they needed at least 50 percent more time than was allotted for this patient care function. In addition, nearly a quarter said they needed at least 50 percent more time for follow-up appointments.\u201d \u2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality", "But we can build systems to help reduce the burden on physicians, by streamlining their workflows and giving them access to quality tools to make it easier for them to their jobs.", "This article will serve as an introduction to the application of AI in the healthcare system that I will be writing. Here I will be focusing on clinical imaging and the application of AI algorithms to aid clinical physicians.", "When training a machine learning model, it's important to have a general understanding of the kinds of images your dataset may contain. Some images may be very detailed and allow for higher training accuracies. Other images may have lower detail but are used more frequently.", "For example, you may develop a great model that can determine where bone fractures are on a CT scan but the model may perform poorly on x-ray scans. If most hospitals and clinics use x-rays for bone fractures and your model isn\u2019t able to perform well on that kind of data then it might be useless.", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know the types of imagining tools available so you can research how to best implement the model you build.", "There are three kinds of machines that we\u2019ll focus on that are used by clinicians.", "X-rays are typically used for bones and sometimes dense organs like the lungs or the heart.", "The machine works by passing radiation (x-ray) through an area of the body. Radiation that gets blocked by dense objects appears white in the film.", "They\u2019re typically used to diagnose :", "These images are usually less detailed than other imaging solutions and require radiation to be used.", "The x-ray will capture a single 2D image.", "X-Rays are usually the cheapest option for medical imaging and are sometimes done first even if a clinician thinks you may need a CT or MRI afterward.", "A CT scan is similar to an x-ray in that is uses radiation to capture an image. The main difference is that it has the ability to capture multiple slices of the body, giving the physician a 3D view of the section being captured.", "CTs are very powerful because they allow clinicians to create detailed images of bone, blood vessels soft tissues, and other organs.", "They\u2019re typically used to diagnose :", "It\u2019s important to note the image itself is not 3D, but multiple 2D images.", "CT scans are more expensive, than x-rays but provide much more detail.", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (or MRI) is usually used for soft tissue injuries like muscles or connective tissues. This is because they have provided a greater amount of detail for these types of tissues. MRI\u2019s use an electromagnet to produce an image so they are free from radiation.", "However, this means that they cannot be used by people with metal in their bodies. MRI\u2019s can produce both 2D and 3D images", "MRI\u2019s are the most expensive imaging tool a physician may have.", "Source: You can read more about differences here", "The next part that\u2019s important to understand is the workflow that clinics and hospitals generally take to imaging.", "This information will help us know, at what stage our model should be deployed.", "Here we see 5 main stages. The image is first taken by using an X-ray, CT, or MRI. The images are then stored in an online server called the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). This server allows different departments to gain access to the imaging information in a hospital. A radiologist will then read and interpret the images in a first-in first-out order. They will identify abnormalities and then generate an interpretation of the image or images of a patient. Finally, a physician will take the results of the scan and all other available information to make a diagnosis. It\u2019s important to know that the diagnosis is only made by the physician and not the radiologist.", "If a clinician believes that a patient has an issue of some sort and imagining is required to verify it then we would call this a diagnostic image.", "For example, in the case where a physician may believe that there was severe damage to the brain from a concussion, they may order a CT or MRI scan to diagnose if there was any significant brain damage.", "Diagnostic Images can be used in both emergency situations where a life may be at risk (for example verifying a brain bleed) or in non-emergency situations.", "This is typically used when there\u2019s nothing wrong with the patient necessarily but they\u2019re non the less high risk. For example, a patient with a family history of lung cancer may receive periodic screening for early detection.", "Next, we should get a brief overview of the types of imaging algorithms that can be applied to medical images. These algorithms will help us determine the best approach and solution to solving specific problems.", "Classification is used to identify what class an image falls into. This is done by the algorithm either identifying a structure or finding with an image. This can be binary or multiclass. In laymen terms, classification solves the \u201cis this a cat or dog photo\u201d. In medicine, we can use it to detect if something like if a tumor is present in an image.", "For example, if I were to give this to an image classifier, it would return we with the result of \u201cPatient has tumor\u201d. It would not provide any other information, like the size or location of the tumor.", "Localization is similar to classification in that it will identify whether a structure or finding exists. But it goes a little further.", "Instead of telling you that a finding exists, localization will box-in the locations of each of the findings that the model had identified. This is extremely useful in drawing in the attention of a radiologist who can more quickly identify potential points of interest.", "In the above example, the tumor is glaringly obvious. But in the next example, we\u2019ll be looking for pulmonary lesions.", "Here, the algorithm was able to correctly identify the pulmonary lesion. Sometimes a confidence level is also given to help the radiologist understand how likely the model believes that it identified the correct area.", "Segmentation is similar to localization and classification in that it will identify whether a structure or finding exists and locate their positions on an image.", "Segmentation will identify the pixels in an image that contain a structure and highlight that structure. This is useful for obtaining the area or size of a structure and tracking its growth or shrinking over time.", "For example, here in this example, instead of just boxing the area where the tumor is, the model instead tries to outline the exact tumor. This makes it easier to computationally determine the size of a tumor from a certain slice or image.", "If you want to be able to bring your product to market, it's important to note which stakeholders are involved and forming your product in such a way as to benefit each of the stakeholders.", "When it makes the job of everyone involved easier and more efficient. The accuracy of your algorithm matters but the way it\u2019s implemented can be just as important.", "Summary: Millions of mammographies are taken a year in the United States and require 2 radiologists to interpret the results. Over 85% of the mammographies taken end up being completely normal.", "Problem: Radiologists are wasting hours interpreting normal mammographies.", "Potential Solution: Use classification. Depending on the accuracy of the model, algorithms may be used to determine whether a mammogram comes back positive or negative, and then a single radiologist can be used to verify the result.", "Summary: Radiologists read images in a first-in first-out queue from the PACs system.", "Problem: Brain bleeds are fatal if left untreated and need to be quickly discovered.", "Potential Solution: A classification algorithm that is run before placing the image into PACs. If it determines that a brain bleed exists, it can be pushed to the front of the queue for a radiologist to verify.", "Taking into consideration all these components and having a more holistic understanding of the medical landscape is the best way to ensure that your algorithms can actually be used in the medical setting.", "If you enjoyed this piece consider checking out some of my others!", "Your home for data science.
