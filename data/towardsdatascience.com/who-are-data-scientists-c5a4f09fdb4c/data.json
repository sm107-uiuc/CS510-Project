Analysis of Stackoverflow 2019 survey\u2026 | by Adam Deacon | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Who are Data Scientists?", "description": "What can we learn about Data Scientists from the Stackoverflow 2019 survey results? How do Data Scientists differ from other developers?"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://github.com/deacona/stackoverflow2019", "anchor_text": "https://github.com/deacona/stackoverflow2019", "paragraph_index": 20}], "all_paragraphs": ["As someone looking to bring more data science to my work, I felt it would be interesting to look at the characteristics of those already in the field \u2014 and see if these differed from other developers.", "The Stackoverflow user survey is a great resource for detailed information on all kinds of developers including data scientists. My analysis is based on the 2019 survey results which had 88,883 responses in total.", "I wanted to look at who is the typical coder. What are their attributes? Can we generalize them in any way. Further, can we identify a typical data scientist.", "First, I looked at the most common questions and answers. The single most common answer to a question was \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cDo you code as a hobby?\u201d. Around 80% of respondents answered in this way.", "Not all questions were open to such simple analysis as many allowed multiple answers. For example, respondents were given a long list of programming languages to select from, plus a box to enter others. Once I de-duplicated this information I found that JavaScript came out as the most popular language (almost 60,000 users).", "Whilst these single response statistics are interesting, I felt that the best way to define the typical coder was to look at all responses and find the most common combination of all answers.", "One note, whilst most answers were categorical or grouped values, four of the questions allowed continuous numerical values. In order to process these I created buckets for the four quartiles (i.e. covering a 25% range of values in each).", "It became clear that this method divided the responses into lots of very small slices. I found that, by this definition, the most common set of answers only occurred 15 times\u2026 and that for those 15 people only four questions were answered.", "Perhaps all we can say so far is that developers are unique individuals and aren\u2019t all the same!", "Using the same methodology but just focusing on data scientists, no clear \u201cwinner\u201d emerged as all combinations of answers only occurred once. Data scientists are even more unique! :-)", "Moving on from looking just at typical responses. I next wanted to look if we could identify some attributes that clearly make data scientists different from other developers. Can we predict which developers are data scientists based on those attributes?", "I wanted to model this as a machine learning classification. Firstly, I needed a target variable to train our model on. The \u201cDevType\u201d question seemed to hold the key to this, but first we needed to extract the distinct roles from this multi-answer field. \u201cData scientist or machine learning engineer\u201d was the value that most accurately described our target group. By this method we can say 6,460 of our respondents are data scientists.", "The next step was preparing the data, which involved:", "After that it was time to train and test my model. I selected three classification algorithms to evaluate: Naive Bayes, Ada Boost and Gradient Boost. When I compared the results of these 3 algorithms there were some interesting results:", "On balance, I feel that the Ada Boost algorithm gave the most encouraging results. The overall accuracy was good and it had the least-worst balance of precision and recall (represented by the f1-score) But there\u2019s certainly lot\u2019s of room for improvement in the model!", "My final question was to look at whether data science is an inclusive field? Or rather, more specifically, whether it shows greater diversity in it\u2019s practitioners than other coding disciplines. Are minority groups better represented in data science?", "I decided to focus on three main representations of diversity \u2014 ethnicity, sexuality and gender \u2014 and excluded any responses which hadn\u2019t answered these questions. We can see quite quickly that coding in general is dominated by white heterosexual men\u2026", "As with the previous questions we used the \u201cData scientist or machine learning specialist\u201d role to divide our data. Diversity groups were created to record each combination of gender, sexuality and ethnicity. Also a Diversity score was calculated by totalling how many of the three dimensions a person did not belong to the predominant group.", "Looking at the spread of diversity groups we can see that 218 groups are represented within data scientists, as opposed to 550 within other developers. When you factor in that the data scientist group is much smaller, this translates, on average, to being over four times more likely that two data scientists are from different diversity groups (1 in 24 vs 1 in 109).", "Now looking at the diversity scores, we find that for each point increase in score the proportion of data scientists increases. For example, 44% of data scientists are NOT white heterosexual men as opposed to 40% of all other developers", "Full code and analysis can be found here https://github.com/deacona/stackoverflow2019", "Your home for data science.
