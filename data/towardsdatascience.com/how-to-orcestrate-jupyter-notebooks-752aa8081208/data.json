While there are one-off tasks e.g. data exploration where Jupyter notebook along is enough, many data scientists are having a hard time maintaining their long-running data pipelines for refreshing reports, dashboards, and machine learning models. They have quite limited solutions for them:", "However, as data teams began writing more cron jobs the growing number and complexity became hard to manage. In particular, managing dependencies between jobs was difficult. Second, failure handling and alerting had to be managed by the job so the job or an on-call engineer had to handle retries and upstream failures, a pain. Finally, for retrospection teams had to manually sift through logs to check how a job performed on a certain day, a time sink. Because of these challenges, data orchestration solutions emerged. (By Astasia Myers )", "2. Airflow, and its competitors ( Luigi and Dagster). Such solutions have addressed the issues of cron, handling failures, and dependencies for tasks defined by users. The following code is a bash task that prints the data provided by the Airflow official tutorial.", "The target users of Airflow and its competitors are mainly data engineers or ETL engineers who may or may not get used to the mandatory abstraction over the actual code get executed (e.g. \u201cprint_date\u201d). On the one hand, such abstraction is essential for achieving the design goal of Airflow and its competitors, reducing the costs and headache in maintaining data pipelines. On the other hand, this abstraction or \u201cexternal code\u201d itself causes new problems: there is a learning cost for data scientists and they are forced to spend more time on pinpoint issues in debugging.", "3. Argo and other Kubernetes-based solution. Instead of orchestrating tasks of Airflow which are often python functions, Argo and its competitors orchestrate Docker containers on Kubernetes. They address the issues of maintaining data pipeline and environment issues altogether without worrying about missing some system-level dependencies when moving from a local development environment to production. However, even with the aid of cloud platforms like AWS, operating Kubernetes clusters is costly and time-consuming. It is not feasible for most companies to hire an experienced Kubernetes engineer. There are learning curves for docker: how to start/stop docker container, attach shells to a running container, reset the root password, building, pushing, and maintaining docker images.", "The fundamental design consideration of workflow orchestration consideration is problems solved by such a system must be significantly larger than problems created. Otherwise, it only helps data scientists simply shift their time fixing issues of cron to fixing issues of workflow orchestration system.", "To achieve this goal, such systems must make a much weaker assumption than the current solutions mentioned above. That is why we developed Bayesnote. We make the weakest assumption: even if the data team consists of only one data scientist, they can get started to orchestrate notebooks on different clusters within 5 minutes. There is", "2.
