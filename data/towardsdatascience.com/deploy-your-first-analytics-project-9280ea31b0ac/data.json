From my working experience, the expectations that data scientists create machine learning models while the engineers deploy them are gone. Most of the time, data scientists would need to do both: to design their data models and deploy their data apps (Dev-Ops).", "What if we could deploy our Data Application for our users easily and freely.", "Heroku is a widely used commercial Platform as a Software (PaaS) which makes it much easier for data professionals to build, manage, deploy various scale of applications. This means you could now focus on developing analytics applications with little hassle on the deployment infrastructure. Heroku handles all of the deployment heavy lifting for you!", "Simply put, whatever you run on your local Jupyter Server, you can also deploy it on the cloud for users to !", "In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy your Python Dashboard Web Application with Heroku. We are going to deploy the dashboard to review price drops on Lazada products and generate alerts.", "Feel free to just enjoy this article or visit my Github Repo for the complete codes. Alternatively just scroll down and enjoy this article.", "For you who are not familiar with the Dashboard Web Application that I am referring to. I am building a dashboard based on the price changes on Lazada Scraped Products. Each time the user modifies the input drop down, the app will alert the users if the price of the product drops.", "Our task is to deploy this application on the cloud with Heroku. The end result is a link where you can share to your friends or colleagues to access and monitor Lazada products price trends.", "Visit Heroku and sign up. You will then receive a notice on your email to confirm your account creation.", "Once you are ready, head to your account and you can visit your personal main app page.", "Go on and click new app on the right hand corner of the page.Input your app name then click create app.", "You will need two files on your first page of Heroku: requirements.txt and Procfile.", "Gunicorn is a WSGI interface which means that it hosts any Python Programmable web applications and ensure proper communication with our Dash Python and Flask Library.", "Gunicorn takes care of the tasks that happens between your web server and your web application. It also helps you run multiple instances to your web applications, check the instance health, and reset them as necessary while load balancing those instances. A lot of effort has been done to optimize it so it would be easy for us to use it. Cool!", "Simply put this line of code in the Procfile to instruct the dynos to use gunicorn web interface.", "There are many ways to deploy using Heroku. But one of the easiest way that I have found is to use Heroku Toolbelt. Refer to this link to download the Toolbelt.", "We will then use git and heroku commands to deploy our application.", "Then once you push it into heroku, you will see that your host will install all libraries you specify in your requirements.txt.", "After the server finishes with its commission, you will retrieve the link to access your application.", "Congratulations, you just deployed your first app to Heroku!", "In most cases, you will encounter some issues with the deployments. Therefore to debug this, you can insert the command heroku logs -tail.", "This command will return the following logs which would tell why your application crashed.", "It says here that the module on my Dash is not called app. This is because the I named my main application as dashboard.py rather than app.py. This caused the error because Flask could not find the main application script to run. Therefore, we could just rename to app.py then push the app again.", "If you encounter more issues, simply google the log errors, Stack Overflow or Dash Documentation. If not, feel free to comment here and I would reply as soon as possible. Cheers :)", "Congratulations!! You have deployed your first data application. If you did it properly, you would be able to access the application on your link. If not, feel free to refer back to my Github Codes or post your questions here.", "Now set free and deploy your Analytics Application with Heroku", "If you need more examples and better insights of what Heroku can offer with some of the engines. Feel free to visit the following links.", "I really hope this has been a great read and a source of inspiration for you to develop and innovate.", "Please Comment out below to suggest and feedback.
