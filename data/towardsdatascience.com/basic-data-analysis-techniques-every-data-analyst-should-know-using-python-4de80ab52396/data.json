What I noticed is that certain basic techniques you need in most projects, independent of the type of project you are working on. I\u2019m convinced every data analyst/scientist should have a good understanding of these techniques. So the goal of this article is to take the readers through these techniques and to explain these on a basic level.", "These are the topics we will go through and discuss:", "For our analysis, we will make use of the pandas library in Python. So if you haven\u2019t installed this library, use one of the following codes in your command prompt to install pandas:", "Furthermore I assume you already have a basic knowledge of Python and the pandas library. But no worries if you haven\u2019t touched any of the above, we will go through everything from the bottom up.", "To be able to go through the mentioned techniques, we need data. We could import a csv file or an excel file, but for now we keep it simple and just create a small dataset with pandas.", "The following code will generate a pandas dataframe:", "Which gives us the following dataframe:", "As can be seen above, it contains ID\u2019s, values and dates.", "So now we loaded the pandas module and created a dataset, we can start with the first technique. When you want to get a subset of your data based on the values in a column, we are talking about filtering data.", "In pandas we have multiple ways to do that, for now we look at the most common ones:", "So filtering with square brackets looks as follows:", "The logic behind filtering in pandas is you pass the condition to the dataframe between the square brackets:", "And gives us the following output:", "Filtering with .loc looks quite similar:", "And as expected, it gives us the same output, since we applied the same filter", "Which one is preferred to use? For basic filters, as we saw above, there\u2019s no difference or preference, it comes down to what you prefer code syntax wise. But when you want to apply more advanced selecting of your data, .loc provides for that and can do more complex selecting and slicing. But that\u2019s not something to worry about right now.", "We applied our first filter, which was pretty straight forward. But let\u2019s say you want to apply a filter with multiple conditions. How would we do that in pandas? For that we have look at Python operators.", "2.1 The & operatorFor example, you want to filter all the rows where ID is equal to C1 and Value is above 100.", "To apply that filter, we have to chain two conditions with the & operator. That would look like following:", "And will return the following output:", "As expected, we get one row back, since only this row met the conditions we set in our filter.", "The | operator in Python stands for or and will return True if one of the conditions is met.", "We can show this by applying the following filter: give us all the rows where date is later than 2019\u201304\u201310 or Value is greater than 100.", "In Python code this would look like the following:", "And will return the following output:", "As expected all the rows that are returned have a value greater than 100 or have a date after 2019\u201304\u201310.", "Sometimes there\u2019s the need to aggregate data so you can create certain overviews or to do some calculation. In pandas we use groupby for this.", "So what is groupby exactly? If we quote the pandas documentation:", "By \u201cgroup by\u201d we are referring to a process involving one or more of the following steps:* Splitting the data into groups based on some criteria.* Applying a function to each group independently.* Combining the results into a data structure.", "So basically it\u2019s making groups out of your data based on some indicator, to enable yourself to do some actions on these groups.", "3.1 Groupby #1: get total sumLets look at an example. Say we want to get the total value of each group based on ID . This would like like the following in Python code:", "Which will give us the following output:", "So if we look at out DataFrame again, we can see that this is correct:", "Pandas provides a big range of function you can use on your groups after using groupby. Let\u2019s look at one more. For example, we can get the highest date per group by using the .max() function.", "And would give us the following output:", "Joins are combining two dataframes on a side by side manner based on a common column. Most of the time these columns are referred to askey columns .", "The term joinis originated from the database language SQL, and was needed because the data modelling of SQL databases is mostly done by using relational modelling.", "There are many types of joins, and your output will be based on which type of join your perform. Because this is an introductionary tutorial, we will look at the most common one: inner join. In later parts of these series we will look at more complex joins.", "The inner join is derived from venn diagrams which represents inner (intersection) part of both sets. So when we translate this to our data, an inner join returns the rows which are present in both dataframes.", "Because we want to combine two dataframes, we will create new data. These two imaginary dataset represent customers master table and an orders table.", "With the following code we create two new dataframes:", "And they look like the following:", "So one logical analysis we could do on this new data, would be to get the names and city of the customers next to each order in the orders table. This is a typical join problem, matching two dataframes row-wise and enriching the data with more columns. In this case, our key-column is the Customer_ID.", "In pandas we use the merge method for joining. We will pass the following arguments to this method:", "There are more arguments we can use in the merge method than the ones listed above, but for now these are sufficient.", "The merge we want to perform looks like following in pandas:", "And the output is as we expected, the name and city columns are added next to each corresponding customer_ID.", "So that was it for this part: basic data analysis techniques every data analyst should know, using Python.", "You can find the code of this article on my GitHub in the form of a Jupyter Notebook: Link", "If this article was useful for you, please consider giving this article a like and share this with friends and/or colleagues.", "For any questions or other discussion, feel free to comment.", "Find part II here, where we go a bit more advanced.", "Your home for data science.
