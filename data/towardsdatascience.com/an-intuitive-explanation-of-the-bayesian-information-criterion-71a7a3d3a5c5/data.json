Clusters give us a way of describing data, finding commonalities between data points, and catching outliers.", "But without any prior knowledge, how do we know how many clusters exist within the data?", "Most clustering techniques require that we choose a fixed number of clusters. An algorithm like k-means will then find the centers of these k different clusters. Sometimes a visual inspection can help.", "Visual inspection can be a good first start, especially if your data is 2- or 3-dimensional. Beyond that, visualization becomes trickier.", "Let\u2019s stop for a minute and ask ourselves what our brain is doing when we perform a visual inspection.", "Our visual system is great at picking out contrasts. We are looking for contrasts in the density of points and then picking out spatially separated regions of high density. We then count the number of such regions we find. For points outside of one of these dense regions, we ask, \u201cdoes this represent another cluster?\u201d or \u201cis this an outlier of one of the original clusters?\u201d", "Our brain is performing something like a Bayesian estimation here. We are really asking, \u201cwhat is the probability that our data are explained by our model?\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s the simplest possible model that explains our data?\u201d", "The first question is asking about the likelihood function, denoted by L. How likely is it that our data x are explained by the model M (e.g. some clustering approach), which has certain model parameters \u03b8 (like the centers and extents of the clusters).", "When we\u2019ve found the parameter values that maximize this probability, we denote them with a carat (^). This gives the \u201cmaximum likelihood function\u201d, denoted by L with a carat.", "Going back to our example, you could imagine a model that has as many clusters as there are data points. See, no outliers!", "But that wouldn\u2019t be a very useful model.", "All models are wrong, but some are useful.", "We have to balance the maximum likelihood of our model, L, against the number of model parameters, k. We seek the model with the fewest number of parameters that still does a good job explaining the data. So we introduce a penalty for the number of model parameters.", "We are now most of the way to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).", "The BIC balances the number of model parameters k and number of data points n against the maximum likelihood function, L. We seek to find the number of model parameters k that minimizes the BIC.", "This form of the BIC derives from a paper by Gideon Schwarz [1] from 1978. The derivation can be hard to follow, so we won\u2019t go into it here.", "Computing the maximum likelihood function is the hard part, but there exist analytical functions for most common models. In linear regression, for example, the log-likelihood is just the mean squared error.", "Standard machine learning libraries will usually compute the likelihood function for you, so don\u2019t despair.", "Let\u2019s finish our example of data clustering. I want to cluster the data using a Gaussian mixture model and determine the best number of clusters to choose. In Python, using the scikit-learn library, here\u2019s how:", "Plotting the BIC for different values of k, we can see how the BIC is minimized for 3 clusters.", "The BIC agrees with our initial visual estimation. It also tells us that a larger number of clusters would also fit the data fairly well, but at the cost of having to introduce more parameters.", "You can always find a model that will fit your data, but that does not make it a great model. Following the principle of Occam\u2019s razor, we should always choose the model that makes the fewest assumptions. In machine learning, an overfit model performs poorly in the wild.", "With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.", "Using the Bayesian Information Criterion, you can find the simplest possible model that still works well. Hopefully this article has given you an intuitive feeling for how it works.", "Your home for data science.
