What exactly is he seeking? Understand the bigger picture\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["When you get requests from customers, be it a new report/a specific analysis/project, always understand why the customer is requesting this. What exactly is he seeking? Understand the bigger picture. Don\u2019t be embarrassed to ask even many questions if needed, until you fully understand. Understanding exactly what he needs, is a big part of your job. It will also help you feel more of a connection with your work, by understanding it\u2019s value.", "Your customer may think he knows what he needs/wants, but sometimes you know best. Ask the tough questions, what do you need this for? Do you even really need this? After you understood exactly what he needs, think of the alternatives. Is there an existing solution you can moderate to meet his needs? What would be the best solution technologically? Offer the solution that you think is best.", "Part of an analyst\u2019s job can sometimes include \u2018grunt work\u2019, lots of copying and pasting in excel etc. However, there are some situations in which you can choose to automate the process more. Always look for the better automatic solution. For example- instead of dozens of actions in excel you won\u2019t be able to replicate next time, try to put it in a query form. Try thinking big- what about the entire data process isn\u2019t running smoothly? What can be improved?", "Document as best as you can. Always think the same question could arise in a few weeks from today. You\u2019ll want to easily access what you did. For example- In the excel add a SQL sheet. Add comments in long queries. Even the emails you send- write them very clearly. Add an extra sentence just to document properly so when you or another person read back, it will be clear.", "You can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t know exactly where your career path will lead you. The best is still ahead. But it\u2019s important to connect with your inner self and thoughts. Don\u2019t just let time pass. Thinking about your next move is not an easy thing to do, but nonetheless try to imagine where you want to be in the next few years. Where would you like to advance to? More technical? More business? Which position looks interesting to you? What are you liking at your job? What are you missing?", "Did you work on some interesting project? Document it! It can be on LinkedIn, Medium or a private blog. You can also create a slide show and present it to other team members who might be interested. Try thinking, could this be of value to others as well? Maybe someone else in the company can benefit from this? Try to make your work create the most benefit in-house and out-house.", "Aside from becoming familiar with the software your company uses- the ETL, warehouse and reporting software, understand the technological landscape thoroughly. Who are these chosen tool\u2019s competitors? Why did your company choose these particular softwares? What are their pros and cons?", "A \u2018 data analyst\u2019 can mean a lot of different things depending on your company, its technological landscape and your specific role definition. Some roles are more technical, even close to data engineer, while others more product or business oriented. Although your company may have defined your role, you have the freedom to play around with your job definitions. Which aspects are you interested in? Are you interested in the business side of things? lean in on that. Do you enjoy teaching? Lean in on that. Your company only gains when you\u2019re coming up with new ideas and projects that you are enthusiastic about, while utilizing your best skills in the process.", "An analyst can become a very valuable key player. Its up to you if that\u2019s what you want. Alternatively, your job can be reduced to a more technical position, just running some query over and over again. The people who make it to the top, are no different than you and me, they just wanted and pushed to get there.", "Your home for data science.
