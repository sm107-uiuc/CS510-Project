Many people from both academic and other industrial fields share the same idea. To meet this demand, hundreds of courses are open, and the internet is swarmed with learning materials to help you get into the Data Science world (like here or here). The problem is: that might be too much.", "Let\u2019s assume we are busy, lazy, and stupid, so we will not have the time and strength to consume all the online learning materials. For someone who wants to land a job in Data Science within one year, looking at those resources to find where to start, and when to stop, can be overwhelming. Thus, in this blog, I will share the exact steps that I made in order to move from a Ph.D. student in Physics to a Data Scientist.", "Disclaimer: My current job title is actually Machine Learning Engineer, with job scope very much similar to a Data Scientist. The differences between machine learning and data science will be a story for another day.", "The very first step, before taking any action, is to prepare the mindset.", "Data Science is a multi-disciplinary field involving mathematics, programming, and domain knowledge, and is believed to best suited for Computer Sciences students. So, can someone from Physics be compatible? The answer is a big YES. Don\u2019t believe me, let\u2019s take a look at typical daily jobs of a Physicist and compare it with a Data Scientist.", "Don\u2019t you see it? These two guys do the exact same thing. The only difference is that they work with different data sets. So, if you are doing your physics research right, it\u2019s very likely that you already have the skills needed to be a data scientist. But you cannot be one yet until you address some certain issues:", "My preparation process was focused on addressing these issues.", "I decided to pursue the path of becoming a Data Scientist when being 1.5 years away from the deadline of my Ph.D. thesis. Minus 0.5 years' time of looking for jobs, it leaves me with exactly 1 year to do my preparation. And here are things that I have done during that time:", "The moment I decided that my future would not be in Academia, I started accelerating my Ph.D. works. I wrapped up the existing projects that were necessary for my graduation and gave up all others. I also shared my plan with my supervisor and asked for his support. This action brought 2 critical benefits:", "Data Science, in the end, involves a lot of programming, which is the strong ground of Computer Science majors. Thus, I would need to upgrade this skill to stand a chance against them.", "I practiced coding by using Python to do my research tasks instead of relying on third-party software. From controlling equipment, processing data, building simulation to figures plotting, all were performed by means of coding. Practicing algorithm with competitive programming would be nice, but I simply did not have the time.", "There are many online materials to support this purpose. However, knowing my time is limited, I did not dwell too much into books and courses. Overall, I took 2 courses: \u201cMachine learning A-Z\u201d on Udemy, and \u201cDeep Learning Specialization\u201d on Coursera, and read 2 books: \u201cAn introduction to statistical learning\u201d and \u201cDeep Learning with Python\u201d.", "My own advice is that: don\u2019t go too deep in the math or attempt to code the algorithm from scratch. It would take forever and serve no practical purpose. Instead, I focused on understanding the intuition, the pros and cons of each algorithm, and which library can be used to implement them. The knowledge acquiring process took me the first 5 months.", "Kaggle is a great platform for beginners to find examples of how to solve a machine learning problem and practice as they learn. I started my first competition by forking and tweaking from other\u2019s works. This helps me greatly in grasping the standard workflow and popular libraries. By the third competition, I was able to make everything from scratch (see my code here).", "My learning experience with Kaggle was great. However, I came to Kaggle to learn, not to climb the ranking. After 3 months and 3 competitions, I have learned enough about data processing, features engineering, and model building. Staying longer would allow me to learn more tricks to boost my ranking, but that would not align with my initial purpose. So, by the end of the 4th competition, I left Kaggle to start working on my own Data Science projects.", "The word \u201cproject\u201d might sound a little fancy, but the actual work is very much similar to a Kaggle competition. The difference is you yourself decide what to work on, where to find the data, and how to get the solution, without much references from other\u2019s works, and no ranking to compare.", "Doing self-initiated projects and uploading them to your blog or Github have many benefits when applying for a Data Science job:", "Overall, I did 3 Data Science projects: one with classical machine learning (see code here), another with computer vision (see code here), and then one with natural language processing (NLP) (see code here). Looking back, I believe I should have focused on only one particular area, NLP for example. Doing so would have helped me gain deeper knowledge about that area, and make my profile more consistent. A Data Scientist role will likely focus on only one of those three areas anyway.", "The time I completed the third project marked exactly one year since I started learning Data Science. On average, I have spent 2 hours daily, plus the weekend for this learning. My knowledge is not yet solid and still far from complete, but it was enough for me to confidently work on my resume and send out applications.", "In a nutshell, here are things that I have done to prepare for my move from Physics to Data Science:", "Learning something new is never easy, but Data Science is not Rocket Science. I hope that from my story, you get a practical view of the road to become a Data Scientist. I believe that with confidence, passion, and hard work, you can definitely do it.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "PhD in Physics.
