The data is tabulated to display a frequency distribution for the number of crew members on each shuttle mission from April 1981 to July 2000 as below.", "With the given NASA space shuttle data, we can ask a few questions:", "To address all the question above, we need to first examine the concept of random variable.", "A random variable is a quantitative variable whose values is a set of possible numerical outcome from a random phenomenon/experiment.", "In this case, we can try to define a random variable, X, to denote the crew size of a randomly selected shuttle mission.", "Next, we can proceed to list all the possible outcomes of X. The set of all these possible outcomes are collectively known as the sample space of X.", "From the sample space, it is obvious that all the possible numerical values of random variable, X, are discrete values. Because of that, the variable is known as a discrete random variable.", "Discrete random variable is a random variable whose possible values are distinct and disconnected.", "To represent the probability of joining a random shuttle mission with crew size of four, we can use the following notation:", "Now it\u2019s time to address all the questions based on the concept of the random variable presented above.", "\u201cWhat is the probability he can join the team with a crew size of 4, P(X=4)?\u201d", "To do so, we can calculate the proportion of times for X = 4 to occur. Such proportion of time is known as relative frequency which is equivalent to the probability.", "Let\u2019s try to investigate the probability for the rest of the crew size values (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) by finding the relative frequency for each value of X as in the steps given above. The listing of all possible values along with their corresponding probabilities of a discrete random variable is known as probability distribution.", "We can also build a graph to visualize the probability distribution. The graph that shows the probability distribution of a discrete random variable is known as probability histogram.", "By having the probability distribution, the probability, P (X = (4, 5, 6)) can easily be calculated by summing the relative frequency of X = 4, 5 & 6.", "\u201cWhat is the mean of crew size?\u201d", "The calculation of the mean of discrete random variable can be quite tricky as it can always be confused with the population mean which should only be applicable to a population but not to a discrete variable based on a random phenomenon/experiment.", "In fact we can still apply and extend the concept of the population mean to estimate the mean of a discrete variable.", "The mean of the discrete random variable is commonly known as expected value. In summary, the formula of expected value is as follows:", "Based on the formula, we can finally obtain the expected value (mean)of the crew size. The solution is presented in a table as below:", "Please note that the \u201cP(X=x)\u201d in the current table is equivalent of the row of \u201cRelative Frequency\u201d in the previous table.", "What is the standard deviation of the crew size?", "Essentially the standard deviation of a random variable, X, indicates how far, on average, an observed value of X is from its mean. The smaller the standard deviation of X, the more likely it is that an observed value of X will be closer to its mean.", "The standard deviation of a discrete random variable is denoted as:", "To ease the calculation, we can build another table:", "After going through the above session, we should now notice that the random variable is a variable to hold all the uncertainty values from a random event. Here we only focus on the discrete random variable whose values are distinct. There is another type of random variable whose value are continuous which will require another article to discuss it in detailed.", "This is important to highlight that the mean of the random variable is a long run average value of random variables. The expected value is commonly used in finance sector to indicate the anticipated value of an investment in the future.", "Your home for data science.
