As a Statistician, the ability to decipher statistical formulas is quite\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["The Greek alphabet is an incredibly significant staple of modern mathematics, and statistics is certainly no different. As a Statistician, the ability to decipher statistical formulas is quite important, and not being able to do so is quite a hindrance. The problem is that newer students getting into statistics might see these symbols and think", "\u201c looks like Greek to me!\u201d", "While they are technically correct, because often these formulas contain Greek in a very literal sense, it is still important for beginners to pick up on these symbols and get familiar with their meaning. Even those with experience in similar quantitative fields without statistical analysis involved could potentially have trouble, as the letters might mean something entirely different from trade to trade. Furthermore, pulling these symbols into Python can be rather difficult to infer. So without any further delay, here is The Statistical Greek Alphabet!", "In order to understand a series of Greek symbols called the \u201c population parameters,\u201d we need to get familiar with the difference between a population and a sample. As the names infer, a population is an entire group of observations whereas a sample is a small portion of those observations. In Python, we can get a sample using random.sample().", "Although we can use random.sample() to get a random sample from our population, a sample does not necessarily need to be random. This is important because it is the basis of how T-tests are performed.", "Now that we know the difference between the population and the sample, we can discuss population parameters. Population parameters are simply features of a population or sample that are insightful of that data.", "As I commented in my example above, the length of the sample can be represented with the letter n. The length of the population, on the other hand, will be a capital N. In Python, we can calculate the length of a list using the len() method.", "As for the mean, the mean of the population is represented with the Greek letter \u03bc, or \u201c mu.\u201d The sample\u2019s mean is represented with x\u0305, or \u201c x-bar.\u201d We can calculate these in Python either using NumPy, or dividing the summation of the list by the number of observations in that list.", "The median of data is kind of a mixed bag. It can be represented with x\u0303, or \u201c x tilde.\u201d It can also be represented by a capital M or Med. The median\u2019s symbols are not usually population or sample-specific. In Python, we will once again use Numpy to calculate the median:", "The standard deviation for a population can be represented using \u03c3, or \u201c sigma.\u201d Note that this is lowercase sigma, not uppercase sigma \u2014 this is important as they mean different things.", "The correlation coefficient of the sample is represented by lowercase r. The correlation coefficient of the population, on the other hand, is represented with \u03c1, or \u201c rho.\u201d There are many different ways to calculate the correlation coefficient, but among the most popular is the Pearson correlation. This time we will use Scipy.stats to find the Pearson correlation coefficient:", "If you\u2019d like to learn how you can calculate the correlation coefficient from scratch using the Pearson correlation, I wrote an article where I did precisely that in R. Along with it, I also calculated r\u00b2 and used it to score a linear regression model. Fortunately as well, the combination of R along with r made for a pretty hilarious name:", "The sample\u2019s proportion is represented by p\u0302, or \u201c P-Hat.\u201d The population is represented with a simple p. Make sure not to mix up p\u2019s with \u03c1\u2019s as in rho! To calculate this in Python, there is really no need to import anything, as it is calculated by simply dividing the length of the population by the length of the sample or vice versa:", "Typically whenever proportion is referred to we are talking about the sample proportion.", "Alpha is used to represent the significance of a hypothesis test. In other words, it represents the likelihood of a Type-1 error. As a result, you can calculate confidence by doing", "Alpha is a number that can change according to the level of confidence you would like to obtain. The alpha value can normally be assumed to be 0.05. Why is that? Because typically in statistics we shoot for a confidence level of .95, or 95 percent confidence. 1 minus .05 is .95. This number is not typically calculated, but is instead given as a parameter.", "Beta is used to represent the significance of a Type II error in a hypothesis test. Like alpha, beta is typically provided as a parameter and is a base value that one can use to optimize their statistical inference. One minus beta is what we call the power of the test. If you would like to learn more about power, I wrote an article where I created a power-log algorithm from scratch:", "Nu is used to represent the degrees of freedom in statistics. We can calculate the degrees of freedom in Python by first getting our standard deviation of X and Y, then plugging them into this formula:", "Sigma-X-Bar is used to represent the standard error of the mean. We can calculate this in Python by once again using Scipy.stats:", "Since Sigma-X-Bar is the standard error of the mean, then Sigma-P-Hat is the standard error of the proportion. We can calculate this in Python by simply making one change to the standard error formula:", "In the above example, s is, of course, representing the estimate of the sample\u2019s standard deviation, similar to sigma.", "Uppercase sigma is used to delimit the summation of a given group. This is simply calculated with Python\u2019s standard sum() function.", "The Chi-Squared distribution of a given array x. The chi-squared distribution is a distribution for multinomial experiments and contingency tables. We can once again use this statistic from Scipy.stats:", "Those are all of the Greek letters typically used in statistics. Though there are some notable exceptions from base statistics, like frequency (fi) and even more importantly theta. I excluded these because while they are important, they are also far less used and relatively advanced, and obviously this article is targeted at relatively-new statisticians.", "What you should also be aware of is the slight mix of Roman symbols in this article. I think there isn\u2019t a good reason to leave them out in case you run into them at one point or another. Especially since some of these symbols contrast directly with the Greek ones, I felt it important to leave them in. Overall, I can remember back to a day when this was daunting to look at. The reality is that the formulas are a lot more simple than they seem, and a lot of it is just understanding what each variable represents. Thank you for reading, and I hope you learned something valuable!", "Your home for data science.
