The views expressed in this post are those of the authors and not of their partnering organizations.", "We used ML and computer vision techniques to optimize photos of shelter cats in order to increase their adoption rates. See this video or this poster.", "Given the crowding issues at U.S. animal shelters, millions of shelter animals are euthanized annually. Austin Pets Alive! (APA), a Texas-based organization focused on animal welfare, attempts to address this issue by pioneering no-kill initiatives. As part of their endeavors, they have partnered with Adoptimize, a technology company that provides software to automate selecting the best photo given a video of an animal. The resulting high-quality photos translate to increased adoption rates and thus decreased euthanasia rates. However, while Adoptimize has had significant impact, their technology only works for dogs, and does not generalize to other animals.", "Shelter cats need this technology even more so than their canine counterparts, given their lower rates of adoption. As part of our Capstone project at Harvard, we partnered with APA and Adoptimize to pioneer a similar process for cats, with the overall aim of increasing feline adoption rates so as to reduce their chances of euthanasia. Thus, the goal for this project is to produce a model that, when given a video of a cat, chooses the best frame. We ultimately designed a logistic regression model that predicts on features extracted through various computer vision techniques.", "Our data consisted of 79 videos of shelter cats, provided by our partners. At a glance, the videos lasted an average of 23 seconds in duration, with a minimum of 2 seconds, and a maximum of 55. They mostly play at 60 frames per second, and are generally 2 megapixels in resolution.", "For a better sense of our dataset, here\u2019s a sample video:", "While certainly fun to sift through, the data posed several challenges in regard to size and quality. For example, many of the videos were filmed in low-light environments. Sometimes the cats were in kennels, with cage bars obstructing any clear views. In terms of behavior, some cats were particularly timid and shied away from the camera. Another challenging aspect of the data was the video quality, as many videos were filmed on mobile devices as opposed to higher resolution cameras. Lastly, the dataset was limited in size, as we only had 79 videos to work with.", "Most significantly, a major hurdle was that our data was not labeled in terms of image quality. Since supervised machine learning methods would best support our objective in obtaining the optimal photo, we needed to find a way to tag the frames\u2019 quality (the dependent variable) in a systematic manner.", "To achieve this, we wrote a simple script that sampled random snapshots across our dataset, served them up to us through a barebones UI, and recorded our annotations. For the measure of quality itself, we used the Likert scale, commonly deployed in psychometric survey forms, to assign a value from 1 to 5 \u2014 with 1 being the lowest quality photo and 5 representing the highest. After an initial round of \u201cpractice\u201d scoring so as to converge on a generalized agreement on what types of image corresponded to each Likert value, we sat down and labeled a total of 471 frames across our videos.", "Upon inspecting the resulting dataset, we found that it was slightly biased, given the low proportion of high quality frames (only 12% were scored at a 5). Thus, we decided to expand this dataset by acquiring an additional 20 clips from the internet and repeating the tagging process on them, bringing our total dataset to over 500. The only challenge with this was that the internet has no cat videos \u2014 anywhere.", "We suspected that we lacked sufficient data for a deep learning approach, so we focused our efforts on feature engineering, as guided by the domain knowledge of our partners. Our first task was to detect the presence or absence of a cat in a frame. We investigated two different object detection algorithms: Haar cascade classifiers [1] (a relatively traditional approach) as well as YOLO [2] (closer to state-of-the-art).", "Haar cascade classifiers use Haar-like features, which are sums and differences of pixel intensities in adjacent rectangular regions. The Haar-like features are used to train AdaBoost ensembles of decision stumps. A series of these ensembles are constructed with increasing complexity and decreasing false positive rate so that negative examples are rejected as quickly as possible. We were able to use an out-of-the-box implementation trained on cat faces found in OpenCV.", "YOLO, which takes the form of a convolutional neural network (CNN), is a one-pass object detection algorithm, proposing bounding boxes for objects and classifying them simultaneously. The image is divided into a grid, and each cell is responsible for producing a fixed number of bounding boxes (including the confidence that the bounding box contains an object) as well as a probability distribution over the classes, assuming an object is present. With the help of this training setup, and the CAT dataset [3], we used a YOLO network pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned it to detect cats\u2019 heads, ears, eyes, and noses.", "We decided to use the YOLO network for object detection instead of Haar cascade classifiers because of both higher recall and the ability to detect multiple features at once. We saved the resulting confidence scores of detected nose, eyes, and ears as a set of predictors.", "Using the bounding boxes, we were able to calculate an additional set of features, including:", "We believed the distance of the head from the image\u2019s midpoint would reflect how centered the cat was, while the relative head size would serve as a decent proxy for the percentage of the image occupied by the cat. Lastly, through eye and ear ratios, we aimed to capture the extent to which a cat\u2019s face might be angled away from the camera.", "Since image clarity often factors into the quality of a photo, we investigated two different metrics for sharpness: the variance of pixel intensities after applying a Laplacian filter, and the Cumulative Probability of Blur Detection (CPBD) [4]. In applying both methods to our dataset, we only measured sharpness on the region within the bounding box of the cat\u2019s head.", "We began with the Laplacian variance, but found that this metric failed to accurately represent an image\u2019s sharpness to our liking. The CPBD metric, however, exhibited a slightly better correlation to our dataset, and was easier to work with as it was normalized on a 0\u20131 scale. Hence, we ultimately selected this method as our measure of image sharpness.", "After performing further exploratory data analysis on our features, we found that the predictors producing the most promising correlations were the confidence values of detected eyes, nose, and ears as produced by YOLO. This made sense, as the network\u2019s training data mostly entailed images of front-facing cats with resting features (alert eyes, no snarled noses, etc)\u2013\u2013traits that are desirable in a good cat adoption photo.", "Interestingly enough, we also noted that the relationship between sharpness and image quality was not quite as evident. Upon further reflection, this may be explained by the fact that \u201cgood\u201d cat photos aren\u2019t necessarily the sharpest ones \u2014 a photo that is moderately crisp, yet cast with a warm blur, is likely more appealing than a very sharp one of a cat\u2019s face turned to the side.", "Additionally, we discovered some level of multicollinearity in our features, which we\u2019d need to address in our modeling.", "For our baseline, which we used to test against our developed models, we simply returned any random frame from the input video in which a cat head was detected.", "Our initial model was based on a subjective function of the features, in which we applied arbitrary weights for the subset that\u2013\u2013early on before performing a deeper investigation into our features\u2013\u2013we intuitively believed to be most relevant: sharpness and head size. The model then scored each frame based on their relative ranking in these two features, and returned the image with the highest score.", "However, this initial model mostly served as a crude proof of concept. Once we had a sufficient amount of annotated data, we turned towards a more disciplined data-driven approach in constructing the final model.", "We ultimately used a logistic regression classifier that predicted the image quality label given each of the features. We applied L1 regularization to address some of collinearity that we discovered in our features. For further tuning, we inspected the coefficients, and found that that the size of the head and its distance from the center proved uninformative, so we removed these features.", "The final model runs each frame through the regression, and then selects the image with the maximum probability of ranking as either good or excellent (class 4 or 5 respectively on the Likert scale).", "At a glance, the model appeared to perform reasonably well. If we pass the earlier example video through it, we are returned the following frame:", "Considering that the original video provided few shots where the cat was fully visible (as the kennel bars often overlapped the cat), and the shaky camera which often turned towards the ceiling or ground, this was proved to be a particularly good result (and of course we assess the performance quantitatively with testing, delineated further below in the next section).", "While logistic regression ultimately produced the best results, we also experimented with other models. To start simple, we attempted linear regression, but found that it produced uninterpretable results, and did not outperform logistic regression.", "Next, we tried training a CNN from scratch. However, the accuracy scores only landed between 30\u201340% depending on how we tuned the parameters. This is most likely due to the size of our dataset, which was far too small for the number of parameters in the model. This might have been compounded by the fact that many sampled frames within a given clip are alike on a pixel-by-pixel basis and are similarly rated, resulting in a network that learns to fit on specific videos.", "As a final attempt at applying deep learning, we also investigated transfer learning, using the InceptionV3 network pre-trained on ImageNet. This yielded similarly disappointing results.", "Given the inherently subjective nature of this problem \u2014 as there is no quantitative standard to deem one photo \u201cbetter\u201d than another \u2014 we created an A/B testing-inspired framework to evaluate the performance of our model against the baseline. The interface presents the user with two photos in random order: one produced by a developed model and another generated by the baseline. The user, not knowing which is which, must then select the image that they believe is better.", "Using this, we assessed the performance of our initial and final models against the baseline, and found promising results.", "The initial model was chosen over the baseline 64% of the time, while our final model was selected over the baseline 75% of the time, demonstrating a marked improvement (note that different test sets were used to evaluate the two models). If we consider photo quality that is indistinguishable from the baseline as a success, then our the performance metric for our final model is even better: 96% of the time, users either favored our final model\u2019s frame or could not differentiate it from the baseline.", "With our refined logistic regression model, our project proved successful, performing at least as well as the baseline on 96% of videos. Our final deliverable to our partners entailed a web app prototype, which allows users to upload a video of a cat and subsequently displays what our model considers to be the best frame.", "Beyond the scope of our project, there were a number of items that we would\u2019ve liked to explore given more time. For one, the web app prototype takes a considerable amount of time to run, mostly due to the frame-by-frame YOLO object detection. This is especially true for longer videos, so it\u2019d be helpful to parallelize this process. Moreover, it would be gratifying to measure the downstream impact of our project once adopted by our partners \u2014that is, to determine whether adoption rates for cats indeed improved in cases using photos returned by our model.", "Lastly, as data scientists, we are never quite done; there\u2019s always the ability to refine and improve our models \u2014 whether this means finding scalable ways to gather more data, or running further experiments to tune the parameters.", "And with that, we leave you with a photo of a cat. Good luck finding another one on the internet.", "We would like to thank our partners at Austin Pets Alive and Adoptimize, as well as our course instructor Chris Tanner, for their guidance throughout this project.
