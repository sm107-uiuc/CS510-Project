After 4 years in Engineering, I\u2019ve now made a permanent transition into Data Science. I started my new role last month as a Data Scientist at Kainos. It took me 2 years of explicit and dedicated effort to make the transition. Through this article, I indent to share my story to inspire and guide others pursuing a similar path.", "There are primarily two reasons I decided to transition into Data Science.", "The dominant reason which made more than 80% of my motivation for this transition is my intention of being able to use Data Science to solve many wider sets of challenges in the world and being able to use my skills for social good in general.", "Second motivation for transitioning into Data Science was the widely available career opportunities in every industry.", "Data Science is not much different from what I\u2019ve already been doing: Maths, Programming, Data Analysis and Visualization, and Problem Solving. So, there was nothing holding me back from transitioning.", "I started my Data Science journey about 2 years ago, when I started my role at as a CFD Engineer for an Engineering Consultancy. At that point I had gone through a fundamental crash course in Python and knew the bare basics of pandas and matplotlib. But I was determined to automate, analyse, visualise, or process data using Python (data science stack) for whatever project and whatever data I came across at my job. And very soon I started to get good at it. For the next one year, I carried on learning through various Data Science and Machine Learning courses from various sources. I wasn\u2019t a very disciplined student, but I knew I was never going to give up. So slowly but steadily, I carried on learning during my spare time, at work, during commute and on the weekends. After 1 year of studying, I was comfortable with data wrangling using pandas, create neat plots using matplotlib and using sklearn to train and evaluate the most basic ML models including regression and classification.", "Tip 1: The only way to get through the learning phase, is to have patience, and assume there is no going back.", "Throughout the first year of learning Data Science, I had been developing tools for my team using Python, to process and visualise data. The key habit I had developed was to implement as much of whatever I learn into practice at work. I had also simultaneously started to attend plenty of workshops (which are now all virtual) and Hackathons on Data Science. Attending hackathons, gave me opportunities to work with a variety of data science problems, get hands-on real-life datasets and actual ongoing challenges to address in the various industries using machine learning. What\u2019s best about it is, during the 2\u20133 days of the hackathon, I learn more than what I would learn in months. In addition to hackathons, I also participated in kaggle competitions and community projects as a volunteer. These efforts combined led to the third phase of my transition journey; spotting opportunities and networking.", "Tip 2: Just the courses are not enough, you need to work on real world datasets and actual ongoing problems.", "Hackathons and community projects connected me to many other likeminded, passionate Data Scientists, entrepreneurs, industry leaders or those on a similar journey to me. These are invaluable connections which in turn leads to great friendship, learning buddies, or opportunities to either gain experience, or even work on paid projects. This is where I got into the zone and started to understand the Data Science industry, from a Data Scientist\u2019s perspective, before actually becoming one. From here on, I started to spot every single opportunity to participate, work on real data science projects, and network with other data scientists. As a matter of fact, the first commercial project I worked on, arose from winning a hackathon challenge, which led to a full-fledged and funded project. This was the project that gave me the most data science experience before I landed a Data Scientist job. Additionally, a particular community project I undertook for Covid-19 to address food security issue was another major data science experience I gathered before landing into my first permanent data science role. Not to mention, there were several AI and Tech Expos, and conferences I attended (for free) exclusively to network. Phases 2 and 3 were inseparable in my journey. In the meantime,", "I also continued learning, undertaking udemy courses and reading books. This included enrichening my knowledge on more complex algorithms outside of the sklearn stack, Deep Learning, hyperparameter tuning, and understanding how to address typical challenges in data science like data quality issues, regularization, imbalanced datasets, and more.", "Tip 3: Spot every opportunity, be engaged with the Data Science communities, and grow your network", "One and half year into my journey with two major data science projects in my portfolio, I felt, I was almost ready for a job until I started interviewing at companies. I realised, the major missing was not actually the data science knowledge, it was the end-to-end experience including data engineering, deploying models and cloud architecting (MLOps) in general for data science. To validate this, I prepared and passed the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty, and just after securing an offer, also the Azure Data Scientist Associate. There is also a GCP variant to it if interested. These certifications validate four things: my broader understanding of data science principles, my understanding of the MLOps, Cloud specific services (AWS or Azure), and finally my passion to learn new skills. In about 4 months, I acquired 4 cloud certifications to validate these, which can be found here. I particularly recommend the AWS Certified Machine Learning \u2014 Specialty, as it is the most holistic of all in my perspective. Learn how to prepare and pass this certification here.", "Tip 4: Acquire Cloud ML/DS Certifications to validate your end-to-end knowledge", "In parallel to preparing and passing these certifications, was the actual interviews and technical tests for the jobs I was applying for, mostly either as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. Almost all roles I interviewed for, involved 3\u20134 stages: phone interview, technical test, video interview (technical) and final interview (cultural fit). With the projects in my portfolio, for the initial interviews prior to cloud certifications, I was able to pass the technical tests and get to the technical video interviews, however, lacked the productionsing / cloud experience. With certifications on-board, my confidence had a massive boost, and I was finally able to make it. Phases 4 and 5 were also inseparable in my journey. To summarise key ingredients to a successful data science interview in addition to cultural and personality fit, from my experience, is as follows:", "Tip 5: Every interview is an opportunity to learn from the interviewer, refine yourself and grow where you need to.", "After all the hard work, experience and certifications, I ended up with multiple attractive offers to choose from, way more than I had imagined. Choosing one was even harder than doing the technical tests and the interviews. It was overwhelming to see the hard work becoming fruitful finally, that too, in the middle of a pandemic.", "Final Tip: It takes time, effort, discipline, and persistence. If you\u2019ve sown the seeds, you\u2019ll reap the rewards, no earlier or later than you deserve.", "There were several untold challenges in breaking into AI, which I will try to distil and simplify from my perspective.", "The first and the biggest challenge, was choosing the right resources to learn from. There are hundreds of courses to choose from, on several platforms including udemy, coursera, edx, datacamp, dataquest and many more. What to start off with and what to follow up with? There is no designed path to learn and acquire the necessary skills and knowledge that will guarantee a career transition into data science. What\u2019s even more troubling is, after starting and completing courses, there might still be a feeling, \u201cmaybe I should have picked another course and started differently\u201d. There is no right or wrong, or a perfect path. The way I looked at it: Design your own degree to graduating into data science and award the bachelors to yourself when you feel you\u2019ve made it.", "The second challenge was, how do I know that I\u2019ve learnt enough of a particular skill? How do I know that I\u2019ve covered all the necessary skills in the data science skills spectrum to land me a job? The truth is, I will never learn enough of a skill or enough number of skills. My approach has been to develop skills for the sake of solving problems in projects I work on, not for landing a job.", "The third most daunting challenge was having the faith and persistence to keep going until I can make it. The big questions were: Am I doing the right thing? Will I get there? Am I doing enough? Closing the back door was my solution to these questions. I was just determined to transition.", "After all this work and the achievement of breaking into the field of AI, I feel that the real journey has only begun. The true efforts start now, as there is always a lot more to learn; As someone said, \u201cWhat got you here, won\u2019t get you there\u201d. I hope this can inspire those on a similar journey towards data science.", "Your home for data science.
