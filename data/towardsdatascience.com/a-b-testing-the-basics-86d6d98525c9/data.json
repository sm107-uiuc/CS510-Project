Which version works better in leading the customer to the end of the funnel?", "You can take a wild guess and go ahead with the change Or A/B Test!", "An A/B test is used to determine which version of something will perform more effectively in the market.", "From startups to large tech firms, companies of all sizes and industries rely on A/B testing to make smarter choices. Even the simplest of tests can help steer big decisions.", "A/B testing is a process of showing two versions of the same web page to different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine which one performs well.", "It\u2019s basically confirming which does better \u2014 this version(A) or that version(B)?", "A/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of an ad, marketing email, or web page are shown to users at random, and then different statistical analysis methods are used to determine which variant drives more conversions.", "Typically in A/B testing, the variant that gives higher conversions is the winning one, and that variant can help you optimize your site for better results.", "In Email campaigns, two variants of one campaign are sent to the users. By doing this, the marketing team will know which email was most effective in terms of encouraging opens or clicks.", "But they won\u2019t know what exactly led the user to open the mail. Was it preheader, the subject line, the visuals or the email content? This can be determined by the A/B test, which is the most compelling element of the email?", "It can help you examine visitor and customer behavior on your site before committing to major decisions on the changes and help you increase your chances of success. In short, A/B testing helps you avoid unnecessary risks by allowing you to target your resources for maximum effect and efficiency.", "An Online learning platform wants to make changes to their homepage, where the new, more engaging design will increase the number of users that explore their courses. Or maybe they want more career focused description on their course overview page, this may encourage more users to enroll and complete their course \u2014 A/B testing can confirm this for them.", "Anything on a web page that can affect the behavior of a visitor while browsing on the site can be tested using A/B Testing.", "Here is a list of variations that can be assessed by A/B Testing \u2014 the headline, content, page design, images, Sales promotions and offers, Social media mentions, Site navigations and user interface, Call to action (CTA) text and button, Payment options, Delivery Options, etc.", "In A/B test, the comparisons should be kept as simple as possible. For example, don\u2019t compare two completely different versions of your website, because you\u2019ll have no idea what factors actually made a difference. Similarly, if a new module or menu is added to the website it cannot be tested by A/B testing as there is no point of comparison.", "How to conduct an A/B test?", "An ideal customer funnel for an e-commerce store will be as follows:", "Homepage -> Category listing/Search product -> View Product Page -> Shopping Cart -> Checkout", "The store loses its users as they go down the stages of this funnel. An A/B test is then performed to try out changes that will hopefully increase the conversion rate from one stage to the next.", "A/B testing is done in broadly four steps:", "Determine the change and the metric", "First, decide what types of information you\u2019ll be able to collect and analyze. We don\u2019t just guess but use proper analytics tools to be sure you have a problem in the first place and to find where exactly it is.", "The analytics will often provide insight into where you can begin enhancing. For example, we decide to change the Call to action(CTA) button on the Product page from \u201cBuy Now\u201d to \u201cShop Now\u201d to increase the number of users that add items to the Shopping cart.", "A metric is then chosen to measure the level of engagement from the users. In our example the metric will be click through rate for the \u201cBuy Now\u201d button. Click through rate (CTR) is number of clicks by unique users divided by number of views by unique users. You can select as many metrics as you want, but more the metric you evaluate, more likely you are to observe significant differences.", "Hypothesis testing in statistics is a way for you to test the results of an experiment to see if you have meaningful results. The most important and confusing aspects of Hypothesis testing is determining Null and Alternate hypothesis.", "To put it simply, the statement that is true before we collect any data is the null hypothesis. So, in A/B testing the basic null hypothesis will be that the new version is no better, or even worse than the old version. For our example, the new Click through rate(CTR) is less than or equal to the old CTR.", "The alternate is the competing, non-overlapping hypothesis of null. The statement that we are trying to prove always appear in alternate. So, in A/B testing, the alternate hypothesis is that the new version is better than the old version. For our example, the new CTR is greater than the old CTR.", "Design the experiment (sample size, impacting factors, run time, participants)", "Typically, users are randomly selected and assigned to either a Control group or a Treatment group. We then run the experiment where the control group sees the old version and the treatment group sees the new version.", "Each user sees just one design (A or B), even if they update the interface. This way, the same number of people will view each version and you can measure which version achieved the lift that you would consider meaningful.", "The sample size that you decide on will determine how long you might have to wait until you have collected enough data.", "Once your experiment is complete, it\u2019s time to analyze the results. This is where analysts should have more focus. We calculate the metric values of both the control and treatment group.", "Different statistical techniques such as Sampling Distribution using bootstrapping, regression and various other machine learning algorithms are then applied to evaluate the metric and show you the difference between how the two versions of your page performed, and whether there is a statistically significant difference.", "There are many factors to consider when designing an A/B test and drawing conclusions based on its results. Some common ones are:", "I have written this blog as simple as possible so that people with no prior knowledge of A/B testing can also get a basic idea about it. There are various analytical tools that are used for A/B testing in the industries such as Google Analytics and Google Optimize, Vwo, Optimizely, HubSpot\u2019s A/B testing kit, Crazy Egg, etc.", "A/B\u2019s aren\u2019t a luxury for marketers with spare time; they\u2019re the lifeblood of growth hacking.", "One of the most popular examples of A/B testing is 41 Shades of blue, when Google couldn\u2019t decide which of two blue colors they preferred for a certain design element, they reportedly used A/B testing to assess the performance of 41 different shades of blue instead. Also, check out 7 Incredible Examples of A/B Tests by Real Businesses for industry level A/B testing examples.", "A precise A/B Testing approach can lead to huge benefits \u2014 improved user engagement, increased conversion rate, ease of analysis, and increased sales \u2014 It\u2019s a Win-Win!!", "Your home for data science.
