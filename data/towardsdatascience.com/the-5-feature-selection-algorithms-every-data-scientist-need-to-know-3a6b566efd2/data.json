Why don\u2019t we give all the features to the ML algorithm and let it decide which feature is important?", "So there are three reasons why we don\u2019t:", "If we have more columns in the data than the number of rows, we will be able to fit our training data perfectly, but that won\u2019t generalize to the new samples. And thus we learn absolutely nothing.", "We want our models to be simple and explainable. We lose explainability when we have a lot of features.", "Most of the times, we will have many non-informative features. For Example, Name or ID variables. Poor-quality input will produce Poor-Quality output.", "Also, a large number of features make a model bulky, time-taking, and harder to implement in production.", "Fortunately, Scikit-learn has made it pretty much easy for us to make the feature selection. There are a lot of ways in which we can think of feature selection, but most feature selection methods can be divided into three major buckets", "So enough of theory let us start with our five feature selection methods.", "We will try to do this using a dataset to understand it better.", "I am going to be using a football player dataset to find out what makes a good player great?", "Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t understand football terminologies. I will try to keep it at a minimum.", "Here is the Kaggle Kernel with the code to try out yourself.", "We have done some basic preprocessing such as removing Nulls and one hot encoding. And converting the problem to a classification problem using:", "Here we use High Overall as a proxy for a great player.", "Our dataset(X) looks like below and has 223 columns.", "We check the absolute value of the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the target and numerical features in our dataset. We keep the top n features based on this criterion.", "In this method, we calculate the chi-square metric between the target and the numerical variable and only select the variable with the maximum chi-squared values.", "Let us create a small example of how we calculate the chi-squared statistic for a sample.", "So let\u2019s say we have 75 Right-Forwards in our dataset and 25 Non-Right-Forwards. We observe that 40 of the Right-Forwards are good, and 35 are not good. Does this signify that the player being right forward affects the overall performance?", "To do this, we first find out the values we would expect to be falling in each bucket if there was indeed independence between the two categorical variables.", "This is simple. We multiply the row sum and the column sum for each cell and divide it by total observations.", "so Good and NotRightforward Bucket Expected value= 25(Row Sum)*60(Column Sum)/100(Total Observations)", "Why is this expected? Since there are 25% notRightforwards in the data, we would expect 25% of the 60 good players we observed in that cell. Thus 15 players.", "Then we could just use the below formula to sum over all the 4 cells:", "I won\u2019t show it here, but the chi-squared statistic also works in a hand-wavy way with non-negative numerical and categorical features.", "We can get chi-squared features from our dataset as:", "This is a wrapper based method. As I said before, wrapper methods consider the selection of a set of features as a search problem.", "The goal of recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a coef_ attribute or through a feature_importances_ attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features. That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached.", "As you would have guessed, we could use any estimator with the method. In this case, we use LogisticRegression , and the RFE observes the coef_ attribute of the LogisticRegression object", "This is an Embedded method. As said before, Embedded methods use algorithms that have built-in feature selection methods.", "For example, Lasso and RF have their own feature selection methods. Lasso Regularizer forces a lot of feature weights to be zero.", "Here we use Lasso to select variables.", "This is an Embedded method. As said before, Embedded methods use algorithms that have built-in feature selection methods.", "We can also use RandomForest to select features based on feature importance.", "We calculate feature importance using node impurities in each decision tree. In Random forest, the final feature importance is the average of all decision tree feature importance.", "We could also have used a LightGBM. Or an XGBoost object as long it has a feature_importances_ attribute.", "Why use one, when we can have all?", "The answer is sometimes it won\u2019t be possible with a lot of data and time crunch.", "But whenever possible, why not do this?", "We check if we get a feature based on all the methods. In this case, as we can see Reactions and LongPassing are excellent attributes to have in a high rated player. And as expected Ballcontrol and Finishing occupy the top spot too.", "Feature engineering and feature selection are critical parts of any machine learning pipeline.", "We strive for accuracy in our models, and one cannot get to a good accuracy without revisiting these pieces again and again.", "In this article, I tried to explain some of the most used feature selection techniques as well as my workflow when it comes to feature selection.", "I also tried to provide some intuition into these methods, but you should probably try to see more into it and try to incorporate these methods into your work.", "Do read my post on feature engineering too if you are interested.", "If you want to learn more about Data Science, I would like to call out this excellent course by Andrew Ng. This was the one that got me started. Do check it out.", "Thanks for the read. I am going to be writing more beginner-friendly posts in the future too.
