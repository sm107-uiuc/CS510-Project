This simple observation and the way logarithmic tables are structured, meant that numbers starting with digit 1 were more common in nature than numbers starting with digit 2 and digit 2 more common than digit 3 and so on. This strange pattern in the first-digit frequency might sound counterintuitive at first, but it turned out to be true for many numerical datasets.", "Newcomb published a paper about it in 1881, but his discovery wasn\u2019t really picked up by the scientific community. So, when Frank Benford (1883\u20131948) rediscovered this phenomenon in 1938, he didn\u2019t know about Newcomb\u2019s discovery. Benford looked at the first digits of many different datasets, such as lengths of rivers, addresses, atomic weights, random newspaper numbers, and so on. Every time, he saw a similar pattern, which supported the idea that numbers could be sorted on their first digit. This digit-law is now called Benford\u2019s law but could also have been called Newcomb\u2019s law.", "Benford\u2019s law can be caught into a probability function:", "Where P is the probability for a first digit d to occur. The frequencies in percentages can also be displayed in a figure, such as in this bar chart:", "What does it bring us today? Benford\u2019s law can be used to detect (tax) fraud and it has, for example, been used to evaluate the reliability of Covid-19 data (number of cases and death).", "If you would expect Benford\u2019s law to occur but your first-digit distribution is deviating too much, you have to inspect your data in more detail. So, Benford\u2019s law is a simple first validation tool for your numerical dataset. However, Benford\u2019s law cannot blindly be followed as we will see\u2026", "In the Netflix show Connected: The Hidden Science of Everything Benford\u2019s law is explored in one of their episodes. They also tell that the distances to other stars and galaxies are following Benford\u2019s law. This is probably based on a scientific paper that was using ESA\u2019s Hipparcos space telescope data together with a bit of other observational data (see HYG database). With this data, you can estimate distances indirectly by converting the measured parallaxes. (Note that we can only determine parallaxes and not direct distances)", "With ESA\u2019s space telescope Gaia, we now have more precise measurements and a thousand times more parallaxes of stars in our own galaxy (the Milky Way). So, to verify earlier claims, together with my internship supervisor at ESA and master thesis supervisor at KU Leuven, I explored if distances to stars are really following Benford\u2019s law and what it means. For this, we used Gaia\u2019s second data release.", "You can find our full results in a scientific paper on Astronomy & Astrophysics. Here you can also read in the second section when Benford\u2019s law is in general expected to occur (if you might have wondered by now).", "The most important result of our research is that the parallaxes are following Benford\u2019s law as we saw before with the Hipparcos or HYG data, but when we looked at the statistically derived distances, we came up with a different conclusion for the distances. These do not seem to follow Benford\u2019s law.", "As you can see in the figures above, it is clear for the distances that the values starting with digit 2 are most common. We also saw that precise simulations of the Milky Way show a non-Benford distribution of the first-digits. This result contradicts that distances to other stars in the Milky Way are following Benford\u2019s law, as claimed before.", "We explored why this could be the case. And it turned out that when you increase the uncertainty on the parallax measurements, the first digit frequencies are agreeing better with Benford\u2019s law. So, it might be the uncertainty in the measurements which is causing Benford\u2019s law to occur in the parallax data. However, final conclusions about the nature of distances to other stars cannot be made.", "An important takeaway is that you cannot easily assume that everything in nature and our universe is following Benford\u2019s law. And more research is needed to have a full understanding of the first-digit phenomenon in a complex system as our Milky Way.", "For anyone interested in applying Benford\u2019s law on their own data in Python, you can use my package (or have a look at my github page) to see how to return your own visual representation of your numerical data versus Benford\u2019s law with the Euclidean Distance (value between 0 and 1, the lower the better) as a measure.", "Your home for data science.
