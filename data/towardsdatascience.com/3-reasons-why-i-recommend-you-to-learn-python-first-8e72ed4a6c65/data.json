But, if you are a newcomer to data science, I would recommend Python first. Here, I give the reason for it."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Python and R are the most popular languages to use on Data Science and Machine Learning fields. Both languages have their own advantages.", "For the last 2 years, I\u2019ve already used both of the languages for my Data Science and Machine Learning projects. If you want to start in this field, I highly recommend you to start learn Python first and after several months you\u2019ve got used to it, you can learn R. Trust me, you will realize that both languages have an easy-to-learn syntax.", "Why do I recommend you to learn Python first, but not both of them? Here are my 3 reasons why you should learn Python first and then I will give you my opinions about the R language and not recommend you to learn it first.", "Python is a popular language for computer science. This language is so popular because it has an easy syntax and also open-source. It means that this language is being contributed by the communities around the world and you can make anything by using it, for example making a game, web app, automating really boring things, and also doing data science.", "For newcomers, Python is hard but worth to learn", "For the first comer to the data science field, you probably don\u2019t have any experience in using any programming languages. From a computer science perspective, Python is easy to learn, but I know that you probably don\u2019t think that is easy. It\u2019s okay to spend your time learning the programming language first before you move to another language, for example, R. After you get used to it, then you can explore any other language. But remember, just learn the fundamentals only and then make your own project using it.", "Deep Learning libraries mostly work on Python", "This is what I think is the disadvantage of the R language. Maybe it has some libraries that can be used for Deep Learning, such as Keras and TensorFlow, but it still needs Python for its back-end. If you are interested in deep learning also, I really insist you learn Python first and spend months on it.", "That\u2019s the main reason I can give to you why you should learn Python at first, even if you are new to programming languages or you are a newcomer to the data science field.", "So, why I don\u2019t recommend you to learn R first if you are new to data science or maybe programming?", "The main reason that I don\u2019t want you to learn R first is because its syntax is so easy to learn, especially on their data science library, in example ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, etc. Take a look at the tweets that I\u2019ve got laugh a lot recently,", "Probably you don\u2019t understand right now, especially those who are new to data science, but it just makes my day because of these tweets. I have to say that what have just they said is true, I mean it is.", "The reason why is that the dplyr and ggplot2 packages have a unique and easy-to-learn syntax rather than python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.", "Let me give you some example, especially on how you manipulate data and visualize data using Python and R. I will use the John Hopkins University Coronavirus dataset for this time to demonstrate to you how both languages do the task.", "Suppose we want to make a line plot that consists of top 10 the most confirmed cases around the world.", "This is how to do this on Python,", "And then, take a look at how R do this,", "So, based on these examples, which one do you prefer to use? R or Python? Let me know on the comment section below!", "In conclusion, Python and R have their own capabilities. Which one to learn it first, I would recommend you to learn Python first rather than R.", "Beside of all reason that I gave above, Python is more object-oriented syntax than R that using a function for doing it, but both have the same capabilities. If you invest more learning python, then you will get usual on programming syntax, especially on object-oriented programming syntax. If you invest a lot on R, probably you will enjoy on the syntax, but don\u2019t learn it at first because you will not get the feel on object-oriented programming.", "I don\u2019t want to discourage you to learn R, but do you understand if you learn R first and not Python? Take a look, the syntax way much better than the Python, isn\u2019t it?", "Despite that, I still recommend you to learn Python first because when you learn Python, you can learn other languages easily.", "Your home for data science.
