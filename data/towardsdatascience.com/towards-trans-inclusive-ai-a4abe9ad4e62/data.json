They exclude transgender people and reinforce gender stereotypes. Worse, governments across the world spend billions of dollars to scale cis-sexist AI to new industries like government agencies and to new applications like image recognition with little regard for their gendered impacts. The computer science community, tech community, and government agencies should be more accountable for the gendered impacts of their algorithms. They need to learn to analyze the gendered impacts of algorithms using queer and transgender theory then apply that learning to the design, deployment, and monitoring of AI algorithms in society.", "AI algorithms are usually one of two varieties: Machine Learning algorithms or expert system. Machine Learning is a subfield of AI where algorithms learn from training data to make decisions. Three pioneers in the field, Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio, recently received the Turing Award for their work. This is a testament to the power of Machine Learning algorithms in a multitude of applications including image recognition, self-driving cars, and language translation. Expert systems are simpler algorithms that consist of if-then rules created by a domain expert. For example, an algorithm created by a physician that can perform the following rule \u201cIf patient shows X and Y symptom, then do Z intervention\u201d.", "I\u2019m interested in the Machine Learning algorithms that have gender as input or output. Here are two examples:", "Automated Gender Recognition (AGR) \u2014 The input is either a picture, video, or social media post of someone. The output is their predicted gender, problematically constrained to only male or female.", "Facebook\u2019s Ad Recommendation Algorithm \u2014 The input is a user\u2019s profile including their gender identity. The output is a Facebook Newsfeed ad.", "Automated Gender Recognition is cis-sexist and transphobic. Cis-sexism is the assumption that someone\u2019s sex assigned at birth matches their gender identity and that gender identity does not change over time. ARG\u2019s cis-sexism excludes transgender and genderqueer people and reinforces gender stereotypes of what \u2018real\u2019 men and women are like. Automated Gender Recognition should not be done. Transgender and genderqueer identifications show us that gender is neither determined by sex, binary, or unchangeable. Assuming otherwise violently erases the experience of these groups.", "The oppression of people who do not look like \u2018real\u2019 men or women \u2014 whether or not they identify as trans \u2014 is a part of their regular interactions with AI. For example, take the Berlin Transportation Company\u2019s (BVG) ticket discount to \u2018real\u2019 women on Equal Pay Day. BVG states that, \u201cWomen travelling on Berlin\u2019s metro, buses or trams will pay 21% less than men \u2026 in a stunt to boost the visibility of Germany\u2019s gaping gender pay gap.\u201d BVG, in trying to bring awareness to the serious pay gap in Germany, ignored trans and gender non-conforming people. BVG staff were given authority to make decisions about the gender identity of passengers, something they should have no authority on. What if a transgender woman was denied a discounted ticket because a BVG staff member didn\u2019t believe her gender identity? Now imagine instead of BVG staff making these decisions about gender identity, it was a camera and an AI algorithm. Cameras have been installed in train stations throughout Berlin to do facial recognition. An AI algorithm now has the authority to make decisions about the gender identity of anyone riding public transportation in Berlin, a very scary idea. A possible trans-inclusive alternative is to give discount tickets to people who self-identify as non-cis male which will bring awareness to the pay gap between cis-men and other genders. Sure, some cis-men would abuse the system but the trans-inclusive message of pay disparity would be made loud and clear.", "In general, AI algorithms should not make decision about gender identity. The use of gender as the output of AI algorithms is unscientific because gender identity is under the authority of the individual. It is not something that can be determined by looking at bodies or outward expressions. If an organization needs to know someone\u2019s gender identity, they should ask, not infer.", "The Facebook Ad algorithm has a history of serving discriminatory ads based on self-identified gender. One such case is when the Facebook Algorithm excluded women from seeing online job ads. Facebook algorithms are not the only case of an algorithm with gendered inputs making sexist decisions though. There is a billboard ad algorithm that uses a hidden camera to guess the gender of people walking by and then serves them ads. People recognized as men are served ads for pizza while those recognized as female are served ads for salad. Including gendered inputs to an AI algorithm makes both cis-sexist and sexist decisions more likely.", "It is unclear if there is a way to use gendered input responsibly due to the examples above. Maybe we can find a way to responsibly use gender identity to improve the ability of some algorithms without causing harm to women, transgender, and genderqueer people, but maybe not. Of course, the only gender input that would be valid is a self-identified gender that breaks the M or F sex-gender binary. The question we need to answer is \u201cdoes gender input improve algorithmic performance or simply perpetuate gender stereotypes?\u201d", "We are scaling cis-sexism by expanding the role of AI in society while simultaneously ignoring its biases. AI algorithms are becoming more and more prevalent in society due to their extensive use in public and private industries. National governments in the USA, China, and other nations are spending billions of dollars a year funding AI research and development. Prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng calls it the next electricity and the tech industry is waiting for AI to change the world for the better. Yet there is little awareness of how AI systems can have heteronormative effect on transgender, genderqueer and cisgender people.", "A wide range of industries are now using AI. Clinical Decision Support Systems are used by physicians for a range of tasks in healthcare and Automated Decision Systems are used in city governments to predict criminal recidivism and do predictive policing. This trend will only continue as Machine Learning researchers are expanding the abilities of algorithms and cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are making it easier for non-experts to use AI systems. The human capital necessary to deploy AI algorithms is growing.", "Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that establishes \u201cthe American AI Initiative \u2014 that\u2019ll task federal agencies with devoting more resources to artificial intelligence (AI) research, training, and promotion\u201d. The biggest criticism of the executive order? It doesn\u2019t include enough funding to keep up with the AI programs in China, South Korea, and Canada that involve hundred-million-dollar, multi-year strategies.", "We must acknowledge the expanding role of AI. No longer are AI algorithms politically neutral. They are making decisions that have large and complex effects on society that can have gender bias, specifically towards trans and gender non-conforming people. It is essential that those who research, design, and use AI algorithms understand this point so that they can responsibly promote the use of AI in society.", "Transparent use of AI systems. \u2018Trade secret\u2019 claims made by the designers of AI algorithms and general lack of public disclosure prevents the public, journalists, and academics from exploring the gendered impacts of AI algorithms. The most pressing need for such transparency is in automated decision systems used in public agencies. A team at NYU\u2019s AI Now department has designed an algorithmic impact assessment that provides a framework for the responsible use of AI algorithms in a public agency.", "Valuing Trans Knowledge. We need to address the pre-existing sex and gender conceptions of the communities who create, use, and deploy AI algorithms. For example, the Human-Computer Interaction researchers that design AGR algorithms share the cis-sexist views of their algorithms. Broadly speaking, the influential AI communities include Machine Learning researchers, data scientists, and tech executives all of which are primarily composed of cis-gender men who often have binary conceptions of gender. For expert audits of AI systems to be effective, it is essential that the people reviewing the algorithms understand the technical methods of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence AND the transgender perspective. There are very few people with expertise in both fields. Here is a short list of readings on transgender perspectives that could be helpful in analyzing the gendered impacts of AI algorithms:", "1.
