After reading it I opened the app, looked at my playlist and realized that I listen to really distinct styles of music throughout the week or even throughout the day. I could be listening to Samba one minute and after a while swiping to heavy metal. Thinking of that I decided to analyze not only mine but also my Fianc\u00e9e\u2019s taste in music to figure out what the data has to say about this.", "So, in order to do that I started by extracting the audio features of 10 artists that we listen to the most on Spotify using it\u2019s API so that I was able to perform the music taste analysis. In addition to that, I trained a machine learning model to predict each list a song would be more likely to belong to.", "Another noteworthy fact is that I had as a reference some materials from the Data Science do zero which is one well-known data science community in Brazil.", "You can check all the code I develop on my Github page", "- Spotify Library to get access to Spotify platform music data - Seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization- Pandas and numpy for data analysis- Sklearn to build the Machine Learning model", "As we know Spotify is one of the most popular audio streaming platforms around the globe. Likewise Twitter, Slack, and Facebook they have an API for developers to explore their music database and get insights into our listening habits.", "Based on that, I chose ten artists that I often listen to in my daily routine and asked my Fianc\u00e9e to give me one list with the ones she likes the most. After having the artists lists, I used the Rare Loot post as a reference to obtain the audio features data for my analysis.", "The first data set acquired contains 16 columns with 1433 songs from my list and 691 from Emily\u2019s lit. So, In order to balance the number of songs I built a function to randomly remove some rows from my list. After the removal process, we came up with a total of 1394 songs (703 from my list and 691 from Emily\u2019s list).", "It\u2019s important to mention that I did not use all of the 16 columns for the analysis. Instead, I selected only those columns related to the audio features. You can find below the explanation of each feature ( past/copy from the Spotify website).", "I\u2019ve never really thought about my music taste until I decided to do this article. Actually, after thinking about this I realized that I don\u2019t have a specific genre which I listen to every single day. In fact, that depends on my mood\u2026some days I wake up and listen to pagode (Brazilian style music from Rio de Janeiro), the other day, after getting up, I just want to listen to a really energetic song such as Iron Maiden, and so on. So, I am curious to investigate not only mine but also Emily\u2019s Spotify audio features. That being said, let\u2019s jump right into the analysis.I will commence by plotting a Bar chart and a Radar Chart showing the means of our features in order to compare both of them.", "The plots show that the predominant feature in my list of artists is energy \u2014 probably because of rock music such as ACDC, Iron Maiden and Motorhead. On the other hand, looking at Emily\u2019s features, we can notice that danceability and energy are the prevalent audio attributes of her list. That really makes sense since she loves listening to a song by artists such as Ludmila ( a Brazilian funk singer) and Rihanna.", "The tempo is an important feature in terms of music analysis. It can be as significant as melody, harmony or rhythm due to the fact that it represents the speed of a song and the mood it evokes. For instance, the higher the BPM of a song, the faster the song is and consequently more inspiring and joyful it tends to be. On the other hand, a low BPM means that the song is slower, which can indicate sadness, romance or drama.", "Looking at the graph below we can see that our lists have tempo close to 120 BPM on average which indicates a moderate/fast tempo. Based on that I would say that both types of track could be of interest for those who enjoy fast walking and running since a song with 120 BPM can usually be synchronized with the one\u2019s stride pattern and their pace in order to make the run/walk harder and faster.", "For the purpose of comparing the audio features, it is important to look at the bar chart below. It shows the difference between the mean of each attribute of mine and Emily\u2019s song lists.", "In line with that, we can see clearly that my list is more energetic, livier and instrumental** than hers. Besides, we can also notice a slight difference in our speechiness variables and see that valence, danceability, and accousticness take the top spot on her side.", "The variety of the lists can be investigated by checking the difference in genres of our songs. In case most of the songs belong to the same genre we would say that they are low varied.", "The question is: How would we analyze this? well, the answer is simple: Let\u2019s check the standard deviation of each audio variable and examine them.", "Although the standard deviation of the audio features themselves do not give us much information ( as we can see in the plots below), we can sum them up and calculate the mean of the standard deviation of the lists. By doing that we get the values represented in the plot \u201cVariety of Audio Features\u201d with values of 0.22 in my list and 0.20 in Emily\u2019s list.", "How would we interpret that?! Well, let\u2019s say we can have songs with a high value of a specific feature such as energy and other songs with a really low value for the same attribute. In short, those numbers suggest that my songs are a bit more diversified than Emily\u2019s.", "We can also build correlation plots, such as scatter plots, to show the relationship between variables. In our case, we will correlate the feature valence which describes the musical positiveness with danceability and energy.", "In order to interpret the plots below, we have to keep in mind that numbers one ( green dots) and zero (gray dots) represent mine and Emily\u2019s songs, respectively. That said, let\u2019s check the scatter plots.", "The correlation between valence and energy shows us that there is a conglomeration of songs with high energy and a low level of valence. This means that many of my energetic songs sound more negative with feelings of sadness, anger, and depression ( NF takes special place here haha). whereas when we look at the grays dots we can see that as the level of valence \u2014 positive feelings increase, the energy of the songs also increases. Although her data is split, we can identify this pattern which indicates a kind of \u2018linear\u2019 correlation between the variables.", "Now, looking at the relationship between valence and danceability we can see that Emily\u2019s songs have high values of danceability split in the first and second quadrant of the plot. On the other hand, my songs are mostly either in the third or in the first quadrant, showing a kind of variety in terms of these two features.", "Ok, we\u2019ve got some insights from the data. In order to keep this article short, let\u2019s jump right into the best part (at least to me) which is the machine learning (ML) algorithm.", "It\u2019s important to bear in mind that I\u2019m not 100% focused on the accuracy of the model. Besides, we will be using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) due to the fact that it is the one I\u2019m currently studying. In addition, I won\u2019t explain how SVM works. Instead, let\u2019s say that it is a supervised ML approach which is used for both classification and regression problems. Also, it\u2019s main task (classification) is to separate all the classes by defining an optimal hyperplane that discriminates them. That being said, let\u2019s build an algorithm to predict if a song is more likely to belong to my list or Emily\u2019s.", "The first step is to preprocess our data set in order to have a dataframe with numerical values in all of the columns. So let\u2019s start off dropping all features which are not relevant to our model such as id, album, name, URI, popularity, and track_number and separate the target (who column) from our dataframe. We can easily do that by building the function features_removal which receives a list with the features we want to drop as a parameter.", "Notice that after its removal, we still have a categorical feature (artist). So, we\u2019ll have to deal with that in the second step. Also, important to mention that we have two slightly balanced classes (column who) which indicate whose list the song belongs to. In short, there are 703 songs in my list and 691 in her list and, that balance, in terms of quantity is important to our model.", "The second task is to transform all categorical data (artists names) into numeric data. Why do we have to do that? Well, the ML algorithm only accepts numerical data, hence, the reason why we have to use the class LabelEncoder to encode each artist name into a specific number. The encoding process is shown below.", "Now that we have our data set almost ready we can build our model. You might be wondering: almost ready ?! Well, when we are dealing with some ML algorithms we have to keep in mind that some of them expect data in a specific range or structure. For instance, sometimes we have to transform our data into a higher dimension in order to find the boundary that separates the classes as can be seen in the figure below. To accomplish that, we use a technique called kernel trick which offers an efficient and less expensive way to do this mapping. In addition, it uses different functions ( kernel) for that and the most popular ones are polynomial, linear and radial basis function (RBF). The last one, for example, requires features centered around 0 and with variances in the same order and that is the reason why we have to preprocess our data.", "The model with RBF kernel and StandardScaler preprocessing gave us the highest accuracy but we can improve it by tunning it\u2019s hyper-parameters. Let\u2019s use GridSearchCV to exhaustively combine different values for C and Gamma and test them in our algorithm.", "In this post, I used the Spotify API to analyze the audio features of my Fianc\u00e9e and my music list. Instead of checking our playlist, I used features of the 10th artists we listen the most in our daily routine. Based on that I concluded that my list is more varied than hers and surprisingly my songs are more energetics. Another insight (I expected that :] ) is the fact that Emily\u2019s songs are more danceable. To complement the analysis I also built a machine learning model (SVM) to predict if a song is more likely to be listened to by her or me. The accuracy of the model was about 74% which is good(it can be improved though).", "\u2022 Electrical Engineer turned Data Scientist \u2022 LinkedIn : linkedin.com/in/cabreirajm"],
