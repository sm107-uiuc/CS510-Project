As Benjamin Franklin said:", "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.", "One of my last week\u2019s post was on building an effective Data Science portfolio where I shared a comprehensive and actionable guide to building a portfolio.", "A good portfolio most of the time helps you get the first call and if you really know your thing, you are almost 90% there. The rest 10% is accounted for by the three traits mentioned in the first line of this post.", "So, this post intends to provide you actionable tips and resources to prepare well for your next data science interview.", "Data Science again is a very diverse space. The first thing that you\u2019re required to do even before you start to build your portfolio is to identify which segment of skills matches your expertise/interest.", "To help you out, here are the four common genres of Roles in Data Science today,", "Studying a good Analyst Job Description will tell you what to master and prepare for, here\u2019s an example:", "2. Data Engineer \u2014 These are individuals who specialize in designing and developing data infrastructures for data-driven companies that experience a good amount of traffic. Common tasks are core technical in nature like designing data models, managing SQL and NoSQL databases, building data processing systems using Hadoop, Spark, Airflow, etc.", "3. ML/AI Engineer \u2014 Positions like these are more research-heavy where you are required to know the ins and outs of machine/deep learning algorithms. Common tasks include design, develop, deploy ML models/infrastructures, building libraries, and frameworks that enable larger applications.", "4. Data Scientist(Full-Stack) \u2014 There is no job title as \u201cFull-Stack Data Scientist\u201d but every data-backed company(especially startups and mid-size co.) dreams to have them on board. They cover almost all the skills mentioned in the roles above and have diverse experience in solving complex technical and algorithmic problems. A Data Analyst who grows to learn and employ machine/deep learning would call him/herself a Data Scientist within 3\u20134 years.", "Note: Understand the requirements of the company because having the skills is not enough sometimes, there are several factors like specific needs of a particular department, domain expertise, experience in solving a specific class of problems, etc.", "Once you have figured out which role suits your interests, the next job is to work on a portfolio and if you have that ready, you should start preparing for the interviews.", "I have broken down the curriculum into 2 categories:", "Four major skills that you must have identified above are as follows:", "Every job description mentions good programming skills in their eligibility criteria as there is no data science job that is complete without you being able to manipulate data. Almost every technical interview starts with a programming problem to solve.", "You can choose any programming language you feel comfortable coding in. Two widely used languages in Data Science are Python and R. I\u2019d recommend you to learn Python because of its versatility.", "Statistics plays a vital role in a data scientist\u2019s professional career. Not many data scientists and analysts have formal statistics training, you should sharpen the topics from a data science perspective. It also builds the foundation exploratory analysis, sampling, experimental design, etc. Even if you\u2019re using Excel or Tableau, understanding of foundational statistics is very important.", "Pulling data out of a relational or non-relational database is something that every analyst is required to know. A few of the analyst job description explicitly demands expertise in writing complex SQL queries to gather data.", "Then one should be well versed with Python packages like pandas, NumPy, scipy, statsmodel to be able to crunch datasets.", "Resources to sharpen your data analysis skills using Python:", "This might not be required for a few junior roles but it builds a good case if you can showcase your understanding of developing ML models. I\u2019d suggest everyone gets familiar with the basics including types of ML problems, and linear regression, decision tree, logistics regression, and how they are trained and tested using data.", "Resources to learn and practice Machine Learning", "For beginners, this would be a bible to understand Machine Learning. It is a must-read for anyone who wishes to test the waters of ML. The book covers all the fundamental algorithms along with the mathematical explanation and practice questions.", "The second part of the book dives into deep learning, something that ML/AI Engineers should be thorough with.", "The book will get you up to speed with Machine Learning. A well-written book by Andriy who has tried to condense the fundamental algorithms, building blocks, and problems into this one book.", "Talking about machine learning, the recommendations are incomplete without Andrew NG\u2019s course on ML. A must-watch to understand ML and statistical pattern recognition. It covers supervised/unsupervised learning along with the best practices. It also covers numerous case studies and applications that have applied ML to solve real-world problems.", "Apart from rehearsing the presentation of your project(s), you should be brushing on topics that will be tested during technical interviews and via take-home assignments. These are role-specific topics and depend on the job requirements so studying the job description is of utter importance.", "For a competent Data Analyst, you should be focussing on preparing the following topics:", "You guys are more technical and don\u2019t need as much math and stats. Having a solid grip over programming and understanding of data management tools is essential. These Engineers serve as DevOps for Data Science.", "AI Engineers are expected to have deep understanding of ML algorithms, they should be aware of the mathematics that drives those algorithms to optimized states. Following are the essential concepts you should look to master:", "The majority of companies look for generalists to join their team of data scientists. The position expects you to design and execute A/B testing experiments, perform statistical analysis on samples of data, sometimes refactor production code and visualize data.", "Thus the topics you should prepare are:", "If I had to give you one summarize the whole process in simple steps, here\u2019s this workflow that you can use to develop your own strategy:", "With this channel, I am planning to roll out a couple of series covering the entire data science space.
