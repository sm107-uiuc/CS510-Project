For building automotive and robotics apps, these are really powerful devices. For example, Jetson uses a powerful GPU and tens of watts of power when running at its full.", "But have you ever thought of leveraging deep learning in your tiny microcontroller or Arduino project? Well, you might end up thinking \u2018Oh, it\u2019s nearly impossible\u2019. These tiny microcontrollers just run on tens or hundreds of kilobytes of\u00a0memory. They are mostly used in low power & low cost apps and computationally inefficient to run deep learning capabilities.", "You may be surprised to know what mechanism your Android phone uses to constantly listen for \u2018Ok Google\u2019 call words. I tell you it doesn\u2019t use Android\u2019s powerful processor and gigabytes of RAM for running powerful neural networks. Rather it simply uses a 14KB neural network running on digital signal processors(DSP) to achieve this task. These DSPs have only tens of kilobytes of memory and uses only a few milliwatts of power.", "In short, to introduce machine learning to devices running on a few kilobytes of memory, low processing power and a coin battery with lifetime of months(energy cost of below 1 mW), this idea of TinyML was introduced. Combining deep learning and embedded systems, you can now build amazing applications by integrating simple speech recognition, gesture detection via a motion sensor, and detecting people with a camera sensor.", "Initially, it\u2019s a good practice to begin with many ready-to-go boards available. SparkFun\u2019s Edge, Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and Mbed STM32F746G Discovery kit are some of the popular options. If you want to build some realistic prototype project, you will also need a microphone, accelerometer or a camera.", "Most developers prefer TensorFlow and Keras to build and train deep learning networks. A TensorFlow model is basically a set of instructions that tell an interpreter how to transform data in order to produce an output. When we want to use this trained model, we load it in memory and execute it using interpreter. Luckily TensorFlow provides an interpreter to run models on these tiny, low-powered devices. This set of tools is called TensorFlow Lite. TensorFlow Lite Converter is used to convert our model in TensorFlow Lite format.", "There is a variant of TensorFlow Lite called TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, a framework specifically designed to run on embedded devices with only a few tens of kilobytes of memory available.", "After the model has been converted, it\u2019s ready to deploy. We use TensorFlow Lite for microcontroller\u2019s C++ library to load the model to device and make predictions. Since this is part where our model meets our application code, we need to write some code that takes raw input data from sensors and converts it into the same format that our model was trained on. Then this transformed data is passed into the model, which is then used to make predictions.", "TinyML enables us to integrate a machine learning model into a C++ program to create powerful apps for deploying on low memory and low-power devices. Microcontrollers are everywhere, there are around 250 billion microcontrollers present in different devices around us. Imagine what power they give us if they are powered by this tiny human like intelligence?", "Your home for data science.
