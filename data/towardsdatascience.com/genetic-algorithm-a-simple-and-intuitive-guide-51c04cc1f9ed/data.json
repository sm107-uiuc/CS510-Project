Before diving into Genetic Algorithm (GA), I will explain what metaheuristic algorithms are, and why we use them sometimes instead of traditional optimization algorithms. Afterwards, I will introduce the metaheuristic algorithm GA, and explain how it works and the intuition behind it.", "Metaheuristics are powerful optimization algorithms that are not problem dependent \u2014 this means that their frameworks are not designed specifically for a certain problem but you can use them for pretty much any optimization problem (unlike heuristics that are usually adapted to the problem at hand).", "Many metaheuristics are inspired by nature. For example, the algorithm simulated annealing is inspired by the process of heating then slowly cooling metal or glass. Another example is ant colony optimization which mimics the way ants behave when travelling to a food source and communicating with each other through pheromones.", "Traditional optimization algorithms such as greedy algorithms, branch and bound, and Dantzig\u2019s simplex algorithm, among others, have shortcomings. Here are just a few of the important reasons on why we would tend to prefer metaheuristics over traditional optimization algorithms:", "Short answer: it is faster than traditional algorithms and can handle larger problems.", "To explain this point, let\u2019s take the example of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a widely used optimization problem that suggests there is a salesman who has to travel to n cities, passing through each city only once, then returns to the origin city from which they left. The question given is what route should they travel (from which city to which city) that would minimize the distance traveled?", "Let\u2019s say that you want to solve a certain TSP with 6 cities, with distances given in the image on the left (Figure 1). As it can be seen, the distance between city A and city B is 4 units of distance.", "Here, you need to find the optimal route the salesman should take to minimize the distance traveled. The optimal route in this case would be if they traveled from D to C to A to B to E, then back to D (since you return to the origin city), this distance would come out to 41 units (7+11+4+6+13=41), whereas if the salesman were to take the worst route possible, in this case it would be E to A to D to B to C, then back to E, the total distance would come out to 53 units, which is a longer distance to travel than the optimal 41 units. Keep in mind that D to C to A to B to E, then back to D would be the same as going from A to B to E to D to C, then back to A, because a single route is a closed loop; you can start from any point in the loop and end with the same point and the distance traveled would be the same.", "For n cities, the number of possible route combinations would be ((n-1)!)/2. It is (n-1) because it does not matter which city you start at, and it is divided by 2 only if the distances between the cities are symmetrical (i.e. the distance between city A and city B is equal to the distance between city B and city A). In the case of asymmetry, the number of possible combinations would be (n-1)!. In our example of 6 cities, where all distances are symmetrical, the total number of combinations would be ((6\u20131)!)/2 which would be 60 possible combinations.", "Metaheuristic algorithms find ways to go from a solution to a better one without considering every combination out there; it chooses better solutions than the one in hand, and updates it according to some rules (points #2 and #3 should explain this better).", "Short answer: it can avoid getting stuck in a local minima and escape it because it uses randomness (or random numbers) to accept worse moves (larger f(x) for minimization problems) because they may lead better answers (i.e. a better local minima or a global minima).", "When you are tackling an optimization problem, you are always either trying to minimize an objective function such as total distance traveled, or maximize an objective function such as profit.", "For minimization problems, you will often hear the terms local minima and global minima (local optima and global optima for maximization problems). Let\u2019s take a look at Figure 2 on the left where x1 is a local minima and x2 is a global minima. Let\u2019s assume we have a function f(x) where if you input x1, we will get f(x)=10, and if we input x2, we will get f(x)=6, clearly x2 is a better input than x1 because 6 is lower than 10 which is better for our minimization problem. Whatever the function f(x) is, it just asks: what should x be to get the lowest possible f(x)?", "Imagine you started on a point to the left of x1, where x=2 (Figure 3), and you would like to use a greedy algorithm to minimize your f(x) function. Greedy algorithms tend to only update x if it gives you a better answer, in our case, a lower f(x). Now we try x=2.1, f(x=2.1) is lower than f(x=2), so our new x would become 2.1. There is still room for improvement so we continue doing this until we get to x1 where f(x=3).", "However, if we wanted to increase x to 3.1, you can see that it gives a higher f(x), as shown in Figure 5. Because of this, the best x for the greedy algorithm would be when x is equal to 3 (at x1).", "By looking at the image (Figure 4), it is clearly shown that x2 is even a better choice than x1 to lower f(x) but when dealing with real problems, the search space is not known and you need to try out many, many values for x to be able to draw a search space like the Figure. Even with this, since the values for x take on an infinite number of possibilities, finding the value of x that would yield the best result is sometimes impossible. However, if we were to have an upper bound and a lower bound for x, finding the global minima (the best solution) could be possible.", "Going back to why we use metaheuristics, with greedy algorithms, when our x became x1, which has a value of 3, any other update would give a worse f(x) so the best solution found would be f(x=3) and the algorithm would terminate. With metaheuristics, we sometimes accept worse moves (in the case of the image when x=3.1). The reason we are okay with accepting worse moves is that they have the potential to lead us to even better solutions, such as x=x2. If we continued updating x towards the top of the hill, we will be able to descend back and find x2 where f(x2)<f(x1).", "Note: if we were to calculate all possible solutions for a problem, we would not care about getting stuck in a local minima because we could just pick the best answer from all combinations and that would give us the global minima, however, as discussed earlier, as a problem grows larger, so does the time it takes to compute all possible solutions.", "If you take a look back at Figure 2\u20134, you would only see one variable (x) that we are trying to find the best value for it to give us the lowest f(x) possible. However, in real-life problems, you will have a much larger number of variables to optimize (find the best value for each variable). In Figure 5, we have 2 variables that need optimization (x and y) where the f(x) would be on the z-axis. This case, and the previous one, can easily be solved by just looking at the plots. However, when you have more than 2 variables, it would be impossible to draw and solve by looking at the graphs because you cannot draw more than 3 dimensions.", "Short answer: when especially dealing with a population-based search method, you will have many solutions at once all over your search space. This means you will be able to evaluate many points or solutions rather than having one solution and updating only that.", "With metaheuristics, your algorithm is either a neighborhood (or local) search algorithm or a population-based one. If your algorithm is neighborhood search it means you have one point, or solution, throughout your search and you update that solution as your algorithm is running. Since it is a metaheuristic, the solution is able to escape if it gets stuck in a local minima and this keeps on going until the algorithm terminates and you converge to a final solution, as seen in Figure 6. As your algorithm approaches the end of its search, the probability of accepting worse moves becomes smaller, this is because your algorithm needs to converge towards a better solution. Examples of neighborhood search algorithms are simulated annealing and Tabu search.", "For population-based search algorithms, you would have multiple solutions at once in your search space, like a \u201cpopulation\u201d of them (Figure 7), where with each iteration your algorithm takes, a certain number of them would update and become new solutions. Each population-based search algorithm has its own rules on how it selects solutions to update and how that update goes about. Population-based search algorithms tend to be very powerful because you can explore various points in your search space rather than one, and at the end, when your algorithm terminates, you can select the best solution from the last update in which it converged to, or, keep track of all updates and select the best out of all. Examples of population-based search algorithms are GA (which will be discussed shortly), evolutionary strategies, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization.", "While traditional algorithms are able to work just fine on small problems, we tend to prefer metaheuristics over them when the problem is large thus requiring more time. Metaheuristics are able to avoid getting stuck in a local minima. Although when dealing with a very large problem, such as unbounded problems , where each decision variable can take on any real number, your search space will be infinitely large, therefore, you may not be able to find the global minima, even with metaheuristics, but you will find a good local minima that would suffice. Lastly, population-based search algorithms have the great advantage of searching various points in the search space which increases the algorithm\u2019s chance of finding a better local minima or the global minima.", "GA is a population-based metaheuristic developed by John Holland in the 1970s. GA uses techniques inspired from nature, more specifically evolution, to find an optimal or near-optimal solution towards a problem. It applies evolution concepts such as reproduction and survival of the fittest to solve a problem. GA belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms.", "If I were to try and explain GA in a few sentences, I would say that GA is a way to optimize a problem by creating many solutions and updating those solutions in certain ways related to evolution concepts to reach a \u201cgood enough\u201d solution or the best solution possible.", "In continuous problems, where the decision variable you want to find the optimal value for takes on real numbers, a solution in GA would look like what is shown in Figure 8. This is called a chromosome (sometimes referred to as a string). Each square below is called a \u201cgene\u201d while the value each gene takes is called an \u201callele\u201d.", "In real-life problems, most decision variables are constrained and bounded, so that it does not take a value of infinity (which is not a real number). For example, if you had an optimization problem that wanted to maximize the profit (or minimize the cost) for a certain company, it may ask you what is the maximum number of labor hours we can set, usually given other conditions. You may be first inclined to say that we can have an infinite number of hours, but since that is not feasible, the company would tend to set a maximum limit per month, for example, it may say that the number of hours per week should not exceed 120, therefore, the lower bound of the number of hours (x) would be 0 and the upper bound would be 120 (0\u2264x\u2264120).", "Now that we can place the decision variable x between bounds, calculating a real number for the hours can be found.", "For the chromosome in Figure 9, or any other GA chromosome encoded with 0s and 1s (in the case of continuous problems), each gene will be represented with 2^i (2 to the power of i, where i starts at 0, on the far right, and is increased by 1 the more you have genes in the chromosome, i.e. 2\u2070, 2\u00b9, 2\u00b2, 2\u00b3, \u2026, 2^i).", "For the second part of Formula 1, the precision, the equation is given in Formula 2, below, where l is the length of the chromosome, in our case it would be 9, since we have 9 genes, b is the upper bound, which we have as 120 (given in the example as the maximum number of hours allowed), and a is the lower bound which is 0. The precision now would be (120\u20130)/(2\u2079-1) which is equal to 0.234833, therefore decoding the chromosome would be 418*0.234833+0 which is 98.16 hours \u2014 a value between 0 and 120.", "The chromosome representation (encoding) is called a \u201cgenotype\u201d while the decoded value of the chromosome is called a \u201cphenotype\u201d.", "Note: the length of the chromosome (l) is set by the user. The longer the string the more accurate your decoded value is, but there is a trade-off with computational time.", "Say we had a minimization problem that we need to find the best values for x and y that would give us the lowest f(x). How would you represent that? Simple, we will have a chromosome where half of the genes represent x, and the other half represent y. Keep in mind that for each x and y, the gene that represents the start of each one would have a corresponding value of 2\u2070.", "See Figure 10, where the green genes represent x and the blue genes represent y, they both occupy the same string but they should be treated separately when decoding each to get its corresponding value. You decode each the exact same way shown above. The same principle applies for when you have more than two decision variables.", "Besides the terminologies above such as chromosome, genes, alleles, genotype, and phenotype, here I explain a few others, where their explanations might intertwine with each other:", "1- Population: when we say population, it means a set of solutions at a certain generation (gen). Remember that GA is a population-based search algorithm, this means that at every time (gen), we have several solutions in our search space. All have the potential of updating and becoming new solutions. In GA, the population size remains constant throughout the search, so if your population size is 100, you will have 100 solutions in each gen, each is a chromosome or string that can be decoded to a certain value.", "Figure 11 shows an example of a population size of 10 (population size is usually much higher than 10, but I used 10 for illustration purposes), each with a chromosome size of 8. All of the 10 chromosomes are filled with 0s and 1s (I only show the first 4 filled, also for illustration purposes, but they will all be filled with 0s and 1s).", "Important note: the initial population that you want to start your algorithm with is chosen at random. You initially set the length of the chromosome and how many chromosomes you want in the population (population size), and randomly fill in 0s and 1s, this is the case for your first generation. The population in the subsequent generation is the result of manipulating and updating the population from the previous generation, i.e. create a random population for gen #1, the resulting offspring becomes the population for gen #2, then their offspring become the population for gen #3, and so on.", "2- Generation: your algorithm will run for gen generations before terminating. Each generation will have the same population size but with different solutions (some might stay the same as the previous generation). Before going to the next generation (e.g. from gen #1 to gen #2), you will need to update your current population with the crossover and mutation operators to create new solutions (offspring) in the search space. After you get a new set of solutions equal to the population size, you then go to the next generation and start over using the new solutions as your population.", "3- Parents and offspring: in each generation, your current population are all potential parents that have some chance to \u201cmate\u201d and produce \u201coffspring\u201d, i.e. a chance to become a parent. These offspring are the new set of solutions that will go on to become the population for the next generation, then their offspring will become the population for the generation after that, and so on. Think of it as how we have generations in real life.", "GA is inspired by evolution and survival of the fittest, which means that in order to produce offspring, 2 chromosomes or \u201cparents\u201d will reproduce and create 2 offspring or \u201cchildren\u201d.", "Since we are looking for good or the best solution(s) to a problem, we need to try and make our new and updated solutions come from good ones.", "There will be a parent selection method that we will apply to the population to find 2 good solutions, which will be the 2 parents, and apply an operator called crossover on the selected parents to produce the children. So how can we make sure we select 2 good solutions to be the parents?", "First, you need to know that just because a solution (chromosome) is not good compared to the rest in the population, it does not mean it will not get picked as a parent, it only means that it has a lower chance of getting picked. There are many parent selection methods developed, but the two widely used are tournament selection and roulette wheel selection.", "1- Tournament selection: the idea is straightforward, you randomly select k solutions from the population (with or without replacement), where you set the value k, and pick the best one to be parent #1, then repeat by picking another k solutions and choosing the best one to be parent #2. Simple, right? But how do you know which is best? You know by comparing their corresponding objective function value as to say which chromosome is the best choice for your f(x).", "Example: let\u2019s take the Booth function f(x,y)=(x+2y-7)\u00b2+(2x+y-5)\u00b2 as a minimization problem in which x and y are both bounded by -10\u2264x,y\u226410, where -10 and 10 are the lower bound (a) and upper bound (b), respectively. We want to know what are the values of x and y that would give us the lowest f(x).", "Now we want to select parents to produce offspring, and we set k=3. We randomly select 3 chromosomes from the population we have, then we decode each chromosome to the actual values of x and y. Starting with the first randomly selected chromosome, if x after decoding was 2.1, for example, and y after decoding was 3.6, we plug these values in f(x) and we get f(x)=(2.1+2*3.6-7)\u00b2+(2*2.1+3.6\u20135)\u00b2, which is equal to 13.13. Then we try another chromosome that was selected and find that, through the same procedure, its f(x) is, for example, 8.32, then the last chromosome we selected and its f(x) is 16.84. Since it is a minimization problem, we need the lowest f(x) as the better solution, therefore, the chromosome that gave us 8.32 outperformed the other two that gave us 13.13 and 16.84, so this would be parent #1, this is illustrated in Figure 12. And to find parent #2, we repeat the exact thing. f(x) for any chromosome is called the fitness, fitness value, or objective function value.", "So, the tournament selection method is applied using the following steps:", "2- Roulette wheel selection: the fitness (f(x)) of a chromosome is used to associate a probability to select the parents. For maximization problems, the higher f(x), the higher the probability it will get to be selected. See Figure 13 as an example, there are 5 solutions in the population that we need to select from. The probability is based on how good the solution is compared to the rest, the higher the probability, the higher the chance of getting selected, which is the survival of the fittest theory but still giving some chance for worse solutions to be selected.", "To get the probabilities for each solution, you add all the fitness values (f(x)) together to get the total and divide each f(x) by the total to get a percentage of how much it occupies from the total. Then, you select a random number, which is between 0 and 1, and select the solution to be parent #1 from the probabilities set. If the 5 solutions get probabilities 5%, 12%, 14%, 31%, and 38%, based on their fitness, and your random number comes out to be 0.89, then it will be in the range of 0.62 and 1.00 which would make us choose the chromosome #3, which had a probability of 38% of being selected. If our random number came out to be 0.16, then we would choose chromosome #4, which has the probability of 12%. As you can see in Figure 14, the range is based on the cumulative sum of the probabilities.", "Okay, but what happens if we have a minimization problem?", "With maximization problems, the probability of a chromosome is relative to its fitness value which makes the higher the fitness, the better, and the higher the probability. But if we had a minimization problem, the smaller fitness the better but we need to associate it with a higher probability, how? There are many ways you can do this, one way I choose is to take the invert of each fitness value, f(x), so that when you take the invert of the lowest number and compare it to the invert of the others, it would be the highest.", "Now that we have 2 parents, the next step is to perform the crossover operator and create offspring or children. There are many ways to do crossover, here I will explain the two methods commonly used:", "Important note: I will be using letters instead of 0s and 1s to show you how it works because explaining with 0s and 1s could cause confusion.", "When we have the 2 parents, we apply the single-point crossover by randomly selecting a cutoff point. You can do this by selecting a random integer to specify where the crossover will happen. Example, let\u2019s say that our random integer came out to be 6 (this depends on what programming language you will use as Python, for example, starts indexing at 0). So the genes after the cutoff point will be exchanged between the two parents. See Figure 15, the [R, Z, P] from parent #1 will interchange with the [A, F, W] from parent #2 and this will create the offspring: child #1 and child #2.", "The idea is the same as single-point crossover but instead of randomly selecting one integer, we select two and exchange what is in between. In Figure 16, the two-point crossover made us exchange [T, B, L] with [P, S, D] to create the offspring. You can either have the two random integers differ from each other by an if or while statement, or you can allow the integers, by chance, to be the same, but if this happens, it will become a single-point crossover. This is based on the user\u2019s preference.", "Note: the crossover operator can be done based on a probability, so that you won\u2019t preform crossover every time, however, most studies tend to apply a probability of 1 (100%) with crossover ensuring the operator will happen after every time parents are selected.", "To create diversity in the search space, the mutation operator is introduced at a certain probability (usually low, e.g. 0.1 or 0.01). Mutation is applied on the children after creating them from crossing over the two parents.", "The way to do this is straightforward: you start with child #1 and go through each gene one by one. You start at the first gene, and get a random number, if the random number is less than the probability of mutation, you mutate, else, move to the next gene and apply another random number and so on. But what happens when we do mutate? Simple, if the gene you want to mutate has a 0 as its value, it would become 1, and if the gene had the value of 1, it would become a 0. Look at Figure 17, the red boxes indicate which genes will be mutated and the green boxes show the result of mutation. Since the probability of mutation is low, not many (or even zero) genes will mutate.", "The below flowchart, Figure 18, is a flowchart I personally developed for GA when using tournament selection as a parent selection method. I found almost all of the flowcharts that are online a bit difficult for beginners to understand. Notations in the flowchart are as following: M is the number of generations, N is the population size, p_c is the probability of crossover, p_m is the probability of mutation, and k is the number of chromosomes selected at random during tournament selection.", "At first, we select the number of generations (M), population size (N), probability of crossover (p_c), probability of mutation (p_m), and number of chromosomes to be selected for tournament selection (k). Let\u2019s say we set M=100, N=120, p_c=1.00, p_m=0.10, and k=3. Our problem we want to solve is a continuous minimization problem.", "Congratulations! You now know what GA is and how it works!", "GA is a powerful population-based search metaheuristic algorithm. It is inspired by evolution and its concepts such as reproduction and survival of the fittest.", "In this explanation, I covered how GA is applied to continuous optimization problems where the chromosomes are represented (encoded) with 0s and 1s. We learnt how to decode a chromosome into an actual value and how to select parents, perform crossover to produce children, and how to mutate them. A flowchart and a step by step guide on how the GA algorithm is executed have also been thoroughly explained.", "Final note: the same principles of crossover and mutation can be applied to combinatorial problems, such as the TSP, where what you want to optimize are not decision variables that take on real numbers but discrete elements, such as traveler or vehicle routes. Although the idea behind crossover and mutation would be the same for combinatorial problems, the way we apply them is slightly different, because you do not want to end up with a traveler\u2019s path like [A, D, B, D], where city D is mentioned twice and city C is not included in the path, and this may happen if you use the continuous crossover or mutation methods on discrete problems.", "\u00a9 2020 Dana Bani-Hani \u2014 articles, codes, and images developed by Dana Bani-Hani should not be used without permission and proper citation.", "Holland, John Henry.
