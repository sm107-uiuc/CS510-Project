There are two components to it \u2014 the \u201cVolume\u201d and the \u201cChirp\u201d.", "The Volume (see Figure 1) is a value of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, displayed as a volume bar to indicate the \u201cloudness\u201d of the chatter on various social media platforms. If it is a 3 or 4, it\u2019s considered trending high enough to warrant a Chirp (see Figure 4), which is essentially key phrase extraction of collected and processed social media content. We use PyTextRank, an open-source implementation of TextRank, to do the phrase extraction for these high-volume chirps, which is a graph-based algorithm based on PageRank (a way that Google ranks webpages). The chirp is then comprised of the top phrases that the algorithm comes up with, representative of the initial \u201cword on the street\u201d of a patch.", "The following sections describe how each of these elements are derived.", "We begin by scanning social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit daily for any comments (tweets, submissions, etc.) that mention a patch, keying off the patch ID. We then collect the text of the comments, as well as additional factors including retweets, upvotes, likes, and downvotes. If there is enough popularity or chatter about a patch, it gets aggregated and scored. The score itself is an internal calculation, based on summarizations of platform-specific features which include the likes and upvotes.", "The score also accounts for the source of the comment in order to decrease any bias that may be caused by patch release update \u201cannouncements\u201d that are generated by popular authors (such as Microsoft Help). The reason this step is needed is that often a large list of patches will be mentioned simultaneously (e.g. \u201cLatest Releases\u201d) which are devoid of any content containing the user\u2019s experience with a patch, but since it was released by someone with a larger following, it may inspire irrelevant discussion (see Figure 2). An example of this would be \u201cMicrosoft releases October patch update for patches kb1234, kb4567, \u2026\u201d, followed by several comments such as \u201cGreat. Here we go again.\u201d A flurry of activity like this can take away from the actual content that has more meaning, such as \u201cHas anyone had problems with kb1234?\u201d followed by \u201ckb1234 is causing me a Blue Screen of Death.\u201d", "Once the scores are created, we use them to calculate \u201cranks\u201d. Scores are bucketed into 5 ranks (0\u20134), based on boundaries set by incremental growth of upper and lower scores by day (accounting for the increase in daily accumulation). See Figure 3.", "A chatter volume rank of 0 indicates the patch has not been mentioned at all, whereas a score of 1, 2, or 3 falls within the bounds displayed in Figure 3, sectioned off into percentage splits of the scores. A rank of 4 falls above the top bound and indicates a good deal of interaction from people on social media with the comments. A rank of 4 could imply anything from issues and warnings to the critical status or relevance of a patch. The volume is merely indicative of the magnitude of chatter that is detected on an aggregate of social media platforms.", "If a patch gets ranked as a 3 or 4, a text summarization process (which includes standard NLP text pre-processing) is triggered to provide key phrase extraction of the social media content collected for it. The method involved is an unsupervised, extractive summarization technique called TextRank. The specific library used is PyTextRank, which is a Python implementation of TextRank as a spaCy pipeline extension.", "The TextRank algorithm, a graph based, vertex (node) ranking algorithm, begins with tokenizing the text and annotating the tokens with parts of speech tags. The vertices are a subset of the tokens, chosen based on their part of speech. An edge is added to the graph for each instance where words co-occur within a window of N words (this is represented by the adjacency matrix in Figure 5). The ranking algorithm runs on the graph until convergence and a final score is obtained for each node. The algorithm is inspired by PageRank, which was developed by Larry Page, one of the founders of Google, used to rank websites. Adjacency between words in the text is analogous to a web page transition probability. We use PyTextRank, which constructs the graph as a lemma graph to represent links among candidate words and their supporting language by tokenizing, tagging parts of speech, using co-occurrence windowing, then using NetworkX to compute TextRank on the graph.", "This graph algorithm is based on use of eigenvector centrality to compute the \u201ccentrality\u201d, or approximate importance, of each node in a graph. It\u2019s a measure of the \u201cinfluence\u201d of a node in a network based on global information drawn from the entire graph. For a keyword/phrase extraction application such as the Patch Chirp, the task is to automatically identify a set of terms or phrases that best represent the collection of comments made about a patch.", "Once these centrality scores are computed, they are used in post-processing to create the phrases: the Patch Chirps. Words with high ranks are marked in the text and sequences comprised of highly ranked words are collapsed into a multi-word phrase. An example of this would be if we had a comment such as \u201cthis patch is causing installation issues\u201d. If both \u201cinstallation\u201d and \u201cissues\u201d are selected as keywords by the TextRank algorithm, they are collapsed into the phrase \u201cinstallation issues\u201d due to their adjacency and rank.", "1- Rada Mihalcea, Paul Tarau, \u201cTextRank: Bringing Order into Text\u201d (2004), Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing", "Thank you to Tony Workman for feedback about the article.", "Your home for data science.
