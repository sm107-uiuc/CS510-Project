While it\u2019s true that a computer can perform millions of calculation much faster than the human brain, humans can perform much more complex activities like showing emotions, balancing their bodies in highly difficult terrains, and adapting to changing environments and times. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tries to bridge the gap between what the human brain and a computer can do.", "One of the most successful outcomes of this, is the humanoid robot \u2014 Sophia [1], created by Hanson Robotics. The company goes on to say,", "Hanson Robotics\u2019 most advanced human-like robot, Sophia, personifies our dreams for the future of AI. As a unique combination of science, engineering, and artistry, Sophia is simultaneously a human-crafted science fiction character depicting the future of AI and robotics, and a platform for advanced robotics and AI research.", "While it may seem a fictional character and a cool concept, it may not be unreasonable to think that Sophia might even behave like you, if given a chance for a long term interaction with you. Have you ever wondered, what if you have a doppelganger AI who is just like you? It may sound both funny and spooky, but AI research may surely enable it in the near future.", "AI is a very difficult topic, but it\u2019s looking promising. By the first half of 20th century, science fiction movies brought in the concepts of intelligent human-like robots and computers. However, enthusiasts didn\u2019t take this just as a work of fiction. By early 1950s, scientists and researchers started taking interest in AI [2]. One such person was Alan Turing, a highly influential individual in the development of theoretical computer science and the famous \u2014 \u2018Turing machine\u2019. In his 1950 paper, \u201cCOMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE\u201d, Alan Turing asked a question \u2014", "Turing was curious to discover, that if humans can assimilate information from their surrounding to learn and make decisions, why can\u2019t computers do the same ? Since then, AI research has interested a huge numbers of researchers and received enormous funding across the world. According to International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide spending on AI was $37.5 billion in 2019, and is expected to reach $97.9 billion by 2023 [3].", "Today, one of the major implementations of AI, which interacts with humans is through smartphones, laptops, and digital assistants like Siri and Cortana. They not only help you get done with your daily tasks and set reminders, but also learn your habits, your likes and dislikes, and can even detect your mood from your voice and phone usage. In a 2018 Google IO event, Google demonstrated how their assistant was smart enough to make an actual phone call to a saloon, interact with a human on the other side of the call, and schedule an appointment without a single hiccup.", "Though artificial intelligence directly does not comprise of only neural network methods, however neural network and deep learning have become increasingly crucial for the effectiveness of AI [4]. With the advancements in silicon technology, processors have become extremely power efficient, fast and reliable. Moreover, storage technology has evolved a lot over the last decade, where it has become possible to store terabytes of data in blazingly fast pocket-sized SSDs, which was impossible just a couple of years ago.", "This has enabled researchers to build and train large complex neural networks [5] required for AI to emulate human like features such as feelings, and the important act of \u201creasonable decision making\u201d [6]. Also, a huge number of computations can be made on these, not so power hungry processors, which are enabling better battery life for such remote applications. A huge amount of research is also going on in faster and more accurate sensors and their reliable integrations with onboard embedded systems [7], which will enable such AI to be more aware of its surroundings than ever before \u2014 may be even more than a living human !", "Faster and larger storage in a smaller form factor means that a huge amount of information can be stored within the AI hardware. This can be information which was stored by the designers of the AI, but more importantly, it will enable the AI to store information in real time \u2014 information that it experiences on interaction with the environment. This information can be used by the AI in real-time to learn new things \u2014 what is called \u201cself aware AI\u201d [8], that is, it knows what to learn and what not. This will enable such AI to adapt to changes and interact more realistically with the environment.", "5G is beginning to emerge as a super fast network, not only for data consumption, but also near real-time remote control \u2014 thanks to its low latency. This means a lot of the AI decision can be made in the cloud, without the need for local storage. Storing and computing decisions in the cloud will not only help in a more apt decision by the AI due to the \u201calmost infinite\u201d knowledge available [9], but will also help keep track and control of the AI to not perform illegitimate or objectionable tasks. It is worth taking a look at the potential use cases of remote controlling devices using 5G, which was released by Ericsson.", "How can the AI think and make decisions like me ?", "Have you ever talked to your friend about buying an iPhone, and the next moment you see a Google Ad about the latest iPhone? Or were you ever looking to order food, and your favorite dish came up automatically? Or even LinkedIn suggest you a complete message with which you can reply to a connection? \u2014 you surely have experienced this !", "Huge tech companies like Google and Facebook are continuously collecting your data \u2014 what you search, who you talk to, whose posts you like, and even what music your like. This data is used to personalize your experience with their products, to make their products think like you ! But the scope of this information goes much beyond just content personalization.", "This data can be specifically used to train AI to behave and decide like you. With the paradigm of connected devices (smartphones and wearables), data about your sleep pattern till people who matter to you, everything in stored in the cloud. A paper in IEEE [10] also studied the use of Microsoft Kinect, a sensor which detects your posture, for robotic applications. The paper investigated how a robot can be taught indoor navigation by reverse engineering, using data collected from human subjects.", "Such AI, if implemented in a robot, can definitely deceive your colleagues for you in an office meeting. It will not only look and behave like you, but in some aspects may also be smarter than you in decision making \u2014 thanks to the emergence of 5G and the connected devices paradigm, which will enable the AI to stay up to date with the latest happenings. No, I am not saying that our technology is ready enough for such a move, but we may be close. The rate at which AI is developing and attracting researchers, it is not hard to imagine a future with AI all around us. But, this would lead to the next big question, which has been one of the biggest debates of the century !", "All this might seem very cool and helpful to humans for performing tasks and in decision making. But, researchers and the non-scientific community also worry about the potential dangers it may have on us.", "AI is either the best or the worst thing to happen to humanity. ~ Stephen Hawking", "I would like to conclude this article by asking a question \u2014 What would you name your doppelganger? Do let me know in the comments section. I hope you liked this article and it gave you insights on how AI is becoming smart and more aware about its surrounding, and how the data explosion can lead to personalization to such a level, that your office colleagues may mistake your doppelganger for you !
