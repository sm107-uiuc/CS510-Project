They range from simple programs with limited conversational capabilities, to intelligent, conversationally capable bots thanks to advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning.", "Although the complexity of these bots varies greatly, one thing is certain: they\u2019re getting better. One day, speaking to them may be indistinguishable from speaking to another person. This begs the question \u2014 is there a time when we will be able to have meaningful conversations with robots as we do with other humans?", "To answer this question, we\u2019re going to look at:", "Chatbots have existed since 1966. From humble beginnings as text only, to adopting voices and uncanny faces, they have served as information brokers in a variety of industries.", "Recently, Chatbots have gained lots of attention in the media, which is no surprise since they are the most \u201chuman\u201d face of AI so far. But, there is a large variation between how the bots behind this catchall term work.", "Although relatively simple, Chatbots do a good job of responding to common, structured queries. Recent advances in NLP, many of which are based in clever deep learning techniques (such as GloVe, Word2Vec, ELMo, and BERT), have given these bots a more nuanced understanding of language and with it, the ability to respond to a wider range of questions more effectively.", "However, the main utility of these bots is not to have a conversation, but to serve as a means to process and communicate information. We can ask simple questions, and they give simple responses.", "This trend will continue. The purpose of these bots will remain as curators of information, at least for the near future.", "However, as the IoT world becomes more prevalent, these bots may evolve into the medium through which we communicate with our interconnected world \u2014 the middleman between man and machine.", "Evidence of this future already exists.", "The most ubiquitous examples of conversationally capable AI\u2019s are virtual assistants. Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Assistant have found their way out of our phones and into our homes. Their ability to recognize and process natural language queries (\u201cTurn on the lights\u201d \u201cWhat was the final score for the game last night\u201d \u201cOrder two tons of creamed corn\u201d) has gotten more and more impressive.", "We are already seeing the first wave of Chatbot+IoT interaction \u2014 and the adoption rate is staggering. According to this article, over 39 million Americans own a voice activated smart speaker. This is proof that people find value in Natural Language commands, eliminating the need to learn new software and UI to get things done.", "As time goes on, we will be able to orchestrate more of the world around us with little more than a command \u2014 think Tony Stark and JARVIS.", "One day, we will be able to command cyber-physical objects to do our bidding, just through the power of our voices.", "Yet, the role of the bot remains unchanged: a servant that processes and delivers information. But, progress is being made. At this rate, NLP and AI will eventually progress to the point where talking to a bot feels as natural as speaking to another person, we may not look at them solely as tools, but also as companions. A bot like this, by definition, will pass the Turing Test. From here, things get slightly more theoretical, and much more speculative.", "\u201cThe Turing test, developed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine\u2019s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.\u201d", "This test was initially designed to judge a text-only conversation \u2014 no speech or facial expressions required. Unlike traditional tests, there is no rigorous grading rubric or scoring system; the Turing Test serves as a useful benchmark to base our current progress against.", "Alan Turing originally came up with his famous test as a result of pondering the question:", "Credible arguments (which we will explore in Part 2) have been laid out on both sides. However, it can be argued that the act of thinking is irrelevant. Do machines need to understand what we say to come up with an adequate response, or just know what to say in response without truly understanding what the meaning of their words are? Many argue the latter, an argument founded on the basis that intelligence is just information processing in a physical system, no \u201cthinking\u201d required.", "A somewhat similar question can be framed as follows: do late night conversations \u2014 ones about life, the universe, desires, motivations, spirituality \u2014 need to come from a biologically motivated, thinking being? Or can a machine muse with us all the same, interjecting with insights from its internal model of reality?", "These questions are surprisingly deep. The answer to what a \u201cmeaningful conversation\u201d is depends what is required from the other party, and is different from person to person. Some people are happy to monologue, only needing a periodic affirmation that the other party is still listening. Others, however, need answers to their questions, opinions, and new perspectives to help guide their thoughts. While some people are easily satisfied, the majority of people fall in category two. And, for a machine to meaningfully contribute to a conversation that complex, it needs to have General Intelligence.", "Artificial General Intelligence (explained in this amazing blog post), is a term used to describe a machine that has intelligence on par with your average human. This means across all domains \u2014 problem solving, reasoning, learning ability, appreciation of art, understanding of science, humor, etc\u2026", "In other words, what a bot that passes the Turing Test fools you into believing it is, this bot really is. However, not every aspect of General Intelligence is relevant to our question. The only things it needs to have in common with us are:", "These are (more or less) the essential elements that give humans the ability to converse about abstract, grand, and subjective topics. The way we talk about religion, emotion, art, meaning, and other \u201chuman\u201d values is purely based on the way our brain interprets the world around us, and how we reason through that understanding. It would be no shocker to say that a machine needs to do the same to contribute to such a discussion in a meaningful way, at least one that we can connect with.", "But, there is another obstacle even if all 3 conditions are met. An Artificial General Intelligence with the same knowledge and reasoning ability as us will still have much higher processing speed. Due to the difference between the processing speed of our biological brains and computer chips, this bot could potentially accomplish years worth of thinking in minutes. At that point, does a conversation become pointless? Yes, it might even be boring. There is beauty in not knowing, and in searching for answers. Consulting an oracle takes away from the joy of exploring a question.", "In theory, a superior intelligence could act dumber than it is in order to effectively communicate with us, just as humans use simple words and gestures to communicate with animals. In this case, it is possible to have a meaningful conversation with a machine. If you\u2019ve ever visited a psychologist, you quickly realize that they don\u2019t just flat out tell you the answers, but instead guide you through their analysis of your current state, and help lead you to solutions, a machine could theoretically do the same.", "Rest assured that in todays world, nothing like this exists; not even close. We humans (more specifically, our brains) are the only Generally Intelligent things we know of (and nothing\u2019s to say an Artificial General Intelligence needs to look or work in remotely the same way).", "In short, to get to a machine that we can have a meaningful conversation with, it needs to know as much as we do, have the same level of reasoning, but also think at the same speed. Such a sweet spot is pretty much impossible to hit, let alone sustain. Progress is exponential, and even if such a machine exists one day, it will soon be surpassed.", "So, there lies our answer. It may be disappointing, but absent of the illusion of a superior intelligence dumbing itself down on purpose, our robot buddies may never be in a spot where we can consider ourselves intellectually similar enough to have a meaningful conversation.", "Today\u2019s technology is an unmistakable precursor to the robot companions of the future. While we may not know what consciousness truly is, and whether a machine can ever experience it, it probably doesn\u2019t matter to answering the question \u201cWhen can we have a meaningful conversation with a machine?\u201d.", "Due to the differences in all the factors of intelligence between man and machine, it is unlikely there ever will be a time where we can meaningfully converse with a robot. However, that doesn\u2019t stop us from having beneficial relationships with them. Just as we have bonds with other objects \u2014 cars, houses, other possessions that hold either utility or sentimental value, our AI friends can be part of that list and hold a special place for us one day, both personally and as a society.", "So, in conclusion, you\u2019re probably better off just making real friends for now.", "This is Part 1 of a two part story. Part 1 aimed to answer the title question; Part 2 will focus more deeply on the philosophy of machine thinking, emotion, and consciousness.
