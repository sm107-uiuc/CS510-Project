It has been around for quite a while but its relevance is still as high as ever. People say it is the diamond of emerging technologies. But is it really worth the praise? Data science has powered other technologies to push the boundaries of futuristic tech further than we can ever imagine, birthed a brand new field, Business Intelligence, created the awareness of the importance of data and data collection and so much more. In this story, I am going to discuss with you what makes Data science an attractive field for most people seeking to enter the tech space. We will go through its many pros and talk about the downsides involved in the field too.", "My personal favorite reason for entering the field of Data science is because it is very interesting. You get to see things from a whole different level that most people cannot see, you get to understand why things end up the way they do and you get to look into the future in order to make crucial decisions to stop something from happening or to increase the possibility of something happening. Being a data scientist makes you somewhat of a superhero, and you learn amazing things every day if you are really passionate about it and have the willingness to learn.", "\u201cAim for simplicity in Data Science. Real creativity won\u2019t make things more complex. Instead, it will simplify them.\u201d\u2015 Damian Duffy Mingle", "Being a data scientist practically means you can take really complex problems and break them down into very simple bits so everyone around you can understand and find ways around. This can be done when one keeps an open mind and reaches out to the creative person within. With creativity comes simplicity and when things are made simple, one can easily notice core problems and easily find solutions.", "Data science is a rapidly growing field because of the powerful impact it brings to companies. The demand for data scientists has skyrocketed over the last few years but the supply for good and quality Data scientists is rather increasing at a much slower pace. About 3 years ago, a research study by professionals at IBM predicted that by 2020, the demand for data science jobs and all other jobs under it will soar by 28%. Many people by then saw that as a joke, seeing as most emerging technologies gradually die out. Data science kept growing because it had potential, it still does. As a matter of fact, data science has changed the way we view the business world. It has brought so much value to businesses that any company that works in the business sector feels incomplete without a Data scientist or Data Science team. Data science is not stopping at the Business sector, it has stretched into the science and technology sector and has now become the backbone of every company that handles Big Data. Data science is not dying soon, it is birthing more technologies by the day. I don\u2019t think anyone who takes the bold step to learn to become a Data scientist will regret, just do it, it may be the best decision you\u2019ll ever make.", "Although data science salaries depend largely on the level of expertise and years of experience, even entry-level positions pay quite well as compared to other fields of technology. A study on Data science salaries and factors that influence it by Professors at Wisconsin University shows that are so many things that influence the salary ranges of data scientists. The most paid data scientists work with companies from the USA and the least paid to be from companies in Africa and Asia. However, it may come as a shock to you when you find out that what is considered as a small salary of a Data scientist working for a small company is relatively larger compared to the salaries of other people from other fields. If you are someone who is considerate about the money involved, go for it.", "Data scientists are rare, especially when it comes to having the right combination of education and skills. At the most basic level, data scientists must know how to write code. In fact, the highest data scientist salaries belong to those who code four to eight hours per week; the lowest salaries belong to those who don\u2019t code at all.", "Another thing that makes data science so popular is that it accepts people of all sorts, regardless of their background and domain. People in literally any industry can move into data science and still do amazing work in their industry with the help of data science. People from the banking and finance industry, food and health sector, arts, climate science, engineering, and physics can all couple their domain knowledge and expertise with data science and make ground-breaking progress. You do not necessarily need to have a BSc or MSc in computer science or engineering in order to start a career in data science but rather couple data science with whatever career you currently have, find a problem you can solve with the combination of both and do something.", "Data science in combination with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and the Internet of Things has the power to literally automate anything in order to make lives easy. Automation of tasks can also bring huge progress to companies since work can now be done faster. Also, when work is done by humans, there is a natural tendency to be inconsistent and make human-related errors. Automating tasks handles these problems and gives us better results in a shorter time. Dangerous and very tedious tasks can also be automated to reduce work-related accidents. Finally, tasks that require extreme precision can be best handled by automated objects like robots since human beings struggle to achieve a good level of precision when handling certain tasks like surgeries.", "Working as a Data scientist is a very prestigious position in any company. Data scientists are generally seen as people who make certain decisions based on inferences they make from the data they have and the decisions they make are very crucial in saving the company from collapsing or increasing the general success of the company. It is not easy to have this much power in your hands in any company, it requires experience and expertise and that is what makes the position a very prestigious one.", "With everything we have discussed, it may seem there are no downsides to being a data scientist. In reality, there are quite a few downsides or problems people in this field encounter. Let us discuss the most relevant ones.", "\u201cSometimes the job of a data scientist is to know when you don\u2019t know enough.\u201d\u2015 Cathy O\u2019Neil", "Data Science is a field that is constantly growing and being developed. New tools and technologies are being developed every single day to make work easy and fast. Being a Data Scientist directly means you have signed up for a life long learning trip and as such, you must be willing to learn every single day of your career. Being in a process of constant learning means you can almost never master whatever you are learning, you may become very proficient at what you do but definitely not a master of it. Dedication and consistency are very important if one is determined to become very proficient in the field.", "In my previous article, Developing A Good Attitude Towards Data Science, I spoke about how essential domain knowledge is in the data science world. I want to add a bit more to the things I stated there. Domain knowledge is what brings value to you as a data scientist. Without domain knowledge, you are just someone who plays with data with no understanding of what the data means. Domain knowledge is what leads you to make good and valuable inferences from your data. There are no two ways about having a good domain knowledge before entering the field of data science, it is absolutely essential and you can not do without it.", "Data science is powered by data. However, your methods of collecting and retaining data have to comply with the general ethics of data privacy. Some people in this field overlook the ethics of data privacy and use unethical and unorthodox methods to collect data. It should be noted however that breaching data privacy laws are serious legal crimes and are punishable by law. Most often, we might find the need to access and use data from other people who could be customers and clients which are out of bounds to us. When this happens, the best thing to do will be to let those people sign a contract that explicitly gives you the right to use their data. If the rights given to you do not explicitly state that you are allowed to access and use their data, you can be sued and punished by a court if you are caught infringing on the data privacy laws.", "It should be noted that everything I wrote about in this story is my opinion on things and opinions are subject to change. I shall edit or remove any part of this writing if my attention is drawn to a mistake I made or to a contribution I should add.", "Thank you for making time to read this story.

Happy Hacking!", "A big thank you to Anna Ayiku for proofreading and correcting the many mistakes I made writing this.", "Your home for data science.
