You should not rely on an author\u2019s works without seeking professional advice. See our Reader Terms for details.", "After Iron and Aluminium, Copper is one of the most consumed metals in the World. An extremely versatile metal, Copper\u2019s electrical and thermal conductivity, antimicrobial, and corrosion-resistant properties lend the metal to widespread application in most sectors of the economy. From power infrastructure, homes, and factories to electronics and medical equipment, the global economic dependency on Copper is so profound that it is sometimes referred to as \u2018Dr. Copper\u2019, and is often cited as such by market and commodity analysts because of the metal\u2019s ability to assess global economic health and activity.", "From a trading perspective, Copper pricing is determined by the supply and demand dynamics on the metal exchanges, particularly the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) COMEX. The price Copper trades at, however, is affected by innumerable factors, many of which are very difficult to measure concurrently :", "As well as the aforementioned fundamental factors, Copper\u2019s price can also be artificially influenced by hedge funds, investment institutions, bonded metal, and even domestic trading. From a systematic trading point of view, this makes for a very challenging situation when we want to develop a predictive model.", "Short-term opportunities can exist however, in relation to events that are announced in the form of news. The spot and forward price of Copper has been buffeted throughout the US-China trade war and like all markets, responds almost instantly to major news announcements.", "Caught early enough, NLP-based systematic trading models can capitalize on these short-term price movements through parsing the announcements as a vector of tokens, evaluating the underlying sentiment, and subsequently taking a position prior to the anticipated (if applicable) price move, or, during the movement in the hope of capitalizing on a potential correction.", "In this article, we are going to scrape historical (and current) tweets from a variety of financial news publications Twitter feeds. We will then analyse this data in order to understand the underlying sentiment behind each tweet, develop a sentiment score, and examine the correlation between this score and Copper\u2019s spot price over the last five years.", "We will not go as far as developing and testing a fully-fledged trading strategy off the back of this work, the semantics of which is beyond the scope of this article. Moreover, this article is intended to demonstrate the various techniques a Data Scientist can employ to extract signals from text data in the search for profitable signals.", "Let\u2019s kick off by acquiring our data.", "We will start by acquiring our spot Copper price data. The reason behind our choice to use Copper\u2019s spot price, rather than a Copper forward contract (an agreement to buy or sell a fixed amount of metal for delivery on an agreed fixed future date at a price agreed today) is that the spot price is the most reactive to market events \u2014 it is an offer to complete a commodity transaction immediately. Normally, we would use a Bloomberg terminal to acquire this data, however, we can get historical spot Copper data for free from Business Insider:", "Whilst our price data looks fine, it is important to note that we are considering daily price data. Consequently, we are limiting ourselves to a timeframe that could see us losing information \u2014 any market reaction to a news event is likely to take place within minutes, likely seconds of its announcement. Ideally, we would be using 1\u20135-minute bars, but for the purposes of this article, this will do ok.", "We will extract our historical tweet data using a library called GetOldTweets3 (GOT). Unlike the official Twitter API, GOT3 enables users to access an extensive history of twitter data. Given a list of Twitter handles belonging to financial news outlets and a few relevant keywords, we can define the search parameters over which we want to get data for (note: I have posted a screenshot, rather than a code snippet, of the requisite logic to perform this action below for formatting reasons):", "The method .setQuerySearch() accepts a single search query, so we are unable to extract tweets for multiple search criteria. We can easily solve this limitation using a loop. For example, one could simply assign variable names to each execution of a unique query, i.e. \u2018spot copper\u2019, \u2018copper prices\u2019 etc, but for the purposes of this article we can settle for a single query:", "We now need to process this text data in order to make it interpretable for our topic and sentiment models.", "Preprocessing of text data for Natural Language applications requires careful consideration. Composing a numerical vector from text data can be challenging from a loss point of view, with valuable information and subject context easily lost when performing seemingly basic tasks such as removing stopwords, as we shall see next.", "Firstly, let's remove redundant information in the form of tags and URLs, i.e.", "We define a couple of one-line Lambda functions that use Regex to remove the letters and characters matching the expressions we want to remove:", "Next, we perform some fundamental analysis of our twitter data by examining tweet composition, such as individual tweet lengths (words per tweet), number of characters, etc.", "It is immediately apparent that the mean length of each tweet is relatively short (10.3 words, to be precise). This information suggests that at the expense of computational complexity and memory overhead, filtering stopwords might not be a good idea if we consider the potential information loss.", "Initially, this experiment was trialled with having all stop words removed from Tweets, using NLTK\u2019s very handy standard list of Stop Words:", "However, this action lead to a lot of miscategorised tweets (from a sentiment score point-of-view) which supports the notion of loss of information, and therefore best avoided.", "At this point, It is well worth highlighting NLTK\u2019s excellent library when it comes to dealing with Twitter data. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and functions to help parse social media outputs, including emoticon interpretation!. One can find a really helpful guide to getting started with and using NLTK on Twitter data here.", "The next step is to consider word order. When we vectorize a sequence of tokens into a bag-of-words (BOW \u2014 more on this in the next paragraph), we lose both context and meaning inherent in the order those words within a tweet. We can attempt to understand the importance of word order within our tweets DataFrame by examining the most frequent n-grams.", "As observed in our initial analysis above, the average length of a given tweet is only 10 words. In light of this information, the order of words within a tweet and, specifically, ensuring we retain the context and meaning inherent within this ordering, is critical to generating an accurate sentiment score. We can extend the concept of a token to include multiword tokens i.e. n-grams in order to retain the meaning within the ordering of words.", "NLTK has a very handy (and very efficient) n-gram tokenizer: from nltk.util import ngram. The n-gram function returns a generator that yields the top \u201cn\u201d n-grams as tuples. We, however, are interested in exploring what these n-grams actually are so will in the first instance, so will make use of Scikit-learn\u2019s CountVectorizer to parse our tweet data:", "Upon examination of our n-gram plots, we can see that apart from a few exceptions, an NLP-based predictive model would learn significantly more from our n-gram features. For example, the model will be able to correctly interpret \u2018copper price\u2019 as a reference to the physical price of copper, or \u2018china trade\u2019 to China\u2019s trade, rather than interpreting the individual word\u2019s meaning.", "Our next step is to tokenize our tweets for use in our LDA topic model. We will develop a function that will perform the necessary segmentation of our tweets (the Tokenizer\u2019s job) and Lemmatization.", "We will use NLTK\u2019s TweetTokenizer to perform the tokenization of our tweets, which has been developed specifically to parse tweets and understand their semantics relative to this social media platform.", "Given the relatively brief nature of each tweet, dimensionality reduction is not so much of a pressing issue for our model. With this in mind, it is reasonable not to perform any Stemming operations on our data in an attempt to eliminate the small meaning differences in the plural vs possessive forms of words.", "We shall instead implement a Lemmatizer, WordNetLemmatizer, to normalise the words within our tweet data. Lemmatisation is arguably more accurate than stemming for our application as it takes into account a word\u2019s meaning. WordNetLemmatizer can also help improve the accuracy of our topic model as it utilises part of speech (POS) tagging. The POS tag for a word indicates its role in the grammar of a sentence, such as drawing the distinction between a noun POS and an adjective POS, like \u201cCopper\u201d and \u201cCopper\u2019s price\u201d.", "Note: You must configure the POS tags manually within WordNetLemmatizer. Without a POS tag, it assumes everything you feed it is a noun.", "For the purposes of demonstrating the utility of the above function, we have also passed a list of stop words into the function.", "We now need to convert our tokenised tweets to vectors, using a document representation method known as a Bag Of Words (BOW). In order to perform this mapping, we will use Gensim\u2019s Dictionary class:", "By passing the list of processed tweets as an argument, Gensim\u2019s Dictionary creates a unique integer id mapping for each unique, normalised word (similar to a Hash Map). We can view the word: id mapping by calling .token2id()on our tweets_dict. We then count the number of occurrences of each distinct word, convert the word to its integer word id, and return the result as a sparse vector:", "A precursor to developing our NLP-based trading strategy is to understand whether the data we have extracted contains topics/signals that are relevant to the price of Copper, and, more importantly, whether it contains information that we could potentially trade on.", "This requires us to examine and evaluate the various topics and the words that are representative of these topics within our data. Garbage in, garbage out.", "In order to explore the various topics (and the subjects of said topics) within our tweet corpus, we will use Gensim\u2019s Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. LDA is a generative probabilistic model applicable to collections of discrete data such as text. LDA functions as a hierarchical Bayesian model in which each item in a collection is modelled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modelled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities (Blei, Ng et al 2003).", "We pass our newly vectorized tweets, cbow_tweetsand the dictionary mapping each word to an id, tweets_dictto Gensim\u2019s LDA Model Class:", "You can see that we are required to provide an estimate of the number of topics within our dataset, via the num_topics hyperparameter. There are, as far as I am aware, two methods of determining the optimal number of topics:", "From a trading point of view, this is where domain knowledge and market expertise can help. We would expect the topics within our Twitter data, bearing in mind they are the product of financial news publications, to focus primarily on the following subjects:", "Aside from this, one should use their own judgment when determining this hyperparameter.", "It is worth mentioning that a whole host of other hyperparameters exists. This flexibility makes Gensim\u2019s LDA model extremely powerful. For example, as a Bayesian model, if we had \u2018A-priori\u2019 belief on a topic/word probability, our LDA model allows us to encode these priors for the Dirichlet distribution through the init_dir_prior method, or similarly through the eta hyperparameter.", "Getting back to our model, you will note that we have used the multicore variant of Gensim\u2019s LdaModelwhich allows for a faster implementation (ops are parallelized for multicore machines):", "A cursory inspection of the topics within our model would suggest that we have both relevant data and that our LDA model has done a reasonable job of modelling said topics.", "In order to understand the distribution of topics and their keywords, we will use pyLDAvis which launches an interactive widget making it ideal for use in Jupyter/Colab notebooks:", "Upon inspection of the resulting topic plot, we can see that our LDA model has done a reasonable job of capturing the salient topics and their constituent words within our Twitter data.", "What makes for a robust topic model?", "A good topic model typically exhibits large, distinct topics (circles) with no overlap. The areas of said circles are proportional to the proportions of the topics across the \u2018N\u2019 total tokens in the corpus (namely, our Twitter data). The centres of each topic circle are set in two dimensions: PC1 and PC2, and the distance between them set by the output of a dimensionality reduction model (Multidimensional Scaling, to be precise) that is run on the inter-topic distance matrix. A full explanation of the mathematical detail behind the pyLDAvis topic visual can be found here.", "While remembering not to lose sight of the problem that we are trying to solve, specifically, understand whether there are any useful signals in our tweet data that might affect the Copper\u2019s spot price, we must make a qualitative assessment.", "Examining the individual topics in detail, we can see a promising set of results, specifically top words appearing within the individual topics, that adhere largely to our expected topic criteria above:", "Top words include major Copper miners (BHP Billiton, Antofagasta, Anglo American & Rio Tinto), along with mentions of major Copper exporting countries i.e. Peru, Chile, Mongolia, etc.", "2. China Trade & Manufacturing Activity", "On the strength of the results above, we make the decision to proceed with our NLP trading strategy, on the strength that our twitter data exhibits enough information relevant to the spot price of Copper. More importantly, we can be confident of the relevancy of our Twitter data with respect to the price of Copper \u2014 the topics that our LDA Model uncovered adhered to our view of the expected topics that should be present within the data.", "As Data Scientists, we know that we must validate the integrity and robustness of any model. Our LDA Model is no different. We can do so by checking the Coherence (mentioned above) of our model. In layman terms, Coherence measures the relative distance between words within a topic. The mathematical detail on the mathematics behind precisely how this score is calculated can be found in this paper. I have omitted to repeat the various expressions for brevity\u2019s sake.", "Generally speaking, a score between .55 and .70 is indicative of a skillful topic model:", "At a Coherence Score of .0639, we can be reasonably confident that our LDA Model has been trained on the correct number of topics, and retains an adequate degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in each.", "Our choice of score measure, observable in the signature of the above Coherence Model logic, is motivated by the results in the paper by Roder, Both & Hindeburg. You can see that we have chosen to score our model against the coherence = 'c_v measure, as opposed to \u2018u_mass\u2019, \u2018c_v\u2019, \u2018c_uci\u2019. etc. The \u2018c_v\u2019 score measure was found to return superior results to that of the other measures, particularly in cases of small word sets, qualifying our choice.", "Having been satisfied that our twitter data contains relevant enough information to potentially be predictive of short-term Copper price movements, we move onto the sentiment analysis part of our problem.", "We will use NLTK\u2019s Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) to analyse our tweets, and, based on the sum of the underlying intensity of each word within each tweet, generate a sentiment score between -1 and 1.", "Irrespective of whether we employ single-tokens, ngrams, stems, or lemmas in our NLP model, fundamentally, each token in our tweet data contains some information. Possibly the most important part of this information is the word\u2019s sentiment.", "VADER is a popular heuristic, rule-based (composed by humans) sentiment analysis model by Hutto and Gilbert. It is particularly accurate (and was designed specifically for this application) for use on social media text. It seems rational, therefore, to use it for our project.", "The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer contains a dictionary of tokens and their individual scores. We then generate a sentiment score for each tweet in our tweets DataFrame and access the result, a dictionary object, of the four separate score components generated by the VADER model:", "After plotting the rolling scores for the various components, negative, positive, and compound scores (we leave neutral out), we can make a few observations:", "Now we must evaluate whether our hard work has paid off: Is our sentiment score predictive of Copper\u2019s spot price!", "On first glance, there does not appear to be any association between the spot price and our compound score:", "However, when we apply a classic smoothing technique and calculate the rolling average of our sentiment score, we see a different picture emerge:", "This now looks a lot more promising. With the exception of the time period between January and August 2017, we can readily observe a near-symmetric, inverse relationship between our 21-day rolling mean compound score and the spot price of Copper.", "At this juncture, we pause to consider the options available to us on how we want our model to process and classify the underlying sentiment within a piece of text data, and, critically, how the model will act on this classification in terms of its trading decisions.", "Consistent with the Occam\u2019s Razor principle, we implemented an out-of-the-box solution to analyse the underlying sentiment within our twitter data. As well as exploring some renowned EDA and preprocessing techniques as a prerequisite, we used NLTK\u2019s Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER), to generate an associated sentiment score for each tweet, and examined the correlation of said score against simple corresponding Copper spot price movements.", "Interestingly a correlation was observed between our rolling compound sentiment score and the price of Copper. This does not, of course, imply causation. Moreover, it may simply be the news data trails that of the price of Copper, and our tweet data is simply reporting on its movements. Nonetheless, there is scope for further work.", "In reality, the design of a systematic trading strategy necessitates a great deal more mathematical and analytical rigour, as well as a good dose of domain expertise. One would typically invest a great deal of time designing a suitable label that best encompasses the signal and the magnitude of the price movement (if at all!) found within said signal, notwithstanding a thorough investigation of the signal itself.", "Scope for very interesting further work and analysis exists in abundance with respect to our problem:", "We used VADER to parse and interpret the underlying sentiment of our Twitter data, which it did a reasonable job of doing. The drawback of using VADER, however, is that it doesn\u2019t consider all the words in a document, only about 7,500 in fact. Given the complexity of commodity trading and its associated terminology, we might be missing crucial information.", "As an alternative, we could employ a Naive Bayes classifier to find sets of keywords that are predictive of our target, be it the price of Copper itself or a sentiment score.", "Intra-day data in nearly all cases is a must when designing an NLP trading strategy model, for the reasons mentioned in the introduction. Time and trade execution is very much of the essence when attempting to capitalise on news/event-based price movements.", "Thank you for taking the time to read my article, I hope you found it
