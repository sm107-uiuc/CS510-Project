However, even among those 15 players, who individually are some of the best basketball players in the world, it is no shock that they each have different levels of responsibility when it comes to contributions to the team. A very basic heuristic to define the roles of the players on a team is to look at the \u201cstarters\u201d versus the \u201cbench players.\u201d In professional basketball, a team can have five players on the court at a time. \u201cStarters\u201d (or the \u201cstarting lineup\u201d) are the five players who are on the court at the very beginning of a game. Usually, these are the team\u2019s best five players at each of the five positions, and sometimes, the starting lineup can be made up of the team\u2019s best five players overall. Starters also tend to be the players who play the most minutes in a game. Starting lineups can vary from game to game, but for the most part, teams like to keep them pretty consistent, which is why we can distinguish the starters from the \u201cbench\u201d (the players who aren\u2019t starters). Even among bench players, some players have more responsibility and get more playing time (e.g. the\u201csixth man\u201d) and others aren\u2019t as important in the lineup from game to game. When it comes to my analysis, I wanted to look at which benches in the NBA underperformed versus outperformed expectations, and which benches contributed more to their teams in comparison to benches of other teams (adjusted for a team\u2019s success).", "To perform this analysis, I need a way to measure team success and player contributions. To measure team success, I look at the team\u2019s number of wins in the regular season, and to measure player contributions, I look at an advanced statistic called \u201cwin shares.\u201d", "This is basically the number of games that a team wins in the regular season. Barring extraordinary circumstances (like we saw with the COVID shutdown in 2020), NBA teams usually play 82 games in the regular season, and games can either result in wins or losses. Here are the top 10 NBA teams in the 2019\u20132020 season listed by number of wins.", "According to basketball-reference.com, \u201c\u2018win shares\u2019 is a player statistic which attempts to divvy up credit for team success to the individuals on the team.\u201d From now on, I will abbreviate \u201cwin shares\u201d as WS. For this analysis, I scrape data from basketball-reference.com, so I will be using their definition of WS, which means that one team win translates to roughly one WS (it\u2019s not exactly one in the basketball-reference definition so WS can be awarded for exceptional performances in losses as well). This means that a team with 50 wins on the seasons will have roughly 50 WS. The sum of the players\u2019 WS in a season is equal to the team\u2019s WS for that season. WS is a statistic that is based on individual and team performance in comparison to the performance of other teams and players. The full definition of WS is given here. It is important to note that WS is a cumulative statistic, so between two players who play on similar teams and have similar contributions to those teams, the player who plays more minutes will likely have more WS.", "In order to roughly compare these players, we use \u201cwin shares per 48\u201d (I will henceforth refer to it as WS/48). It is pretty self-explanatory: you take the total WS that a player has amassed, divide by the number of minutes the player has played, and multiply by 48. This attempts to estimate how many WS a player would contribute in a single game, given that an NBA game lasts 48 minutes. Below, I have listed some all-time and 2019\u201320 WS and WS/48 leaderboards to help make the concept a little clearer.", "It must be noted that WS and WS/48 should not be considered comprehensive metrics to compare NBA players. For example, no disrespect to the great Neil Johnston, but there is no way I\u2019m picking him over LeBron James, even though he has a higher all-time WS/48. There are definitely other metrics that can be used to compare players, including \u201cPlayer Efficiency Rating\u201d (PER) and \u201cBox Plus-Minus\u201d (BPM), and sometimes even simple box score comparisons can suffice. Also, many aspects of the game of basketball aren\u2019t captured by both basic and advanced stats. However, these aberrations definitely balance out when it comes to comparing a group of players or entire teams, which is why we can use this analysis to compare the bench squads of different teams. For example, below I have shown the scatter plot of team wins versus team WS for the 2019\u20132020 NBA season.", "Now that we have an idea of wins and WS, we need a way to define who our \u201cbench players\u201d are, especially given that lineups can differ from game to game. Here are the metrics that I use to filter out the \u201cstarters\u201d and get the bench players. These are definitely somewhat arbitrary, but I think they do a good job of differentiating between players who start games more often versus those who come off the bench.", "For example, here are some of the rosters from the 2019\u201320 NBA season, along with a list of those rosters after applying these filters.", "Using the data that I have, I perform two different kinds of analysis. The first is an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression of wins versus WS, where wins is the independent variable (x) and WS is the dependent variable (y). In vernacular, this is known as the line of best fit. The second analysis is the OLS regression of wins versus WS/48. The first regression doesn\u2019t take into account minutes played and gives a general sense of which teams utilize their benches more as compared to others. The second analysis provides insight into which benches are outperforming their expectations adjusted for overall team performance. To determine the idea of \u201coutperforming\u201d and \u201cunderperforming,\u201d I look at the residuals, which is just the difference between the observed and the expected value of bench win shares for that team (expected values lie along the regression line) given the number of games that the team has won.", "Both analyses gave some very interesting results, and these results mostly matched my intuition of what the most recent NBA season\u2019s teams look like. Here are the tables and the regression results from the 2019\u201320 NBA season.", "The first table is sorted in descending order based on the residuals of WS. The teams with the highest positive residual utilized their benches more than expected, and these benches were a lot more important to the teams\u2019 success than the benches of other teams. This makes sense looking back at the 2019\u201320 NBA season. For example, the Los Angeles Clippers had two Sixth Man of the Year finalists (finalists for the award for the best \u201csixth man\u201d in the NBA), so it makes sense that they would be close to the top in terms of bench importance. However, the Clippers bench WS is inflated by the fact that some of the Clippers bench players played a lot of minutes, so that definitely overstates how much they seem to outperform the average NBA bench. This is shown in the WS/48 regression, where the Clippers bench only has a small positive residual. Also, some of the teams that I thought were really top-heavy, including the Portland Trailblazers, in which starters like Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum generate most of the offense, and the Houston Rockets, in which the entire offense is centered around James Harden, who is in the starting lineup, are also at the bottom of the list. Also, I just wanted to give a shoutout to one of my favorite Chicagoans, Derrick Rose, who came off the bench for the Detroit Pistons this past year!", "It\u2019s really important to note that this is not a ranking of how effective or how strong the bench rosters are, but rather how much they contribute to their team\u2019s success. Would I rather have the New York Knicks bench roster rather than that of the Los Angeles Lakers: of course not. But the Knicks bench was relatively more important to the team\u2019s success (albeit very little of it) than that of the Lakers, at least in the regular season.", "There are definitely some ways my methodology can be improved. First of all, the analysis could be made more accurate if I looked at the actual lineups for each individual game. For example, if a regular starter gets injured, some of the bench players would have to fill in until the starter comes back to full health. In this case, the WS that they garner during these games should go towards the starters WS rather than the bench WS. Also, teams just like to experiment with different lineups a lot of the time. Unfortunately, it would probably be very computationally intensive to request webpages for every single player from every single game and then calculate WS, but my filters provide a rough estimate of the bench players throughout the entire season.", "When it comes to generalizing these results, I thought of whether or not they could have any predictive power. Obviously, we shouldn\u2019t predict a team\u2019s success in subsequent seasons based on how important its bench is. However, this analysis could definitely be important in the offseason, when general managers and the basketball operations teams of NBA franchises are evaluating what roster changes should be made. It could also be useful to the training staff and coaches regarding where to focus player development efforts. Overall, I just think it\u2019s a cool way to get a sense of the dynamics of different NBA teams and validate your intuition about what you see happening on the court.", "I\u2019ve also started pushing the Python scripts of my research projects to a public repository on Github linked here! These scripts are in .ipynb files, so you would have to open them using something like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Also, feel free to contact me on Facebook or LinkedIn if you want to discuss any of my projects and other research ideas, or if you want me to run the results from a different NBA season. I would also love to talk basketball in general. Catch y\u2019all in the next one!", "Your home for data science.
