These hallowed, esteemed institutions send thousands of bright graduates across the United States to alleviate suffering, change lives, and in some cases, hopefully, save them.", "But what if these graduates are entering into a system that is increasingly money-driven and decreasingly care-driven? What if these bright young men and women are targets in an extensive money-making scheme run by massive pharmaceutical companies? What if Big Pharma targets certain medical specialties more than others? Why might that be?", "In the 1960s, American trust in the medical profession was at an all-time high. At the time, more than three-fourths of Americans had great confidence in medical leaders. Today, only 34 percent of Americans do. With thousands of pharmaceutical companies \u201cdonating\u201d billions of dollars a year to physicians across the country, should American trust in the medical profession be even lower?", "If you have time, watch the video on the left. Seriously, watch it. The video sheds light on a seemingly-corrupt system that millions of Americans are unaware of.

If not for the pronouncement of widespread, consistent corruption in the medical/pharmaceutical fields, at least watch it for the comedic value that John Oliver brings to the table. The issue at hand is complex, multilayered, and multifaceted; the video will work wonders on your understanding of it.", "From an outside view, this whole system might sound seemingly innocent \u2014 companies teach doctors about their drugs so that doctors can make informed decisions on the drugs they prescribe to patients. What\u2019s wrong with that?", "But this innocent framework becomes cloudy when the FDA\u2019s requirements for generic vs. branded drugs enter the picture:", "Hold up. You\u2019re telling me that generic drugs are legally required to essentially be identical to branded drugs in every way? When generic drugs are on average 80\u201385 percent cheaper than branded drugs, why in God\u2019s name would anyone choose to take branded drugs over generic drugs?", "Well, there are three possible scenarios for this seemingly misguided behavior:", "\u201c\u2026companies with branded drugs will stop generic drugs from coming to market by refusing to hand over the samples and safety protocols needed to produce a generic drug. This tactic artificially extends drug companies\u2019 patents and cuts against Congress\u2019s intent to encourage generic drugs.\u201d -OpenMarketsInstitute", "We don\u2019t quite have the hours, days, weeks (you get the picture) required to venture down the rabbit-hole of patent monopolies and Big Pharma\u2019s Congressional lobbying efforts. But, if you\u2019re really curious, check out this link.", "2. A patient specifically requests a brand name drug instead of an identical generic drug at the pharmacy (maybe because of TV advertisements or recommendations from their neighbor Karen* who takes Lipitor and swears by it).", "3. A physician specifically prescribes a branded drug instead of a generic drug.", "Scenario #3 is where things get really exciting \u2014 and where our research is focused.", "We looked at scenario #3 and asked ourselves why.", "Remember that quote from the Hippocratic Oath at the beginning? When physicians took an oath to understand a disease\u2019s effect on a patient\u2019s \u201ceconomic stability,\u201d why would they then prescribe branded drugs over generic drugs?", "Paired with the multi-billion dollar system of \u201cdonations\u201d that Mr. Oliver pointed out above, it made for a compelling, socially-impactful, and consequential research question:", "Through our research, we set out to understand the impact that Big Pharma\u2019s direct payments to doctors might have on the prescription drugs that you, me, and Karen all end up taking - and the prices we pay for them.", "So, with ear to the ground, listening for the slightest hint of medical corruption, we set out on a valiant quest to reveal widespread societal abuses and, by consequence, invoke widespread societal change.", "At least that\u2019s how we imagined it.", "The immediate obstacles we *slammed* into were directly related to the sheer scale of the data available, the formatting of the data sets, and the minute legal/procedural intricacies involved in the prescription filling process.", "But no time for that now\u2026 we\u2019ll get into those along the way.", "We structured our research on three key data sets:", "After downloading each data set, we quickly realized the utter size of the data we were working with. The Open Payments data sheet alone contained tens of millions of rows. The Medicare Provider Utilization data sheet contained over one hundred million rows.", "The data was thorough, that\u2019s for sure. But manageable for our purposes? Not quite.", "We made the decision to refine our research to the calendar year 2016. This significantly trimmed the data to a ~slightly~ more manageable state. The Open Payments data was constrained to ~10.9 million rows while the Medicare Provider Utilization data (from here on called the \u201cPrescriptions Data Set\u201d ) was constrained to ~24.3 million rows. Even these constrained data sets were too much for our measly 8GB of RAM to process in reasonable amounts of time; computational time and memory usage were magnified in every process we attempted with the data sets, particularly in moving between data sets (e.g. taking a doctor who accepted donations from the Open Payments data set and searching for occurrences of the same doctor in the Prescriptions Data Set). To help remediate these problems, we used Dask dataframes to load the data \u201clazily\u201d (not loading data into memory until computations are executed on that data).", "The second step of our research process was to clean the data. This step took a surprising amount of time and effort which I guess is a testament to how much time in data science is spent tailoring a given data set/sets to your specific research needs. We cleaned our data by, among other things, removing unnecessary (for our purposes) columns from all three data sets, combining certain columns that we required to be combined (e.g. first, last name), dealing with NaN values, removing case-sensitivity, summing payment totals for each doctor, and a whole slew of other tidying tasks.", "After cleaning, we set out to make meaningful conclusions on our research question from the data. We knew that we were still dealing with a pretty massive data set so we decided to hone in on a target subset of the data: medical specialty. Which medical specialties are most donated to and why?", "To investigate, we focused on the 20 pharmaceutical companies that gave over $100 million in donations to physicians between 2013 and 2016.", "We then queried the Open Payments data set, grouped donations by physician specialty, then found the average donation value for each medical specialty. We hoped that this process would reveal exactly which medical specialty the biggest pharmaceutical companies were spending the bulk of their money on targeting.", "Here is a nice plot illustrating the findings (using mean):", "Immediately upon turning your head sideways and viewing the plot, it is clear that Pediatric Critical Care Medicine blows the other specialties out of the water in terms of mean donation value. We found this to be extremely surprising! We expected orthopedic surgery to be the highest in terms of mean and total value; orthopedic surgery ranks first in terms of total net value of donations (see plot below), while it ranks just fifth in terms of mean value of donations.", "Here is the plot using total donation value:", "Why might this be? Why would the largest pharmaceutical companies target pediatric emergency care specialists with such intensity?", "Our initial justifications of these results focused on the nature of the pediatric emergency care specialization. These physicians care specifically for children in emergency situations. Because emergency issues are typically time-sensitive, it might be that these medical professionals have complete discretion over what prescription drugs a child takes. In this, we mean that in the specific scenarios that pediatric emergency care specialists tend to, parents might give complete discretion to the trusted professional without arguing over whether to be prescribed a branded vs. generic drug. When Jimmy is SCREAMING because of his broken arm, mom and dad probably aren\u2019t going to argue about the brand-name of a drug; they just want the SCREAMING to stop and their beautiful baby boy to be the image of 5-year-old health again.", "If this is the case and pharmaceutical companies understand that, then it would make sense for Big Pharma companies to get pediatric emergency care specialists to prescribe all branded drugs at whatever cost necessary, including making hefty donations.", "But why just make unfounded conclusions when you can query the data and make, well, founded conclusions!", "We then moved to close the loop by directly examining the specific drugs that pediatric emergency care specialists and orthopedic surgeons prescribed. We did this to investigate whether these substantial donations really did affect the specific drug prescribed by a doctor.", "Above, we established that pediatric emergency care specialists were rolling in cash from Big Pharma (okay, yes, the \u201cdonations\u201d are labeled as \u201cspeaking fees,\u201d and \u201call-expenses-paid medical conference trips\u201d but just roll with me on this one), now let\u2019s see if that cash paid off.", "3. Iterate through each physician\u2019s set of prescriptions, flagging a prescription if it was a brand name drug instead of a generic drug", "4. Cross-reference the branded drug in the \u201cDrugs and Manufacturers\u201d dataset to see if manufactured by one of the top-20 companies investigated.", "5. If the physician prescribed a branded drug, we then queried the Open Payments data set using the physician\u2019s name, to see if that specific physician was given donations by pharmaceutical companies. By doing this, we would be able to examine, to some degree, the possible influences of pharmaceutical donations on drug prescriptions.", "6. Repeat steps 1\u20135 for the second specialty investigated: orthopedic surgery.", "Our results were surprising to say the least.", "After carrying out the above process on both pediatric emergency care specialists and orthopedic surgeons, we found:", "# of branded pediatric emergency care specialist prescriptions in 2016: 4", "# of pediatric specialists who prescribed branded drugs and took donations from the drug\u2019s manufacturer (one of the 20 companies investigated): 0", "# of branded orthopedic surgery prescriptions in 2016: 568", "# of pediatric specialists who prescribed branded drugs and took donations from the drug\u2019s manufacturer (one of the 20 companies investigated): 4", "Or maybe not, depending on how you see it! If these findings hold, it appears that pharmaceutical donations are not as effective at influencing physician prescription decisions as hypothesized. And hey, that would be good news all around.", "Our research suggests that in 2016, for the specialties (pediatrics emergency care and orthopedic surgery) that receive the highest average donation value and the highest net donation value from the 20 highest-spending pharmaceutical companies, there is minimal correlation. In ultra-simple terms it seems like donations did not overtly affect the specific drugs that were prescribed.", "These findings come with some major caveats we would like to address. At numerous points while conducting the research, we ran into problems and limitations with the data.", "First and foremost, the nature of the Prescriptions dataset.", "This Prescriptions dataset is limited to Medicare Part D Spending by the federal government for the year 2016. While the set is massive, it only represents a small fraction of total prescriptions fulfilled in the U.S. in 2016. Medicare is a government program and as a result, its records are free and available to the public. This is why we used them. This research project is not definitive simply because it only examined a small sample of the total drug market.", "Sampling at a small scale to model large-scale behavior might work with some research but certain characteristics of Medicare further muddied our research waters. Because Medicare is a government program, it carries with it restrictions and limitations; these limitations become even more refined and restrictive at the \u201cPart D\u201d level. \u201cPart D\u201d refers to a specific subset of Medicare plans and only covers drugs in six categories: antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals (AIDS treatment), immunosuppressants, and anticancer. This immediately poses a problem with our investigation of pediatrics and may explain why we found such a small number of branded, pediatric drug prescriptions.", "Furthermore, funding for Medicare is limited by the federal government. Because the government\u2019s goal is to keep Medicare spending at a minimum while still providing necessary drugs to the public, they may overwhelmingly restrict fulfilled prescriptions to generic drugs and not branded drugs. This might also explain why we found so few branded drug prescriptions in our research.", "Finally, not all doctors accept Medicare. Doctors have to opt-in to accept Medicare and when, on average, Medicare pays only 80 percent of what private health insurance pays, it seems to be an increasingly less popular option. Doctors who are already interested in maximizing their profits might not choose to accept Medicare and thus would not be present in our data set. These same doctors may be the ones who take the most donations from pharmaceutical companies.", "In a separate vein, our research was limited by only investigating the top 20 donating pharmaceutical companies. We made this decision because it made the data easier to manage and work with. However, it is possible that these companies all, or mostly, focus on a specific sector of the medical market (i.e. they make drugs that pediatricians and orthopedic surgeons would never use). Because we left out dozens of other, smaller companies, we may have missed manufacturers of pediatric/orthopedic drugs.", "All these observations point to a single truth that reverberated through our minds at every step of this research process: the perceived pharmaceutical donation problem is exceedingly nuanced and clouded. At the start of the project, we could never have imagined the number of times we had to consider the actual decisions a pharmaceutical company might make, a physician might make, a pharmacist might make, and a patient might make \u2014 all to arrive at meaningful and valid claims about the data we had before us. The scale of the problem, the legal aspects surrounding public disclosure of certain payments/prescriptions and not others, and working with multiple datasets that each coded its data in a different way and was created/managed by different groups, made this research project challenging\u2026 but fun.", "But why does investigating any of this actually matter?", "If you\u2019ve gotten to this point and still haven\u2019t already found your own answer to the question above, here is how we see it, plain and simple:", "If a doctor prescribes the wrong drug (because of a bias toward Big Pharma) to a patient, diseases could be inadequately managed, symptoms could spread, and treatment could be ineffective. People could die.", "Our project only scratched the surface of what is possible using the OpenPayments and Medicare Part D datasets. These datasets are thorough, powerful, and impressive and the opportunities for investigation are limitless.", "We discussed investigating the effect of Big Pharma donations on research publications. For example, if Dave the Doctor was given donations from a pharmaceutical company that produces ExampleDrug A, what are the chances that he will later write/co-author a research article touting the perceived positive effects of ExampleDrug A? This question is important because thousands of doctors and patients rely on medical journals to understand the benefits/disadvantages of new drugs appearing in the market. Based on these articles, doctors prescribe specific drugs.", "To answer this question, we could use natural language processing to code research articles by tone (positive/in-support or negative/not-in-support) and search the Open Payments Dataset for donations to the author of the article. Then, we could use linear regression using the sentiment analysis score along with the query into the Open Payments Dataset.", "Furthermore, we are interested in using machine learning to predict the projected amount of donations a doctor might receive based on a number of features of the physician (e.g. U.S. state located, years in practice, etc.). We would particularly like to investigate whether the specific form of Big Pharma donations affects prescription bias. If good ol\u2019 Dave the Doctor receives 150 free lunches every year from FakePharma, Inc., is he more likely to prescribe FakePharma, Inc.\u2019s drugs than if FakePharma, Inc. was flying him to medical conferences every weekend?", "All the datasets we used are free to use/download; if you have any ideas on possible further research topics related to them don\u2019t be afraid to dive in!", "Do your own research and bring that research to your doctor\u2019s office. To start, try taking a look at the findings published in the CDC\u2019s Preventing Chronic Disease Journal or other journals like it.", "1.
