Some offer unlimited access with no advertisements while others offer a lower cost ad-supported version. Some have access to high-quality premium content that consumers value more while others have high quantity but lower quality.", "Each service sets a price that they believe will maximize their objective. For Netflix, the objective might be revenue, profit, and / or growth. For Apple or Amazon, content is a gateway to locking a customer into their product ecosystem. For Disney, it\u2019s generating interest in merchandise, parks, or their suite of content (ESPN, Hulu, Disney+, etc.).", "Pricing strategy is largely a function of what a consumer will pay, the presence of competition, and the goal of the organization. This article will focus on the first component of what a consumer will pay.", "What will you pay? A Case Study in Streaming", "Let\u2019s imagine that we work for a company that wants to introduce a new streaming product to the market. A recent study determined consumer willingness to pay for a set of streaming services. The 4 bundles and their range of prices are:", "Which bundles, if any, should we offer? Should we give multiple options to consumers? Should we sell ads or go ad-less? What is the set of prices that maximizes revenue? Then what?", "Using this data, I created an illustrative data set for 1,000 consumers that had a random uniform distribution between each of the above price ranges.", "We begin by finding the consumer surplus for each option by subtracting their willingness to pay from the price of the bundle.", "Think of this as having your maximum price in mind for a product (\u201cI\u2019ll only pay up to $15 for the movie ticket\u201d), looking at the price, and determining if you\u2019ll go to the movie based on that. If the price is $13, you\u2019ll go. Your \u201cconsumer surplus\u201d is $2 and the company receives $13 in revenue. If the price is $18, you won\u2019t go, and the company\u2019s revenue from you will be $0.", "If the surplus for all four bundles is negative, the consumer makes no purchase. Otherwise, they will purchase the bundle that has the largest differential between their willingness to pay and the price of the bundle.", "(This assumes that consumer choices are rationale and they can value different options \u2014 a fundamental assumption in many economic models. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky might argue otherwise.)", "After the product bundle is chosen for each customer, the revenue for the company is the associated price for each bundle. The sum of revenue from all consumers represents the revenue opportunity that we will look to maximize.", "Thus, we\u2019ve created a pricing optimization problem with the objective to maximize total revenue. An optimization function can be set up and run that searches different price points, calculates the objective function (e.g., revenue), and chooses the combination of prices across services that maximizes this function.", "Solving this on the example data set yields the following optimal pricing and percent of consumers that purchased each bundle (or made no purchase):", "To summarize, the total revenue from the 1,000 customers is $10,735, with more than half choosing unlimited TV Shows & Movies. Only 4% of potential customers wouldn\u2019t purchase with these prices across the four options. The most common purchase is unlimited TV Shows & Movies and consumers expect a nearly 20% discount to pay for this same bundle with advertisements.", "These prices represent the mathematically optimal numbers to maximize customer revenue given their willingness to pay.", "We have numbers, but we don\u2019t have an answer. These prices are mathematically optimal but not business-ready. When was the last time you saw a subscription that was $x.14 or $x.06? Are these prices profitable? Is our objective revenue, profit, growth, or something else?", "These are the business questions that transition analysis to action.", "The next step is to determine whether the content can be delivered profitably (either immediately or over time) at these prices. If not, there\u2019s a lack of product-market fit \u2014 consumers don\u2019t value the product enough to bring it to market. The product must then be scaled back or additional features added to reach an equilibrium of supply and demand.", "If it passes the profitability test, the next consideration is what consumers value beyond content. Will some consumers pay more to have high definition content over standard (and if yes, at what premium)? Is it valuable to have access to multiple simultaneous streams (i.e. Netflix family plan)?", "If there are additional features that are valuable, should there be multiple sub-plans below the unlimited TV & movies? This good-better-best model is frequently seen among any subscription plan.", "These prices should be seen as a benchmark around which to deviate based on specific business objectives. A desire to be seen as a premium product in the market may lead someone to sacrifice revenue in favor of brand equity through higher prices. A desire to acquire customers over profit may lead to lower prices.", "Determining willingness to pay (and trusting people to act as they say they will) is a separate article and a challenging exercise in itself. With this data, though, most analytics programs (Excel, R, Python) can provide this first layer of insight on pricing strategy that can be used to drive more informed decisions and data-driven results.", "Assuming that the willingness to pay doesn\u2019t vary significantly from the real ranges above, the pricing of each of the noteworthy streaming services on the market is telling to their strategy:", "Content acquisition and overhead costs aside, the pure price of the services are reflective of their business goals at a high level. Over time, I\u2019ll be interested to monitor whether low prices remain (signalling the adjacent business goals of retention or increased hardware sales were accomplished) or if there\u2019s a breaking point where profitability of the service becomes critical, and if yes, where we\u2019ll see prices land.", "Your home for data science.
