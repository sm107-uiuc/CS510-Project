One should be careful that his model is good enough to learn from existing data, and good enough to generalize to unseen data. The lack to generalize a model is mainly because of a problem called overfitting.", "In simple words, overfitting means that the model achieves very high accuracy on the initial training data and very low accuracy on newly unseen data. It is like when teachers always give the same questions in their exams. Their students would easily get very high grades, because they simply memorized the answers. Therefore, the high grades are not a good metric here. Another dangerous consequence is that students will not even bother to learn the subject\u00a0anymore.", "There are many techniques to target overfitting, and dropout is one of them. In this article, we will discover what is the intuition behind dropout, how it is used in neural networks, and finally how to implement it in Keras.", "Consider a TV show consisting of a participant, a group of audience, and a show host. The show works as follows:", "Suppose that the participant notices that one of the audience is always giving the correct answer. With time, the participant will build trust with this person and will neglect the answers given by the others.", "There are some problems with this strategy. The trusted person may be good with the question categories in the early stages, but very bad with the ones in later stages of the game. If only one person (or a small group) are always selected, other people from the audience will feel left out and will not care to pay attention to the played video clip anymore. This way \u2014 at later stages \u2014 the trusted person will no longer be helpful, and other people from the audience who stopped paying attention will already lose the sequence of events to answer correctly. Therefore, relying only on one person is bad, and it will definitely lead to losing a lot of money.", "How do you think we could manage to fix this problem? One smart strategy is to always give chance to others. This way the participant will learn the strength of each one of the audience and knows which one to ask based on the question category. In addition, this way everyone will always feel responsible and obliged to pay attention.", "You may ask what this has to do with neural network? Well, let us consider the following network\u2026", "We could think of the input layer (in green) as the question the host asking, each neuron in the hidden layer (in blue) as one person from the audience, and the output layer (in red) as the chosen answer from one selected audience. If the output layer finds out that a specific neuron is always giving the best answer, it may neglect the others and give all the weight to this neuron.", "Based on our previous analysis, we chose to forbid some neurons of answering and give chance to others. This way we will achieve balance and force all neurons to learn. This is the concept of dropout, and technically it works as follows:", "With this technique all neurons will have the chance to vote and will be obliged to answer correctly to decrease the model loss.", "This is an example of a neural network before and after dropout.", "Applying dropout in Keras in simpler than you think. All what you have to do is import and create a new Dropout layer object, then add it into the relevant place withing your network structure.", "Normally, dropout layer is added after a Dense layer in a fully connected before the output with a dropout rate = 0.5 (50%). Some recent approaches apply dropout after the activation function of a convolution layer or a recurrent layer with a dropout rate=0.2 (20%).", "In this article I introduced dropout, an interesting way to solve overfitting problems while training. Even thought, the concept behind dropout is very simple, it leads to great improvements when training your model. I tried to keep the explanation as simple as possible.
