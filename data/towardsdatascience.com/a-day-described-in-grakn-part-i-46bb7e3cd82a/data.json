Long story short, a Hypergraph can have edges that connect more than two nodes at a time. So there must be a database with the Hypergraph model right? Yes, there is and it\u2019s Grakn\u2026and that\u2019s what this post (and a bunch of few others) is going to talk about.", "Grakn is quoted to be \u201can intelligent database\u201d that allows you to model knowledge bases for different domains by extending the Entity-Relation approach (which was mostly used for SQL databases). Powered by an automated reasoning engine, it is capable of performing logical inference on large datasets. Grakn has its own declarative query language called Graql and also ships with its own visualization tool called the Grakn Workbase. (more on this later)", "Enough talk\u2026let\u2019s get down to basics.", "Before any data is loaded into the database, a schema should be created.", "Think of the schema as a blueprint of the database that gives you a coherent idea of how the data is\u00a0going\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0structured.", "Mind you! Schema design is the first and the most crucial step while creating a database. Almost all the other operations depend upon how the schema is defined.", "Let\u2019s create a simple schema using an example.", "The city of Whatsville was hosting a concert by Gina Goodvoice on New Year\u2019s Eve and the city was expecting a surge of visitors from the neighboring cities. Bobby was one of them. Wanting to explore the city, Bobby decided to arrive beforehand. He took the train from WhoTown and arrived in Whatsville that morning and met his friend Tim for breakfast at a nearby cafe. He then decided to visit the City Museum and bought a book along the way. For lunch, he bought a sandwich from a food truck and sat by the lakeside for a while. By evening, he headed towards the city stadium where the concert was going to be held. He had a great time at the concert, listening to the tunes of Gina Goodvoice. The concert went on till late night, post which, Bobby took the last train back home.", "Why am I digressing so much? The reason is simple.", "Imagine Bobby\u2019s world. Or rather, Bobby\u2019s day. There were people he met; places he visited; things he bought etc. It\u2019s just a series of events that took place throughout the day. Now, we\u2019re going to model this same day in Grakn.", "To create a schema, you first need to identify the entities, attributes, relations, and roles. Here\u2019s a brief description of each of them", "Confused? Let\u2019s identify each of these for our example.", "What are the things that can be called entities? A simple approach is to identify people, places, and things (and animals too if they\u2019re there)", "So we have Bobby, Tim, Gina Goodvoice, Whatsville, WhoTown, the train that Bobby took, the cafe he had breakfast in, the stadium where the concert was held, the sandwich he bought and much more. There! We have our basic entities: Person, Place, and Thing.", "Now, what can be the characteristics of these entities? So a person can have a name and an age, for example. A city (or any place) can have a name, a parent country/state, a latitude, a longitude, etc to identify it. Similarly, a thing can also have a name and other certain characteristics. These can be your attributes.", "Next, if you think closely, what connects all these entities together? An event.", "The concert by Gina Goodvoice is an event that links Bobby, Tim, Gina and takes place at the stadium on New Year\u2019s Eve. That\u2019s an event, and the relation in your schema that links a person, a place and a thing.", "Further, a person plays the role of a participant in the event and the place plays the role of the event\u2019s location. There, we assigned roles to the entities in the relationship.", "Alright, it\u2019s time to start tapping away. We\u2019re going to create the schema that we earlier defined for Grakn.", "Make sure you have got the Grakn server and the Workbase installed. If not, then take a detour here and come back.", "The schema can be defined in a file with a \u201c.gql\u201d extension.", "The schema definition always starts with the keyword \u201cdefine\u201d.", "Next, we define the entities. So we have a person, location and thing as our entities. Additionally, we can define the entity\u2019s attributes and roles.", "Like a person has an attribute name and plays the role of a participant in an event.", "Next, we need to define all the attributes that are mentioned in the schema. When defining each attribute, the datatype of the attribute must be specified. This can be done using the \u201cdatatype\u201d keyword.", "Finally, down to the relationships. Relationship definitions are similar to an entity definition. A relation can have attributes and even play roles.", "The \u201crelates\u201d keyword is used in the definition to specify which roles the relationship connects. A relation can connect attributes, entities and even relations!", "For example, the event relationship relates to the roles \u201ceventParticipant\u201d and \u201ceventLocation\u201d which are played by the entities person and location respectively.", "(Note that a relation can connect roles and not entities)", "Now that we\u2019ve defined the schema. We need to load it into Grakn.", "Head over to your terminal and start the Grakn server:", "The -k argument here stands for the \u201ckeyspace\u201d. Think of the keyspace as the name of your database. While the -f here is the \u201cfile path\u201d to the schema file.", "If you get an output such as", "Then that means your schema is loaded. Now you can head over to Grakn Workbase and see your schema. It should look somewhat like this:", "And done! The next step is to load the data into a database\u2026. and that deserves a whole post to itself. So all I can say is stay tuned! And happy reading!", "Your home for data science.
