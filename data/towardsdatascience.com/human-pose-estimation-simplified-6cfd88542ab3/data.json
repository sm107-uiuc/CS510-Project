Imagine being able to track a person\u2019s every small movement and do a bio-mechanical analysis in real time. The technology will have huge implications. Applications may including video surveillance, assisted living, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and sport analysis.", "Formally speaking, Pose Estimation is predicting the body part or joint positions of a person from an image or a video.", "I have been working on Human Pose Estimation for over 8 months now. The research in this field in vast, both in terms of width and depth. However, most of the literature (research papers and blogs) in Pose Estimation are fairly advanced, making it difficult for someone new to get accumulated.", "The scope of future research in Pose Estimation is immense and creating a learning slope can get more people interested. The aim of the blog is to provide a rudimentary understanding of Pose Estimation and possibly spark a interest in the field. Anyone with absolutely no previous experience of Computer Vision can superficially follow the blog. Even a basic understanding of Computer Vision concepts is enough to fully understand the blog.", "As I said earlier, Human Pose Estimation is a field with vast amount of research, both in terms of depth and width. The problem statement can be classified based on the following axes :", "Depending on the number of people being tracked, pose estimation can be classified into Single-person and Multi-person pose estimation. Single-person pose estimation (SPPE) is the easier of the two, with the guarantee of only one person present in the frame. On the other hand, Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) needs to handle the additional problem of inter-person occlusion. Initial approaches in pose estimation were mostly focused on SPPE, however with the availability of huge multi-person datasets, the MPPE problem has lately been getting increased attention.", "Modality refers to the different types of inputs available. Based on the ease of availability, the top 3 forms of inputs are,", "A video is nothing but a collection of images, where every two consecutive frames share a huge portion of the information present in them (which is the basis of most of the video compression techniques). These temporal (time based) dependence in videos can be exploited while performing Pose estimation.", "For a video, a series of poses need to be produced for the input video sequence. It is expected that the estimated poses should ideally be consistent across successive frames of video, and the algorithm needs to be computationally efficient to handle large number of frames. The problem of occlusion might be easier to solve for a video due to the availability of past or future frames where the body part is not occluded.", "If temporal features are not a part of the pipeline, it is possible to apply static pose estimation for each frame in a video. However, the results are generally not as good as desired due to jitters and inconsistency problems.", "Depending on the output dimension requirement, the Pose Estimation problem can be classified into 2D Pose Estimation and 3D Pose Estimation. 2D Pose Estimation is predicting the location of body joints in the image (in terms of pixel values). On the other hand, 3D Pose Estimation is predicting a three-dimensional spatial arrangement of all the body joints as its final output.", "Most 3D Pose Estimation models first predict 2D Pose, and then try to lift it to 3D Pose. However, some end-to-end 3D Pose Estimation techniques also exist which directly predict 3D Pose.", "Every pose estimation algorithm agrees upon a body model beforehand. It allows the algorithm to formalize the problem of human pose estimation into that of estimating the body model parameters. Most algorithms use a simple N-joint rigid kinematic skeleton model (N is typically between 13 to 30) as the final output. Formally, kinematic models can be represented as a graph, where each vertex V represents a joint. The edges E can encode constraints or prior beliefs about the structure of the body model.", "Such a model suffices for most applications. However, for many other applications such as character animation, a more elaborate model may be needed. Some techniques have considered a highly detailed mesh models, representing the whole body with a point cloud.", "Another rather primitive body model that was used in earlier Pose Estimation pipelines is a shape-based body model. In shape-based models, human body parts are approximated using geometric shapes like rectangles, cylinders, conics etc.", "A major portion of research involves solving the pose estimation problem using input from a single camera. However, there are certain algorithms which try to use data from multiple viewpoints/cameras, combining them to generate more accurate poses and handle occlusions better. The research on multi-camera pose estimation is currently somewhat limited, primarily due to lack of good datasets.", "Feature extraction in Machine Leaning refers to the creation of derived values from raw data (such as an image or video in our case), that can be used as input to a learning algorithm. Features can either be explicit or implicit. Explicit features include conventional Computer Vision based features like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). These features are calculated explicitly before feeding the input to the following learning algorithm.", "Implicit features refers to deep learning based feature maps like outputs from complex Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These feature maps are never created explicitly, but are a part of a complete pipeline trained end-to-end.", "Confidence Maps : A common way of predicting joint locations is producing confidence maps for every joint. Confidence maps are probability distribution over the image, representing the confidence of the joint location at every pixel.", "A lot of algorithms, including both bottom up and top down approaches, do not have a relation constraint on the final output. To put it in layman terms, an algorithm predicting joint positions from an input image does not have any filter on rejecting/correcting unnatural human pose. This can sometimes lead to weird Human Pose Estimation.", "To cope with this, there exist a set of postprocessing algorithms, which rejects unnatural human poses. The output pose from any Pose Estimation pipeline is passed through a learning algorithm which scores every pose based on its likeliness. Poses that get scores lower than a threshold are ignored during the testing phase.", "A brief introduction of a few common datasets in Human Pose Estimation.", "Human Pose Estimation is an evolving discipline with opportunity for research across various fronts. Recently, there has been a noticeable trend in Human Pose Estimation of moving towards the use of deep learning, specifically CNN based approaches, due to their superior performance across tasks and datasets. One of the main reason for the success of deep learning is the availability of large amounts of training data, especially with the advent of the COCO and Human3.6M datasets.", "If you are interested in further reading and more detailed exploration of Human Pose Estimation, check out these resources.", "This blog is a part of an effort to create simplified introductions to the field of Machine Learning.
