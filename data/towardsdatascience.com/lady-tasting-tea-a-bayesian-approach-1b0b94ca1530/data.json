How can we evaluate her claim? Through solving this problem, known as the lady tasting tea problem, Sir Ronald Fisher introduced the notions of hypothesis testing and p-value for the first time.", "In this article, I revisit Fisher's solution (i.e. the frequentist approach), use a Bayesian approach for the problem of lady tasting tea, and compare their results.", "Given a cup of milk tea, we assume that the lady would guess the right answer (i.e. whether tea or milk is added first) with the probability p. If she guesses randomly, we expect that p is equal to 0.5 \u2014 i.e. what is called the chance level. If she has some magical skill, then we expect to find a probability greater than 0.5.", "Therefore, to decide whether she lies or not, we should test whether p=0.5 (called the null hypothesis and shown usually by H\u2080 or M\u2080) or p>0.5 (called the alternative hypothesis and shown by H\u2081 or M\u2081). To do so, we ask her to taste N cups of milk tea and tell us her guesses. We denote the number of her right guesses by n.", "Now the question is: How can we use this information (i.e. n and N) to decide whether she lies or not?", "The frequentist approach for testing the null hypothesis is based on the computation of p-values\u00b9. For the case of the lady tasting tea, the p-value is the probability of the cases with more than or equal to n right guesses out of N cups given the assumptions that the lady has lied about her abilities. If this probability is very small, then it is hard to believe that she could make these many right choices only due to pure chance. Therefore, we will reject the null hypothesis for the cases with very small p-values\u00b2.", "So, how small the p-value is would be the criterion for accepting the lady's claim (i.e. the alternative hypothesis, M\u2081). There are some traditional thresholds for rejecting the null hypothesis. A summarisation\u00b3 can be found in the table below.", "Now the question is: How should we compute p-values?", "For an arbitrary p, the probability of having m right guesses out of N guesses is", "Given the null hypothesis, we have p=0.5, and hence, we can compute the p-value as", "As N increases, the distribution of having m right guesses converges to a Gaussian distribution with the mean Np and the variance Np(1-p) \u2014 according to the central limit theorem\u2074. Then, the p-value can be approximated by\u2075", "where the 2nd term is the cumulative density function (cdf) of a Gaussian distribution at the value n, with the mean N/2 and the variance N/4.", "From the Bayesian perspective, the null and alternative hypotheses can be seen as two different models M\u2080 and M\u2081, respectively, which are candidates for generating data. Then, Bayesian hypothesis testing is equivalent to the Bayesian model selection: Which model explains data better?", "The idea in Bayesian model selection is to compute the posterior probability of each model given the observed data, e.g. P(M\u2080|n) in our setting. The odd posterior ratio is defined as the ratio of two posterior probabilities as", "where the 1st term on the right side is called the odd prior ratio and the 2nd term is called \"Bayes factor\"\u2076. If there is no prior preference between two models (i.e. when we have uniform prior over the models), the odd posterior ratio is equal to the Bayes factor.", "Bayes factor is the central concept in Bayesian hypothesis testing and model selection\u2077. High values of the Bayes factor tell us that the alternative model is much more probable than the null model, given the observations. So, how large the Bayes factor is would be the criterion for accepting the lady\u2019s claim (i.e. the alternative hypothesis, M\u2081). Similar to the case of p-values, there are some traditional thresholds for rejecting the null hypothesis, summarised in Table 1\u00b3.", "Now the question is: How should we compute the Bayes factor?", "For the problem of lady tasting tea, each model can be characterized by a prior distribution over the probability of a single right guess p. The characterization of the null model is straightforward and without any ambiguity: p is equal to 0.5 \u2014 the prior is a delta distribution at 0.5. As a result, the conditional probability P(n|M\u2080) can be computed easily using the formulas mentioned in the previous section.", "However, the characterization of the alternative model M\u2081 is not trivial. We know that the prior distribution must have its whole mass on p>0.5, but we need to specify exactly the form of the prior \u2014 it is necessary for the computation of P(n|M\u2081). Then, what is a good choice of prior?", "One very simple but intuitive choice of prior is a uniform distribution over the interval of [0.5,1]. Using this prior, the log Bayes factor can be computed as", "It can be shown that\u2078 if the prior distribution is non-zero in a neighborhood of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the parameter p, then, as N increases, the log conditional probability log(P(n|M\u2081)) can be estimated by (a constant times\u2079) Bayesian information criterion (BIC). It is surprising but true that as N increases, the effect of the prior disappears. Therefore, for large N, the Bayes factor can be approximated (whenever n>N/2) by", "When n\u2264N/2, we have logBF(n)\u2248-log(N)/2, but it might not be an accurate approximation anymore, because the ML estimate of p is out of the prior's support \u2014 is less than 0.5.", "For different choices of N and n, we computed both the exact and approximated p-value and Bayes factor. Then, for each level of significance, according to Table 1, we computed the critical ratio of right guesses (i.e. n/N) above which we reject the null hypothesis. The boundaries for 4 different levels of \"borderline\", \"moderate\", \"strong\", and \"very strong\" are shown in Fig. 1.", "There are a few interesting take-home messages:", "In contrast to the frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach for hypothesis testing can make statements also about accepting the null hypothesis. The logic is the same, we just need to look at the negative log Bayes factor. A set of similar critical ratios of right guesses below which we will accept the null hypothesis (that the lady has lied) can be found. The boundaries are shown in Fig. 2.", "The result can be summarised in three points:", "We studied hypothesis testing from both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives for the particular example of lady tasting tea.
