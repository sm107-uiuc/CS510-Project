In this post, I try to convey the basics of what I learned and feel worth sharing.", "1) Introduction2) How do GANs work?2.1) The principle: generator vs discriminator2.2) Mathematically: the two-player minimax game3) Why are GANs so interesting?4) Conclusion and references", "Over the past decade, the explosion of the amount of available data \u2014 Big Data \u2014 the optimization of algorithms and the constant evolution of computing power have enabled artificial intelligence (AI) to perform more and more human tasks. In 2017, Andrey Ng predicted that AI will have a profound impact as electricity did.", "If we claim that the purpose of AI is to simulate human intelligence, the main difficulty is creativity. In the field of AI, we talk about generative models and one of the most popular model nowadays is GANs (for \u201cgenerative adversarial networks\u201d). In a 2016 seminar, Yann LeCun has called GANs \u201cthe coolest idea in deep learning in the last 20 years\u201d.", "GANs [1] introduce the concept of adversarial learning, as they lie in the rivalry between two neural networks. These techniques have enabled researchers to create realistic-looking but entirely computer generated photos of people\u2019s faces. They have also allowed the creation of controversial \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos. Actually, GANs can be used to imitate any data distribution (image, text, sound, etc.).", "An example of GANs\u2019 results from 2018 is given Figure 1: these images are fake yet very realistic. The generation of these fictional celebrity portraits, from the database of real portraits Celeba-HQ composed of 30,000 images, took 19 days. The generated images have a size of 1024\u00d71024.", "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a generative model with implicit density estimation, part of unsupervised learning and are using two neural networks. Thus, we understand the terms \u201cgenerative\u201d and \u201cnetworks\u201d in \u201cgenerative adversarial networks\u201d.", "The principle is a two-player game: a neural network called the generator and a neural network called the discriminator. The generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating real-looking images while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. Hence, we understand the term \u201cadversarial\u201d in \u201cgenerative adversarial networks\u201d. See Figure 2.", "At the bottom left of Figure 2, we can see that our generator samples from a simple distribution: random noise. The generator can be interpreted as an artist and the discriminator as an art critic. See Figure 3.", "During training, the generator progressively becomes better at creating images that look real, while the discriminator becomes better at telling them apart. The process reaches equilibrium when the discriminator can no longer distinguish real from fake images. See Figure 4. Thus, if the discriminator is well trained and the generator manages to generate real-looking images that fool the discriminator, then we have a good generative model: we are generating images that look like the training set.", "After this training phase, we only need the generator to sample new (false) realistic data. We no longer need the discriminator. Note that the random noise guarantees that the generator does not always produce the same image (which can deceive the discriminator).", "Note that at the beginning of the training in Figure 4, the generator only generates a random noise that does not look like the training data.", "The generator G and the discriminator D are jointly trained in a two-player minimax game formulation. The minimax objective function is:", "where \u03b8_g is the parameters of G and \u03b8_d is the parameters of D.", "By definition, D outputs the likelihood of real image in interval [0, 1]:\u2022 D(x) equals 1 (or is close to 1) if D considers that x is a real data,\u2022 D(x) equals 0 (or is close to 0) if D considers that x is a fake data (e.g. a generated data).", "We can prove that, at the equilibrium, D outputs 1/2 everywhere because D has no idea how to distinguish fake generated data from real data.", "Because x \u223c p_{data}, x is a real data. By definition of G, G(z) is a fake generated data. For example, x would be a real-life image of a cat and G(z) would be a fake generated image of a cat. Thus, D(x) is the output of the discriminator for a real input x and D(G(z)) is the output of the discriminator for a fake generated data G(z).", "Following [1], the two-player minimax game from Equation (1) was written such that \u03b8_g and \u03b8_d evolve so that the following points from subsection 2.1) are true:\u2022 The discriminator D tries to distinguish between real data x and fake data G(z).More precisely, the discriminator D plays with \u03b8_d (\u03b8_g being fixed) to maximize the objective function such that D(x) is close to 1 (x being real data) and such that D(G(z)) is close to 0 (a generated data is detected as false).\u2022 The generator G tries to fool the discriminator D into thinking that its fake generated data is real.More precisely, the generator G plays with \u03b8_g (\u03b8_d being fixed) to minimize the objective function such that D(G(z)) is close to 1 (a false generated data is detected as true by the discriminator).", "Although we are in unsupervised learning (the data is not labeled), we choose that the data generated by G has a 0 label for false (regardless of what the discriminator returns) and the real learning data has a 1 label for true. We can thus define a loss function.", "Paper [1] proves that the minimax game has a global (and unique) optimum for p_g = p_{data} where p_g is the generative distribution and p_{data} the real data distribution. However, in practice, having p_g to converge towards p_{data} is not easy.", "Generative models have several very useful applications: colorization, super-resolution, generation of artworks, etc. In general, the advantage of using a simulated model over the real model is that the computation can be faster.", "Many interesting examples are given in Goodfellow\u2019s tutorial [3] and Stanford\u2019s lecture [2]. In particular, examples given by Goodfellow in the conference \u201cGenerative Adversarial Networks (NIPS 2016 tutorial)\u201d, from 4:15 to 12:33, are impressive.", "One example is given Figure 5. These real images are transposed into realistic fictional images \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 with the CycleGan developed by researchers at the University of Berkeley. The concept, called image-to-image translation, is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. There exists a tutorial on CycleGAN for Tensorflow.", "A second example is shown in Figure 6. For example, the aerial to map feature can be very useful to Google Maps or similar applications and the edges to photo feature can help designers.", "GANs\u2019 applications have increased rapidly, in particular for images. I believe that GANs can be very interesting for companies. For example, GANs can generate realistic images of new medical images and image-to-image translation can help designers draw and be more creative. Moreover, GANs can be used for data augmentation when we only have one hundred images and we wish to have more.", "GANs have also been developed for binary outputs (sick or not) or discrete outputs (rounded blood pressure, rounded weight\u2026) [7]. Benefits from this new research on tabular data are numerous, in particular for privacy purposes. For example, instead of sending confidential data from Excel sheets, hospitals can send fake realistic data (that keeps the correlation between the features) to their partners.", "Thanks for reading, I hope you found this post useful.
