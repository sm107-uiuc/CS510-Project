The reasons why representative studies are needed are explained. The findings of the cruise liner \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d, the aircraft carriers \u201cCharles de Gaulle\u201d and \u201cUSS Theodore Roosevelt\u201d, the investigation in Santa Clara County and especially the investigation in Gangelt are discussed. Furthermore, it is shown that about half of the persons infected with COVID-19 show no or mild symptoms. Based on the representative studies, it is calculated that the probable lethality of COVID-19 is around 0.3% and how high the statistical uncertainty is regarding this value. It is calculated how many people in Germany are probably already infected or have already been infected, thus showing that there is a high number of unreported cases in Germany. It also shows why Germany, in contrast to other countries severely affected by the pandemic, is well prepared for peaks in intensive care due to a pandemic event and why even larger peaks can be treated with intensive care.", "Author: Daniel Haake, M.Sc. in Data Science, currently working as Data Scientist", "For data scientists it is desirable that data is collected as completely and accurately as possible and thus as free of errors as possible. This ensures that correct information can be derived from the data, thus minimizing the possibility of misinterpretations. The question therefore arises whether this desirable state of affairs also applies to the data for COVID-19.", "First of all one has to consider to what extent COVID-19 tests have been carried out. At the beginning of the pandemic, the aim in Germany was to trace chains of infection in order to contain the virus. According to the initial recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), people who meet the following criteria should be tested for COVID-19 [1]:", "But can this procedure lead to the fact that really all COVID-19 cases are made public and thus the official number of infections is correct?", "If it were indeed possible to find all contact persons of an infected person, this would be conceivable. The virus has an average incubation period of 5\u20136 days, and the range can even extend from 1\u201314 days [2]. Thus, an infection only becomes noticeable after several days. At the beginning of the pandemic, infected people who did not know they were infected could use the closely manned public transport system and take part in events that allow close personal contact, such as visits to discos or football stadiums. Initially, these people were not tested even when symptoms appeared, unless they were in contact with a person who was demonstrably infected or had returned from a risk area. Many infected people could not be detected in this way.", "From the point of view of the RKI, the recommendation was certainly understandable at the time, as the testing capacities were limited and the laboratories should not be overburdened. Thus, it was necessary to concentrate on the most likely cases. From a data science point of view, however, collecting as complete information as possible is not a desirable state of affairs. Especially since this results in a shift in the data, which means that they cannot be considered representative. Precise statements such as \u201cx people are infected with the COVID-19 virus\u201d, \u201cx people of the infected have pneumonia\u201d or \u201cx percent of the infected have died of COVID-19\u201d are not possible in this way. Formulations such as \u201cx people were found to be infected with COVID-19\u201d, \u201cx people who were found to be infected had pneumonia\u201d or \u201cx percent of those who were found to be infected died\u201d should be used. For this reason, representative studies are absolutely desirable, which will be discussed in the following.", "The COVID 19 cases on the cruise ship \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d can be regarded as representative examples. All passengers and crew members were tested there, regardless of their symptoms, which allows a closer look [4].", "COVID-19 also spread on aircraft carriers. On the \u201cCharles de Gaulle\u201d all persons were tested [19], on the \u201cUSS Theodore Roosevelt\u201d about 94% of the crew members [20]. However, it must be taken into account that the median age of the cruise ship was just under 60 years and thus higher than that of the population. For the aircraft carriers, on the other hand, the crew members are on average younger and healthier.", "To get more representative figures, it is also worthwhile to have a look at Iceland. There, parallel to the tests by the Icelandic authorities, tests were also carried out by the research institution deCode Genetics. In contrast to the Icelandic authorities, who only tested people with symptoms, deCode Genetics selected the people tested randomly [5]. This allows a representative view of the total population.", "There is also a study in Santa Clara County, California, which was conducted by Stanford University School of Medicine. Blood samples from 3,300 people were tested. The people were contacted through a Facebook ad. They were also required to have a vehicle to drive to the testing stations. The authors of the study write that this has led to an overrepresentation of white women aged 19 to 64 years [21].", "Recently a representative study from Germany has also been available. The University Hospital of Bonn examined about 1000 persons in the particularly severely affected community of Gangelt, both for the presence of the virus and for the presence of antibodies. The study is still in progress, but a first interim result has already been announced after about 500 persons have been evaluated. After the announcement of the interim results, the first criticism was voiced. Criticism was voiced that there is only one test that can reliably detect COVID-19 antibodies and at the same time does not react to other, harmless corona viruses. However, no information on the test used has been provided from the interim results [6]. The study is being conducted at the University Hospital in Bonn by professors from institutes of virology, clinical chemistry and pharmacology, hygiene and public health, and also medical biometrics, computer science and epidemiology. Since it appears that experts are conducting the study, it should first be assumed that a test was used that reliably assigns the antibodies only to COVID-19 antibodies. Should it be determined in the future that the test was not suitable, the statistical error will have to be examined more closely.", "Update from 24.04.2020: After Prof. Dr. Drosten (Director of the Institute of Virology at the Charit\u00e9 Berlin) had contact with Prof. Dr. Streeck (Director of the study in Gangelt and Director of the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital Bonn), he now also expects an \u201cextremely solid, robust study\u201d [25].", "In the further course of this article, reference will be made to these tests again and again, as they provide a representative view of the data situation. Two further studies are being conducted in Munich by the Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine at the LMU Klinikum M\u00fcnchen [7] and nationwide by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) [8]. Results are not yet available. The performance of such studies can only be welcomed, as they provide a representative picture of the virus.", "A study from China provided the first indications that the infection also occurs without or only with mild symptoms. It was not a representative study of the population, as only reported cases were investigated. Nevertheless, it can give a first impression of how the virus has worked in the reported cases. It has been shown that around 80% of the reported cases were mildly symptomatic, although there were also infections without symptoms [3].", "As explained above, the cases on the cruise ship \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d can be considered representative, as all persons on the cruise ship were tested for COVID-19. It was found that about half of the infected persons did not show symptoms at the time of testing [4]. This is in line with the results of the samples from the research institute deCode Genetics in Iceland, where the people to be tested were randomly selected and thus provided a representative picture. There, too, half of the infected persons showed no symptoms [5]. Similar observations could also be made on the two aircraft carriers. On the \u201cCharles de Gaulle\u201d more than 50% showed no symptoms [19], on the \u201cUSS Theodore Roosevelt\u201d it was 60.7% [20].", "In all representative studies it was found that at least half of those infected did not show any symptoms. This illustrates how unnoticed the virus can spread in society. Considering the recommendation of the RKI that, in addition to symptoms, a person must also have been in contact with a demonstrably infected person or at least have returned from a risk area, this suggests a high number of unreported cases.", "Looking at the official lethality figures for the individual countries, large deviations are noticeable. As of 29.04.2020, the lethality rate in Germany was stated at 3.94%, worldwide at 6.96% and in Belgium even at 15.67%. [9].", "But can the same virus lead to such different lethality rates in different countries?", "Actually, it can be assumed that a virus is similarly lethal in the case of similar medical care. To do this, one must bear in mind how lethality is calculated: It is calculated by comparing the number of deaths of people who are detected as infected with COVID-19 with the number of people who are detected as infected with COVID-19. As shown above, there is a strong case for a very high number of unreported cases in the number of infected persons. However, it can be assumed that almost all of the dead have been recorded. It can be assumed that these persons had previously shown strong symptoms and had received intensive medical care and were accordingly tested for COVID-19. The RKI says: \u201cWe assume that the patients are diagnosed before they die\u201d [10]. Nevertheless, there may of course also be an estimated number of unreported cases, but based on the previous remarks, this figure can be estimated as significantly lower. The different lethality rates also indicate that the number of undetected cases among infected persons varies from country to country. However, if the number of infected persons is higher than officially known, the calculated lethality decreases if the correct number of infected persons is expected. For this reason it is necessary to look at representative studies.", "Update from 23.04.2020: Meanwhile the RKI makes a different statement: \u201cI assume that we have more dead than officially counted\u201d. [22] However, it is not said how many more deaths are assumed. The Ministry of Health of Hesse says that so far no excess mortality in connection with the coronavirus has been determined. Also the health administration of Berlin says that in the last weeks only a low excess mortality could be determined. This is probably primarily due to influenza and not to COVID-19 [22]. It should be noted that there may well have been excess mortality in other countries. In contrast to this, there are autopsy results according to which not all of the COVID-19 deaths listed in the statistics are also due to COVID-19 (see section \u201cAutopsy results for COVID-19\u201d). From a data-scientific point of view, it cannot be said on the basis of the data available up to now whether more or less people have died of COVID-19 than is listed in the statistics for Germany. Therefore the official value will be used in the statistics in the following.", "To estimate the lethality of COVID-19, it is worth taking a look at the findings of the cruise ship \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d. The median age on the cruise ship was higher than that of the normal population. For this reason, the lethality was approximately 0.5% age-adjusted with an uncertainty of 0.25 percentage points in both directions. This value occurs although medical care on the cruise ship could not be guaranteed in the same way as on land with intensive care beds and respirators [11].", "On the aircraft carrier \u201cCharles de Gaulle\u201d 1081 crew members tested positive for COVID-19. Of these, 24 had to be treated in hospital, 2 of them in intensive care, none of them died so far [19]. On the aircraft carrier \u201cUSS Theodore Roosevelt\u201d COVID-19 was detected in 660 crew members [20]. One died, which corresponds to a lethality of 0.15%. If both aircraft carriers are considered together, one infected crew member died from 1,741 infected crew members, which corresponds to a lethality of 0.06%. Certainly, these values cannot be transferred to the total population, as the crew members are on average younger and healthier.", "The study in Santa Clara County, California, conducted by the Stanford University School of Medicine, comes to a lethality of 0.12% \u2014 0.2% [23]. It should be noted that the selection of people was not random. The persons were contacted via an advertisement on Facebook. Furthermore, they had to own a car in order to drive to the test stands. This could lead to the fact that the people who took part in the study are younger and more mobile and have thus spread the virus further than the average population. This would lead to a too high assumption of already infected persons, which would result in a too low calculated lethality. An age distribution of those examined was not given in the study.", "Due to the investigation in Gangelt, interim results from Germany have recently become available. It was found that 15% of the population in Gangelt have already carried the virus either currently or in the past [12]. 509 persons were tested, so that arithmetically about 76 persons must have carried the virus in themselves. An exact figure was not given in the presentation of the interim results.", "The results in Gangelt are discussed in more detail below. When considering the numbers, both the specificity and sensitivity of the test must be considered. The specificity indicates the percentage of tests that actually test negative in people who have not developed antibodies against COVID-19. According to the manufacturer, the specificity is > 99%. If one assumes that of the 509 test participants, approximately 440 people did not develop antibodies, about four people would be overstated in the statistics. There would therefore only be 72 persons. However, the sensitivity of the test must also be considered.", "The sensitivity indicates the percentage of people who actually developed antibodies against COVID-19 that test positive. According to the manufacturer, sensitivity is 100% if at least 20 days have passed since the onset of symptoms, otherwise it can drop to 87.5% [18]. If we now look at the 72 people who were correctly tested for COVID-19, this would mean that between 72 and 82 people were actually infected with COVID-19. However, it is doubtful that at least the required 20 days had elapsed for all those actually infected, which is why a 100% sensitivity cannot be assumed. However, if the sensitivity decreases, the number of people actually infected increases. It is therefore plausible to continue to assume that the previously calculated 76 people who were or are infected with COVID-19 are still infected. If the value were to be higher than the 76 persons, the percentage of the population already infected would increase and thus the calculated lethality would decrease.", "If one looks at the beta distribution to the infected persons, one can see that the actual value for the percentage share is in the range between 12% and 18% with an accuracy of 95%. The most likely value for the percentage of infected persons in Gangelt is therefore 14.79%. If the percentage of infected persons can be confirmed from 15% to the total 1010 study participants, the certainty increases and the range of the 95% confidence interval decreases to around 13% to 17%. The most likely value for the proportion of infected persons in Gangelt would then be 14.98%.", "The interim results were criticized by the epidemiologist Krause: \u201cOne should not take all results from these households and convert them into percentages, but at best one person per household\u201d [6]. As a reason he gives that the risk of infection within the households is many times higher than in the population in general and a complete count of all family members would therefore not be correct. But is this statement tenable? In a representative study, the group under investigation should, if possible, reflect the cross-section of society in order to be representative of society. The criticism is that the risk of infection is not comparable. But the conditions in Gangelt were the same as in the rest of Germany. Also in the rest of Germany the undetected infected persons are still in contact with the persons living in the same household and can infect them, as it was the case in Gangelt.", "Surely the value of 15% infected persons cannot be transferred to the whole federal territory, because Gangelt was particularly strongly affected. However, taking into account the statistical error, the value for lethality can be transferred to Germany. Because the counting of deaths with COVID-19 is the same everywhere in Germany and must be reported to the RKI.", "For the interim results of the investigation in Gangelt, a lethality of 0.37% was given. When considering the beta distribution, it can be assumed with an accuracy of 95% that the actual lethality is between 0.15% and 0.69%. The density function is apparently left-stiff/right-skewed. As a result, the most likely value for lethality is 0.32%, which is lower than the calculated lethality of 0.37%.", "Here it must be taken into account that the assumed lethality of 0.37% was calculated from the 7 known deaths and the 1879 infected persons extrapolated from the interim results of the study in Gangelt. This extrapolated figure is derived from the 15% infected persons observed in the study. As shown above, the actual percentage of infected persons in Gangelt is between 12% and 18% due to the confidence interval of 95%. Depending on the actual number of infected persons, the lethality rate changes. If we now look at the lower limit of 12% of infected persons in Gangelt, the lethality rate is 0.47%, whereby the 95% confidence interval for lethality ranges from 0.19% to 0.87%. The most likely value for lethality would therefore be 0.4%.", "If one considers the upper limit of the confidence interval for the proportion of infected persons in Gangelt of 18%, the result is a lethality of 0.31% with a confidence interval of 0.12% to 0.57% and a most probable value of 0.26%.", "In summary, according to the interim results of the study, the proportion of infected persons in Gangelt ranges between 12% and 18%, the average lethality is between 0.31% and 0.47%, the most probable lethality is between 0.26% and 0.4% and the range of lethality is between 0.12% and 0.87%. These figures correspond very well with the findings on the \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d, where the lethality rate was given as 0.5% and the probable range for lethality as 0.25% to 0.75%. The lethality calculated for Gangelt is higher than the lethality values on aircraft carriers (0.06% for younger, healthier crew) and also higher than the lethality calculated for Santa Clara County, California (0.12\u20130.2% when the test subjects are selected via Facebook). The lethality calculated for Gangelt can be classified as plausible by comparison with the other, representative studies.", "By using the determined lethality, it can now be estimated how many people in Germany were or are actually already infected with COVID-19. According to the John Hopkins University, there were a total of 6,467 deaths among the 161,539 detected COVID-19 infected persons in Germany on 30.04.2020 [13]. With the lethality of 0.37% calculated in Gangelt, this means that 1,747,838 people (approx. 2.1% of the total population) in Germany were or are already infected with COVID-19. At the most probable lethality of 0.32%, there are already 2,020,938 infected persons (approx. 2.4% of the total population). With a lethality range of 0.12 to 0.87%, there are 743,333 to 5,389,167 infected persons (approx. 0.9 to 6.5% of the total population). This is a review of the past, since the deceased were infected some time ago.", "It can be seen that the range of those actually infected is still quite high. Therefore, the final results from Gangelt are very interesting in order to reduce the range of confidence intervals and thus increase the reliability of the figures. Further large-scale representative studies are also desirable. Despite the uncertainties regarding the number of infected persons, it can be shown that there is a high number of unreported cases in Germany.", "It is repeatedly said that the number of infected people is an exponential function. But is it really? At the beginning of the spread of the virus, an infected person encounters a population that has no immune defence against the virus. The virus can spread rapidly within the population, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of people infected. However, as time goes on, more and more people carry the virus or have already been infected in the past and have built up an immune defence. An infected person now encounters more and more people who are or were infected and therefore fewer and fewer people who can still be infected.", "Therefore, the speed of spread increases at the beginning until it starts to slow down and then there is a time when there are fewer new infections than before. The distribution of new infections over time t is, therefore, a logistic function. This can lead to an undulating occurrence if measures have initially weakened the speed of propagation.", "If one now considers the total number of infected persons, a sigmoid function is obtained. At first, there is a steep increase in the number of infected persons until a peak is reached and the increase in the total number of infected persons slows down. If measures are taken to slow down the speed of propagation, plateaus can form, followed by further S-curves in the total number of infected persons.", "In the statistics of the John Hopkins University and also of the Robert Koch Institute, the death figures of persons in whom COVID-19 has been detected are counted. However, this does not mean that these people actually died of COVID-19. Such a thing can only be clarified by an autopsy. But that is exactly what did not happen. According to the recommendation of the RKI, internal post-mortem examinations and autopsies should be avoided in order to avoid infectious aerosols when a corpse is opened. The Federal Association of German Pathologists (BDP) and the German Society of Pathology (DGP) are already asking the RKI to revoke this recommendation and to perform as many autopsies as possible on COVID-19 infected deceased [14]. The current practice means that the official figures do not show how many people actually died from COVID-19.", "Update of 23.04.2020: Meanwhile, the RKI no longer recommends that no autopsies should be performed [24]. In the version of this article dated 16.04.2020, it was written that 47 of 56 autopsied persons died of COVID-19 [15]. More recent figures, however, speak of 61 of the 65 autopsies. The author of this article does not know how the reduction from 9 to 4 of those who did not die of COVID-19 is achieved.", "In Hamburg, the recommended practice was deviated from and the dead with proven infection with COVID-19 were autopsied. It was found that of 65 persons who were autopsied, 61 COVID-19 were found to be the cause of death [24]. This means that about 93.9% of the COVID-19 autopsied were found to be the cause of death, and about 6.1% were not. Since the number of persons who have been autopsied is still quite small, the 93.9% are still subject to a certain degree of uncertainty.", "If one looks at the 95% confidence interval of the beta distribution, one sees a voltage range of about 86.9% to 98.3% of autopsies for which COVID-19 should be found to be the cause of death. The most probable value here is 95.2%.", "As described above, the RKI now assumes that there are also deaths from COVID-19 that are not listed in the statistics. So whether there are more or less COVID-19 deaths than in the statistics cannot be clarified with the available data.", "But another finding was made during the autopsies in Hamburg. Each of the autopsied persons had one or more serious pre-existing conditions [16].", "The number of deaths from COVID-19 also depends on how many patients can be treated in intensive care. Therefore, measures have been taken to flatten the logistic function curve for the number of new infections. Because if there are more patients requiring intensive care than there are intensive care beds with ventilators, a large proportion or even all of them will die, because they cannot receive the needed intensive care. It is therefore worth taking a look at how many intensive care beds are available per 100,000 inhabitants per country.", "It is noticeable that Germany is in a good position compared to other European countries. It is also noticeable that the countries that have been particularly affected by COVID-19 have considerably fewer intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants. Thus, Germany has more than twice as many intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants as Belgium, about three times as many as in Italy, France and Spain and five times as many as in Great Britain.", "Hospitals in Germany report to the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine the number of available intensive care beds, how many of them are occupied generally or with COVID-19 patients and how many of them have to be beamed. As of 30.04.2020, about 1,256 hospitals have provided these figures [17]. According to these figures, there are currently 2,280 proven cases of COVID-19 infected persons who receive intensive medical care in the reporting hospitals. There are 12,792 free beds. If this utilization rate also applies to non-reporting hospitals, it can be assumed that there may be about 6.6 times as many COVID-19 infected persons at the same time compared to today before all intensive care beds are occupied.", "If one considers that of the 32,691 reported intensive care beds, 17,619 beds without COVID-19 coverage are occupied, one can see that in Germany it is possible to react well to unforeseen peaks in intensive care. If we now take another comparative look at the number of intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in the various countries, it appears that the countries that are particularly badly affected, such as Belgium, Italy, Spain, France and Great Britain, can only provide normal care without a pandemic. High peaks in intensive care cannot be absorbed and the health system quickly reaches its limits.", "It can be stated that Germany is well positioned in terms of intensive care medicine to cope with the pandemic. For example, there may be about 6.6 times as many people infected with COVID-19 at the same time before the current number of intensive care beds are fully occupied. The most severely affected countries such as Belgium, Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom, on the other hand, seem to be able to cover only the normal demand for intensive care beds and are not prepared for high peaks caused by a pandemic.", "The probable lethality rate of 0.32% is well below the values that can be taken from official statistics. This value lies between the findings on the aircraft carriers \u201cCharles de Gaulles\u201d and \u201cUSS Theodore Roosevelt\u201d (0.06% for younger, healthier groups of people) or in Santa Clara County (0.12% \u2014 0.2%) and the findings on the cruise ship \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d (age-adjusted 0.5%, confidence interval: 0.25% \u2014 0.75%). Therefore, the value calculated in Gangelt appears plausible. It results from this that about 2,020,938 persons and thus about 2.4% of the German population are or were infected with COVID-19, ranging from 725,747 to 5,261,667 infected persons (0.9% to 6.5% of the total population). It should be noted that this is a review of the past, as those who died were infected some time ago and there is a reporting delay in the number of deaths. On the one hand, it can be shown that the number of unreported cases is correspondingly high. On the other hand, it shows that further, large-scale studies are needed in order to minimise statistical uncertainty and provide more accurate figures.", "It can also be stated that around 50% of those infected do not show any symptoms. For a good data basis, therefore, not only persons with symptoms should be tested who have been in contact with a demonstrably infected person. Representative examinations are necessary, in which a cross-section of the society is tested for COVID-19 at regular intervals. This is the only way to obtain reliable information on emerging symptoms, on persons requiring intensive medical care and on lethality. In the event of future pandemics, this should be started early.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
