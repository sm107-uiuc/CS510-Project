As a PM, you need to give engineers and data scientists enough space and flexibility to explore before deciding on the path going forward. But you also need to clearly define the objective functions and encourage the team to test early and often so you don\u2019t lose track.", "The same challenges apply when you are designing the user experience (UX) for your ML products. Over the last few months, I\u2019ve been working with our UX team to gather customer inputs and improve the UX of our products. Here are the three most important lessons that we learned.", "The performance of machine learning models improves as they are trained with more data. It\u2019s great that models will constantly improve themselves. But it also means that their performance will not be perfect from day one.", "It\u2019s crucial to help users understand the nature of machine learning products. More importantly, we need to work with users to agree on a set of acceptance criteria beforehand. And we will only roll out machine learning models if they meet the acceptance criteria.", "When setting the acceptance criteria, you can look into baseline performance of the system or the performance of alternative/existing solutions e.g. the performance of human workers or current software programs.", "Sometimes, you may have more than one user groups and they have conflicts in interests. Or your use cases require zero errors for specific areas. You may also need to decide on the tradeoffs between precision and recall based on your business cases.", "For cases that users need the model to perform well from the first day of launch. Pretrained models can be useful. But even with pre-trained models, edge cases can still occur. You need to work with users to come up with risk mitigation plans: What\u2019s the fallback plan if the model doesn\u2019t work? How long does it take to re-train the model if the user wants to onboard new items or add new use cases? Can the user set a blackout period for when no model update is allowed?", "By setting users\u2019 expectations right, you can not only avoid customer frustration but also delight customers. Amazon\u2019s smart speaker Alexa is a good example. We have high expectations for humanoids: We expect them to speak and act like humans. So when Pepper failed to have intelligent conversations with us, we got frustrated. In contrast, Alexa is positioned as a smart speaker which lowers customer expectations. And it delights us when we learn that it can do more than just playing music.", "Transparency is another important component to enhance better communication and trust. ML is more probabilistic than software engineering. Therefore, showing the confidence level of each prediction is a way of setting the right expectations. It also helps users understand how the algorithms work and therefore build trust with users.", "ML algorithms often lack transparency, acting like a black box that takes input (e.g. images) and outputs predictions (e.g. what/who the objects/people in the images are). That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to explain to users how machine learning models work to build trust and get buy-ins.", "Failing to do so would alienate users. For example, Uber drivers reported feeling dehumanized and they question the fairness of the algorithm, especially when they get penalized without a clear explanation. These drivers feel that the app knows a lot about them but they have little understanding about how the algorithm works and makes decisions.", "On the other hand, Amazon\u2019s web page tells us why they recommend these books. It\u2019s just a simple one-line explanation. But it helps users understand how the algorithms work so users can trust the systems better.", "The same Uber driver study also found that drivers feel that they are constantly being watched but they don\u2019t know what the data will be used for. In addition to compliance with GDPR or other data protection regulations, try to make it easy for users to know how their data is managed.", "\u201c\u2026But there are also unknown unknowns \u2014 the ones we don\u2019t know we don\u2019t know\u2026 it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones\u201d \u2014 Donald Rumsfeld", "It\u2019s often difficult to predict how the system would go wrong when you are designing it. That\u2019s why user testing and quality assurance are extremely important to identify fail states and edge cases. Extensive testing in the lab and field can help minimize these errors.", "It\u2019s also important to categorize errors and handle them based on their levels of severity and frequencies. There are fatal errors that need to be notified to users and require immediate actions. But there are also small errors that don\u2019t really affect the overall operation of the system. It\u2019d be really disruptive if you notify users of every single minor error. And it could be catastrophic if you don\u2019t address fatal errors immediately.", "You can also think of errors as unexpected interactions between user expectations and system assumptions:", "User Errors are generally defined by system designers when users \u201cmisuse\u201d systems, resulting in errors.", "System Errors occur when the systems cannot provide the right answers that users expect. And they often result from the inherent limitations of the system.", "Context Errors happen when the system works as intended but users perceive an error. And it\u2019s often because the assumptions that we design the system with are wrong.", "For example, if a user keeps rejecting suggestions from an App, the product team may want to take a look and understand why. For example, it might be that the App wrongly assumes the user lives in Asia based on his or her credit card information. In this case, perhaps users\u2019 actual location data would be a better data point for making such suggestions.", "The trickiest type of error is the unknown unknowns: the errors that systems cannot detect. One way to address this is to go back to the data and analyze unusual patterns like the persistent rejections we just talked about.", "Another way is to allow users to provide feedback: Make it easy for users to provide feedback anytime and anywhere they want. Let users help you spot unknown unknowns. You can also leverage user feedback to improve your system. For example. Youtube allows users to tell the system that they don\u2019t want to see certain recommendations. It also uses this to collect more data and make their recommendations more personalized and accurate.", "Frame your machine learning model predictions as suggestions is also a way to manage user expectations. Instead of dictating what users should do, you can give users options to choose from. But note that this doesn't apply if your users don\u2019t have enough information to make the right decisions.", "Many of the general principles we talked about before still apply here.
