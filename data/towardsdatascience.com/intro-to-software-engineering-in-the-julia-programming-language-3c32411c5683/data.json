That being said, software engineering in\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["While the Julia programming language is certainly most well-known for its scientific use, there are still packages that need to be developed for that purpose. That being said, software engineering in Julia might not be the most vital skill to have for the language, it is important to have packages to do science with in the first place. Packages an important part of the ecosystem, and I personally think that regardless of scientific purposes, packages are always a great way to keep your algorithm skill in tip-top shape!", "For this tutorial, we are going to be working on a very exciting project that actually might come in handy in the future! Our project is called SuperFrame.jl, which is going to be an extension to an existing package, DataFrames.jl. So along with learning more about working with packages such as DataFrames.jl, we are also going to be getting familiar with creating our own awesome project. With that in mind, I decided we might as well make it official! Let\u2019s create a project on Github! If the project is actually useful, we could work together to push it to the Julia package registry and it might become something people use \u2014 which is exciting because we are working together on it! Here is the repository I created!:", "As a convention, commits should improve a brief description of what is going to be included in that commit. That being said, the repository is open to any commits, but you should probably wait till we are actually working with it to understand the exact methodology and standardization we are going to use \u2014 which of course is going to be DataFrames.jl-based by convention.", "Fortunately for Julia-based developers, developing a package with a full environment included in it is actually incredibly easy. We can create the full file-structure with the appropriate Project.toml, which will contain our virtual environment, from the Julia Pkg REPL. So now let\u2019s get to an appropriate directory and run Julia. I personally use ~/Projects.", "Now we will enter the Pkg REPL by using the ] key:", "Finally, we can use the activate command to create our new virtual environment with a Project.toml file and a Manifest.toml file:", "In order to actually create the appropriate files and environment we will need to add a dependency with the add command. Of course, since we are creating a DataFrames.jl extension, we are going to be adding DataFrames.jl:", "Now we can backspace out of the PKG REPL and then press ctrl + D to exit the Julia REPL.", "Pro tip: The pwd() function in Julia will push the working directory of your REPL. This comes in handy a lot, actually. I think this is a great function to take advantage of, since often in Julia it can be hard to tell where you are in relation to your file-system.", "The last thing we are going to work on today before wrapping up this quick introduction is creating a basic module in Julia. Looking back at the module Compose.jl\u2019s page, we see that we need a src directory, so let\u2019s cd into the folder with our new environment and create a new src directory:", "Now for today I just used nano to edit up a quit bit of text, but in the future I will be using the Atom text editor with the Juno extension. Of course, we will also be reviewing how to set up this environment, which should be relatively straightforward \u2014 so don\u2019t worry. This is my preference, however, so if there is a preferred text editor that you would like to use then feel free to use that!", "Finally, the last thing we are going to do is create a module object in Julia. The key-word for a module in Julia is", "which I would describe as direct. We follow the module word with a name to import, for this example of course it is going to be SuperFrame. As with the other things we will write in Julia, we also need to write end to complete our statement.", "I also went ahead and included a \u201c Using DataFrames\u201d, this is just temporary code, as we will likely be using direct imports in the future in order to be more efficient. That being said, writing that to our hard drive will complete the initial setup of our new package!", "I am incredibly excited about creating this package along with my readers and watchers. This is really fun for me and I really hope that contributions are going to be made, because this is our project together and I think it is going to turn out great with a little direction and provide some very useful interactive experience and learning. SuperFrame.jl is going to be a package that supports several different data formats by making types that work better than traditional DataFrames.jl-based types.", "While DataFrames.jl is a great package, it would be great to work more mathematically or in a certain way with some data. While we are at it, we can also create some cool interactive visualizations and take the package pretty far into working with things like image data-frames. Are you excited about the project yet, because I sure am! I am also very excited to be engaged in your learning atmosphere for these programming concepts \u2014 because programming is awesome and fun! Thank you very much for reading, I appreciate it, and happy new year and 2021!", "Your home for data science.
