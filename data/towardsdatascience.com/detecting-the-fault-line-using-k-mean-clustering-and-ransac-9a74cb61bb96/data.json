Although the fault line is known to be nearly vertical in this area, the fitted plane came out to be rather horizontal (Fig. 1). This is presumably because PCA is very sensitive to \u201coutliers\u201d as it is the method that is based on the correlation/covariance matrix. It could also be presumed that, since all the points are weighed the same, some of the data points that are distant from the main fault line could have skewed the plane. In order to improve the result, several different approaches are taken, and I am going to go through the steps in this blog.", "Since fault structure is known to be very complex, a section from the whole dataset was randomly chosen to fit a plane instead of fitting a plane to the whole dataset in the last blog. However, this could have potentially caused a problem as we do not know if the selected points belong to the same structure of the fault. Hence, instead of randomly choosing a subset, k-mean clustering was applied to separate the data points into clusters of more \u2018similar\u2019 points.", "K-mean clustering is a clustering algorithm which groups the data points into n numbers of clusters. The best centroid of each cluster is determined by 1) assigning data points to closest centroid, 2) updating the centroid location to the center of the assigned data points, and 3) reassigning the data points to the nearest centroid. This process repeats until it gets stabilized and once it\u2019s done, the data points that are assigned to a centroid form a cluster.", "Silhouette coefficient was used to determine the best number of clusters (Fig 2). Silhouette coefficient, which takes values between -1 to 1, represents how well each point is assigned to its cluster. The distance (any kind of distance metric can be used, and Euclidean distance is used for this case) from a point to its own cluster and to its neighboring cluster is measured and these distances are compared. Below is the formula to derive silhouette coefficient, s:", "where a is the average distance from a data point to all the data points in the same cluster and b is the average distance from that point to all the data points in the nearest cluster.", "A high value indicates that it\u2019s assigned to its own cluster well, and lower/negative values show that it\u2019s poorly assigned. As figure 2 shows, 3 is the best number of clusters for this study. The figure on the left below shows the 3 clusters of data points, and on the right shows the fitted plane (PCA was used to fit the plane like the last time).", "Using k-means, the fitted planes look a lot better. But in order to further improve the results, an outlier detection method was used to eliminate some of the outliers which could\u2019ve been skewed the plane.", "Random sample consensus, RANSAC, is one of iterative methods to detect outliers. An iterative method uses an initial guess to generate a sequence of improving approximations. It is widely used in the image processing field for cleaning the noise from the dataset. As it removes the outliers, you need to be careful about its application \u2014 RANSAC is viable only when outliers have no effect on the values you\u2019re predicting. RANSAC algorithm way it finds the outlier is as follows:", "There is a sklearn library for RANSAC and it has an attribute, inlier_mask_, that tells you which data points are considered inlier:", "To the derived inliers for 3 clusters, planes are fitted. Transparent points on the left plot in Figure 4 are the outliers and the right plot shows the fitted planes.", "With k-mean clustering, RANSAC, and PCA, the fitted fault line became a lot closer to the reality (rather vertical plane). As PCA is very sensitive to the points distant from other observations, RANSAC was very helpful preventing those points from skewing the fitted plane. Although those outliers were disregarded when plotting the main fault line, they could be part of some underlying fault structure. These outliers will further be studied to understand the complex structure of the faults.", "Your home for data science.
