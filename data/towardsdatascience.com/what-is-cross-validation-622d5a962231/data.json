This allows us to obtain some additional knowledge that would not have been obtained by fitting the model just once. Another reason to use such methods is to evaluate the test error over many iterations to better judge the model performance.", "One such resampling method is Cross-Validation.", "It is generally used to analyze the test error while a machine learning model is being fitted over several training samples of data (model assessment). It then further helps us select the appropriate model (model selection) based on its complexity.", "Life would have been easier if we had the test data readily available after training a model. However, that is hardly the scenario in the real world. Therefore, Data Scientists make their own test data out of the original dataset using resampling techniques.", "One such way of doing this is by holding out a portion or subset of training data from the fitting process and then estimating the model\u2019s performance on that held out data. This method is called the validation set approach.", "In this method, the original set of data is divided randomly into a training set and a validation set (hold-out set). The model is fitted on the training set and is then used to predict results on the validation set. The final evaluation is done on the validation set, which acts like a test data set in this case.", "The figure above depicts an example of how the observations are divided into training and validation sets. The validation set is drawn randomly and its size depends on the user\u2019s choice. For example, I can choose the validation set to be 40% of the original set, or any other fraction or a percentage value. The choice is generally made keeping in mind the size of data to be split.", "In practice, one may require to do this division iteratively (repetitively) in order to fit the same model over different samples and evaluating it on different validation sets. However, reducing the size of the training set is not always advisable as statistical methods are known to perform worse when trained on fewer observations. This calls out for a special type of Cross-Validation technique \u2192 Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV).", "LOOCV is the case of Cross-Validation where just a single observation is held out for validation.", "The model is evaluated for every held out observation. The final result is then calculated by taking the mean of all the individual evaluations.", "This technique addresses the drawback of using small training sets, seen in the general validation set approach, as the model is fitted on almost all the training samples (n-1 observations). However, there are two problems with LOOCV.", "These problems can be addressed by using another validation technique known as k-Fold Cross-Validation.", "This approach involves randomly dividing the data into k approximately equal folds or groups. Each of these folds is then treated as a validation set in k different iterations.", "Let\u2019s say the value of k is 5, then the k-Fold CV can be visualized as below.", "As can be seen in the figure, the 5 folds or groups are selected as validation sets while the rest of the data is used to train the model.", "This approach addresses the drawbacks of LOOCV as it only takes the k-th portion of data to validate and thus allows the model to train on substantial number of observations. It also reduces the computational expenses as compared to LOOCV as the number of iterations is now reduced to k from n (where k<<n).", "LOOCV is a special case of k-Fold Cross-Validation where k is equal to the size of data (n).", "Using k-Fold Cross-Validation over LOOCV is one of the examples of Bias-Variance Trade-off. It reduces the variance shown by LOOCV and introduces some bias by holding out a substantially large validation set.", "That\u2019s all for this post.
