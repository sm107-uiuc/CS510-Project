It allows data analysts to compare many quantitative variables together looking for patterns and relationships between them. They are appropriate for comparing multiple numerical variables simultaneously when those variables have different magnitudes (different scales) and different units of measurement. The idea is to find patterns, similarities, clusters, and positive, negative, or no particular relationships in multidimensional datasets.", "The first PCP was published in 1885 (#1), but its popularity came a century later through the work of Inselberg (#2). They are widely used, particularly in academic papers, to overcome the challenges associated with the visualization of high-dimensional data. The n-dimensional capabilities of the PCP enable complex relationships to be plotted with simplicity (#3).", "HOW: This representation does not show the classic Cartesian coordinate plane, but each numerical variable is given its own axis. As the following figure shows, all axes are placed parallel, vertical, and equally spaced. Every data element of the dataset is represented through connected line segments, derived from a connected set of points, one on each axis. We finally get a set of lines, each of which is a multi-axis representation of every data record. In general, lots of parallel lines indicate a positive relationship whilst lots of crossing lines (X shapes) indicate a negative association.", "Our example dataset has four numerical variables and six records related to three different classes. So we get four parallel axes and six lines (Fig. 1). Each line is derived from four connected points, one on each axis. Each class is represented by a particular colour. We are looking for patterns or relationships between the four numerical variables and the different classes. Clearly, we have a serious problem: the different orders of magnitude between variable 4 and variables 1 and 3 do not allow us to discover these possible patterns.", "To solve this problem we must proceed with a data normalization task prior to plot the data. Remember that raw data may have not only different orders of magnitudes but also different units of measurement. Normalization (scaling) transforms raw data into a new scale that allows us to compare values of initially very different magnitudes.", "There are several scaling techniques. The usual practice, although not the most robust, is to scale each axis between its minimum and maximum values. With this procedure, the lowest value is set to 0, the highest to 1 (or 100%), and all other values in between are transformed accordingly. For example, after scaling with this procedure, you can compare with a PCP two numerical variables with one of them initially in the range 0\u201310, and the other between 100 and 10000. Other scaling techniques use the mean and standard deviation, the median, or another statistic to transform the original numerical values into a common scale.", "Fig. 2 uses the same data as Fig. 1 but every axe is scaled between 0 and 1. We played with some reordering (described below) until we notice that Label 1 and Label 2 share some kind of positive relationship while Label 3 shows an opposite pattern.", "Besides scaling, three other techniques are usually employed in a PCP in order to discover patterns or relationships across variables: colouring; reordering; brushing.", "Colouring implies highlighting an individual line or a set of lines with a particular colour to visually separate them from the others. For example when you have to compare one particular product against the rest of the list.", "Reordering is changing the order of the vertical axes. The reason behind it is that relationships between adjacent variables are more easily visualized than between non-adjacent ones. Then, you may not discover some kind of pattern or relationship simply because the variables are not located adjacent to each other. Besides, you can reduce the clutter of your PCP by changing the order of some axes and minimizing the number of crosses between them. Modern visualization tools allow us to drag the axes along the plot to facilitate the reordering. A clever analyst always experiments with reordering until he enhances the readability of the plot and gets as much information as possible from the display.", "Brushing is a technique where individual data points are selected by an application of a brush for highlighting subsets of the data. Selected lines are emphasized while others are faded. A brush is like a filter that reduces the number of lines, minimizing clutter and revealing patterns in the dataset. Brushing is mandatory on PCP to avoid over-plotting and occlusion during the analysis of huge datasets.", "The following figure clearly indicates the utility of the brushing technique: top image (a) shows the PCP over-plotted with data; bottom image (b) shows the same PCP with a brush applied to it. The original dataset corresponds to a telecommunications industry recorded by a startup specialized in call center data collection and analysis (#3). The dataset contains five million records related to customer interactions (phone calls) with call centers. There are nine numerical variables, each with its corresponding axe in the PCP. The brushing allows the company to identify callers who couldn\u2019t talk long enough to solve any problem they might have and provided the telecommunications experts with previously unobserved patterns. It is evident that the pattern could not be observed in the original over-plotted PCP.", "Parallel Coordinates Plots are usually difficult to understand for non-technical audiences. There\u2019s no way to avoid the typical line jumble;", "Try not to show many numerical variables at the same time. More than twelve axes and their corresponding lines (even with brushing) in the screen might confuse the audience;", "One downside to this display is that after scaling we lose the original values of every variable.", "PCPs are not suitable for categorical data. Remember that a categorical variable, also called qualitative variable, is one that usually takes a limited number of values \u200b\u200bof mutually exclusive categories or groups. These values \u200b\u200bcan be numerical but do not represent quantities but mutually exclusive groups (i.e. marital status: 1- Never Married; 2- Married; 3- Divorced; 4- Widowed). You must use Parallel Sets Plots with categorical variables;", "A radar chart (spider chart, web chart) is another method for displaying multivariate data of three or more quantitative variables. The problem with radar charts is that they are based on non-common axes and circumferential gridlines which makes the task of comparison very difficult.", "It is easy to mislead PCP with line plots, but they tell different stories. The ideas behind brushing and reordering are specific to PCP. Furthermore, time series analysis is not appropriate with PCP because there is no possibility of reordering.", "In summary: relationships between adjacent axes can be easily seen, but not between nonadjacent axes. Hence, revealing data patterns often requires reordering axes and careful choice of a color map or a brushing filter. A positive (negative) relationship is suggested between two variables when lines between two parallel axes are somewhat parallel (X shape) to each other.", "In an article previously published in Towards Data Science (\u201cBubble Charts, Why & How, Storytelling with Bubbles\u201d, https://towardsdatascience.com/bubble-charts-why-how-f96d2c86d167) we analyzed data from a Kaggle Competition related to wine quality exploration and analysis of red and white variants of the Portuguese \u201cVinho Verde\u201d wine.", "Data is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality and includes 4898 records with ten chemical properties and one physical property of white and red wines. The purpose of the project was to evaluate which of the following chemical or physical properties influence the quality of the wines: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, and alcoholic grade. The set of wines was evaluated by three experts who provided quality scores between 0 (Bad) and 10 (Excellent) for each wine. Table 1 shows the first five records of the dataset.", "At the end of the article, we claimed that alcoholic grade and residual sugar level were the two most important parameters to differentiate between a low-quality wine from a high-quality one. Now it remains to be seen if any of the other chemical parameters play a preponderant role in determining the quality of the final product.", "To answer that question we decided to use a PCP because the remaining eight chemical properties were recorded as quantitative variables and we wanted to analyze them simultaneously.", "** First install Anaconda, a cross-platform Python Distribution for tasks like Python computing and data analysis. Then import the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scypy, and Scikit-learn. Use the read_csv() function to read and parse the file. Check for missing records and look for the shape of the dataset: there are 4898 records and 13 columns. Ten columns correspond to chemical properties (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, pH, sulfates, and alcoholic grade). One corresponds to a physical property (density), another column is related to the quality scores and the last one indicates Red or White wines;", "** Next eliminate anomalous values (outliers) because they could have a significant effect during the normalization process. Use scipy.stats.zscore() and experiment with different threshold values;", "** Split up the dataset into high-quality wines (quality scores 7, 8, and 9) and low-quality wines (quality scores 3, 4, and 5);", "** Proceed with the scaling stage utilizing the scikit-learn method MinMaxScaler. Remember that MinMaxScaler rescales the data from its original value so all the new values are within the range 0\u20131 (# 4);", "** Use the parallel_coordinates plotting function, Pandas built-in plotting function for creating a parallel coordinates chart using Matplotlib. Required arguments are frame, class_column, and colormap. Frame includes the following nine columns (quality scores + eight chemical properties): quality, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, pH, and sulfates. Quality is the class_column (Column name containing class names). Select two different colormaps, one for high-quality wines and the other for the low-quality wines plot;", "We obtained Fig. 4 for high-quality wines and Fig. 5 for low-quality wines. High-quality wines show lower values for chlorides and free sulfur dioxide, and higher levels for fixed acidity and total sulfur dioxide. Low-quality wines show lower values for free sulfur dioxide, and higher levels for chlorides and volatile acidity.", "The wine industry uses sulfur dioxide (SO2) for its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and to prevent color changes, especially in white wines. Total sulfur dioxide is a measure of both the free and bound forms of SO2. Sulfur dioxide also improves the taste and retains the wine\u2019s fruity flavors and freshness of aroma (#5). The use of SO2 has become a controversial issue due to the gradual documentation of adverse reactions in consumers, who may have mild allergies to its presence (therefore, the indication of its use on the label has become part of some wine regulations).", "On the other hand, moderate to large concentrations of chlorides might give the wine a salty flavor which may turn away potential consumers. Volatile acidity is made from compounds in types of acid found in wine, showing an aroma, rather than found on the palate. Excessive amounts of volatile acidity cause undesirable sensory effects (#5).", "Several chemical properties are responsible for the organoleptic characteristics of wines. We found that sulfur dioxide, chlorides, and volatile acidity play an important role in determining the quality of the final product. As those properties can be more or less quantified, PCP can help producers to develop high-quality wines for a broader number of consumers.", "If you find this article of interest, please read my previous:", "Clustered & Overlapped Bar Charts, Why & How", "Stacked Bar Graphs, Why & How, Storytelling & Warnings", "#1: M d\u2019Ocagne, \u201cCoordonnees paralleles & axiales: methode de transformation geometrique et procede nouveau de calcul graphique deduits de la consideration des coordonnees paralleles\u201d.
