Would it know my potato was a potato despite the penis-like protuberance that had earned the tuber its nickname?", "I asked the system to look at several different shots of my penis potato \u2014 with flash and without, indoor and outdoor and at a variety of angles \u2014 and obtained answers that ranged from \u2018butternut squash\u2019 to \u2018dough,\u2019 even when I shot the potato in such a way that its private parts were demurely hidden. What I didn\u2019t know at the time was that the system would never identify my potato as a potato, not because of its penis, but because it did not know about potatoes at all.", "The AI I was using is famous in certain circles and performed remarkably well in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) a few years back. For those unfamiliar with this contest, I\u2019d compare it to the Kentucky Derby, well known and equally exciting to those interested in horses and racing. The AI is called VGG-19, and ImageNet, the image data set used to train and test it, is famous in its own right, providing thousands of labeled images that researchers can use.", "As of now, according the site, ImageNet contains over fourteen million images for over 21,000 categories of things; however, only 1000 of these categories are used in the competition \u2014 1000 synsets, as they are called, of which \u2018potato\u2019 is not one. In other words, because the AI had been trained on the ILSVRC contest data set, no matter how often I showed the system a potato or how perfect that potato\u2019s form, the system would never come up with the word \u2018potato\u2019 because it had not been taught to identify it. Potato is not one of the 1000.", "I took a look at the 1000 categories and learned that the AI ought to be able to identify a brassiere, a rifle, a feather boa, lotion, a manhole cover, a computer mouse, a pinwheel, a prayer rug, a whiskey jug. Mostly, as I looked through the list of the chosen, I wondered, why these?", "A paper on the contest explains that the 1000 contest categories were chosen randomly in 2010, the first year of the contest, and then curated to ensure they were not too obscure and that there was no overlap between any two categories in the hierarchy (if \u2018hound\u2019 is included, then \u2018hunting dog\u2019 (superclass) or \u2018beagle\u2019 (subclass) is not. Over the years, the set has changed, but 639 of the categories have been used in every challenge (through 2015, at least, the year the paper was published). In other words, I had randomness to thank for why the model could identify a brassiere, but not a painting, a pomegranate, but not a kiwi, a mashed potato, not my potato, a bookshop, but not a book.", "I showed the AI a couple photographs of a book and I was told that it was an \u2018eraser\u2019 or \u2018envelope\u2019, or sometimes, more eerily, something that was in the photograph but that I hadn\u2019t really noticed at all. When I showed the AI a woman holding a stack of books, for example, it classified the photograph as a \u2018jersey\u2019.", "In another photograph, the AI looked right past the man reading, but identified the shelves of books in the background as a bookshop. The thing the AI predicts most confidently is not incorrect, it\u2019s just not necessarily where my eye is drawn when I look at the photo. To be clear, I do not expect the AI to see something it does not know about, and yet it is interesting to think about what we are teaching our technologies and what they are blind to because we have not shown them examples.", "I was able to spy on the AI to see where it looked thanks to the work of researchers at Virginia Tech and Georgia Institute of Technology, who built Guided Grad-CAM, which I used to generate the illustrations above. The Guided Grad-CAM technology has a number of interesting applications, but the one that struck me most was identifying bias based on the direction of the AI\u2019s gaze. In the example below, the biased model notices a female face and identifies her as a nurse.", "The biased model learned its bias from the data it was trained on, the researchers write, but using \u201cthe insights gained from the Grad-CAM visualizations, we balanced the dataset and retrained the model.\u201d The unbiased model looks at the stethoscope instead of the face when it determines the profession.", "In another thought-provoking study, researchers at Facebook looked at how well our technologies are doing at classifying objects, and where they are failing, with a special look at basketballs and the images used to illustrate them in ImageNet. Though the percentage of images they looked at in which at least one white or one black person appear is very similar (55% for the former, 53% for the latter), a model trained on this data behaves in an unexpected way. When asked to make predictions on a set of images selected so that \u2018the primary apparent difference between the two images is the skin color of the persons\u2019, the model demonstrates this pattern: \u201cAll images containing a black person are classified as basketball while similar photos with persons of different skin color are labeled differently\u201d (as a Volleyball, ping-pong ball, or baseball player, for example). In other words, the model has learned a bias.", "The reasons why the model learns these biases are unclear. One hypothesis is that despite the balanced distribution of races in pictures labeled basketball, blacks persons are more represented in this class in comparison to the other classes.", "I read the above passage a few times and thought about the implications. Who exactly is represented in ImageNet and who is not, I wondered. And what patterns are our technologies picking up simply because of who and what is included (or omitted) in the data?", "Our models are great at identifying patterns, only some of these patterns are not intended, or worse, harmful. Unsettling decisions by algorithms have appeared in the world of beauty contests, facial recognition, and natural language processing, among other areas. Last year, researchers found significant gender bias in several of our large image data sets. AIs trained on these images have not only picked up on but amplified these biases, associating women with things like kitchens and men with sporting goods (see the story in Wired).", "I appreciate the tremendous efforts that goes into creating and maintaining the image data sets that we rely on to train and test our AIs. Without ImageNet and the competition around it, I do not think our technologies would have evolved as rapidly. Still, I have not come across a study relating to skin color and representation in this data set, and I am concerned about what it means to associate human skin tones with some types of things and not others.", "Repeatedly, I hear image data called \u2018real world data\u2019. But do the data reflect reality? And how can we make sure that the data are not simply reinforcing the biases that we as a society must strive to conquer as well?", "\u201cGrad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization,\u201d Ramprasaath R.
