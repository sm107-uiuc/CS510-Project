I needed to upgrade. The new Intel Skylake processors and the Dell XPS 15 9550 blew me away with how form-fitting and powerful an ultrabook could be, and all of that, with a dedicated NVIDIA mobile GPU, I figured I would be set for years.", "And I was set. In fact, I am writing this story on that very same laptop, it has not slowed down a bit since the day I have gotten it. That was, until, I began to pursue my masters coursework in AI and machine learning. I was assigned a classic deep learning task that has been solved now but proves a great learning opportunity in computer vision, to train a CNN to solve CIFAR-10. CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 10 categories of low resolution (32x32) images, and the task is to train a model to correctly classify a new image to one of those 10 categories. It is widely used as teaching material because the low resolutions allow quick training. Or so I thought. A CNN with multiple layers began to take hours at best to a night at worst to train, and this was supposed to be a simple task. Suddenly, that dependable Skylake I7, now 3+ generations old, and those 2 gigabytes of dedicated GPU RAM began to show their signs of wear.", "I knew I needed a solution so I brainstormed building a desktop PC from scratch. To get an upper mid-grade current generation Machine Learning desktop was going to cost a minimum of $1100 (with an i5 6 core CPU and an RTX 3070), then on top of that, as a graduate student who likes to do work on campus, that $1100 PC confines me to a singular location or requires a lot of syncing measures to work from both. I could get a current generation Ultrabook, which comes with GPUs sometimes as good as a 3050-Ti, but those models easily run over $2000, and do not come with nearly the power of a desktop for training.", "This lead me to perform an extensive amount of research into the best solution for people like me. I have a dependable but older computer, a busy life that puts me on the go, the need for more processing power, and the desire to have all of that in one place, without breaking the bank. I know, I am asking for a lot, but I did manage to find a solution \u2014 an eGPU.", "An external GPU is a device that allows you to use a thunderbolt 3 port to connect a graphics card to your existing computer. If you have an ultrabook PC 2017 or later (like me), or a MacBook Pro 2016 or later, you probably have one and can, therefore, use an eGPU to completely transform your laptop. An eGPU is also relatively simple in design, at its core, all it contains is a PCIe port to connect the GPU, a thunderbolt 3 port to connect to the computer, a power supply (GPUs require much more power than your computer can provide), and cooling for your GPU. You can DIY all of those components together, or you can take the simpler method as I did, and find a GPU enclosure, which contains the ports and power supply, reducing the search to 2 parts, a GPU and an enclosure.", "Once I decided on my course of action, to try an eGPU, it was time for me to scout the internet to try and find the best deals possible. Coincidentally, both of my deals came from a buyer-seller app called Letgo. I was able to secure a NVIDIA GTX 1080 8GB for $260 (the cheapest I could find online was used at $375), and as an enclosure, I was able to find someone selling a Razer Core v2 for $280 (sells on eBay for around $400), giving me a build total of $540 for a totally enhanced laptop experience.", "Not everyone is going to want to deal hunt like I did, so I also evaluated the best options for creating a ML eGPU for around $500, fully online, taking no more than 10 minutes to order all of the parts. I would recommend an NVIDIA 1660-Ti 6GB, giving similar GPU capabilities (slight downgrade), for $280, and a refurbished Razer Core X, which can be bought from Razer for $270. If you are willing to shell out a little more for a better, newer GPU, an RTX 3060 8GB will be more future-proof, but also comes with a $400 price tag. If you are looking at transforming a Macbook, it may be worth looking into AMD processors due to their increased level of support in the Apple ecosystem.", "Once I built the machine, I began the task of quantifying my experience. How much of an improvement is a GTX 1080 over the mobile GPU I had previously? To solve that task, I used AI-benchmark, which is a Python library that utilizes Tensorflow to run 42 tests on 19 different sections, providing a great generalized AI score for a GPU. I combined AI-Benchmark with Jupyter notebook, pandas, and a visualization tool called Seaborn to quantify my results. The code can be found on Github here.", "The first results are on individual tests and their time taken to run (in milliseconds). I only included tests 1 through 9 of 19 as the sheer amount of results would be overwhelming to the eye. I also ran into a major problem with my GTX 960M GPU (The GPU that came with my XPS). Because it only has 2GB of graphics, it failed a tremendous amount of the tests as the tensors were simply too large to fit onto the 2GB card.", "The results of this test are pretty clear. Integrated graphics are in no way suited for machine learning, even if it is more stable than the mobile GPU. The tests all took magnitudes longer to run and could cause even simple tasks to run painfully slow. The GTX 960M actually held its own when it came to the speed of the tasks. Where it fell short, however, is reliability. Only having 2GB of ram is a huge determent and will cause you to have to sacrifice the size of your model tremendously in order to be able to fit under such a crippling limitation. For this reason, the GTX 960M is not close to being suited for modern deep learning. The GTX 1080 with 8GB of RAM, however, flawlessly ran all of the tasks and provided about a 3x speed upgrade over the GTX 960M in tasks that it actually did run.", "AI-benchmark also creates a general score (higher is better) after the tests have finished running. To note, The GTX 960M benchmarks are inferred. Since the tests could not finish, there was no method of achieving an overall score. Because of this, I inferred the score from a similar GPU tested by AI-Benchmark\u2019s results. The substituted GPUs use the same architecture and performed within a couple of percent of each other in tests that ran successfully. It is clear to see that the GTX 1080 crushed all of the automated tests, and provided sizable gains in reliability and speed. Based on this result, it should seem clear that an eGPU is a great substitute for its expensive alternatives, and it is, but I have one caveat to that argument.", "Even though the results are astounding compared to just the XPS by itself, utilizing an eGPU versus an integrated GPU may come at a speed penalty.", "When comparing the benchmarks I got to the top benchmarks achieved by AI-benchmark, it leaves a lot to be desired. I expected between 10 and 15% performance loss due to bandwidth on the Thunderbolt 3 port, but these tests show there is a clear ~30% score degradation, and I have a hypothesis as to why.", "The XPS 15 9550 and 9650 models, even though they claim full thunderbolt 3 support, are hardware capped to 2 lanes instead of the advertised 4 (Dell has since addressed this). My hypothesis is this is creating a bottleneck over the thunderbolt port. In a future edition, I may run these tests with a MacBook (which has 4 lanes available) to confirm my suspicion. If I am correct, I should see AI scores over 1400 on the MacBook. This article also confirms my suspicion!", "This brings me to my general recommendations \u2014 is this a viable and cost-effective option?", "I would say absolutely. even with scores not meeting the benchmark, this $540 upgrade to a once $1500 computer has extended its viability by years. Just the difference between having 2GB GPU and 8GB GPU is enough to make this worth doing. If your laptop only has integrated graphics, I would even call this upgrade a must if you want to use it for deep learning.", "The only way I would not suggest this upgrade is if your laptop already has 4GB of GPU RAM and at least a GTX 1050-Ti GPU. If that is the case, you are not likely to see vast improvements in performance, and an eGPU will really only be worth your money if you find yourself needing more RAM for heavier tasks.", "If you enjoyed this article, I wrote an additional article comparing this eGPU to Google Colab! If you loved this, it is worth a read, and another follow-up in this article, where I test what happens when connection speeds are upped to 40 Gbps.
