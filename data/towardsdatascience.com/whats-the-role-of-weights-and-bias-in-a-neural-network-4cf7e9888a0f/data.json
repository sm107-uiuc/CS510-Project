Before we get into the topic, \u201cwhat is the role of weights and bias in a Neural Network \u201c, let us understand the skeleton of this Artificial Neuron.", "We will understand a thing\u2019s importance only during its absence.", "As the statement speaks, let us see what if there is no concept of weights in a neural network. For simplicity let us consider there are only two inputs/features in a dataset (input vector X \u03f5 [ x\u2081 x\u2082 ]), and our task task it to perform binary classification.", "The summation function g(x) sums up all the inputs and adds bias to it.", "so after summation function does its job we get a integer value as output, but since this is a binary classification problem we need to convert this integer value to a binary output, to do this we take help of a activation function that maps a integer value to a binary output. The activation function would look like this", "If you observe, the activation function is mapping a integer value to 1 if the output of the summation function is greater than or equal to 0 else it is giving the output as 0.", "If we compare the activation function expression with the equation of a line:", "By carefully observing the above 2 expressions, we can infer that the slope(m) of the equation x\u2082 = -x\u2081 + b is fixed that is -1, and it will not change in any case. Now you should have understood the problem, for any given dataset if there are no weights involved then the slope of the line that classifies a data point never changes and we are not able to draw a scalable line that separates two classes.", "Consider this sample dataset for demonstration, which contains two inputs (features) [x\u2081 and x\u2082] and one output y. Now our task is, we need to train the computer to predict y if we provide x1 and x2.", "So the 1st step is we need to give the inputs (x1 and x2) to the summation function", "Next step is to map the integer output to a binary value using activation function that is (x1 + x2 + b \u2265 0) for the output to be 1, that can be viewed as (x2 \u2265 -x1 -b) and the edge condition is x2 = -x-b, so all the points that fall above this line are considered to be 1 and and all the points below this line will be 0, so we draw different lines and find the best value for b that correctly classifies the dataset.", "Now if we try to fit the line equation ( x\u2082 = -x\u2081 + b) for the different values of x1 and b we will get this plot\u2026", "You can change the value of x1and b as many times as you want in the expression (x2 = -x1-b) and one thing you observe is all the lines are parallel with same slope as (-1). lets again take a scenario", "If we consider the value of b is 0, and for any value of x1 the line equation looks like (x\u2082 = -x\u2081 + 0), it is represented as the orange line in the above plot.", "If we consider the value of b is 1, the line equation looks like (x\u2082 = -x\u2081 + 1), it is represented as the blue line in the above plot.", "If we consider the value of b is 2, the line equation looks like(x\u2082 = -x\u2081 + 2), it is represented as the green line in the above plot.", "If we go on changing the value of b, we will only end up with parallel lines, but there will not be any change in the orientation or slope of the line, with this we can not even correctly classify our dataset, so we need some thing extra that changes the slope of the line and that is weights.", "When we assign weights to each input then the equation looks like\u2026", "the line that better fits the above dataset is: x\u2081 = 0,", "when w2 = 0, w1 = 1, b = 0, the equation fits the data set in a best way.", "From the plot, we can observe that the slope of the line has been changed with the introduction of weights in the equation.", "Weights associated with each feature, convey the importance of that feature in predicting the output value. Features with weights that are close to zero said to have lesser importance in the prediction process compared to the features with weights having a larger value.", "In the above example the w2 is 0 that means we don\u2019t need w2 for predicting the value of y and the value of w1 is 1, that means we can predict the value of y using x1 alone.", "let us consider an example of finding the likelihood of buying a car, with the dataset containing two input features like", "and let us suppose that people often tend to buy a car within their budget and the most popular one among many.", "the equation of line looks like\u2026", "if the price of the car increases, then the expression value also increases, that means \u201cwe are more likely to buy that car\u201d, but we don\u2019t want that to happen, so we have to compensate it with a negative valued weight (w\u2081) so that their product becomes negative and the value of expression decreases, that implies we are not interested in buying that car, in this way wights help us.", "so if the weight associated with a feature is positive it implies that there is a direct relationship between that feature and the target value, and if the weight associated with the feature is negative it implies that there is an inverse relationship between the feature and the target value.", "Bias is used for shifting the activation function towards the left of right, did not get this statement? \ud83d\ude15 don\u2019t worry let\u2019s understand it with a visual experience \u2026", "let us consider a sigmoid activation function to demonstrate the use of bias, we can represent the sigmoid activation function with the mathematical expression as", "replacing x with the equation of a line", "when the value of b =0 and", "w = 0.3 \u2014 the blue line in the plot", "w= 0.5 \u2014 the red line in the plot", "w = 0.7 \u2014 the green line in the plot", "Even while giving different values of w, we could not shift the center of the activation function, in this case, the sigmoid function.", "Changing the value of w only changes the steepness of the curve, but there is no way we cans shift the curve towards left or right, the only way to shift the curve towards left or right is by changing the value of bias(b).", "when the value of w=0.5 and", "b = -1 \u2014 the red line in the plot", "b= -5 \u2014 the green line in the plot", "b = 1 \u2014 the blue line in the plot", "b = 5 \u2014 the yellow line in the plot", "look at the plot, changing the value of b changes the position of the curve, hence bias is used for shifting the activation function towards left or right.", "Let us understand the working of sigmoid first\u2026", "The equation of the curve is", "From the plot, we infer that all the values towards the right of 0 are mapped to 1 and all the values towards the left of 0 are mapped to 0.", "let us take if x = -1 then the corresponding y value is around 0.1, and we round it to 0, now let us take x= 5 then the corresponding y value is around 1, and we round it to 1.", "The answer is you need to shift the curve towards the right, ie", "The equation of the curve is", "from the plot, we can infer that all the point to the left of the point x=5, seems to have y value less than 0.5, which when rounded ends up with value 0. Hence we achieved our goal by shifting the curve towards shift, and bias is responsible for shifting the curve towards the right, that\u2019s the use of bias in an Artificial Neuron.", "I hope this article cleared all your doubts about why we need weights and bias in the Artificial Neuron.", "Your home for data science.
