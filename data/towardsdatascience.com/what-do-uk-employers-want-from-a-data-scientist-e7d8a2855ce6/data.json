Naturally, they sign up to intense bootcamps and scramble to take online courses on everything from Azure to Excel.", "How can you be sure that focusing on a particular skill won\u2019t prove to be a massive opportunity cost? How many years experience are they expecting? What should I expect to get paid, realistically? If you\u2019re leafing through a data science syllabus, and you want to make sure your investment pays off then what should that syllabus include? That\u2019s also a very pertinent question for people designing a data science course: how do we maximise the overlap between what recruiters want and what our course teaches?", "I\u2019m reporting on findings from an exploration of job data on Indeed.co.uk, so this focusses on the UK job market. Although this post provides useful answers, there are still plenty of questions to ask and it\u2019s unclear how representative the findings are of the total population of jobs. This is why future iterations of the project in Q1 2021 and later will try to replicate / falsify the findings.

Yet with so many people rushing into data science, it\u2019s important to know the market and offer a competitive resume. This post and its corresponding project repository represent my initiative in adding to the trove of knowledge on the job market. This is an exploratory, single-researcher analysis, using data scraped only from Indeed, with a total sample of 1082 job descriptions and 382 annual salaries. Therefore you should take findings with a pinch of salt. The plan is to replicate the scraping and analysis during Q1 2021. I plan to broaden the range of analyses performed on the data as well as improve the quality and efficiency of the web-scraping tool. I searched for jobs with 3 different pairs of words in the title:", "I\u2019ve included all of those under the umbrella of \u201cdata science roles\u201d because even though it\u2019s common knowledge that those roles do very different things and require different proficiencies, they still all do data science, and the lines between the categories is blurry.", "The discrepancy is consistent across the three categories, though wider for roles with \u201cmachine learning\u201d (ML) in the title than those with \u201cdata analyst\u201d (DA). This is particularly daunting for the lone, fresh data scientist entering the field, especially if they have no prior experience of negotiating pay in any field.", "Roles with \u201cdata scientist\u201d (DS) and ML in the title are paid on average \u00a325k per year more. That\u2019s approximately \u00a313 per hour more.", "If you\u2019re aiming to maximise your salary, it\u2019s important to know what parts of the field return greatest financial rewards over time. Having said that, consider that experience can be the greatest barrier to getting a job in data science (see Insight 4). If an analyst role is easier to get into, but you still want to aim for the higher salaried positions, then why not build on it?", "For those just entering the field, that\u2019s enough information to tell you where to start focusing your attention. Once you have a solid foundation in those two, here are your options:", "Most jobs that could be found to explicitly state an experience threshold asked for 2 to 3 years experience. If representative, this presents the largest barrier to entering a data science role. If you\u2019re completely lacking in experience now, you might have around 20 jobs open to your level.", "After 2 years working in data science, that number should be 3 times bigger. Moreover, the expected salary will increase too, as there is a moderate correlation between the two.", "As you might expect, just over half of the jobs are in London. They also pay on average 50% more than in the rest of the country, which is to be expected given the much higher cost of living.", "The median data analyst in London would expect to earn as much as the overall median for outside the capital.", "Using topic modelling (LDA) to cluster and group jobs, I could determine 3 emergent topics that weren\u2019t just noise. These were the", "This last insight was generated with unsupervised techniques and it is not currently possible to verify the accuracy of those topics.

Conclusion \u2014 Report any insights, recommendations and future steps.", "If we want to get ahead in the data science UK job market, it would be useful to be able to answer the following:", "My plan was to scrape data from Indeed.co.uk using BS4 and Selenium. Then I would extract key information such as salary, location and programming languages using regex (regular expressions). I would plot and wrangle data using the Pandas and Seaborn libraries then carry out statistical tests. I would also attempt to build a predictive model for salary using linear regression, and report on the coefficients as measures of the importance of each job feature. Lastly I would use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to look for emerging topics within job descriptions.", "The ideal situation would be to answer all questions stated and to be able to state Insights and Recommendations for every part of my analysis. However, in several areas, I had to report null resorts due to either insufficient data or a lack of a signal, and will have to revisit those questions in future iterations of the project.", "From previous attempts at web-scraping jobs on Indeed.co.uk, I know that the number of jobs listed at any one time are in the hundreds, so there would likely be a problem of insufficient data for some of the questions I wanted to answer. Another problem was trying to make sure that the search terms I used captured the field of data science as much as possible, rather than just one specific role within it.", "To tackle those two problems, I retrieved job data from Indeed.co.uk based on 3 separate searches. For each of these, my search results only returned job posts where the title of the job included the following pairs of words:", "There were jobs that contained a mixture of 2 of the title words (these duplicates were discarded). Moreover it\u2019s generally known that a data analyst is doing data science, an ML engineer does do some analysis, a data scientist does use machine learning, and so on.", "From the perspective of a recent data science grad or someone fresh out of a bootcamp, one challenge they\u2019ll face is salary negotiation \u2014 particularly daunting when most jobs do not directly state their salary. This applies across the board to all 3 categories, although the gap is wider for DA and ML roles.", "For the bootcamp\u2019s organisers, this makes it even more important that they research salary estimates thoroughly and inform their students of this \u2014 to help reach the goal of maximising average salary of bootcamp grads they should also be given help with salary negotiation.", "Among the jobs that reported annual salary (Fig 3.3), DA jobs were not as well paid as ML or DS jobs by quite a margin \u2014 the median salaries for DS and ML are at least \u00a312k above the median for all data science jobs; DA roles pay about \u00a320k less!", "This is fairly solid finding since it\u2019s supported by general background knowledge about the field that analyst roles tend to be less technically specialist and pay less compared to other data science roles. If you\u2019re aiming to maximise salary, then a recommendation might be to prepare your grads to aim for DS and ML jobs. However DA jobs are also the most numerous. They might form a reliable fallback for bootcamp grads not managing to hit targets for the DS and ML roles.", "3. What are the main locations that data scientist roles appear in? (London expected to be the main one)", "As expected, London dominates the country in terms of data science roles. Even with all the mini tech hubs, the emerging Northern cities and the Silicon Fen in Cambridge, London still edges over the entire rest of the country (Fig 3.4).", "The next 9 \u2018locations\u2019 with the most data science roles are utterly dwarfed by London (Fig 3.5). The fourth most popular location (as declared in the job) is \u2018Home Based\u2019, which is unfortunate for anyone hoping data science jobs might invigorate the North or anywhere that isn\u2019t London.", "The picture becomes even more dire when we consider salary breakdown between the capital and rest of the kingdom. Figure 3.6 shows the annual salaries for the 3 sub-groups in London. The purple and yellow line show the non-London and London median salaries respectively. There is \u00a320k difference between the two!", "4. What are some of the most frequent words mentioned in the job title?", "A job title can communicate a lot of things. For instance if a role mention \u201cR\u201d in their title (e.g. \u201cData Scientist with R experience\u201d) you\u2019ll have good reason to ignore that role if you don\u2019t code in R. If we look at the single terms and bigrams (2 word combos) that appear most frequently (Fig 3.7) we can infer the following:", "5. Which programming languages are in greatest demand? Do any of the languages correlate with higher salary?", "For this question, I went beyond including just programming languages but also techniques, libraries, cloud services and skills. This has greatly increased the usefulness of the findings.", "Figure 3.8 illustrates how the 10 most popular languages and skills compare across the 3 groups. This particular graph can be used to tailor your own portfolio building journey.", "For instance, if you have expertise in R and SQL, you\u2019re more well positioned to aim for a DA roles. If you have experience in Java and are considering pivoting into data science, then focusing on Python and AWS will put you in good stead.", "If you\u2019re a data bootcamp, you can help inform more clearly which skills grads can leverage towards which roles, so they can optimise their job search. Towards the end of your course, you could create \u2018Data Science Profiles\u2019 that learners can gravitate towards depending on the kind of work they would prefer doing. Those that want heavier computational work (so more on the ML side), can attend classes on Docker, Java and AWS. Those drawn more towards analytics can spend more time refining their SQL and other relevant skills.", "I next attempted to build a linear regression model for predicting salary, but it would seem that there wasn\u2019t any way to reliably predict the salary from the features I built. After multiple iterations, dropping non-significant features and cross-validating, the summary for the best model is this:", "I also attempted to bin the salary data into bands so that I could attempt to predict (binned into categories such as \u00a320'000\u201325'000). However, even that didn\u2019t have much predictive power, with the best model having an accuracy of about 10% (given 10 different salary bands). To conclude, the model is nullified and I will attempt to build another in future iterations of the project, when more data is available. However, it might just be the case that the features used have no real relationship with salary.", "Many new data scientists find it vexing or disappointing when they search for an \u201centry-level\u201d position and find that it requires 3 years of experience in the field. But do the years of experience required stated in the job ad actually have anything to do with something more concrete, like pay?", "After extracting the required experience in years from job posts using regex and averaging those that gave a range (\u201c2\u20133 years experience\u201d becomes 2.5), I compared it to salary for those jobs. Jobs with 0 years experience were found by searching for \u201cjunior role / data / position\u201d (this is probably the most contentious assumption of the created feature). Unfortunately there were very few jobs I could extract such data for (246 job posts), although the Spearman Ranked Correlation test was significant (p value < 0.001). The experience and salary have a weak-to-moderate correlation (0.37). We must remember that this was based on data mined with regex and is relying on certain assumptions and limitations. Hence this is an important test to re-run in the next project iteration.", "Out of those jobs, Figure 3.9 shows the general trend. The largest number of jobs in this group asked for 2 OR 3 years of experience. Hopefully this isn\u2019t representative of the job market, but if it is then as a beginner data scientist, you\u2019d have to find ways to make up for the lack of experience, e.g. by doing freelance work for a while.", "Using topic modelling, can we see if there are natural groups within the job descriptions? Can we split apart our data in some semantic way?", "Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and pyLDAviz (here\u2019s my previous post on it), I determined a few emergent topics of interest. It\u2019s important to note that, since this is an unsupervised approach, there\u2019s a strong chance that the outputs are mostly noise, and not useful insights. However, guided by domain knowledge and other pieces of information in this dataset, we can infer at least 3 useful topics.", "Client and Business-centric \u2014 (Fig 3.10) Roles heavily featuring this topic are focused more on delivering insights towards customers and using tools such as dashboards, excel, (power) \u2018bi\u2019 and thus providing analytical insights for the stakeholders.", "Development and Deep Learning\u2014 (Fig 3.11) This topic and associated job roles are focussed on development programming languages (\u2018java\u2019), specific packages used for deep learning (\u2018tensorflow\u2019, \u2018pytorch\u2019), niche areas (\u2018NLP\u2019, \u2018neural\u2019 (networks)) and mentions \u2018development\u2019, \u2018processing\u2019 and \u2018product\u2019. This topic corresponds strongly to a lot of ML jobs.", "Academic & Scientific (Fig 3.12) \u2014 there\u2019s a very strong association with this topic and terms such as \u2018university\u2019 and \u2018research\u2019 \u2014 more so than for any other topic! Also the only other topic with a strong association with \u2018AI\u2019, \u2018novel\u2019, \u2018publication\u2019 and \u2018academic\u2019 is Topic 1 \u2014 Deep Learning and Development.", "My plan is to repeat this project in late Q1 2021 with a fresh batch of job post data and to improve the functionality of the web scraper to be able to detect tags for things such as \u201cRemote working\u201d. I hope that this exploratory analysis proves useful to some people, although I repeat that all findings should be considered in light of the unstructured and semi-rigorous nature of the work. None of these findings can/should be interpreted as conclusive, only preliminary. As said before, I appreciate any feedback and any claps! If I had to summarise the most important advice for aspiring data scientists in one bullet point it would be this:", "Invest most time into mastering Python and SQL, play the long game and lower your initial expectations of what pay or job you\u2019ll get, with the realistic hope that 2 years of building experience in your less-than-ideal job. Don\u2019t spend too much time initially on niche, fancy areas like deep learning or NLP, you can revisit those at a latter stage.
