It also becomes the buzzword for the recent year by any stakeholders. Because of that, there\u2019s a lot of resources that exist, such as courses, papers, communities, and many more.", "And amazingly, most of the resources are given at no cost, and it\u2019s publicly accessible on the internet. Therefore, Deep Learning becomes available for communities around the world regardless of what\u2019s their background and where they represent.", "As those factors make Deep Learning so famous this time, some effects will affect to us. One of them is affecting our mental health. With that vast amount of resources, it leads us to become overwhelmed.", "Feel overwhelmed is a feeling where you become frustrated because of some factors. If we don\u2019t treat it really great, it will lead us to become unmotivated to do many things.", "Yoshua Bengio, one of the winners of 2018 Turing Award and the famous deep learning researcher, recently publishes an article on his blog about rethinking how the publication in machine learning would like to be. It resembles to a manifesto called Slow Science. I\u2019ve quoted it, and what is said is like this,", "We do need time to think. We do need time to digest. We do need time to mis\u00adunderstand each other, especially when fostering lost dialogue between humanities and natural sciences. We cannot continuously tell you what our science means; what it will be good for; because we simply don\u2019t know yet. Science needs time.", "\u2014 Bear with us, while we think.", "Based on the quotes above, it shows that, as a scientist, we should slow down ourself to achieve things. What he really wants is that the field should have more conversations to it. Therefore, it could produce a breakthrough, or it could be new inspirations.", "The concept itself is not just for the scientist, but also for us, as a learner, to slow us down to achieve more from the field.", "Now, let me ask you these questions,", "Probably you will answer that you\u2019ve learned a lot, and also you feel okay while learning Deep Learning. Are you sure with that? Maybe you will answer it yes or no. But if you already open so many resources and don\u2019t feel that you\u2019ve learned any single things from it, you should take a break.", "We may want to learn so many things, and we want to achieve many things, but don\u2019t rush on it. We have to slow ourself down, or it could lead us to become unmotivated.", "Now, the problem is how we can learn Deep Learning without getting overwhelmed?", "Here are my tips on how to learn without getting overwhelmed.", "People can learn all of the things. But to learn it, probably you will use a different style for learning. There are many kinds of learning styles. They are,", "So, based on those types, which one suits you? You don\u2019t have to choose one of them. You could combine those to make your learning more effectively. I\u2019m the type of kinesthetic and reading learner because I would prefer to learn from reading books and then implement those.", "You know yourself. Therefore, you have to choose which one suits you.", "Right after you\u2019ve known your learning style, the next step is to determine which resource to use. There are many resources to learn deep learning, such as Stanford University, MIT, Deep Mind, and many more. You could use any kind of those, but one rule that you must hold is that,", "Each course has its own uniqueness, but mostly it gives you the same concept. Therefore, you should stick on it, and you have to learn until you\u2019ve finished the course.", "If you feel that you don\u2019t understand the course, you can search other resource as your additional reference, and don\u2019t use it as your primary resource. Just use with the first one for your main resource.", "Learning sometimes makes you bored. To make sure that you always get motivated, you should do something else that could matter to you or something that you love. Or probably you are an employee for a company, so you can not choose when to learn new things.", "You can apply OpenAI\u2019s Learning Day to solve this. Learning Day is a day for learning new things that are not your expertise. For example, you are a data analyst, and you are interested in reinforcement learning. Therefore, you can allocate one full day to learn that. Probably you can schedule it on weekdays or weekend.", "By doing it, you will not get bored, and you can increase your skill in another field.", "Publicly available resources make deep learning accessible to anyone. But the vast amount of it leads us to feel overwhelmed. Therefore, you should learn slower and focus just one resource only.
