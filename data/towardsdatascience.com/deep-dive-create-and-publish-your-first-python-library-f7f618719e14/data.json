Easy!", "First, because the code you have written may, in the future, save other developers from going through the same long and expensive research process you did.", "Also, if your code provides a high level interface to solve some problems, you will help democratize the resolution of these problems to less experienced programmers. Therefore, your high-level library could, for example, become an entry point for others to easily get a quick result.", "And finally, because on your resume and during an interview, saying that you devote your free time to programming and developing libraries will undeniably work in your benefit.", "Confident? Let\u2019s go to the creation of your lib!", "First, when creating your library\u2019s project in your favorite IDE, use an older version of Python, so that your library can be compatible with as many current workflows as possible.", "For example: Python 3.9 released 2 months ago.
