It doesn\u2019t take much analytics to see that the chart from Google Trends shows an explosion of interest on this topic since 2013.", "Since it became popular, big data has taken the business world by storm. It seems to have infiltrated organisations of all sizes across all industries and there is no denying that big data is the key driver for a large number of commercial successes. However that\u2019s not what I want to talk about today, with the value of big data being featured everywhere, I want to talk about the value in small data. Not every organisation has the luxury to work with big data but if we have a different approach, we can actually gain a lot of value with small data.", "I see a lot of parallels between small data and a new startup venture, we are often obssessed with growth and scale before we get things right. One common advice for startups is to do things that don\u2019t scale, with the famous example of AirBnB founders who visited their early customers one by one to learn about how and why they use the product. The principle is the same when it comes to small data. Because your dataset is small enough, you can look at individual data points, investigate individual outliers and try to understand how an individual customer or process is represented in your data. This approach is not scalable but it is a great way to really understand your data. When it comes to extracting value from data, there is no substitute with in depth understanding, so spend more time with the data when you can still do it.", "Recently I read Todd Rose\u2019s book \u201cThe End of Average\u201d which talks about the science of individuality. Todd described how traditional methods start by aggregating the data before analysing the results and through that process, we end up with an average that seemingly fits everyone but actually fits no one. The same can be said for big data sometimes, we are so obsessed with using more and more data, we overlook the value of an individual within the large dataset. It\u2019s somewhat ironic that we strive to achieve personalisation through the lens of big data rather than small data. Because we have access to huge amount of data, we default to aggregating large datasets before really trying to understand what is going on and we run the risk of overlooking important insights. The science of individuality offers an alternative solution, by first analysing individuals to find insights and then apply that to the large dataset, we may come to a very different conclusion. So indeed there is big value hidden in small dataset if you know how to find it.", "Now let\u2019s talk about some tips that can get you started when you are working with small datasets.", "Once we have exhausted all the different ways to leverage your small data, you can now look into growing your dataset. With the knowledge you have already gained with working intimately with your data, you should now feel much more comfortable with working with other datasets and understand how they can compliment yours.", "Here are a few ways that you can use to grow your dataset.", "Hopefully as you have been able to leverage your existing data effectively, your business is having strong organic growth. You can grow your dataset in both breadth and depth, by capturing more data points on your existing customers and increasing your customer base. Both offer different value to you and while they are not mutually exclusive, you should stay focused on getting the right data to answer your questions.", "Finding strategic data partners is a great way to onboard new datasets. This is a great way to grow if you can leverage other companies that have domain expertise on the dataset you are interested in. Things like geolocation dataset and analytics is a good example use case where collecting and analysing data in house might not be the best option.", "As mentioned briefly above, in some cases we are able to create a useful synthetic dataset. These are also useful when it comes to testing and offer a good alternative when you are handling sensitive data that comes with strict regulations.", "Just because your dataset is small, doesn\u2019t mean it is not valuable. In the age of big data, we often neglect the power of small data, but when used effectively, even the smallest of datasets will be able to bring great value to your business. We should start thinking of small data as a blessing rather than a curse. It might be a constraint that we have to work with, but it\u2019s one that can help us see the problem differently if we approach it with the right mindset and techniques.", "If you have enjoyed my content, sign up for more at https://jchoi.solutions/subscribe", "Your home for data science.
