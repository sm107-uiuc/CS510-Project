The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used in the convolution operation underlying computer vision and (with modifications) in audio-signal processing while the Spherical Harmonics give the structure of the Periodic Table of the Elements.", "While it\u2019s easy enough to write down a formula, there is a broader view revealing that each arises from simple considerations about symmetry. We will pursue that view here.", "As always, I will strive to avoid unnecessary technical jargon complications. If you\u2019re interested in them, try the footnotes. There will, however, be some complex numbers: you\u2019ve been warned.", "The Fourier Series is the oldest of the bunch and was originally studied by a Frenchman, Joseph Fourier. Fourier, a friend of Napoleon\u2019s, wrote about it in the 1820s while studying heat flow, shortly before he discovered the Greenhouse Effect we spend so much time worrying about today.", "The natural setup for the Fourier Series is complex-valued functions on a circle.\u00b9 As you will recall, a function is something that takes and input and gives an output.", "Symmetry is one of those mystical things people love to talk about. For example, research has consistently shown that if your face is symmetric, people find you more attractive. It also shows up in physics: the best theory of the world we currently have can cryptically be described as the symmetry SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1), whatever that means. But when we talk about symmetry, we mean something laughably simple: if you rotate a function on a circle, you get a function on a circle.", "Now, it\u2019s a little tricky to draw a function on a circle. So please recall that if you take a piece of string and connect the two ends, you can make a circle. With this in mind, we can graph a function on a circle by graphing it on a line segment; the fact that the left and right ends have to be connected you have to visualize in your head.", "The figure below shows a simple function on a circle (left). To rotate it, we just \u201cshift\u201d with the proviso that whatever goes off the right end comes back on the left. In this case, the rotation is by \u1d28/2 radians (which is 90\u00b0). The input to the function is just the angle around the circle (going clockwise starting from the point all the way on the right, say).", "Another way to think about this is, if you have a function on a circle, you can just rotate the circle (because the circle is, tautologically, circularly symmetric).\u00b2", "Hopefully you are convinced so far that there is no particular wizardry going on yet. All we said was that if you rotate the function (or the circle), you get another perfectly good function.", "The study of the fact that you can rotate a function on a circle to get another function is called representation theory by mathematicians and it involves one extra step that opens up a whole world of understanding.", "The extra step isn\u2019t too complicated in itself. In the previous setup, when you wanted to rotate the circle, you just rotated it. Now we will add an intermediary. I want you to imagine that you are going to give instructions to rotate the circle and I am going to interpret them and do the rotation. For example, you might say \u201crotate the circle 73\u00b0\u201d and I will rotate the circle 73\u00b0.", "Now, I never said I have to do exactly what you said. There are some rules that apply to what I do, and we\u2019re going to explore them by example.", "It would be quite a diversion to go deep into the details of where these rules come from. But very briefly, the \u201crotations of a circle\u201d come with a certain mathematical structure (called a group). Roughly, the structure is that obvious fact that rotating by 1\u00b0 and then again by 1\u00b0 is the same as rotating by 2\u00b0. Plus the fact that 360\u00b0 is the same as 0\u00b0, which does nothing. The rules:", "follow from the requirement that we preserve this structure and in turn imply that I can only multiply by an integer. This consequence is called quantization and is precisely what is meant by the \u201cquantum\u201d in quantum mechanics. In fact, it turns out that the reason that electric charges come in discrete (quantized) amounts follows directly from the argument we have just made. For this reason, the integer multiple I use is sometimes called charge!", "To recap, recall that we have:", "Taken all together, these three mathematical objects form a representation.\u00b3 I imagine it is so called because I am \u201crepresenting\u201d your abstract instructions with a concrete action.", "This is where the magic happens. In many contexts (like the one here), the thing being acted on (the functions) can be decomposed into constituent parts.\u2074 Roughly what\u2019s going to happen is:", "If we have done this, we have broken down a complicated thing into the sum of a number of simple parts.\u2075 This is good. If we do this, we win.", "Now, proving all of this is going to work is beyond the scope of this article. If you are interested, it\u2019s often the first thing covered in any textbook on representation theory and it isn\u2019t crazy hard or anything. Instead, we are just going to introduce a sleight of hand and then describe the buckets.", "Consider the function f below, and look at what happens when we rotate it by an angle a. As in the previous diagram, rotation is the same as shifting the argument to the function by a. i is the imaginary unit, the square root of -1 (don\u2019t worry about it for now). Everything else follows from the exponent rules you learned in math class.", "It turns out (by Schur\u2019s lemma) that the functions in our buckets have to satisfy the property that rotating them is the same as multiplying them. And the functions above, where n is any integer, are exactly the functions that do satisfy this property. Therefore, we can write any function on the circle as a sum of such functions:", "where the coefficients a just tell us how much of each function to take. This decomposition is called the Fourier Series. If you don\u2019t like complex numbers as much, you may be more comfortable using the fact that", "which means that we can write every function f on the circle in the form", "and the complex numbers are hiding in the coefficients a and b if they are necessary. (Note: we combined terms like n=2 and n=-2 so we only sum over non-negative n. And for n=0, we only really need one of these terms.)", "Finally, note that we might need infinitely many terms whereas in practice we only get finitely many. The animation below shows what happens as we take more and more terms. The blue lines are a \u201csawtooth wave\u201d which you can think about as a discontinuous function on the circle (it jumps every 360\u00b0). The red curve is the Fourier Series approximation with 1, 2, 3, etc. terms.", "Let\u2019s recap what we did. We realized that if you rotate a circle you get a circle back (the symmetry). We expanded this so that we worked with functions on the circle and allowed our rotation instructions to be modified (the representation). We learned that the functions can be decomposed into simpler parts (the irreducible representations) and that the simpler parts had to satisfy a simple property that rotation is multiplication (Schur\u2019s lemma). With this we could write down those simple parts.", "To recover everything else, all we need to do is consider functions on X where X is something other than the circle.", "Okay, let\u2019s make X into \u211d, the real numbers. They symmetry is that you can translate the real numbers (add 5, say) and end up with what you started with. Or stated with functions, a regular function that takes as input a real number and has as output a real number can be translated and you get back another perfectly good function.\u2076", "Formally, this is similar to what we did on a circle where rotation also looked like a shift. Unlike before, however, the result will not be quantized. Instead of having discrete buckets, we will have on bucket for every real number. To add up a continuous set of things, we need to use an integral instead of a summation; but conceptually this is the same as with the circle.", "Note this is not the formula you will see on Wikipedia for a couple reasons. First, the Fourier transform is usually written down with a slightly different normalization (we need a 2\u1d28 term somewhere to make some later formulas nice). Second, it is the inverse transform: the transform computes the coefficients a(p), and the inverse transform is how we write down the decomposition of the function f.", "Now let\u2019s change the underlying space to be a \u201cdiscrete\u201d version of the circle. Let\u2019s say there are N points equally spaced around a circle. The symmetry is that you can rotate by 360/N degrees or any integer multiple of it. A \u201cfunction\u201d on the \u201cdiscrete circle\u201d is just a list of N numbers, 1 for each point. Rotating the function is just shifting the list of N numbers (and moving anything that goes off the edge back to the other side).", "Now there will only be N buckets. The smallest rotation is by an angle of 2\u1d28/N radians. The variable changes from x to k and k is an integer, one of 0,1,2,\u2026,N-1.", "Again, slightly different than what you will see on Wikipedia for the same reasons.", "Now let\u2019s change the underlying space to be a discrete version of the line (the real numbers). So we get the integers. The symmetry is shifting by any integer. A \u201cfunction\u201d is an infinite list of numbers, one for every integer.", "Again, we aren\u2019t being careful with our 2\u1d28 normalizations.", "What if the underlying space is a sphere? By sphere, I mean the boundary and exclude the interior. This space is denoted S\u00b2. The symmetry is any rotation of 3 dimensional space. Because this symmetry group is a little more complicated, the number of functions in each \u201cbucket\u201d is not always one.", "The result is called the spherical harmonics and you learned about them in chemistry class. The size of these buckets also gives the structure of the periodic table. This is pretty amazing: just by trying to do a Fourier Transform on a sphere, you can basically figure out chemistry. (There are some more details: everything gets doubled because electrons can be spin up or spin down).", "I will briefly try to describe the buckets and their relation to the periodic table.", "To spell it out, the quantum state of an atom is like a function on a sphere (the radial part factors out and accounts for the 1s, 2s 2p, 3s 3p, 4s 4p 4d part of the structure). If you rotate that state you get another perfectly good state (you\u2019d better!). So the representation theory applies and we can do our \u201cFourier\u201d analysis.", "We\u2019ve seen that the Fourier transform and its cousins can be viewed as doing the same process to a function, with slightly different results depending on the data that make up the function. The table at left captures the 5 versions we described. And of course you can do it on any shape that has a symmetry. For example, you could work out Fourier analysis on a function that is defined on a plane (2-dimensional real numbers) or for an image (which is a finite 2d array of numbers that we can take to loop back on itself, forming a discrete torus).", "We\u2019ve also seen just how powerful this tool is. It gives us the periodic table of the elements (essentially our whole world). In computer vision, it turns out that it\u2019s faster to do a (discrete) Fourier transform, multiply the results, and then inverse transform than just naively multiplying numbers. In audio signal processing, the Fourier transform and its variants (like the wavelet transform) is a powerful tool for feature extraction. Tune in next time for applications.", "I found Peter Woit\u2019s book on Quantum Mechanics provided a very clear explanation of representation theory and the Fourier Transform, though it doesn\u2019t go into any of discrete variants or the relationship between the two.", "[1] For those interested in the technicalities we will be using L\u00b2(S\u00b9), the space of Lebesgue Square-Integrable functions on the circle.", "[2] I have elided some details in the relationship between the symmetry of the circle and functions on the circle. These details mostly amount to dealing with some pesky minus signs. Roughly, if you rotate the circle, you have to rotate the function backwards so that everything ends up working the way you expect (and so that the map from the symmetry group to the set of actions is a homomorphism instead of being backwards).", "[3] The official definition of a representation is that you have a group G, an underlying vector space V, and a map \u03c1 from G to GL(V), the group of all invertible linear transformations on V.", "[4] The main requirement is that the representation is unitary (it is here). We will also use the fact that the symmetry group of rotations of a circle, called U(1) is Abelian (commutative: x + y = y + x) to ensure that the irreducible representations are 1 dimensional. We are going to ignore entirely the analytical issues involved which largely amount to the fact that a given function may have an infinite number of \u201cparts\u201d it decomposes into and we have to be careful when talking about how to add up infinitely many things.", "[5] We have written the vector space as the direct sum of a collection of smaller vector spaces. In this example, the smaller vector spaces are 1 dimensional and the collection is indexed by the integers.", "[6] Let\u2019s keep things simple and say we are working on L\u00b2(R).
