To summarize everything, I\u2019ve proposed three pillars that a Data Scientist should look to improve in order to reach seniority:", "In this story, we will discuss a part of the first pillar: your personal skillset. What are the tools that you need to hone every day in order to execute your projects and deliver incredible results?", "Your ability to get things done is correlated with your familiarity with the tools that ease the burden of programming AI models and the knowledge about when to use them. You can say that a good Data Scientist is an expert applier.", "There are three steps in the Data Scientist modeling development process that are directly affected by your field knowledge: data representation, model building, and impact measurement.", "The first thing you need to do when creating your models is to define how your raw information will become pretty, semantically-charged numbers. Temporal Series of KPIs? Live feeds from surveillance cameras? Big chunks of texts from social media? You should be able to deal with those challenges even if they are out of your area of expertise.", "You need to know exactly how to deal with each type of data and what models are adequate for your chosen data representation.", "According to this Medium article from Sequoia, one of the main factors that transform a Junior into a Senior is their ability to be a multi-domain expert and functional leader. For that to happen, you need to be free from modal restraints: image, text, frequencies\u2026 It\u2019s all data.", "Get to know the basics of every possible area. Bag-of-Words and Word2Vec for text, SIFT/SURF and ImageNet-trained convolutional networks for images, spectrograms and MFCCS for audio. Your feature extraction toolbox should grow constantly.", "While modeling, training, and testing complex algorithms are part of the Data Scientist toolkit, they are not the main dish of the Data Scientist full course.", "You may have a preferred area, such as Natural Language Processing, Neural Machine Translation, Object Detection or Facial Recognition, but you don\u2019t need to be well-versed in all manner of neural network architecture known to man.", "You need to know the basics to model for every task. How to design your inputs and outputs, what loss function is best for your training, how to measure class unbalance and, most importantly, how to identify the core of the problem.", "Most AI challenges can be neatly segregated in distinct areas. Knowing general solutions for problems in each area is the first step to seniority.", "You don\u2019t need the implementation details of everything in your head, that\u2019s a task for Google and Mendeley. You just need to know how to efficiently research how to develop them and use that to implement these algorithms.", "Now, for all models you create, you will feel a tingling sensation when looking at their metrics. If you leave it alone, it'll eat your sleep hours and leave you reeling, gasping, taken over the edge into madness.", "Is this model good enough for this task?", "Is it even useful for my company?", "Chances are that your whole model will be scrapped. That's just the reality of data. Things move so fast you don't even remember the last time an ML project was rolled into production.", "But the model itself was never your biggest asset. It's the insights you gained with it that are valuable.", "Let's go back a few paragraphs and reuse that user profiling problem. Your project was to segment your userbase in order to create targeted ads. Marketing was expecting big, abstract groupings based on previous population studies and your model created small, dense clusters. They are not happy about it, and you are called to explain these results.", "Now, your model was objectively bad in the eyes of everyone, but you know better.", "All that from a failed project.", "The only whetstone that will adequately sharpen this specific skill of value prospection is experience. A systemic view of the company will allow you to see possible connections; knowledge of what can be reused will allow you to create these links.", "Improve your critical thinking. Make it a daily practice. Quarter problems and solutions in atomic pieces. Be watchful of issues in other areas that may be enhanced with data.", "I\u2019m partial to the thought that a Data Scientist is a good learner and not necessarily a know-er. Don\u2019t be desperate to delve into every area and be a master in it. Slowly but surely you will accumulate knowledge and experience if you deal with Data on a daily basis. We are all walking up in the steps of Data together!", "Thank you for reading, and have fun in this Data-filled universe!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Consultant Data Scientist that also moonlights as Data Engineer"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
