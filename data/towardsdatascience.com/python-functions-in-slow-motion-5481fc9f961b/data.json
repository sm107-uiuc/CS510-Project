Turns out, it\u2019s all a myth. We don\u2019t even have brains!", "At least that\u2019s how it feels as I begin to study data science. Sometimes, I can\u2019t process all the information my eyes and ears are trying desperately to take in. Other times, I feel like I\u2019m on autopilot and the built-in formulas and libraries are doing all the work. You may think the latter is a desirable state, but I\u2019d much rather know what\u2019s going on \u201cunder the hood.\u201d", "Writing functions is a sweet spot where \u2014 call it middle-brain? \u2014 creativity overlaps with problem-solving in the most obvious way: you create something that solves a problem. Within the context of the larger project you\u2019re working on, it\u2019s nice to have this small success \u2014 to see that the stuff you put under the hood worked.", "Problem is, I\u2019m not very confident when writing functions\u2026 yet. I\u2019m going to share with you what I\u2019ve learned about writing them along my journey to becoming more confident.", "I assume that if you\u2019re still reading, you have at least tried to write a few functions. I skip some major definitions and requirements (plenty of tutorials and documentation cover them already) and instead focus on tangible things we beginners can do to help ourselves write python functions in the actual moment that we need to write them. Note: A summary of the process I outline within this article can be found at the end, if you\u2019re a list person!", "When I need to write a function, I immediately get nervous. Will I be able to do it? On the first try? Fast enough? It\u2019s harder for me to be creative or logical when I\u2019m distracting myself with pointless questions like that first.", "Even in technical interviews, the function output and how long it took you is not what\u2019s important \u2014 what\u2019s being measured is your resolve, resourcefulness, and approach to problem solving. Instead of getting scared, we ought to write functions as if we\u2019re doing a jigsaw puzzle.", "Some people place all the edge pieces first, some group all the similarly colored pieces together, some people look at the box constantly, some prefer to work with a group and others alone, and most move at their own pace and enjoy the process of putting it together. I\u2019ve never been nervous to put a puzzle together. In fact, it\u2019s relaxing.", "Adopting a positive mindset is important for any task, and that\u2019s just as true for writing Python functions!", "Perhaps you are also just beginning to learn Python, like me. As a beginner, I often rush myself unnecessarily. I\u2019m not sure why! If someone is looking over my shoulder, they are more than likely rooting for me to write the function successfully. I know very few interviewers who are rooting against their candidates, and in those cases you probably don\u2019t want to work with those people anyway. If you\u2019re pair programming, your peer hopes you are successful, and they don\u2019t have a time limit for you. The need for speed is all in our heads!", "The idea of \u201cslowing down to speed up\u201d is incredibly value in several applications, but especially when learning something new. If we take our time at the beginning, spending a couple extra hours to understand a topic, then we may save ourselves a couple weeks of work down the line. Adhering to this philosophy means we can\u2019t gloss over solutions for functions that we failed to write ourselves. We have to take the time to understand those too.", "Obviously we don\u2019t have all the time in the world. Balance taking your time with the old \u201cwork smarter not harder\u201d adage, and know when you\u2019ve reached the point of diminishing returns, which is almost certainly not before trying several times on your own. If you don\u2019t have someone in person to ask for help, Stack Overflow is amazing.", "If we spend a couple extra hours to understand a topic, then we may save ourselves a couple weeks of work down the line.", "Okay, now we\u2019re going to enjoy tackling this problem, and we don\u2019t need to rush at all. Let\u2019s do it.", "Write a function that finds the maximum of three numbers.", "Before we start giving the computer commands, let\u2019s focus on how a human would solve the problem. Once we think about our own thinking, we\u2019ll translate that to Python.", "For this problem, working backwards is helpful for me. (You may think of a different way off the top of your head.) If we\u2019re looking for the maximum, then our output will be one of the inputs. How will I know which input to return?", "If I did this problem with three numbers, like 1,2, and 3, how would I find the maximum? Look at the first two numbers and see which is greater. Then compare that greater number to the third number. Return whatever the greatest number of those two is.", "Writing down what you want the code to do in the comments is a great interim step for keeping track of your ideas somewhere outside of your own brain. The old idea that if you can explain something then you fully understand it holds true here \u2014 if we can explain through comments what the the function is supposed to do, that\u2019s half the battle.", "Tip: To comment out multiple lines at once, press command / . Try it!", "Remembering that there is no time limit, now I\u2019ll try to translate to python.", "Admittedly, this is sometimes the hardest part as a beginner. We don\u2019t know what is possible, and have to often look up the documentation, examples, or look at a cheatsheet. However, for me, making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn new information. It\u2019s like a good kind of trauma: Whenever I\u2019m in a similar situation, I\u2019m more likely to be \u201ctriggered\u201d and reminded what will happen if I make the same mistake again.", "For our max_of_three example, a comparison makes me think that I should use an if statement concerning the values of the first two numbers:", "Now, I imagine running the function. I\u2019ll test the function when I\u2019m more confident in my solution, but for now I\u2019m just getting started and simply imagine inputting values. I realize that I don\u2019t deal with the third number c at all. So, according to my comments, before I return anything, I need to compare my a and b to the third number c. So, it seems like I should compare the greatest number to c in each case, since I\u2019m not ordering the numbers and instead just returning the greatest one. Notice this is different than my original comments, but that\u2019s okay! I\u2019ll give it a try:", "I think my logic is sound. At this point, I might move on to the elif statement, but I just realized I\u2019m missing a step! What if a and c are equal? In that case, it doesn\u2019t matter what number (a or c) I return, because the max will be equal to both of them.", "By the way, I wasn\u2019t totally sure if I\u2019m using the if and elif statements correctly, so I googled \u201cif elif documentation\u201d and verified: \u201cThere can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional.\u201d", "Cool. But since I\u2019m taking my time, I realize I can make this a little easier to read by deleting the second elif line and replacing it with one character: >=", "Now I think I\u2019ve completed my function for when a is greater than b. I\u2019ll do something similar for when b is greater than a:", "One of the best parts about Python is the feedback \u2014 the error descriptions with an arrow telling you exactly where the error is occurring. If I get an error while running my function, I am that much closer to getting it right. To test my function, I\u2019ll try a few different trios:", "Everything looks good until the last two examples. There is no output. I must be missing something since there is no error yet nothing is returned. What am I missing?", "In each of the examples with no output, I have a = b. Looking at the code, I remembered to consider when a or b is equal to c, but I forgot the case where a and b are equal to each other! Well, that\u2019s easy enough to add in and test:", "Tip: Use print statements at different steps to see what is happening \u201cunder the hood\u201d in your function, especially if you can\u2019t figure out where you are going wrong. This is especially helpful for recursive functions, when we get there.", "It looks like I have completed writing this function. I am tempted to think, \u201cBig deal \u2014 I bet a lot of people could do this more quickly, and I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m right.\u201d But, I must remember, neither speed nor accuracy were the point of this exercise. The point was to get better at writing functions. And since I had a few areas that I overlooked and went back and fixed them, I succeeded!", "Furthermore, I\u2019m never going to use max_of_three because there is a built-in Python function called max that finds the maximum of any number of numbers. But I\u2019m a beginner, and the fastest way to get better at writing functions is not to immediately look at what other people have written but to keep practicing writing functions myself. (FWIW, I\u2019m going to try the rest of these later.) What did I learn in this example? When comparing integers, don\u2019t forget that they can be equal. I did forget on two different occasions while writing it.", "Speaking of the max function, it might be a fun challenge to write that function myself! I know the Python function allows for different types of inputs, but if I restrict myself to a list, I bet I could do it.", "Fast forward an hour, and I didn\u2019t replicate the maximum function. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I\u2019m getting errors when I try and translate my thoughts to Python. I\u2019ve taken a few short breaks to get a new take on the problem, but I\u2019ve pretty much stalled out. This is one version I tried:", "After this, I tried using the enumerate function. That didn\u2019t solve my problem. I decided to peek at the Python source code, but I realized I didn\u2019t actually know how to do that and couldn\u2019t find it when I tried to look. I did some more searching and found a similar question on Stack Overflow that I don\u2019t fully understand.", "So, it seems like I failed. Right?", "Remember, the goal was never to replicate the max function. The goal was to learn something by trying to replicate the max function. So, what did I learn?", "In short, I tried and failed to replicate something that is built in to Python and I would never have used anyway. However, I learned more by trying and failing than if I had just glossed over everything. Bonus: I had the wherewithal to optimize my time and not waste it by getting in a daze, becoming upset, or taking a long break only to come back and repeat myself. When my progress halted, I \u201casked for help.\u201d", "Do you do anything that I\u2019ve missed in this article? Add a comment if so!
