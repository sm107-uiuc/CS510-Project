Such a high fatality risk was terrifying, and the entire world went running for cover.", "In March, the New York Times described a report that Covid-19 could kill as many as 2.2 million people in the United States. That early report set many of our current policies in motion.", "Since March, we have accumulated a great deal of experience about the virus and substantially more data. Early speculations can now be replaced with informed analysis.", "In this article, I will explain how multiple newer data sources show that the overall fatality rate for Covid-19 is roughly one-tenth of what it was originally claimed to be \u2014 between 0.4% and 0.6%, and likely close to 0.5%.", "If you study the Naive CFR curve in Figure 4, it\u2019s apparent why some of the early-reported fatality rates were so high. Depending on the timing of the specific report, a person could perceive virtually any fatality rate up to 35%.", "We now know more than we knew in March about the timeline by which Covid-19 progresses. Understanding the disease\u2019s timeline allows us to analyze data and draw more accurate conclusions.", "The general progression of the disease, in mathematical terms, is as shown in Figure 1. First, a person is infected. After 2.3 days, the person becomes contagious. After 4.5 days, the person develops symptoms. After 5 days, the person will be tested. At 11 days, they are still sick, but no longer contagious. If they\u2019re going to die, they die after 18 days. Otherwise, they recover and develop antibodies at 21 days.", "Of course, there are ranges, probabilities, and confidence limits associated with each of these time periods. None of them are as specific as I just described. The real progression looks more like what is shown in Figure 2, where the pink shaded areas represent probabilities of the timelines.", "Contagiousness begins somewhere between 1 and 3 days after infection. Symptoms begin around 4\u20135 days. Testing is performed, on average, after 5 days. Sometimes it\u2019s performed before symptoms develop (e.g., if a person knows they\u2019ve come in contact with an infected person). Sometimes testing isn\u2019t done until the person is hospitalized. Some people die quickly, and some live much longer. There are hints that contagiousness and antibody development are non-normal distributions (they are not bell curves).", "The fact that there is variability in these ranges doesn\u2019t change our ability to use the data on disease progression to draw conclusions. As shown in Figure 3, we know that \u2014 for statistical purposes \u2014 a person who is infected at point \u201cA\u201d, either dies after 18 days at point \u201cB\u201d or recovers and develops antibodies after 21 days at point \u201cC\u201d.", "Knowing this timeline, we have a basis for calculating an overall fatality rate \u2014 if we can find data for points A, B, and C.", "Thanks to extensive antibody testing conducted one weekend in New York state, we have solid data for a point \u201cC\u201d, which is that 13.9% of New York state\u2019s population had developed antibodies as of April 19, 2020. We know those people had to be infected, on average, at least 21 days earlier, on March 29.", "To make that number useful, we need to put it together with the number of people who also became infected on March 29, but who later died.", "According to Figure 3, we need to look at the number of deaths 18 days after March 29 to make an apples-to-apples comparison of antibodies and deaths. Eighteen days later is April 16. New York state reported a total of 12,192 deaths as of that date.", "The question is not whether there\u2019s variability. The question is, \u201cHow much does that variability affect the calculation of fatality rate?\u201d", "What this tells us is that \u2014 of the 2.716 million New York state residents who were infected on or before March 29, 2020 with Covid-19\u2014 0.449% of them died. Thus, for the population of New York state, the overall fatality rate for Covid-19 is approximately 0.449% (at \u201cmean confidence\u201d). This is sometimes called the IFR, or Infection Fatality Rate, but that term has been used inconsistently in much of what has been published, so in this article I use the term fatality rate.", "The level of accuracy in this analysis does not justify showing results with three decimal places, however, I have carried that level of precision through this article for the sake of people who want to follow the calculations.", "After its initial antibody testing program, New York state continued to conduct antibody testing, and it has released two additional sets of test results. Using the same calculations I described above, these test results imply fatality rates of 0.520% and 0.686%.", "Less detail has been released on the test periods and methods of sampling the population in these later tests, which makes the fatality rates more uncertain than the first set of test results. Rather than completely exclude these later results, I computed a weighted nominal in which the first set of results is weighted more heavily than the second two sets. This produces a nominal fatality rate of 0.500%. (I\u2019ve included notes on this calculation in the Notes section at the end of the article.)", "If these results were excluded, the nominal would remain 0.449%, and the 11% difference between the two numbers would carry through the rest of the calculations in this article.", "Covid-19 has proved to be highly age-sensitive \u2014 it\u2019s significantly more deadly to older people than to younger people. New York state\u2019s population averages somewhat older than the US population. Based on the age-specific fatality ratios of the virus, and the demographics of New York state vs. the US as a whole, New York state should have 1.05 times the fatality from the virus of the US overall.", "However, within New York State, the virus has been concentrated in New York City, and New York City\u2019s population averages significantly younger than the US overall. Based again on age-specific fatality ratios and demographics, New York City should have 0.88 times the fatality of the US overall.", "To reconcile these competing ideas, I weighted the ages first for NYC and second for the rest of New York state according to the number of deaths from Covid-19 in each area. (I believe deaths are a better proxy for prevalence of the disease in the two areas than PCR/virus tests are because PCR/virus testing has been so inconsistent over time.) With this weighting, the overall population in New York state comes out to slightly younger than the US population, by a factor of 0.98.", "The details are shown in Table 1.", "To adjust for differences in the demographics of New York vs. the US overall, I divide the fatality rate for New York state by 0.98 (actually 0.984), which produces a fatality rate for the United States of 0.508%.", "This fatality rate is significantly lower than the rates of 3.5\u20135% that were reported in the pandemic\u2019s early days.", "Based on the number of deaths in the five boroughs as of last week, and the total population of New York City, the fatality rate cannot be less than 0.19%, even if 100% of people are infected.", "If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cThere are quite a few assumptions in all this, and some of the data points must have some variability associated with them,\u201d you\u2019re right.", "But the question is not whether there\u2019s variability. The question is, \u201cHow much does that variability affect the calculation of fatality rate?\u201d I considered seven possible areas of variability.", "Multiple antibody tests in New York state. As I described earlier, New York reported three sets of antibody test results. Variations in these results suggest that the overall fatality rate could vary from a low of 0.78 times nominal to a high of 1.22 times nominal.", "Bias in antibody testing. The public discussion of antibody testing has focused on accuracy of tests for testing individuals. The accuracy considerations for testing large groups are different. As long as we know the \u201csensitivity\u201d and \u201cspecificity\u201d of the test, we can account for inaccuracy in the tests mathematically. In the New York state tests, officials said the tests had been calibrated, \u201cto err on the side of producing false negatives \u2014 to miss some who may have antibodies.\u201d That suggests their tests probably understated the number of infections. I used variability of 0.9 times nominal to 1.0 times nominal for this factor.", "Additional antibody development. The research that found people take 21 days to develop antibodies specifically found not that 100% of people developed antibodies after 21 days, but that that 95% did. I did not include an allowance for 5% more people having antibodies than tested positive in the nominal fatality rate. Depending on whether that\u2019s included, the US fatality rate could be adjusted from 0.95 to 1.0 times nominal.", "New York State Demographics. I could have used just New York City\u2019s demographics or just New York state\u2019s. I could have weighted by PCR tests rather than deaths. Based on variations in how I could have adjusted for New York state\u2019s demographics vs. the US\u2019s as a whole, the overall US fatality rate could by adjusted by a factor ranging from 0.95 to 1.14 times nominal.", "Infection to antibody lag. If the research average of 21 days is not correct, that changes the relevant infection date. Allowing for infection dates ranging from March 27 to March 31, the US fatality rate could be adjusted by a factor ranging from 0.89 to 1.10x.", "Infection to death lag. If the average person takes longer or shorter than 18 days to die, that changes the relevant infection date, too. The calculation is the same as it for variability in the antibody lag. It produces the same date range from March 27 to March 31, and the same adjustment range to the US fatality rate 0.89x to 1.10x.", "Cause of Death. There has been much discussion about whether Covid-19 deaths are being over counted or under counted. There are lots of strong feelings, but very little data. I have not included any adjustment for this factor.", "These sources of variability and their impacts on the fatality rate calculation are summarized in Table 2.", "As I mentioned earlier, the three decimal places are included for sake of people interested in following the calculations. The underlying accuracy of the analysis and data really justifies only a coarser range of 0.4% to 0.6%.", "For those interested in the statistics, I\u2019ve included additional notes in the Notes section.", "Most of the erroneous speculations about fatality rates have been too high, but a few have been too low, including some assertions that the fatality rate might be close to influenza, i.e., around 0.1%.", "A lower limit on the possible fatality rate comes from analysis of New York City\u2019s deaths. Based on the number of deaths in the five boroughs as of last week, and the total population of New York City, the fatality rate cannot be less than 0.19%, even if 100% of people are infected. If only 50% are infected, the fatality rate cannot be below 0.38%.", "Table 3 provides specifics on deaths, populations, and minimum possible fatality rates within New York City\u2019s five boroughs and for New York City overall.", "Recent US test and death data provide a basis for estimating an upper limit on the possible fatality rate.", "Naive CFR is calculated by taking the deaths for one date divided by the number of positive tests 13 days earlier. The 13 days comes from the timeline shown in Figures 1\u20133.", "The CFR in Naive CFR stands for Case Fatality Rate. The reason it is called the Naive CFR is because we don\u2019t really know how many true cases exist for the purpose of calculating a true Case Fatality Rate. We use the number of positive tests as a proxy for the number of cases, but that proxy is not very accurate. So we refer to the resulting computation as the Naive CFR.", "The first few months of the pandemic, testing was limited. Only the sickest people were allowed to be tested, and so the number of positive tests was artificially low and the fatality rate was artificially high. Indeed, the Naive CFR was as high as 35% in March, as shown in Figure 4. This high apparent fatality rate was not due to the deadliness of the disease, per se, but rather to the limited number of tests that were performed at that time.", "As testing has become more comprehensive, the Naive CFR has declined steadily. As you can see from the figure, the Naive CFR has now dropped to 1.5%. If we are currently testing 100% of all infections, that implies the fatality rate has an upper limit of 1.5%.", "However, I don\u2019t think anyone believes that testing is currently capturing as much as 100% of infections, so the true fatality rate is likely lower than 1.5%. If you think we\u2019re currently testing half of infections, the fatality rate will be half of the Naive CFR, or 0.75%. If you think we\u2019re currently testing one-third of infections, the fatality rate will be one-third of the Naive CFR, or 0.5%.", "A fatality rate of 0.5% is consistent with the fatality rate calculated from the New York antibody study, and the idea that we are currently testing one-third of infections seems plausible.", "Including the variability shown in Table 2 brings me to my conclusion that the overall fatality rate for Covid-19 in the US is between 0.4% and 0.6%, and is likely close to 0.5%.", "If you study the Naive CFR curve, you can see why some of the early-reported fatality rates were so high. Depending on the timing of the specific report, a person could perceive virtually any fatality rate up to 35%.", "The bottom line on Covid-19 fatality is that it is 3\u20134 times more deadly than the flu. It is a serious disease, but we now know that it is nowhere near deadly enough to kill the 2.2 million people the New York Times reported in March. We can now calculate that for that number of people to die, 440 million people would need to become infected. That\u2019s 100 million more people than live in the United States.", "At least there\u2019s one thing we don\u2019t have to worry about.", "This is Part 1 of a 5-part series on the fatality rates of Covid-19:", "I have been focused for 20 years on understanding the data analytics of software development, including quality, productivity, and estimation. The techniques I\u2019ve learned from working with noisy data, bad data, uncertainty, and forecasting all apply to COVID-19.", "Thanks to James D Cotton, PhD, Brian Donaldson, and Brad Porter for tremendously useful comments on an earlier draft of this article.", "For more US and state-level data, check out my Covid-19 Information website.", "New York antibody testing schedule for the first set of antibody tests here.", "Summary of New York state\u2019s three sets of antibody tests here.", "Time lag from infection to symptoms here.", "Time lag to develop antibodies here.", "Daily record of deaths in each state here.", "New York state\u2019s deaths by county here and infections by county here.", "I did not create probability distributions for each source of variability.", "In accounting for the range of New York state antibody test results, I computed a 95% confidence range based on the six sets of results (counting the first set 4 times, the second set 1 time, and the third set 1 time). This produced a 95% confidence range of 0.393% to 0.608%. These numbers are divided by 0.984 to convert from New York state numbers to US numbers.", "For the overall confidence range shown in Table 2, I approximated a 6 \u2202 range by taking the product of the minimum adjustment factors for the lower end of each range and the product of the maximum adjustment factors for the upper end of each range. This approach yielded a 6 \u2202 range for the adjustment factors of 0.504 to 1.659. I applied these multipliers to the nominal (mean) value of 0.508%, which produced a 6 \u2202 range for the fatality rates of 0.257% to 0.844%. Dividing this range by 6 produced an estimated \u2202 of 0.098%. For the confidence interval calculation, I used 0.508% for the mean and a value of 3 for the number of samples, based on the 3 sets of antibody test results. Using a sample size of 1 would have produced a 95% confidence range of 0.317% to 0.700%.", "Your home for data science.
