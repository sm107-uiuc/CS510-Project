I\u2019ve made a few tentative explorations into data science and machine learning projects before. But I thought it was time to do something bigger. But where would I start?", "I made the mistake of looking for inspiration where, to be fair, most people would \u2014 the front page of Google. As it turns out, there are way too many resources out there that you could get lost in. Some tips are a little underwhelming. Take this one from a Quora post I found:", "That didn\u2019t sound right. Why should I be looking at data that merely \u201cmimicked\u201d real world application of data science? I wanted to build a real portfolio, solve real problems and make a real difference to businesses and people. I wanted to analyse something I could be passionate about. These suggested datasets are great, no doubt. They\u2019d probably be a great test of your data exploration, machine learning or visualisation skills. But what would it all count for, ultimately?", "I wanted to build a real portfolio, solve real problems and make a real difference to businesses and people.", "Instead, one of the most useful resources I\u2019ve turned to are the writers on Towards Data Science. Michael Galarnyk wrote a great piece on building a data science portfolio and Jeremie Harris wrote a great \u201cdon\u2019t-do\u201d list for aspiring data scientists. This part spoke to me the best:", "When in doubt, here are some projects that hurt you more than they help you:", "* Survival classification on the Titanic dataset.", "* Hand-written digit classification on the MNIST dataset.", "* Flower species classification using the iris dataset.", "I have mixed feelings about Kaggle and their competitions. I think data scientists should possess the ability to wrangle data from all kinds of places unimaginable. I don\u2019t really like the idea of being \u2018spoon-fed\u2019 the data. That being said\u2026", "So I finally decided to collect my own data. The project was going to be about predicting a movie\u2019s iTunes list price from its characteristics, eg. box office performance, critic ratings, cast, plot etc. Models on predicting success of a movie were not new. But some questions hadn\u2019t been asked, nor answered.", "Much better than looking at cricket data.", "But very few datasets provided the connection between movies and their list price on iTunes, or other VOD platforms.", "Eventually, I turned to open source movie databases such as The Movie Database and Open Movie Database, which I combined with the iTunes data to analyse the data. This was not without its challenges though. You can look at my script and exploratory analysis on Github, but stay tuned for a blog post on my whole data collection process soon.", "I\u2019m no expert in internet protocol, server scripting or database architecture and engineering. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m far off the mark with this one.", "I relied heavily on using APIs through my data collection process, but I also used web scraping techniques to gather my data. I found myself making much less queries to the website/server using an API, which provided me a way of making a structured query to get all the data I needed. Nothing superfluous or noisy.", "It\u2019s important for organisations to understand why an API layer will benefit them:", "The analogy of an API being a a bartender is particularly useful. Instead of opening up your data \u2018buffet\u2019 style, where people would tend to adopt a grab-first-ask-questions-later mentality, it\u2019s much better to have a guy to control how much food gets consumed. Pretty neat stuff.", "Thanks for reading my first blog post. I\u2019ll be posting more updates as my project progresses and thoughts bubble to the surface.", "Your home for data science.
