Total cases in the world will be half a million soon and over 20,000 deaths have been confirmed. The worrying part is the graph of total cases is still exponentially increasing, and showing no signs of slowing down.", "Flattening the curve by social distancing seems to be the only way out of this. Many countries have been locked down in the past few weeks, and people have been asked to strictly stay at home. All these measures will not eliminate the virus, but will help to slow down it\u2019s spread, thus reducing the pressure on the health care system, thus reducing the fatality rate.", "But many people still don\u2019t seem to understand the seriousness of social distancing, and how big of an impact even a single person could have. The point is if you are a healthy individual, and the virus may not affect you much, but you could spread it to other people who may be adversely affected by it.", "So in this quick post, I will try and visualise the effect of social distancing using python, to see the huge impact every single person could have in stopping the spread of COVID-19, and potentially save thousands of lives.", "The goal of this experiment is not to model the spread of the virus, but to understand the impact social distancing has in reducing it\u2019s spread and realise its importance.", "First let us import the essentials and define a few parameters.", "We will use a DataFrame to model a city where each row corresponds to a citizen, and keep track of infected and recovered people. Using the sample function can randomly select people from the DataFrame. Here is what we will do:", "You can see that in around 10 to 15 days, the entire population of 100,000 has been affected and recovered. This is assuming that the city was capable of treating 100,000 patients at the same time, and everyone recovered at the same rate \u2014 in 10 days. But do you think this hypothetical city of 100,000 will have a health care system that can take care of 100,000 active cases per day, for about a week ? Now in reality, the growth may not be so drastic, but it can easily lead to something like this if we take no action at all.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at the graph for different values of SPREAD_FACTOR.", "In the last two cases, you can observe the impact a single person can make on the entire spread of the virus ! From this we can conclude that, although the virus spreads exponentially, social distancing also works exponentially, and every single isolated person has an exponential impact on flattening the curve!", "Note: I am aware that this is an oversimplification of the real world scenario, but I think it gives us a good understanding of the relationship between the SPREAD_FACTOR and the number of active cases. Also, an exponential function can be simulated easily with math equations, but I think this is more intuitive and easier to understand.", "Well now you why exactly social distancing is given so much importance! Basically you are saving lives by sitting at home.", "You can find the code here in this Google Colab. You can try and experiment with different values for the parameters. Also try visualising the other metrics like recovery per day. Instead of having a constant value for the spread factor throughout the simulation, you can try to reduce it at different intervals, and observer the effects. I noticed that once the damage has been done, then there is no going back.", "So practice social distancing, wash your hands and remember, we are all in this together!", "Also, check out my YouTube Channel if you are interested in Machine Learning !", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
