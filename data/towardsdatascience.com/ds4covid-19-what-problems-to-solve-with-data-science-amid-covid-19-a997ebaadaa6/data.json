Covid-19 is the Novel Coronavirus disease of 2019 [1]. This article is useful for both the data science enthusiasts to identify, formulate, solve the business problems, and to the leaders to instruct their teams to work on the data science problems relevant for their business. I observed two main trends in the industry.", "\u25cb We have a business problem but not sure what data helps to solve it?", "\u25cb We have data but what business problems to solve with that data?", "In both these cases, the starting point is different. However, both business problems and relevant data to solve it are equally important in the data science world. The focus of the article is:", "What are the different data sets relevant to COVID-19 available?", "What techniques of Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Statistical techniques can be used to solve these problems and challenges involved?", "Summarize the problems to solve specific to industry verticals", "As mentioned in my earlier article [2], there are 7 types of data namely, numerical, categorical, text, image, video, speech, and signals irrespective of the industry/domain to build the data science problems.", "Table-1 summarizes the type of problems to solve with numerical, categorical types of data, what data science techniques to use, and challenges in solving those problems. The core business problems to solve are \u201cWhat is the impact of Covid-19 on my business?\u201d, \u201cHow risky we are to get Covid-19 virus?\u201d. These business problems are formulated as multi-step data science problems as listed in Table-1.", "Here is the list of available data sets to solve the above set of problems. Along with these data sets, you may require to use data specific to your organization which you will have access to. You can directly load the raw open-source data in your code (python notebook) or download .csv files and then load them for further processing.", "There are interesting articles to process your loaded data as referred to in [3].", "If you are comfortable with text processing, then these problems may be of interest to you. Table-2 summarizes a list of problems, the corresponding text data, techniques to solve those problems along with the list of challenges. Recent advances in Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are playing a crucial role in solving these kinds of problems.", "The available data set links are as follows:", "I solved the problem of building a Question and Answer (Q&A) system with my Ericsson colleagues in a recent Kaggle challenge. The steps followed in the pipeline along with the code and results are shared in the following Kaggle URL:", "Figure 1 captures the high-level steps to solve the problem involving pre-processing, using word embedding, BERT methodologies, and finally to rank the results with Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score (BLEU) scores. Various implementation approaches were discussed by my Ericsson colleagues in this blog.", "Table-3 summarizes the list of problems, reference speech data, data science techniques to use, and the list of challenges.", "Details of Coswara data on respiratory, cough, and speech sounds (in the data collection phase, you may contribute and later use to build the models) can be accessed from the following URL. The diagnosis of cough samples is described in [5].", "Table-4 summarizes the list of problems to solve, reference image/video data, techniques to follow, and the challenges involved.", "Let us check the available data resources to solve the above problems.", "The sample code for the detection of Covid-19 in X-ray images with Keras can be referred to in [6].", "The following URLs have interesting resources to start our analysis in the areas of genomics and pathology repository. There is a mention of available computing resources as gene sequence modeling demands a lot of computing power. Please make use of the available resources and showcase your computer vision and other machine learning skills.", "Table-5 summarizes the list of data science problems to solve in various industry verticals amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This list is in addition to the common business problems across all industry verticals such as \u201cWhat is the impact of my business/share price/revenue due to Covid-19?\u201d.", "The data science techniques presented in Table-5 include LSTM-Long Short Term Memory, SSD-Single Shot Detection, YOLO-You Look Only Once, ARIMA-Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, BERT-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer, Seq2Seq models-Sequence to Sequence models, CNN-Convolutional Neural Networks, CONVLSTM-Convolutional Long Short Term Memory, NLP -Natural Language Processing.", "Our priority is to come out of this pandemic safely and later on work towards business continuity. Life may not be the same Before COVID(B.C) and After COVID(A.C). As we have witnessed in history, each pandemic has given rise to some changes in the pattern of human behavior and the consumption of goods. Capturing change in the consumers\u2019 behavior is the key across various industries. The companies that can capture this trend upfront will be the biggest beneficiaries of this journey.", "In this article, I focused mainly on the set of problems the data scientists can solve where data is available. I captured the set of 40 problems, corresponding data to be used along with the reference URLs and data science techniques to solve those problems. These 40 problems are arranged first by the type of data and later by industry verticals. The heterogeneous data with multiple types of data (numerical+text+image) can be used to solve a further set of problems such as multi-modal chatbots, building Covid-19 assistant, etc\u2026 Few more interesting problems to solve can be referred to in the other articles [7,8,9] shared in references.", "Looking forward to come out of Covid-19 soon and live in a better healthy world post Covid-19.
