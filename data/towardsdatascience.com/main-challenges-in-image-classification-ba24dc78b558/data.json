The example of intra-class variation is having chairs of multiple type in our dataset. Chair can be \u201coffice chair\u201d, \u201ccomfy chair\u201d, \u201cdining table chair\u201d, \u201cdeco chairs\u201d etc.", "Here in images above we have different types of chairs. So our image classification system should be able to solve the problem of intra-class variation.", "This problem is very common in image classification. Scale variation is actually having image of same object with multiple size.", "Picture below is showing scale variation of same object __ spoon, but they are all different sizes of spoons.", "We have viewpoint variation, where an object can be oriented/rotated in multiple dimensions with respect to how the object is photographed and captured in image. No matter the angle in which we capture the image of chair, it\u2019s still a chair.", "There are a lot of objects which we want to classify in image can not be view completely. There large part is hidden behind other objects.", "Given is the image of cat but notice how it is resting underneath the cover, occluded from our view. It means it is not completely visible,but our image classification system should be able to detect and classify it as cat.", "Our image classification should also be able to handle changes in Illumination.", "Both of these images are of same cup but with variation in intensity level of pixels. Our image classification system should be able to handle the variation in illumination.So when we give any picture of same object with different brightness levels(Illumination) to our images classification system, the system should be able to assign them same label.", "It means that there are a lot of objects in the image and for observer it is very tough to find the particular object. These images are very \u201cnoisy\u201d.", "But we are only interested in one particular object in the image; however, due to all the \u201cnoise\u201d, it\u2019s not easy to pick out particular object.", "For human it is very difficult task, so imagine how hard it is for a computer with no semantic understanding of the image.", "But in some cases there is certain object in image but the appearance of that object is very similar to the background, So in those case it is very difficult for image classification system to classify the object.", "In some cases even if there is not object in the image,For example if we show the image of only ice to the image classification system, the system will label it as bear. This is because the image classification system has learnt the patterns in the images during training process and the patterns of ice with white bear and without bear are quite similar.", "So our images classification system should be able to solve the problem of background clutter as well.", "That is all about challenges of image classification system.
