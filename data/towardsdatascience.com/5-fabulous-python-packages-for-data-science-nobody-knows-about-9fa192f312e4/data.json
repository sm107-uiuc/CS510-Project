There might also be some other cool packages that you like to use like Plotly, Seaborne, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["So we all likely know the dynamic Data-Science trio, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.", "It is likely that you are familiar with these packages and how they work as well. There might also be some other cool packages that you like to use like Plotly, Seaborne, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, and Pytorch among certainly many others. Even though these are all fantastic packages, there are millions of packages for Pythonic machine-learning, some of which are under-appreciated, and some of which are entirely unknown!", "You\u2019ve heard of Plotly, you\u2019ve heard of Matplotlib and maybe Seaborne, but you might not have heard about Gleam. Gleam is an amazing tool for creating interactive visualizations with pages, panels, and buttons. These interactive web visualizations are also fully web-integrated, which means you can put them into anything from a website to an endpoint! Gleam uses wtforms for interactivity, and can use any range of different visualization tools for the actual displaying of the data.", "If you want a cool interactive pane for which you can use basically any graphing library, Gleam is the module for you!", "Okay, I know what you\u2019re thinking,", "\u201c Why not just use Pandas?\u201d", "and this is certainly a viable argument. The table package makes this list as an incredibly lightweight alternative to Pandas. It can be a lot easier to read enormous datasets using Table.py than it is with Pandas.py, and that is essentially the only reason it made it on this list. Overall i\u2019d say for certain situations it might be the package for the job, but in most cases I would just stick to", "Shogun is a machine-learning library written in C++ that also happens to posses a Python port. One great thing about Shogun is that it is usable across a whole multitude of different programming languages, and relatively unified in that aspect. If you were to learn Shogun in Python, you could take that knowledge and apply it to any other language that it supports, which is amazing!", "Shogun features a wide range of cutting edge machine-learning algorithms that surely any scientist can appreciate. It is also of course open-source and published under the GNU general license, which is always a plus!", "OpenCV is another great machine-learning package that was actually originally developed at Intel. Despite its proprietary roots, however, OpenCV is open-source and published under the FreeBSD permissive license. One thing that is really cool about OpenCV is its focus on real-time computer vision. Like Shogun, OpenCV is originally written in C++ but has interfaces for Python along with other languages.", "Mlpy provides a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning methods for supervised and unsupervised learning. Unlike its counterparts, it aims to provide an all-in-one methodology for data-science. Though it is a little old-fashioned at this point, it certainly was a great fire-starter to the enormous package explosion that was Pythonic machine-learning. Despite its age, it is certainly still worth checking out in my opinion. This is due to its ease of use, fun algorithms, and inclusive nature.", "Mlpy sought to create a package that balances reproducibility, modulation, and efficiency. In this I think that the package has succeeded because while many of its counter-parts are updated more often and certainly the industry standard, a lot of these ideas seem to of been lost in translation in one way or another. It makes sense, as these are enormous packages mostly written in C by tons of developers, however, I will say that it can be a downside to using them.", "So there you have it, five packages that in my opinion are unrecognized and receive little credit for what they have accomplished. Although these packages are certainly pretty cool, I am certain there are hundreds if not thousands of other cool modules you could add to your Pip environment that are also awesome and unheard of!", "Python has an overwhelming ecosystem and a lot of packages to dig through, and that\u2019s part of what makes it so great! Learning how to use new modules constantly will keep your knowledge-base expansive and keep your programmer-brain active!", "Your home for data science.
