The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) were set in that agenda in 2015, following the Millennium Goals of the previous decade that had targeted developing countries. It\u2019s been five years since that announcement, so I thought it would be a good time to do some preliminary analysis of the partnerships (which are the largest drivers of this change). For those unfamiliar with the goals, you can find a summary of their statements, targets, and indicators here.", "While there are 17 goals, they can each be segmented into three general categories (quoted from source):", "1) It should support countries to invest in higher value added products and sectors, technology, a diversified economy and greater productivity, all of which should generate quality jobs and livelihoods (SDGs 7 to 15 highlight critical issues relating to such a transformation).", "2) Only then can countries meet the most pressing needs of their societies, including the eradication of extreme poverty (SDGs 1 to 6 reflect this social agenda and the human centered approach to development required to underpin and accelerate sustainable economic growth).", "3) Finally, for the first time, the 2030 Agenda acknowledges the quantum leap required in the capacities, collaboration and resources for such a transformation to occur (SDGs 16 and 17 speak to the means by which social contracts are strengthened within and among States).", "Based on the above, I believe there should be partners spanning similar goals, as well as similarities in types of assistance/geographic coverage of these goals. The data I collected can be found on the UN SDG Partnerships Platform. It shows 4585 unique partners, with about 14249 total partnerships. The columns I used are shown below (example of partnership here):", "All data, interactive charts, and scripts can be found at my GitHub repo.", "Let\u2019s start by looking at what countries were the top beneficiaries for each goal. The data for beneficiaries came in variations of this:", "I used re.findall on capital letters, then created a set of the extended list to find unique countries. Since some countries are multiple words (like \u201cSouth Africa\u201d), they would show up as two unique countries \u2014 with that in mind, there were 234 unique beneficiaries. About 7000 of the partnerships did not list a beneficiary on their page, so this data could be slightly skewed.", "To get cross-country coverage, I used the based column. Only 2000 partnerships listed where they were based, so it is a small proportion of the full dataset.", "I do wish I could have done [headquarter, beneficiary] pairs for all 14249 partnerships, as it would give us a very clear picture on who is helping who.", "Most partnerships listed a main entity relationship and most listed additional sub-partners. There are 607 unique entities, and 13165 unique sub-partners in partnerships.", "You can see from the above the push from the European Commission, albeit 120 is a small proportion of 14249. Most entities are related to the UN in some way.", "IUCN is the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which makes sense. I couldn\u2019t find FUNDER, the closest org I could find with that name is from India, focused on Indian Women\u2019s entrepreneurship. There are quite a few sub-partners from India showing up in the chart above, which leads me to believe India is a leader in pushing organizational partnership.", "Before getting into time series analysis, while cleaning I found that about 400 of the partnerships had some sort of date entry error that I couldn\u2019t easily fix, however, they were evenly distributed at about 30\u201350 per goal. There were a total of 712 ongoing projects, which I replaced with an end-date of 12\u201331\u20132030 as a placeholder for this analysis.", "We can see from this chart that some partnerships have existed since way before the 2030 agenda was set in place. My guess is that some partnerships joined the program after it was announced, and have existed/been ongoing for a long time.", "Momentum for partnerships has clearly stalled a little, with most starting in 2017. This is notional, if we were to look at this as % of total partnerships instead:", "Before trying to conclude momentum has fallen, we should study the partnership end dates as well. Some partnerships likely will have a larger impact than others, and my money would be on the ones that last the longest.", "Projects ending each year by category:", "Most projects are between 1\u20135 years long, and from the bar chart we can see almost a third of current projects will have ended by 2021, going up to half by 2025. For the current momentum to keep up, we would need to see at least a thousand new partnerships a year. I\u2019m sure Covid-19 has had an impact on 2020 signups, in fact, most of the partnerships this year mention Covid-19 in their description.", "First, let's see which goals were usually covered in conjunction by partnerships:", "Many partnerships try and tackle all the SDG at once (though for some reason SDG 12: \u201cSustainable Consumption..\u201d got skipped many times). Other than that, SDG 3:\u201d Good Health and Well-being\u201d and SDGs 16/17 (institutional strength and global partnerships) seem to be paired with others the most often. SDGs 13/14 (climate action and conservation of oceans) appear quite often with others as well. The pattern seems to be to tackle goals across the three categories listed earlier, instead of just within them. This says to me there may be a way to draw hierarchies and linkages between different goals/their targets.", "To dig deeper into why certain goals might be covered together, let\u2019s analyze the text in their descriptions. The descriptions covered a summary of the partner, as well as an expected impact when the partnership concludes. To find relationships between partnerships, I used natural language processing (NLP) on the descriptions.", "(if that all sounds like a mouthful, check out this article where I walk through this code process more in another example. However, understanding it is not necessary to continue reading along).", "Plotting the first two components of the PCA in a density plot gives:", "Showing the PCA using a scatter plot by goal instead:", "If you look closely, you\u2019ll see that there are quite a few points that perfectly overlap. Remember that many partnerships tackle multiple goals at once \u2014 so I removed those duplicates and plotted just the partnerships that are unique. For reference, 2232 of the 4585 unique partners tackle only one SDG.", "While this does start to reveal some clear goal clusters, there is still a lot of similarity in the descriptions across various goals. Most goals are either clustered to the left of 0 on the y axis, with a few to the right of 0. The goals I noticed spanning the whole range evenly are all climate and environment focused. That\u2019s not too surprising, as I\u2019d expect climate to be dealing with the most diverse range of issues, resources, and partnerships.", "This is better put in perspective of time, so I created a GIF of how partnerships appeared over time in the unfiltered PCA using a plotly Dash app. We can see that different goals picked up momentum at different times, and it was really 2017 and 2018 that clusters formed. Both \u201cinclusive and equitable quality education\u201d and \u201cconserve\u2026oceans\u201d gained strong momentum in 2012 and 2016 respectively.", "While these charts gave me some information about clusters unique to each goal, it didn\u2019t tell me much as I would have liked. The goals all seem to overlap in some capacity, instead of unique pairs/triplets. To expand this analysis, we\u2019ll take a look at using cosine similarity instead of just euclidean distance comparisons. There are two ways of doing this, either using cosine similarity on the word vectors after applying TF-IDF, or going a step further and taking an extra inner dot product (with L2 norm) between a previous word embedding model similarity matrix and the document similarity matrix to get a soft cosine matrix (essentially capturing semantic meaning of words in the descriptions better). We can do this easily using gensim word2vec or FastTex pre-trained word embedding models.", "After creating the cosine matrix, we can take the PCA again to see if our clusters have changed:", "The spread has changed a lot, though the clusters haven\u2019t really shifted that much. The average soft cosine similarity was 0.779, which is fairly high, so it makes sense that there are no clear separate clusters (even if we run t-SNE). I tried looking at keywords in a certain area (i.e. x(-10,10) and y(-2,2)) as well as taking the gensim summary of a certain area, but those returned broad coverage of issues in the goals. The next section will help explain one possible reason why.", "Resources provided by each partner can vary from financial assistance to agriculture or technology. Most of the description is actually about why a certain resource is necessary, how it will be implemented, and the final impact. The difficult task was figuring out how to identify what resources were provided based on the description.", "After reading through a thousand partnerships, I decided to go with the following resources/search-words:", "This is a brute-force method to give us a general picture, and is not meant to be exhaustive or all encompassing. The output is the following, where each partnerships can be counted as providing more than one resource.", "Research, technology, training, and fiscal look like the common resources provided by partnerships. Splitting that into each goal looks like this:", "It\u2019s a much more even spread than I expected, especially when you convert the view into percentage form:", "The only one point that sticks out to me is SDG 14, which relies a lot less on training than other goals. This also checks out with our PCA analysis, which showed consistent overlap of spread across all goals. It\u2019s good to see that there\u2019s an even distribution of resources across goals, as that means every sector/industry has a part and ability to contribute to the every single sustainable development goal.", "This article was a good first step towards an understanding of how progress for SDG have evolved across many facets, as well as uncovering many relationships in the data across partnerships and the seventeen SDGs. I want to reiterate that this is an article on progression, not progress. If you want to understand actual progress on different goals then dive into the listed targets and indicators, as well as how each country is reporting those.", "I believe one possible next step could be to use all of this data and generate a classification machine learning model. That model would take in the name, country of residence, and description of any organization and suggest what goals, resources, and partners would be a good fit. If that sounds like something you would want to collaborate on, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.", "(I\u2019m still cleaning and refactoring and commenting out the code \u2014 scraping, cleaning, and analysis were over 1000 lines of code \u2014 but if you want to decipher it yourself now, check out the GitHub Repo. All of the plotly files and data are on there as well)", "Your home for data science.
