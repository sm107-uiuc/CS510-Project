The measure can be calculated on any source of text documents, such as newspaper articles, emails, tweets, posts on online forums, blogs and social media. The idea is to capture insights and honest signals through the analysis of big textual data. Spontaneous expressions of consumers, or other brand stakeholders, can be collected from the places where they normally appear\u2014 for example a travel forum, if studying the importance of museum brands. This has the advantage of reducing the biases induced by the use of questionnaires, where interviewees know that they are being observed. The SBS can also be adapted to different languages and to study the importance of specific words, or set of words, not necessarily \u2018brands\u2019.", "By \u2018brand\u2019 one can intend the name of a politician, or a set of words that represent a concept (for example, the concept of \u201cinnovation\u201d or a corporate core value). The measure was used to evaluate the transition dynamics that occur when a new brand replaces an old one[1]. The Semantic Brand Score is also useful to relate the importance of a brand to that of its competitors, or to analyze importance time trends of a single brand. In some applications, the score proved to be useful for forecasting purposes; for example, a link has been found between brand importance of political candidates in online press and election outcomes [4], or between the importance of museum brands and trends in the number of visitors [6]. An update list of publications using the SBS is available here.", "The SBS measures brand importance, which is at the basis of brand equity [1]. Indeed the metric was partially inspired by well-known conceptualizations of brand equity and by the constructs of brand image and brand awareness (see for example the work of Keller) [2].", "Brand importance is measured along 3 dimensions: prevalence, diversity and connectivity. Prevalence measures the frequency of use of the brand name, i.e. the number of times a brand is directly mentioned. Diversity measures the diversity of the words associated with the brand. Connectivity represents the brand ability to bridge connections between other words or groups of words (sometimes seen as discourse topics).", "More information about the SBS can be found on this website [5], on Wikipedia, or reading this paper [1]. In this article I will not spend too much time on the metric, as my focus is to describe the main steps for calculating it using Python 3.", "The calculation of the Semantic Brand Score requires combining methods and tools of text mining and social network analysis. Figure 1 illustrates the main preliminary steps, which comprise data collection, text pre-processing and construction of word co-occurrence networks.", "For this introductory tutorial, we can assume that relevant textual data has already been collected and organized in a text file, where each new line is a different document. I will just insert two imaginary brands (\u2018BrandA\u2019 and \u2018BrandB\u2019) into random English text.", "The updated GitHub repository for this demo is available here. There you will find a Python notebook, together with example files.", "I imported the text file in Python as a list of text documents (texts), which are now processed to remove punctuation, stop-words and special characters. Words are lowercased and split into tokens, thus obtaining a new texts variable, which is a list of lists. More complex operations of text preprocessing are always possible (such as the removal of html tags or \u2018#\u2019), for which I recommend reading one of many tutorials on Natural Language Processing in Python. The stopwords list is taken from the NLTK package. Lastly, word affixes are remove through Snowball Stemming.", "During text preprocessing we should pay attention not to lose useful information. Smileys :-), made of punctuation, can be very important if we calculate sentiment.", "We can now proceed with the calculation of prevalence, which counts the frequency of occurrence of each brand name \u2014 subsequently standardized considering the scores of all the words in the texts. My choice of standardization here is to subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. Other approaches are also possible [1]. This step is important to compare measures carried out considering different time frames or sets of documents (e.g. brand importance on Twitter in April and May). Normalization of absolute scores is necessary before summing prevalence, diversity and connectivity to obtain the Semantic Brand Score.", "Next and most important step is to transform texts (list of lists of tokens) into a social network where nodes are words and links are weighted according to the number of co-occurrences between each pair of words. In this step we have to define a co-occurrence range, i.e. a maximum distance between co-occurring words (here is set to 7). In addition, we might want to remove links which represent negligible co-occurrences, for example those of weight = 1. Sometimes it can also be useful to remove isolates, if these are not brands.", "Having determined the co-occurrence network, we can now calculate diversity and connectivity, which are distinctiveness centrality (previously we used degree) and weighted betweenness centrality of a brand node. We standardize these values as we did with prevalence. More information about distinctiveness centrality is given in this paper [7] and on this post. You will also need to install the Python distinctivenss package.", "If we calculate connectivity as weighted betweenness centraliy, we first have to define inverse weights, as weights are treated by Networkx as distances (which is the opposite of our case).", "The Semantic Brand Score of each brand is finally obtained by summing the standardized values of prevalence, diversity and connectivity. Different approaches are also possible, such as taking the geometric mean of unstandardized coefficients.", "This link points to a short demo of the analyses that can be carried out, once the SBS has been calculated [8]. Word co-occurence networks can additionally be used to study textual brand associations, in order to infer unique and shared brand characteristics. The calculation of brand sentiment can also complement the analysis.", "This article provided a brief introduction to the Semantic Brand Score and a short tutorial for its simplified calculation using Python 3. While learning the basics, we should remember that there are many choices that can be made and would influence results. For example, one could choose different weighting schemes, or normalization approaches, to combine the 3 dimensions into a single score. Particular attention should be paid to the selection of an appropriate word co-occurrence range. Moreover, different techniques can be used to prune those links which supposedly represent negligible co-occurrences.", "Lastly, the final code will be much more complex if the calculation is carried out on big data. Metrics such as betweenness centrality have a high computational complexity on large graphs. Graph-Tool is a library that helped me a lot, as its performance is significantly higher than Networkx. In some cases, complexity can be reduced working on the initial dataset. With online news, for example, one could choose to analyze just their title and first paragraph instead of their full content.", "As a self-learned Python programmer, I will appreciate any comment or suggestion you might have about the metric and its efficient calculation. Feel always free to contact me.", "You can also check the notebook available in the GitHub repository for this demo (here).", "[3] Semantic Brand Score page on Wikipedia.", "[5] Semanticbrandscore.com, the metric website, with updated links and information", "Your home for data science.
