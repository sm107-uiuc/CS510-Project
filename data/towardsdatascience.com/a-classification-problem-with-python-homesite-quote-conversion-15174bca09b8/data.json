Accurately predicting conversion would help Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintain an ideal portfolio of customer segments.", "The dataset represents the activity of a large number of customers who are interested in buying policies from Homesite. Each QuoteNumber corresponds to a potential customer and the QuoteConversion_Flag indicates whether the customer purchased a policy. The provided features are anonymized and provide a rich representation of the prospective customer and policy. They include specific coverage information, sales information, personal information, property information, and geographic information.
