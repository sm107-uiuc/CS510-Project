Most of you probably have spent time on the site, but for those unfamiliar, Reddit is a massive collection of community-driven forums, or \u201csubreddits\u201d, where people share news, content, and opinions on almost any topic. One of the most popular communities, Ask Me Anything (r/IAmA), connects famous or interesting figures with everyday Redditors in order to answer questions directly from an audience of anonymous engagers aiming to take full advantage of the unparalleled access to some of the most compelling people in the world.", "In this article, I\u2019ll be focusing on this specific community to guide current and future data scientists at a high level through the process of connecting to basic information housed in Reddit\u2019s API using PRAW \u2014 a Python \u201cwrapper,\u201d which is like an add-on package that simplifies sets of API calls into easy-to-use functions for users. This particular walkthrough is more about quickly setting up the connection, avoiding any deep dive into business applications (contact Reddit Partnerships for that). That said, I hope to leave you with not only a new data skill but also a collection of some of the most compelling AMA\u2019s to ever make it to Reddit!", "Step 1: Install or Update PRAW in your Terminal", "Step 2: Create and/or Login to Your Reddit Account to begin Authenticating via OAuth", "Click here to create an account or log in to an existing account, and ensure you\u2019ve verified your email.

After you click \u2018create app\u2019, your page will update to reveal both a personal use script key, which will often be referred to as a \u2018client id\u2019 in many API tutorials and a secret key, which you may know as an \u2018API key\u2019.", "When using an API that requires an API key and password you should never hardcode these values into your main file.

Once it finished, you can throw your data into a Pandas DataFrame for turnkey wrangling and analysis.", "The simplest way to help us quickly gauge the most meaningful AMAs is to plot the leaders by most commented (num_comments), most upvoted(num_upvotes), and most positive (upvote ratio), then do the same after grouping the rows by Topic/Category (\u2018link_flair\u2019), taking the mean of these same stats for each group.", "Some of the people in these lists are unsurprising celebrity figures: Obama, Bill Gates, Bernie Sanders, Robert Downey Jr. There are, however, some really interesting surprises that I urge you to read if you have the time. Leah Remini discusses her remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom from the church of Scientology, a viral undecided voter during the 2016 presidential election Ken Bone, an open and honest survivor of Joseph Stalin\u2019s dictatorship Anatole Konstantin, and recently detained WikiLeaks founder, journalist-computer scientist Julian Assange.", "Some of the purely positive AMAs made me really appreciate some of the non-super-celebrity discussions. There was an engineer who implementing new feature suggestions on the spot to his free version of Photoshop (ivanhoe90), access to space scientists from NASA\u2019s New Horizons team aiming beyond Pluto (Alan Stern), software developers and hiring managers at NASA\u2019s JPL, and the 2nd person to walk on the moon, Buzz Aldrin. These extremely compelling adventurers are joined by comedy legend Eric Idle, who brought the entire Monty Python crew in on his AMA fun to connect with fans.", "It\u2019s no surprise that professional Athletes garner an engaged following on the web due to their high visibility, expansive media coverage, and likely support of enormous corporations like the NBA, UFC (Ronda Rousey), sports agencies, and apparel brands. It\u2019s no secret that these AMAs are sometimes booked alongside efforts to promote a product, an event, or a brand. The Nonprofit topic appears in all three bar charts due to Bill Gates on behalf of his foundation, net neutrality activists, and ACLU supporters. A community-first platform like Reddit is truly a great hub for those seeking to organize to incite change or, perhaps, to talk about trolling your fast food competitors on Twitter (Wendy\u2019s social team).", "Highly-upvoted Newsworthy Event discussions were led by Sid Fischer, a school shooting survivor who was in the 3rd room shot into at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, and, on a somewhat lighter note, a guy who dressed up as the Monopoly Man to photobomb former Equifax CEO Richard Smith\u2019s Senate hearing.", "Crime/Justice leads the pack for most positive AMA topics due to a fairly unanimous cause for celebration spurred by a topic that proudly reads \u201cIdaho passed an Ag-Gag law that made it a crime to expose animal abuse on factory farms.
