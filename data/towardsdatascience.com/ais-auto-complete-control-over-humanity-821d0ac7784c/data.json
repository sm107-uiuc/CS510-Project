The fields of AI and ML are broad with myriad use cases. In some cases, human control will be turned over completely to machines powered by AI and ML, whereas others will leverage the benefits offered by machines assisting humans. For the purposes of this discussion, AI and ML use cases will be grouped into the two high-level categories below:", "Humans are replaced: humans relinquish control of a task completely to machines.", "Humans are enhanced: machines assist humans with completing a task.", "Today, we\u2019re witnessing the \u201clearning\u201d stage of autonomous vehicles (AVs) where companies are teaching vehicles how to drive with the ultimate goal of becoming Level 5 autonomous. The pursuit of Level 5 AV technology is an example of how human control of a task, driving a vehicle, is completely relinquished to a machine, which is the AV algorithm. This is an example of Category 1.", "Next, let\u2019s explore examples of Category 2. In a factory environment, completing a given part or assembly is the task. Technologies that enable robots to assist humans in factories by leveraging computer vision is a prime example of how the strength and endurance of a robot can augment the flexible cognition of a human. A more subtle example is recommendation algorithms provided by companies like YouTube and Netflix; these algorithms help humans efficiently solve the task of selecting what to stream next. When having to compose emails and messages, autocomplete language algorithms (e.g., Google\u2019s Smart Compose) are helping humans expedite this task by offering suggestions that can be easily accepted.", "This was a non-comprehensive overview of AI and ML and was only meant to give the reader a baseline understanding of the everyday possibilities. For more information on these technologies, reference this short film by Wired.", "In a previous article titled \u201cAI and the \u2018Useless\u2019 Class,\u201d your author discussed how today humans are mechanically converting their jobs such that they can be performed by a substrate-agnostic intelligence. Simply put, humans today are laying the groundwork for biological intelligence (humans) to be swapped out for silicon intelligence (machines). It appears the real issue isn\u2019t that robot will take our jobs one day. Rather, it\u2019s that the process has already begun and humans are unknowingly leading the charge. The \u201cAI and the \u2018Useless\u2019 Class\u201d article focuses on Category 1 where human control is completely relinquished. Please reference this article for the full discussion as well as formal definitions for AI.", "The remainder of this article explores Category 2 where machines assist humans. Specifically, the autocomplete language use case and what it means for the development of humanity.", "When you are in the process of replying to an email, you have likely noted options to select phrases such as \u201cThank you!\u201d or \u201cGreat!\u201d", "Or when you\u2019re typing an email message and you notice the application provides a suggestion for what you should type. If you hit the tab key, the suggestion will be accepted.", "If you have encountered either of these scenarios, then you have first-hand experience with an autocomplete language algorithm, which is referred to as natural language processing (NLP) in the industry. The algorithm is utilized by a software application to provide humans the option to select from machine-generated responses. Below is the description Google provides for its Smart Compose feature, which is the autocomplete algorithm that the company utilizes in its prevalent email application (Gmail):", "\u201cYou can let Gmail help you write emails faster. The Smart Compose feature is powered by machine learning and will offer suggestions as you type.\u201d", "Note: Google provides users with the option to toggle the Smart Compose feature on or off. By default, the feature is on, but it can be easily turned off via these instructions.", "The lure of increased productivity sounds appealing, but do we actually want our communications with other humans to be influenced by what machine algorithms think our conversations with other humans should be like? In lieu of selecting the machine\u2019s suggestion, what if we would\u2019ve said something in a different way that included our unique personality at that instance in time?", "Will receiving an obvious autocomplete message result in the person on the receiving end feeling like they weren\u2019t worth the other person\u2019s time to generate an authentic response from scratch? Will they think: \u201cHonestly, how much time does it take to type out a sentence?\u201d", "If you stop to think about it, autocomplete language algorithms like Google\u2019s are controlling how we communicate with others, and this is alarming. It\u2019s equivalent to having someone whispering in one of your ears about what to say next while you\u2019re speaking to someone on the phone. Most individuals would find this scenario intrusive and ridiculous, but is it really that much different than autocomplete text suggestions?", "Google states, \u201cSmart Compose personalized suggestions are tailored to the way you normally write, to maintain your writing style.\u201d However, this isn\u2019t the full story. In reality, the algorithm doesn\u2019t know your writing style so its suggestions are (statistical) predictions; the algorithm is guessing and continuously learning via a feedback loop to improve its predictions.", "To summarize, anything a user writes is \u201cfed back\u201d to the algorithm for training. This is the feedback loop and it influences future predictions (suggestions). This means that the machine suggestions we select become part of our writing style, and these suggestions are nothing more than a machine\u2019s best guess given the data it has available.", "Eventually, the line blurs between what is an original thought from a user versus a prediction from an algorithm. A user\u2019s writing style is directly influenced by the algorithm and, thus, is compromised.", "Humans are social creatures, and our human-to-human communication skills have evolved over thousands of years. When we start to rely on an algorithm for what to say next, we risk halting this evolutionary progress. When using autocomplete, how do we ensure we\u2019re not being manipulated and that bias from the training data is not influencing the suggestions?", "When we default to machine-generated suggestions in lieu of human-generated responses, one can imagine how this is a step towards the dystopian world that we\u2019d all like to avoid. This is a potentially dark, dangerous road to go down, and we need to consider the consequences before we overzealously accept the next suggestion bubble that pops up with: \u201cThanks!\u201d", "Your home for data science.
