Finally, I\u2019ll share a suggested learning path for machine learning engineer skills.", "Machine learning engineer is a hip-sounding job title and people in the role are well compensated. According to one analysis , it was the top emerging job on LinkedIn between 2012 and 2017. Indeed reported an average salary of $140,536 for machine learning engineers in the US as of June 26, 2020. Not too shabby. \ud83d\ude00", "Let\u2019s look at how machine learning engineers fit into the flow of data within an organization.", "Here\u2019s a representation of how data flows through an organization.", "Data is generated, ingested, and stored in databases. The data might be modified to make it more usable through ETL, which stands for extract, transform, and load.", "Then the data can be used to make machine learning models, do inference, and create analyses.", "If the data is used in machine learning models, then those models might be served to the word through websites or APIs. That\u2019s the path on the left. \ud83d\udcf1", "Alternatively, if the data was procured with the intent of establishing causality \u2014 often through experimentation \u2014 then statistical analysis can be performed and shared. \ud83d\udd2c", "Finally, if the data is used in post-hoc analysis to glean insights, it will likely be fed into a report or presentation. \ud83d\udda5", "Let\u2019s add the roles that often accompany the flow of data to our diagram.", "The orange boxes represent the people who do the data things. \ud83d\ude00", "There is often a good bit of overlap in the roles. \ud83d\ude42", "Notice that data scientists might focus more heavily on machine learning or statistical inference. This distinction is similar to one by Michael Hochster who differentiated between Type A and Type B data scientist. Type A data scientists do more of the static, statistical inference and analysis and Type B data scientists do more machine learning system building and software engineering. See Robert Chang\u2019s excellent article for discussion.", "In a small organization, the data scientist might be more of a generalist and play all the roles shown in the diagram above. If the organization is young, the first need is to get the data pipeline in shape. Then comes analysis, reporting, and dashboarding of core metrics to drive business decisions. Consequently, a data engineer and a data analyst are often early hires.", "Machine learning engineers are often added later, as the data and data capabilities of the organization grow.

They need to be comfortable with version control, follow common code style rules, and document code well. They might deal with continuous integration, testing, and containerization. They might even deal with container orchestration for deployment \u2014 as you\u2019ll see in a moment, Kubernetes and Docker show up in a decent number of job descriptions.", "Production code needs to be fast and efficient, so machine learning engineers should have a grounding in computer science and big data principles.

Keras is a high-level API for TensorFlow and is now tightly integrated with TensorFlow 2.0. Both were developed primarily at Google.", "PyTorch \u2014 the other major deep learning framework \u2014 is found in over a quarter of listings. It\u2019s younger than TensorFlow but has been growing in usage. See my article exploring PyTorch and TensorFlow popularity here.", "Java appears in nearly a third of listings. Java is one of the most commonly used software development languages. However it isn\u2019t taught for data science nearly as much as Python or R.", "Apache Spark is often used in big data applications. It supports many programming languages including Java, Python, R, and Scala.", "AWS is the most common cloud provider for machine learning engineers and is found in nearly 30% of listings.

Let\u2019s look at a few technologies that saw large differences.", "Data engineer listing are over twice as likely to have SQL in them as machine learning engineer listings. Data scientist listings are also much more likely to have SQL in them. This makes sense, as machine learning engineers focus more on data further down the organization\u2019s data pipeline.", "C++ shows up in nearly a quarter of machine learning engineer listings.

Katie Sylor-Miller and Julia Evans have a fun book on the topic available here.", "As you saw above, employers often want experience with deep learning frameworks. To get started, I recommend reading Deep Learning with Keras by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, the original author of Keras. You can use Manning\u2019s early access program to see the updated version of the book before it is released later in 2020. That book will set you up nicely for TensorFlow.", "If you want to learn PyTorch, the fast.ai MOOC is a good intro. It has great videos and a supportive community for deep learning.", "It\u2019s a good idea to learn SQL. I\u2019ve got an intro to SQL book with PostgreSQL that aims to be a gentle introduction.", "Then I suggest you learn AWS basics so you have familiarity with the most popular cloud platform. Linux Academy has great interactive online courses.", "I suggest you learn the math you need as you need it for a project. It\u2019s hard to learn math without context. At some point you\u2019ll probably want to learn linear algebra. 3Blue1Brown has amazing YouTube explainer videos on this and many math and machine learning topics.", "All along the way, work on your own projects and put them into production. Commit to GitHub regularly and give back to the community as you go. Participate in Kaggle competitions.
