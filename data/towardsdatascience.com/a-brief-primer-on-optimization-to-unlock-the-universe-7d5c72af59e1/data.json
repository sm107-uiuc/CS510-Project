At the core, it is all about optimization, i.e. fitting parameters to minimize or maximize a certain objective function. In this article, I\u2019ll give a brief birds-eye view on optimization and various subcategories. Just remember one thing before reading further, aimed at artificial intelligence and machine learning enthusiasts:", "Actually, I have to write one more disclaimer:", "There is no advanced mathematics here, only pure intuition.", "First of all, let us clear up one important thing, what is optimization about. Mostly we have some kind of parameters \u03b8 that we want to learn such that we minimize an objective function. Concretely, we write the following:", "So there is some kind of function, L that we call the objective function. And we want to minimize it. For now, we won\u2019t be interested in how do we actually minimize it, but we are going to make a high-level differentiation between types of optimization.", "Now that we know what is constrained vs. unconstrained optimization. Let us turn to the problem of minima. Obviously, all kinds of optimization are concerned with finding some kind of minimum of maximum. The proper wording would be extrema. The thing that makes a difference is if the search is for local or global extrema.", "In this super simple 2D example we see a global and a local minimum. What we mostly do if we do gradient-based optimization, we want to do an update to our parameters that amounts to the following:", "So we have some parameters at time step t which end up at something else at time step t+1. The update is a simple addition of the mysterious \u03b7 multiplied by the vector p. The whole research in these methods basically concerns itself with defining good values for the update direction (vector p) and the step size parameter \u03b7.", "You can imagine that it is quite difficult to come to the global minimum if the step size of the algorithm and the direction are not good enough. What does it mean to have a good direction in the first place? Well, it means that the direction vector p of our parameter update creates an angle \u03b1 with the gradient vector that is smaller than or equal to 90 degrees (modulo some details on the nature of the function being optimized), as the following illustration shows quite plainly:", "And what is actually a bad direction, well obviously the opposite of what I said just before. When the angle is greater than 90 degrees. Maybe this does not sound intuitive to you, but imagine the following situation:", "Putting it in the context of functions directly, you can look at the following graph and see the effect:", "You are going in the opposite direction! Obviously you are not going to reach the local minimum. But the direction is not the only thing to worry about\u2026", "Yes\u2026 Step size is quite important and is non-trivial to select. To illustrate the point, look at the following graph:", "We took too big of a step in our optimization, hence we missed the actual minimum of the function. To illustrate the point even further, take a look at the following graph:", "If the step size is the same at the points where we do the update with vector p, then we are going to get stuck. Hence there is all of this tuning of learning rates, adaptive moments and so on \u2014 to avoid such situations.", "A further thing that distinguishes different optimization methods is the nature of the objective function. You may have assumed that the objective function is just a simple continuous function. But this may not be the case, what if it is stochastic?", "Constrained optimization is a bit of an advanced topic, so let\u2019s rather talk about unconstrained optimization and different possible methods. Obviously, one blog article is not enough to cover the whole spectrum of optimization methods. But we can safely say that most constrained optimization methods are based in essence on unconstrained methods. The unconstrained methods can be organized into the following bigger categories:", "Optimization literature is extensive, but I can understand that everybody wants to jump into machine learning and artificial intelligence. Personally, I find it very useful to dig in deep into all of these methods to understand the fundamentals of it all, which are used over and over and over again.", "I hope that this article was helpful in shedding some light on what do these optimizers actually do on a higher level under the hood. The concepts are relatively simple to grasp once you get away from the ugly equations that make the whole thing look overly \u201csophisticated\u201d. Actually, some of the same sophisticatedly written papers on gradient optimizers have had famously mistakes in their proofs, but intuitively the approaches were fairly simple. (won\u2019t name any names, will be covered maybe in a later article :) ).", "Your home for data science.
