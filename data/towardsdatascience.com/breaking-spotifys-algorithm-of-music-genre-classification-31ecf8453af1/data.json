We will be classifying among the following basic genres \u2014 blues. classical, country, disco, hip hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae and rock. The model will be build using LSTM networks. Don\u2019t worry if you do not know what LSTM is. This article will give you a brief understanding of LSTM and its working.", "Here is the GitHub link to the entire project \u2014 https://github.com/rajatkeshri/Music-Genre-Prediction-Using-RNN-LSTM", "The entire article is divided into 4segments \u2014", "There are a few prerequisites you will need to have before you start this project. The first thing you would require is the dataset. The music data which I have used for this project can be downloaded from kaggle \u2014 https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification.", "Note that this dataset contains 10 classes with 100 songs withing each class. This might sound to be very less for a machine learning project, that is why in the next section I will show you how to increase the number of training data for each class of genre.", "There are a few modules which will be required for you to install in your PC/laptop in order to get started. We will be building the entire LSTM model using Tensorflow, coded in python. We will be working with python 3.6 or higher (If you are using python 2.7, it is required for you to use python 3.6 or higher for full support and functionality). The following are the required python packages to be installed \u2014", "These modules can be installed using pip or conda. You can find many online sources and youtube videos on getting started with pip or conda. Once the above modules are installed, let's get coding!", "For any machine learning project, there are two main things in it\u2014Feature extraction from the data and training the model.", "For audio and music feature extraction for machine learning purposes, usually mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted from the song or audio and these features are used to train the model. MFCC feature extraction is a way to extract only relevant information from audio.", "To explain this better, when we represent an audio file in digital format, the computer looks at it as a wave with X axis as Time and Y axis as Amplitude. This is shown in figure 1.", "This format of representation does not give us much information about the audio or song, hence we represent the audio in frequency domain, by using something called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). FFT is a mathematical algorithm found its major use in signal processing, which is used to convert time domain into frequency domain. You can refer to this link or watch some youtube video on what is FFT and how exactly does it work \u2014 https://www.nti-audio.com/en/support/know-how/fast-fourier-transform-fft#:~:text=Fast%20Fourier%20Transformation%20FFT%20%2D%20Basics,frequency%20information%20about%20the%20signal.", "Using this FFT, we convert our input audio file and represent it in frequency and time domain. The graph which displays the audio data in frequency and time domain is called a spectogram, represented in the figure 2.", "A spectrogram is a bunch of FFTs stacked on top of each other. It is a way to visually represent a signal\u2019s loudness, or amplitude, as it varies over time at different frequencies. Here, the y-axis is converted to a log scale, and the color dimension is converted to decibels (you can think of this as the log scale of the amplitude). This is done as humans can only perceive a very small and concentrated range of frequencies and amplitudes and the human ear works on the principle of a logarithmic scale.", "The normal spectogram can be used for extracting features, but this still contains some amount of additional information which is not required. As the human ear works on logarithmic scale and not linear scale, we use mel spectograms, which convert this spectogram into a logarithmic representation to get the features more accurately by removing or eliminating unwanted features. A mel spectrogram is a spectrogram where the frequencies are converted to the mel scale. Figure 3 shows the mel spectogram \u2014", "Coming back to the main topic, the MFCCs uses a mel scale, which is used to extract the features from an audio signal, which when represented as a graph, turns out to be a mel specotgram. So in a nutshell, what we see on a mel spectorgram is the exact features we need for training our model. I have found this brilliant article which explains everything about mfccs in dept \u2014 http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/.", "Once we have our dataset ready, we would like to train our model. Music is a time series data. That means music is linear to time. LSTM\u2019s are pretty good at extracting patterns in input feature space, where the input data spans over long sequences. Given the gated architecture of LSTM\u2019s that has this ability to manipulate its memory state, they are ideal for such problems. For more information, you can refer to this blog.", "The data set which we are going to use here is downloaded from Kaggle and has about 100 songs under each of the 10 labels or genres. Each of the songs is 30 seconds long. As mentioned earlier, this amount of data is significantly less for training an LSTM model. To encounter this problem, I split every audio file into 10 segments, each segment being 3 seconds long. Hence the number of songs under each label is now 1000, which is a decent number to train the model to achieve good accuracy.", "Now that we have our data ready, we need to extract the features which will be suitable to feed into our network. The feature extraction will be done by using MFCCs. Librosa is used to extract the features from each of the audio segment. We create a dictionary, with the label or category of the genre as the key and all the extracted features from all the 1000 segments as an array of features under that label. Once we do this in a loop for all 10 categories, we dump the dictionary into a JSON file. This JSON file thus becomes our dataset on which the model will be trained.", "Moving into the coding for dataset preprocessing, we first define the number of segments and sample rate of each segment. The sample rate is required in order to know the playback speed of the song. Here we keep it constant for every segment.", "We then create a loop in which we open up every song file from each genre folder and split it into 10 segments. We then extract the MFCC features for each of that segment and append it to the dictionary under the genre name (which is also the folder name).", "The above script will create segments and extract features and dump the features into data_json.json file.", "LSTM is used for training the model. But before we build the model, we have to load the model into our program and split it into training and testing. This is done by opening the JSON file which we created in the last section and converting it into numpy arrays for easy computation. This method is shown in the below snippet.", "After loading the data, we prepare the data and split into train and test sets, as mentioned earlier. This is done by using sklearn\u2019s train_test_split function. The function is shown below.", "Next, the LSTM network is created using tensorflow. Here, we have created an LSTM network of 4 layers, including two hidden layers. The following code snippet shows the network creation.", "We initialize the model as sequential and add one input layer with 64 as the number of neurons in that layer, one hidden layer, one dense LSTM layer and an output layer with 10 neurons as there are 10 genres. The size of the input layer depends on the size of the MFCC coefficient which we are passing as an argument \u201cinput_shape\u201d. You can experiment with more hidden layers and test the accuracy.", "Once all the methods and functions have been defined, its time to call them and train our classification model!", "First, we call the \u201cprepare_datasets\u201d function and pass the test date percentage and validation data percentage. Validation data is some part of the training data, with which the model is not trained and is used to validate the model. Validation set tells us, whether the data is performing well or not after the training is done.", "Next, we call the \u201cbuild_model\u201d function to build are LSTM network and compile it. Compiling is used to add the optimizer (which defines the learning rate) and the loss calculating function. Here, we have used categorical cross entropy mathematical function. You can read more about this on this link here.", "After compiling, model.fit() is used to train the model on our data. The training can take about 1 hour to 1.5 hours depending on your hardware. We do not want to keep training our model in order to test it, hence after training, we save the model so we can use the saved file to predict on our new data. At the end of the training, you can see the accuracy achieved.", "Congratulations! Our model has been trained! Now its time to check how well it predicts different songs and classifies it into different genres.", "Before we start with the testing and prediction of new songs, we must define the constants.", "If you remember, we had trained our model with songs of length 30 seconds. Hence, the model will accept song segments of 30 seconds at a time. So for this, we split the input song to be predicted into multiple segments of 30 seconds long. There are three different scenarios for this \u2014 Song length less than 30 secs, song length equal 30 secs and song length greater than 30 secs. For song length less than 30 seconds, we show an error message as minimum is not achieved and for a song of length greater than 30 seconds, we split the entire song into multiple segments of 30 seconds each and feed each segment into the model. The following snippets are for the above mentioned scenarios.", "Next, we load the saved model and define the different classes or genres. The model will predict a number from 0 to 9, and each number will be representing a genre as defined during training.", "The model predicts some genre for each and every segment of the input song. The most predicted genres combining all the predictions of all the sliced segments of a particular input song, gives the final prediction. For example, if a song of length 120 seconds is given as input, it is first split into 3 segments of 30 seconds each and each of the segment is given as input to the model which predicts a particular genre. The genre which is predicted most number of times on average is the genre of the entire song. For prediction, we again extract the MFCC features of each segment and then call \u201cmodel.predict()\u201d to get a prediction.", "And now you know how Spotify classifies your music for you!
