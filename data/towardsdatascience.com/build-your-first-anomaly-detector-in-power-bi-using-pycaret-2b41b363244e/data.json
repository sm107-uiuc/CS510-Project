If not, click here to download Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.7 or greater.", "Before we start using PyCaret\u2019s machine learning capabilities in Power BI we have to create a virtual environment and install pycaret.

There are three ways to implement an anomaly detector:", "(a) Supervised: Used when the data set has labels identifying which transactions are anomaly and which are normal. (this is similar to a supervised classification problem).", "(b) Semi-Supervised: The idea behind semi-supervised anomaly detection is to train a model on normal data only (without any anomalies). When the trained model is then used on unseen data points, it can predict whether the new data point is normal or not (based on the distribution of the data in the trained model).", "(c) Unsupervised: Exactly as it sounds, unsupervised means no labels and therefore no training and test data set. In unsupervised learning a model is trained on the complete dataset and assumes that the majority of the instances are normal. While looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder. There are several unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest or One-Class Support Vector Machine. Each has their own method of identifying anomalies in the dataset.", "This tutorial is about implementing unsupervised anomaly detection in Power BI using a Python library called PyCaret. Discussion of the specific details and mathematics behind these algorithms are out-of-scope for this tutorial.", "Many companies issue corporate credit cards (also known as purchase cards or p-cards) to employees for effectively managing operational purchasing.
