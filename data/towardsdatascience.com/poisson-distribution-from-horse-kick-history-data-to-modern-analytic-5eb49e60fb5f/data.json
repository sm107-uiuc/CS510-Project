It has been used for more than one century. The use cases can cover various problems from business, banking, insurance, science, medical and risk management, just to name a few. In this article, we will introduce Poisson distribution and its application by using two classic examples from last century as well as another two examples from today modern world.", "First of all, let us pick up some basic details and concept of Poisson distribution prior to looking into its application in different domains.", "Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution named in honor of the French mathematician and physicist Simeon D. Poisson (1781\u20131840). It is \u201cdiscrete\u201d because it shows the probabilities of countable/distinct value. (If you wish to know more about discrete random variable, you may look up my other article.)", "Poisson distribution is always used in estimating the occurrence of a specified event that happens during a particular period of time. The formula of Poisson distribution probability is given below:", "Before using the Poisson formula, there are few conditions to be met:", "The mean and standard deviation of a Poisson random variable with parameter lambda are given below", "Now we have gained some basic knowledge of Poisson Distribution, let\u2019s look at its application through a classic example.", "In 1898, a Russian economist and statistician, Ladislaus Josephovich Bortkiewicz, published an interesting findings about the probability distribution of Prussian soldiers accidentally killed by horse-kick. The data was derived from ten army corps who were observed over 20 years. There were a total of 200 observations and 122 soldiers were killed by horse kick over that 20 years. In average, the number of death is", "By using lambda value 0.61, Bortkiewicz applied Poisson formula to predict the probability of number of death, x, with x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:", "When Bortkiewicz compared the Poisson predicted number of occurrences with the actual number, he found the numbers were almost similar.", "This showed the number of Prussian soldiers killed by horse-kick follows the Poisson distribution. As a conclusion, such alignment revealed that the occurrences of the deaths number was due to randomness (As mentioned above, the Poisson distributed events occurs at random and independently). On another hand, if the actual number of occurrences was much higher, an alternative explanation should be given (e.g. inadequate training or any other human factor).", "In 1946, a British statistician, R.D. Clarke, published his analysis of the distribution of bomb hits by flying bombs (V-1 and V-2 missiles) in London during World War II. (If you are interested with the London Bombing historical background, you may look up The Blitz in Wikipedia)", "Based on some observations at that time, some areas were hit more often than others. However, the British military wished to confirm if there are any specific target bombing area by enemy or the bombing merely done randomly. If the bombing is by specific targets, British would have to disperse some important installations to decrease their loss. To confirm the fact, Clarke divided the area into 576 equal sized square grids. The total number of bombs fell was 538. By presuming the missiles fell randomly, the probability of a hit in any one plot will be constant across all the square grids.", "Clark observed that the hit frequencies were very close to Poisson distribution.", "Based on this observation, Clarke reported that the bombing distribution happened only by chance. This report provided the useful military insights to British to make further strategic planning.", "We have already gone through two classic examples of Poisson distribution use cases. Now let\u2019s fast forward our use case to today modern world.", "Just imagine a toll-free phone call customer service of company A is available from 8 A.M. to 10 P.M. Based on the past historical records, the average number of calls received from customers is 0.8 per minute. What is the probability that", "a. zero phone calls will be received?", "b. less than three phone calls will be received?", "c. what is the maximum number of phone calls that will be received in a one-minute period 99.99% of the time?", "Presume that the number of calls per minute follows Poisson distribution.", "The solution is as simple as plugging in the x value and lambda to the formula and we will get the answer. Please note that the lambda = average of call per minute.", "Since the X < 3, we just need to break the solution to three partial probability, P(X=0), P(X=1) and P(X=2) and sum them up together to get the final probability.", "For this question, we would have to calculate the Poisson Probability, P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2)\u2026. until the cumulative probability is approximately 0.9999. Instead of using the brute-force method by repeatedly accumulating the probability from X=0, we can simulate a Poisson distribution and plot a graph using Python.", "Python Scipy package offers a poisson object which enable us to generate a simulated Poisson distributed data through rvs method. We set the parameter, mu (lambda) as 0.8 and sample size = 10000 in the rvs method. Next we use Seaborn to plot a distribution graph. From the graph we can notice that the frequency of X = 5 is approaching zero and we can postulate X=5 could possibly be the maximum number. Let\u2019s use another Scipy poisson method to obtain the cumulative probability for X=5.", "Let\u2019s look at one more example and for this round we are going to approximate Binomial probabilities using Poisson formula. If you are not familiar with Binomial probabilities, you may look up my article about Binomial distribution.", "As reported by the Associated Press, a lobsterman hauled up a yellow lobster nearby Harpswell Cove, Maine. According to B. Ballenger\u2019s The Lobster Alamanac, there is only 1 in every 30 million lobsters hatched is yellow. This means yellow lobsters are much rarer than blue lobsters. Let\u2019s apply the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution to answer the questions below:", "a. Of 50 million lobsters hatched, what is the probability that between 2 and 5, inclusive are yellow?", "b. roughly how many lobsters must be hatched in order to be at least 90% sure that at least one is yellow?", "To approximate Binomial probabilities, there are two conditions which must be met:", "(i) the number of observations, n must be 100 or above", "(ii) the expected value/mean must be smaller or equal to 10", "With that in mind, let\u2019s examine the validity of our current problem:", "Our current problem meet the two conditions, n \u2265 100 and mean \u2264 10. We can now apply Poisson formula to approximate Binomial probabilities.", "Hence, the probability that 2 to 5 yellow lobsters will be hatched is 0.48913.", "To address this problem, we need to tweak our Poisson approximate formula. From the question we learn that P (x \u2265 1) = 0.90 because lobsters must be hatched in order to be at least 90% sure that at least one is yellow. This also means we can derive P(X = 0) by 1 \u2014 P(x\u22651) which is 0.10. We can now use this info, P(X = 0) to find the number of lobsters, n.", "With simple Mathematic logic, we can estimate there are about 69077553 lobsters must be hatched in order to be at least 90% sure that at least one is yellow.", "In this article, we only focus on application of Poisson probability formula to solve different real life problems but we does not go into the details of the origination of formula. The aim over here is to introduce a useful statistic concept that can sheds light on explaining lots of real life phenomena as we have walked through several examples above.
