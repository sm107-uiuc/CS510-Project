Or made a witty comment to a friend that gets a few laughs? These are second nature to us.", "Sure, a computer can hold near-infinite calculations on its hard drive while we have trouble estimating a tip. But if you ask a computer to tell a joke, it\u2019s usually a bit cringey, if not disturbing!", "Understandably, the fields of mathematics and machine learning quickly made progress on problems concerning hard numbers:", "But this ease hits a stopping point when we want to dip into problems facing our main methods of communication: talking and writing.", "We created coding programs to help us communicate on the same level as a computer. But can you imagine a world where humans talked to each other in the equivalent of code? It would be very dry\u2026", "A programmer is going to the grocery store and his wife tells him, \u201cBuy a gallon of milk, and if there are eggs, buy a dozen.\u201d", "So the programmer goes, buys everything, and drives back to his house.", "Upon arrival, his wife angrily asks him, \u201cWhy did you get 13 gallons of milk?\u201d The programmer says, \u201cThere were eggs!\u201d", "Fortunately for us, there\u2019s little chance that we\u2019ll adopt Python as a spoken language. We can keep the beauty and complexity of the languages we speak and write, with their vast vocabulary, double-meanings, sarcasm, slang, abbreviations, and idiosyncrasies!", "Natural language simply refers to the way we communicate with each other: speech and text.", "Processing refers to making natural language usable for computational tasks.", "So, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is concerned with finding, digesting, and understanding human speech and text.", "For NLP practitioners, the subtleties of natural language make NLP a very challenging and very exciting field to be a part of!", "NLP wasn\u2019t always conducted with artificial intelligence and machine learning.", "The original approach to solving natural language problems was to \u201chard code\u201d hand-written, rules-based methods.", "For example, \u201cdog\u201d in English should always translate to \u201cperro\u201d in Spanish.", "But, what if the dog is female? Well, then this should translate to \u201cperra\u201d.", "What about \u201cdog-days\u201d referring to the hottest days of the year? Would \u201cdias de perro\u201d make any sense to a Spanish speaker? No \u2014 in Spanish this would be \u201cla can\u00edcula\u201d.", "We can see how hand-written rules quickly become problematic \u2014 this was actually a reason for a brief halt in NLP progress in the 20th century.", "But, with the aid of massive computational resources and some math know-how, NLP researchers have devised \u201cstatistical NLP\u201d approaches to these problems, which have served a huge boost in accuracy and practicality in the field.", "We\u2019ll leave it there as to the history for now, but know that this is why NLP is often considered a subfield of artificial intelligence/machine learning.", "If a computer can aid us in understanding natural language, there are a whole world of tasks we can do more accurately and cheaply, saving people thousands of hours of tedious work.", "At one point I was helping a large transportation company with its marketing efforts. Millions of people go on trips with them every year.", "The company collects surveys from a sampling of these travelers \u2014 often asking questions on a scale from 1\u201310 (How smelly were the bathrooms?). In addition, they ask for free-text responses (How was your trip? Is there anything else we should know?).", "We got hundreds of thousands of survey responses. Can you imagine being the analyst assigned with reading through each response, trying to glean some useful information? Maybe you\u2019re sitting with an Excel spreadsheet slowly ticking through rows of responses, marking how happy or angry the customer was.", "Instead, we used a very simple but powerful method for automatically inferring how happy or angry the customer survey response was \u2014 a practice called \u201csentiment analysis\u201d.", "Previously, a worker would spend valuable hours on this task. Or, more realistically, the company would just throw out the text data \u2014 wasting the time the customers spent filling it out, and any helpful insights waiting to be revealed.", "Now, in minutes, this analysis meant we could rate from 0% to 100% how happy or angry thousands of customers were on their trips. Then we can start tackling the 20% of issues that are causing 80% of customer complaints.", "This is one simple example \u2014 but there are so many times where a little sprinkle of NLP can save countless hours and provide a whole lot of valuable insight.", "So, we have some idea of the value that NLP can provide. What are the major use cases? How else might we employ NLP to make the world a better place?", "Natural language processing is a constantly growing, evolving field, with new applications and breakthroughs happening all the time.", "This certainly makes it difficult to break the field into neat categories, but below is one breakdown to help get our heads around the many different NLP methods:", "Syntax is something we take for granted. As children, we mostly learned the rules for our language through hearing others follow them, and trying to follow them ourselves. Syntax is usually invisible to us unless it is incorrect.", "Syntax is the set of rules around how to structure our sentences, use the correct tense, punctuation, etc. In other words, the rules your English teacher would mark you down for getting wrong in a paper.", "Notice how one of these sentences seems quite wrong:", "Much of NLP is devoted to learning, dissecting, and reusing the rules of syntax.", "Most syntax tasks are low-level, and are not an end in themselves, but produce information used in higher-level NLP tasks that we will discuss below.", "One example is part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Given a word, we want to infer whether it\u2019s a noun, verb, etc:", "While we may not particularly care that \u201ccat\u201d is a noun, this knowledge is very helpful for downstream NLP applications, like finding proper nouns or summarizing text.", "Other examples of NLP methods concerned with syntax include:", "Allowing our machines to work with syntax forms the basis of (in my opinion) much cooler applications of NLP!", "\u201cI am the egg man. They are the egg men. I am the walrus.\u201d", "Although the above snippet contains perfect syntax and follows all the rules, what does it mean? (Maybe a Beatles fan out there can explain it to me.)", "The meaning of the text is the concern of semantics.", "One example of an NLP method concerned with semantics is the ability to pick out proper nouns from text. For example, in the following sentence:", "\u201cThe next door neighbor Victor works for DreamWorks. Melissa, his wife, works for the Department of Defense.\u201d", "The bolded entities are picked out by a Named Entity Recognition system which is designed to capture proper nouns.", "While easy for our eyes to pick out, this would be very difficult to hand-code rules for, especially since the system will not only find the proper nouns, it will tag them:", "At one point I worked for a company that wanted to extract the names of people mentioned in hundreds of thousands of contracts.", "Trying to find a dictionary with all possible names, or having somebody manually read through and highlight, would be error prone and take ages. Using an NER solved this quickly and accurately.", "Some other NLP methods concerned with semantics include:", "Semantics is a flourishing field \u2014 needless to say there is a lot of progress being made in helping our computers find meaning in text, and in turn helping us perform much more powerful analytics.", "What does it take for somebody to persuade you to do something?", "Let\u2019s say your friend wants to go to Burger King. It would be in their favor to mention things like:", "Excellent \u2014 your friend makes a compelling argument!", "Then another friend wants to go to Wendy\u2019s. They mention that:", "Your second friend fell a bit short. Their ideas and suggestions had little to do with each other, or with the topic at hand for that matter. There is no coherence in what they are saying, so it\u2019s really not very persuasive.", "In the first example, your friend talks directly to your desire to eat, and everything they say relates to Burger King. Great!", "Above all, discourse in NLP is concerned with groups of coherent sentences, and what makes for high-quality, human-like communication.", "One important method for discourse in NLP is text summarization.", "With text summarization, machines can automatically summarize any length of text to a length that you prefer, whether it\u2019s an article summary in a sentence, a scientific paper summary in a paragraph, or a book summary in a page.", "For instance, there are often situations where professionals have heaps of papers they need to read through, but it\u2019s not important that they read every word. They just need the gist of it.", "Most importantly, the returned summarization must be internally coherent \u2014 meaning the sentences in the summary follow one another logically and succinctly \u2014 and that the summary accurately condenses the information from the original text.", "Further methods of NLP that concern themselves with discourse include:", "Much of discourse is used when trying to train chatbots to interact well with humans and be easily understandable. If you tell a chatbot on a cosmetics website that you\u2019re looking for a good moisturizer, it\u2019s unhelpful for the bot to ask what your favorite book is.", "Whereas most of what we\u2019ve discussed so far concerns written text data, natural language includes the spoken word, too.", "Because the written word is easier for machines to work with, a main task in this category is speech-to-text translation.", "When you talk to a smart speaker like Alexa, software converts your speech to written words so that machines can perform the previous tasks we\u2019ve described on it.", "In the other direction, given a piece of text, an NLP practitioner can try to make a machine read the text convincingly in a human voice.", "It\u2019s amazing how in tune we are with other people\u2019s speech \u2014 we can usually quickly detect a robot speaking to us.", "But text to speech is getting much better. Google Duplex robot voices have been shown to speak convincingly to the unsuspecting person on the other end. Turing would be proud!", "When we talk to each other, we usually have a point we\u2019re driving at (if we don\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t be talking). Maybe we\u2019re trying to make the other person laugh, or figure out how to get to the grocery store, or ask them for money, or vent our feelings.", "In short, we have some purpose.", "Dialogue tries to explain the purpose of natural language in the context of people (or robots) talking to one another. Another term for this would be conversational knowledge.", "For example, the Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus contains data from thousands of phone calls. The dataset tags the many kinds of intent that the speaker\u2019s utterances may have.", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go first\u201d is classified as an \u201cAction Directive\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re telling somebody to do something.", "\u201cHow about you?\u201d is an \u201cOpen Question\u201d.", "And one of my favorites: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d is an \u201cAcknowledgement\u201d.", "You can imagine how a keen understanding of intent can help a chatbot become much more natural and convincing. That way it can say just the right thing to make you buy that moisturizer!", "There has never been a better time to start learning Natural Language Processing. We\u2019re generating more unstructured text than ever before, and the questions we need to answer are complex and important.", "You now have the foundational knowledge to recognize which problems fall under the umbrella of NLP.", "Not only that \u2014 you also know about the different branches of NLP which will allow you to brainstorm different solutions to your problems, and different approaches to mining value from your data.", "If you\u2019re very new to the field, a great way to start is to pick a methodology that interests you and go deep \u2014 see what problems you can solve with it.", "Most importantly, stay reading and practicing.
