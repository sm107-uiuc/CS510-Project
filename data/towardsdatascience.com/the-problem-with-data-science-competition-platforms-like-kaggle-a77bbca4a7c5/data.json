Some of these competitions are incentivized financially, others just by curiosity. The basic structure for nearly all of the financially incentivized competitions is that all participants (or teams of participants) train and develop models on a training dataset and send in their submissions as predictions on a test dataset of which the labels are hidden from the competitors. Subsequently, the \u2018best\u2019 models are awarded their respective chunk of the financial reward based on some predetermined accuracy metric. Most opinions regarding these predictive modelling competitions are that competition based on financial incentive creates demand for brilliant people to discover solutions to hard problems. While I initially shared this opinion and don\u2019t disagree that they are aiming in the right direction, I\u2019ve come to notice inherent issues with these projects that inhibit progress in a very solvable way. After all, when an organization offers $10,000 to the best performing model in a competition, they are simply crowd sourcing for the best possible solution to their problem, right? In this article, let me discuss the following: the inherent issues with data science competitions and their violation of open source ethics, a proposal for the restructuring of these competitions, and a case for why this solves the inherent problems of the current structure.", "Even though these competitions offer significant rewards as incentive, from my experience, I\u2019ve learned most competitors do not participate as a result of the prize money. Firstly, if this observation is true, it is a sort of anti-thesis to the purpose of the original offering of financial reward in the first place. If many competitors do not regard the prize money as incentive, the value of the money, as it relates to the quality of the models produced for the offering organization, is greatly decreased. Let me explain.", "Maybe some of you reading this have been near the top of a data science competition before, or maybe some of you near the middle of the pack. I encourage you to recall how either of these positions changed the effort you put forth towards the problem. From my experience competing and seeing others compete, the knowledge of being near the middle of the pack and lacking ideas for further improvement often leads to a disregard of the financial incentive and, in most cases, a turn to something like, \u201cWell, at least I learned something.\u201d On the other hand, the ones that see their name near the top of the leader board already begin thinking about what they would do with their share of the prize; and what happens as a result? These folks buckle down, working relentlessly to ensure they don\u2019t let their hard work slip through their fingers. This is great right? As a result of the financial incentive, we have dozens of smart people tirelessly competing to produce solutions to hard problems. Right. But, what if there was a way we could use the same portion of money to incentivize all participants, hundreds of data scientists, in this way?", "For those that aren\u2019t familiar, to use an Open Source framework is the decision to make all source code for a project available to any and all that may want to take a peek or further improve on the ideas. In my opinion, the move towards Open Source is one of the greatest movements in history in the acceleration tech development, especially as it relates to a field with such a variety of benevolent and malevolent use cases, enter Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Stipulations in these competitions, such as disqualification for the sharing of code between teams, result in an anti-Open Source environment. Based on the current reward structure of the classic data science competition, there doesn\u2019t exist an incentive for anyone to share ideas. In fact, it is much more beneficial to hoard good ideas in-house to prevent others from using them to potentially beat you. As a result of this anti-Open Source nature, when there are common problems to solve such as data preprocessing or experimenting to find the correct neural network structure, countless hours are wasted based on the simple fact that everyone has to solve the same problem on their own. For example, I am currently participating in an Alzheimer\u2019s research competition with the Stall Catchers Project in which the dataset is a collection of videos of blood flow within the brain. By nature of this dataset, every participant in the competition will have to write a script that will preprocess the videos into frame images that are subsequently cropped around the vessel in question. Creating a function that made the Numpy slicing of the videos work properly and universally for every frame of every video took me approximately 3 hours to complete.", "Let\u2019s crunch some numbers here. We see there are 623 participants in this competition and, for lack of more info, let\u2019s assume my n=1 observation is near the average. Since we all have to preprocess the data in the same (or very similar) way, we collectively just spent a whopping 1,869 hours on preprocessing that could have been redirected had only a few people assumed this role and shared their work with the rest of the class. Had this been the case, these hours could instead have been spent building networks, researching the disease, optimizing networks, etc. And remember, this was just the first step of the competition.", "This all boils down to the simple fact that even the best data scientist in the world can\u2019t optimize a network for a sufficiently complex problem in a sufficiently short period of time without computing resources like high end GPU\u2019s and TPU\u2019s. Further, every increment of increased computing power yields some decrease in optimization time, of which can be used to pursue further ideas. My claim is not that these competitions are all dictated by access to computing resources; in fact, it is obvious to me that knowledge of the problem and effective approaches to solve it are a far more important asset than computing resources. I am simply stating the fact that there exists a processing speed barrier that, if not met, could remove the possibility for a brilliant data scientist with a lack of resources to have access to a certain prize pool.", "A potential rebuttal to my argument may claim that some competitions actually are fair by mention of the computing restrictions that are often implemented such as making use of TPU\u2019s illegal, GPU run time limits, or other processing speed restrictions. From an economic perspective once again, if an organization is \u201cpaying\u201d (or offering a reward as a prize) a group of people to find the best possible solution to a hard problem, why would we restrict the pool of computing resources that this group already has at their disposal? For that reason, these restrictions seem like a non-starter to me if the ultimate goal is to arrive at the best solution possible. Further, if we choose not to use the processing speeds at hand, it is a discredit to the engineers that were able to push the envelope and build the amazing technology that is the cutting-edge processors we have access to today.", "The idea behind the branched chain reward structure is that rather than everyone working in solitude and discovering their version of the best model for the problem at hand, we would instead have a repository that hosts the best current working models. As a result, instead of doing all of the exploratory modelling that someone else may have already done, a contributor can focus on improving an existing idea that is already shown to be a potential lead to the best solution. Under this structure, a competitor would sift through the current tree of models and ideas and, based on their knowledge of the problem, decide to contribute in one of two ways:", "In this way, prize money could be distributed not to a single team or individual, but evenly distributed to all contributors of the winning branch of the tree (likewise for 2nd place, 3rd place, etc.).", "A potential issue that could arise from a tree of improvements on previous ideas is that the complexity of the tree could become so large that it is near impossible to decipher which models have potential and which simply cannot work. You can imagine a scenario where a competitor must test out hundreds of different branched variations of models just to determine which model they will end up working on or where they might branch off into their own model at a more foundational level of the hierarchy. To simplify this potential complexity, I suggest some sort of model evaluation metric be displayed at each node of each branch. This will allow competitors to clearly see which models are performing well and the rate at which each model is improving. In this way, competitors will be incentivized to ignore the models that are showing little promise to contend for a prize; thus, causing these branches to be automatically pruned from the tree as they are ignored by the majority of competitors. That is, unless a competitor has a breakthrough idea to contribute to a certain under-performing branch. Ultimately, this will cause the best ideas to proliferate, while the inferior ideas get left behind and eventually die off.", "The switch to an Open Source architecture that allows people to consider, learn from, and build upon each others\u2019 ideas will redirect countless hours of competitors all solving the same trivial tasks by simply allowing them to use each others\u2019 work as a collective and learn from each others\u2019 mistakes. This will increase the rate of problem solving, allow competitors to spend more time on unsolved problems, and ultimately yield a better solution to the problem posed by the prize offering organization.", "2. Larger Quantity of Proactive, Passionate Contributors", "As previously mentioned, I believe in any standard data science competition there is a large subset of competitors that work on problems because they enjoy it and maybe because they would like to build a portfolio, but do not see any possibility of breaking into the prize pool. Consequently, there is a smaller subset of competitors that passionately and tirelessly pursue their ideas as they hold high enough standing on the leader board to make their time worthwhile. In my opinion, a reward structure in which any contributor is rewarded for a brilliant idea contribution at any step of the way to the prize winning model will relocate competitors from the former casual learner group into the latter passionately and tirelessly working group. Further, this structure will incentivize proactive contribution over procrastination. That is, if one contributor makes an update to a branch of a model early on in the hierarchy of ideas and lays the foundation for others, there is an increased probability that this contribution will be the foundation of multiple brilliant models, thus allowing the competitor to garner a portion of multiple prizes. This will keep competitors chomping at the bit to develop new ideas, rather than building and submitting their models at the eleventh hour.", "3. Equal Access to Prize Pools (or a bit more equal at least)", "There is currently a sort of equipment threshold that, if not met, holds competitors out of the running for prize winning submissions (especially in competitions where Deep Learning is necessary). Obviously, access to a high end data science machine with the latest and greatest TPU\u2019s or enough money to pay for something similar in the cloud will still be a huge advantage for competitors. Though, under this proposed structure, a university student with only a Macbook Pro that can\u2019t afford access to a more capable machine can at least contribute ideas such as an innovative preprocessing method or introduction of a neural network structure that others might have overlooked. This will expand the collective mind tackling the problem, again resulting in a better solution.", "Of which I am sure there are many, but here are a couple of potential challenges with this structure I\u2019ve thought of:", "For example, we have a model currently established at one branch of the tree and someone makes a very simple adjustment that causes a trivial increase in prediction accuracy. Is this considered a \u2018new idea\u2019 and added to the tree? I think to solve this issue, one would have to define an \u2018improvement\u2019 on a previous idea as quantified by the respective evaluation metric of the problem. If we create some rule like \u201cA branch can only be extended as an \u2018improvement\u2019 to the previous model if the resulting model is improved by fill in the blank percent\u201d. This way, we impose some sort of limit to what is added to the tree to ensure trivial changes are not considered multiple times over.", "How do we collaborate with each other if were speaking a different (programming) language? The best solution I can think of to this issue is to either declare the language of the competition from the start or possibly split up the prize into a few different competitions, one for each of a small number of languages that best suit the task at hand. On the bright side, maybe this could help people become comfortable with more programming languages by forcing them to explore others rather than letting them always default to their preference.", "I hope as a result of this article I am not taken the wrong way and believed to have a negative opinion of data science competitions; I\u2019ve always loved that data science competitions are so widely offered online. I think they have brought a huge benefit in both getting problems solved and allowing researchers to work on projects they are interested in. It only occurred to me recently while working on a tedious data preprocess that the task I\u2019m currently spending hours on has been or will be also completed by hundreds of other competitors; but due to the nature of the competition, we are not allowed to help each other out. I thought, \u201cI understand why we cannot share ideas for sake of competition, but what if there was a way to make the competition completely open source while also keeping the competition aspect alive? In this way, we could maximize efficiency while still allowing the monetary prize rewards to motivate competitors to solve the problem as is the purpose of the reward.", "There are likely problems with this structure that I haven\u2019t considered that others might think of and others that would only become apparent in practice. But as everything around us tends more and more towards Open Source and in many cases yields revolutionary problem-solving efficiency, I can\u2019t help but think there is a place for it in the world of online data science competitions. With thoughts anyone may have after conceptualizing this idea, feel free to respond and share as I know there are many different avenues of this to explore. I would love to hear other opinions from the community."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
