Following which we are going to see more of these hacks. Let us begin.", "The most effective method for converting wide to long data and long to wide data is pandas.melt() and pandas.pivot_table() function respectively. You will not need anything else to manipulate long and wide data into one another other than these functions.", "When you need to summarise the data, cross tabulation plays a great role to aggregate two or more factors and compute the frequency table for the values. It can be implemented with pandas.crosstab() function which also allows to find the normalized values while printing the output using \u2018normalize\u2019 parameter.", "The one of the best libraries in Python is jupyterthemes that allows you to change and control the style of the notebook view that most of the ML practitioners work upon. As different themes like having dark mode, light mode, etc. or custom styling is preferred by most of the programmers and it can be achieved in Jupyter notebooks using jupyterthemes library.", "You can find more about it here on Github https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes.", "Using pandas.get_dummies() function, you can directly convert the categorical features in the DataFrame to Dummy variables along with drop_first=True to remove the first redundant column.", "While loading dataset into pandas, sometimes the numeric column is taken object type and numeric operations cannot be performed on the same. In order to convert them to numeric, we can use pandas.to_numeric() function and update existing Series, or column in DataFrame.", "When splitting the dataset, we need to obtain sample population in data splits at times. It is more effective when the classes are not balanced enough in the dataset. In sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split() function, a parameter named \u201cstratify\u201d can be set with target class feature to correctly split the data with same ratio as present in unsplitted dataset for different classes.", "In most of the datasets, we have both types of columns, i.e. Numerical, and Non-Numerical. We often have the need to extract only the numerical columns or categorical columns in the dataset and perform some visualization functions or custom manipulations on the same. In pandas library, we have DataFrame.select_dtypes() function which selects the specific columns from the given dataset that matches the specified datatype.", "RandomizedSearchCV is a function from sklearn.model_selectionclass that is used to determine random set of hyperparameters for the mentioned learning algorithm, it randomly selects different values for each hyperparameter provided to tune and applied cross-validations on each selected value and determine the best one of them using different scoring mechanism provided while searching.", "A batch of previously ran commands in the notebook can be accessed using \u2018%history\u2019 magic function. This will provide all previously executed commands and can be provided custom options to select the specific history commands which you can check using \u2018%history?\u2019 in jupyter notebook.", "In python, you can directly print the last output sent by the interpreter using print(_) function with underscore. This might not be that helpful, but in IPython (jupyter notebook), this feature has been extended and you can print any nth last output using n underscores within print() function. E.g. print(__) with two underscores will give you second-to-last output which skips all command that has no output.", "Also, another is underscore followed by line number prints the associated output.", "That\u2019s all for now. I will present more of these important hacks/functions that every data engineer should know about in more next few parts.", "Thanks for reading. You can find my other Machine Learning related posts here.", "I hope this post has been useful. I appreciate feedback and constructive criticism. If you want to talk about this article or other related topics, you can drop me a text here or at LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
