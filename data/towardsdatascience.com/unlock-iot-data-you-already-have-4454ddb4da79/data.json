Every modern commercial building is packed full of sensors. They are already installed and managed at scale. The problem is they are closed systems for single-purpose applications.", "But if you can unlock the sensor data, they can power many data science projects without requiring new hardware.", "Here are 5 enterprise systems you should explore tapping into:", "BMS includes a handful of technologies that regulate the building environment. Most commonly, they include lighting control systems and HVAC (air condition) systems.", "The most basic lighting control systems include motion sensors in rooms and walkways \u2014 you\u2019ve probably had to wave your arms around in a room before when the lights cut off. More advanced lighting control systems include lumen sensors near windows that dim the lights to save power in areas where there is more natural light.", "The HVAC system includes temperature sensors throughout the building to regulate cooling and heating based on where it is needed.", "Both these systems have environmental sensors all over the building \u2014 it just takes some creative integration to make those sensor feed available to IoT applications. In fact, this transition is already happening because BMS applications benefit from IoT integration.", "Here\u2019s a pseudo dataset of what you might get from a BMS motion sensor:", "As the grandfather of the Internet of Things, RTLS has proven how IoT can deliver value for over a decade. In fact, the RTLS market is expected to grow to nearly $12B by 2024.", "RTLS includes tags that are placed on assets or people that a business wants to track location.

At a minimum, they are used to record activity in case evidence is needed for a crime committed on-premises.", "For a while now, these security surveillance systems have been transitioning from old school COAX connections to IP-based connections that are accessible on your internal network.

But did you consider they can also be an IoT gateway?", "Some sensor endpoints can backhaul over Wi-Fi so you don\u2019t have to buy standalone IoT gateways. The tradeoff is that Wi-Fi connectivity increases the power consumption of small IoT devices.", "To help fix that, many Wi-Fi vendors are adding other wireless communication radios to their access points, such as:", "These radios are more power-friendly for IoT devices, which means they can last longer on a battery without sacrificing performance.", "Check your Wi-Fi access points to see what wireless radios they have that can be used for IoT backhaul.", "Lastly, enterprise Wi-Fi vendors often provide analytics tools, such as Cisco\u2019s DNA platform or Aruba\u2019s Operational Intelligence platform, to their customer\u2019s IT network support teams.
