Although classification can include unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering), in most cases, our tasks involve known labels and thus we\u2019re conducting supervised learning to classify our data. Your model will generate predicted labels, which will allow us to compare whether our prediction is accurate or not. When the predicted label and the true label match, we say the prediction is correct, and apparently when they don\u2019t, we say the prediction is wrong.", "To put our discussion into context, suppose that we have clinical data for some subjects whose diagnoses on diabetes are known. Just a quick disclaimer before we proceed \u2014 these data are not real data and they don\u2019t constitute any medical advice.", "Based on these data, we build a logistic regression model to predict whether people have diabetes or not based on their fasting glucose level. In the table below, the fasting glucose level is expressed as mg/dL. The diabetic_clinical column shows you the clinical diagnosis while the diabetic_predicted shows you the prediction result from the logistic regression model. Based on the clinical and predicted results, we can simply know whether a prediction is correct or not, as indicated by the last column.", "Based on this binary evaluation outcome (correct vs. wrong) in relation to the true labels, we can build the 2 x 2 confusion matrix, as shown below.", "We can derive many metrics essential for classification model evaluation. Some commonly used ones are listed below, and you can find a full list of generated metrics at the Wikipedia page.", "The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve is a graph showing you how your classification model performs at all thresholds. The following graph is a hypothetical ROC curve.", "To put the ROC curve into the context of the diabetes diagnosis example, let\u2019s suppose that we can have different thresholds for predicting the diabetes diagnosis. As you can expect, if we have an extreme low threshold, we will classify all subjects as diabetic. Although we can get a TPR of 1, but the FPR will become 1 too. Considering some moderate thresholds, we should be able to find many different combinations of TPR and FPR.", "Because the data shown are small is size, if you have many more data points, by varying the threshold, you should create more points as a function of TPR and FPR. If we connect all of these points and smooth the curve, we\u2019re getting the ROC curve for the particular model that we\u2019re building.", "How can we quantify the performance of our model? As discussed above, we say that the ROC is to show our model performs, but how can we exactly evaluate the performance with the ROC curves?", "If you compare the two extreme scenarios (perfect vs. worst), you\u2019ll probably notice that the areas under the curve seems to mean something. Your guess is exactly right. Suppose you consider a typical model, in most cases, your model\u2019s TPR should be larger than the FPR at various thresholds. In this case, you\u2019ll see your ROC curve above the diagonal line of the graph.", "More importantly, if your model is better, you should see greater differences between the TPR and the FPR, which drives the curve towards the perfect model situation. The following graph shows you some possible scenarios that you may encounter with realistic models.", "Although ROC and AUC are often used to evaluate classification task performance, they\u2019re not always preferred. The major reason is that it doesn\u2019t consider the actual question under examination. For instance, different models can have similar AUC, but they can have different shapes, which means that the models have different combinations of TPR and FPR.", "Thus, we should consider other factors to pick the desired model. Questions to ask yourself can include. Do you care more about correctly identifying positive cases? Or do you care more about correctly identifying negative cases?", "For your reference, here\u2019s a brief discussion on the ROC and AUC, which I find very useful for beginners.", "Your home for data science.
