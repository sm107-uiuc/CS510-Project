(For example, you can get over 20 million datasets here.)", "Want definitions of other related jargon? Find them in my main article on data provenance. (You\u2019re reading Part 2.)", "Inherited datasets are like inherited toothbrushes: using them is an act of desperation. You\u2019d always prefer to use your own if possible. Unfortunately, you might not have that option. Collecting primary data can be prohibitively expensive.", "Collecting your own data is a luxury not everyone can afford.", "While primary data carries a whiff of superiority reminiscent of artisanal cheese, anyone who insists that you\u2019re worthless for chowing down on inherited data should check their privilege. Individuals (as well as firms without strong data traditions or newcomers to a domain) might not have the resources to collect data on their own, especially when the project requires very large datasets or specialist skills/equipment. For example, not everyone can afford to take pathogen measurements in a lab environment with a high biosafety rating.", "Sometimes your only option is to try to make the best of someone else\u2019s data.", "But if you\u2019re forced to work with someone else\u2019s data, don\u2019t be surprised later on if things don\u2019t pan out the way you\u2019d hoped. There\u2019s no guarantee that inherited data will serve your needs\u2026 (Also, the tooth fairy isn\u2019t real.)", "Buyer beware: There\u2019s no guarantee that inherited data will serve your needs.", "Here\u2019s a quote I like from R.A. Fisher:", "\u201cTo consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of.\u201d", "That goes for your inherited dataset too \u2014 its collection was finished before you arrived on the scene, so it wasn\u2019t designed to fit your needs. As far as your intended purpose goes, it might be so kaput that the most you can squeeze out of it is an autopsy. I hope you\u2019ve taken enough journeys around the sun not to let this ruffle your feathers.", "Inherited data are easier to get but harder to trust.", "If you\u2019re on the verge of protesting that it\u2019s better to have some data rather than no data at all, replace the word \u201cdata\u201d with \u201cnoise\u201d / \u201clies\u201d / \u201cdistractions\u201d and try your sentence again. Quality is everything, and if you didn\u2019t collect the dataset yourself, you have no control over what was measured and (perhaps more importantly) what was left out. Some data is only better than none sometimes.", "When you\u2019re forced to work with inherited data, you\u2019ve got five main problems to worry about:", "How should you approach working with inherited data? As with any dataset you get your paws on, your first action, habit \u2014 instinct! \u2014 should be SYDD. (\u201cSplit your damned data.\u201d) Put any data not earmarked for exploration in a safe place.", "Next, it\u2019s crucial that you seek documentation about how the inherited dataset was born. If possible, try to identify and contact whichever culprits, er, project members were responsible for the data collection legwork to find out what precisely they did and ask them clarifying questions. If consultation with the originating team is impossible (or if they forgot what they did), you\u2019ll be forced to rely on written documentation. (See? Yet another argument for why good documentation is so important.)", "If you\u2019re an analyst (not doing statistical inference), you can take a lightweight approach: find out how much documentation exists and how detailed it is, make a gut check about whether the data quality justifies your time investment, and then use the documentation only as needed for your usual exploratory data analysis (EDA). However, if you think you found something inspiring enough to bring to a decision-maker, thoroughly check the documentation to ensure that you haven\u2019t fallen for an obvious red herring.", "If you\u2019re doing ML/AI, you can take a similar approach and use inherited data for training after only a cursory foray into documentation, but \u2014 for goodness\u2019 sake! \u2014 validate carefully and test your model on your own primary data. If you failed to thoroughly check performance in primary data, it doesn\u2019t count. You\u2019re a danger to yourself and others. Pretty please don\u2019t launch.", "Statisticians won\u2019t get away with anything so easy. If you\u2019re engaged in a data-driven decision-making project, you\u2019re going to have to get to know the documentation thoroughly before proceeding with inherited data. This is soulcrushingly boring, but it\u2019s the price you have to pay for working safely with data you didn\u2019t create yourself. Specifically, make sure that you compile your own document detailing your understanding of the sampling procedure, potential biases, and real-world actions that generated the data you inherited.", "As you\u2019re poring over documentation, look up the exact meaning of the variable names and ask an analyst friend to help you do some EDA to ensure that the data aren\u2019t completely bonkers. For example, no negative values for things that should be positive, no columns without variance, no duplicates, no contradictions, etc. If you\u2019re not sure what to keep an eye out for, you might like to look up some of these keywords from standard health checkups for data quality:", "Does it cover the right topic?", "Are there any barriers to access?", "Can you trust what you\u2019re seeing?", "Can you trust what you\u2019re not seeing?", "It\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t make premature assumptions \u2014 just because something is called \u201cweight\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s what you think it is. It could be an SI unit or a weighting of importance or anything else \u2014 people put the darnedest labels in their datasets, especially if they\u2019re not creating them with other data scientists in mind.", "Additionally, trust no one! Even if the documentation says that \u201cweight\u201d refers to weight in kilograms, remember that transcription booboos and other measurement errors are a thing. For example, if the column claims to contain weights, you might ask yourself: Was a scale used? (Or just an eyeball? How do I know?) How precise was the scale? Was there more than one scale? Were they calibrated carefully? How well-trained were the personnel taking the measurements?", "As you attack these questions in the documentation, you\u2019ll be shocked to see how few \u201cwhat the #$%@ is this?\u201d and \u201chow did this actually work in real life?\u201d questions you can get good, precise answers for.", "Does that mean you must give up? You may proceed\u2026 with appropriate caution and humility.", "Does that mean you must give up? No. You may proceed\u2026 with appropriate caution and humility. Every time you find an issue, you\u2019ll be honor-bound to wax lyrical about all the guesses you\u2019re forced to make about what really happened during the data collection.", "You\u2019ll spend a lot of boring \u2014 yes, boring \u2014 time on the following:", "The level of apology you owe your readers and decision-makers depends on your experience and expertise with similar data.", "In plain English: the more you know about the real-world context in which data were collected, the less rubbishy your assumptions are likely to be, and the less you need to grovel in humility before your audience.", "If you\u2019re an expert in the field \u2014 for example, if you\u2019re an experienced biostatistician working with epidemiologists \u2014 you\u2019re better qualified to make reasonable assumptions about what happened during the collection of a COVID-19 dataset than I am. If I were cheeky enough to dive into such data without the support of experienced subject-matter experts, I would owe it to myself and my audience to take stock of my ignorance (in written form!) before proceeding.", "\u201cSince our project team did not participate in planning the study or data collection, it is possible that we are missing crucial context which renders our conclusions invalid.\u201d", "In addition to writing conclusion-softening notes, every self-respecting author should remember to include a blanket inherited data warning like this one: \u201cSince our project team did not participate in planning the study or data collection, it is possible that we are missing crucial context which renders our conclusions invalid.\u201d", "This isn\u2019t about perfectionism. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to try to slightly increase your (imperfect) understanding with data. Just don\u2019t forget to acknowledge how much you don\u2019t know.", "This isn\u2019t about perfectionism. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to try to slightly increase your (imperfect) understanding with data.
