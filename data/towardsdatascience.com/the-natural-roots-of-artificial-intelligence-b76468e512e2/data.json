I will outline how AI differs from, but is rooted in, conceptions of \u201cnatural\u201d intelligence. I have done my best to present technical concepts in a simplified and representative manner.", "To begin our exploration of AI we start with defining intelligence. The Oxford Universal Dictionary (1955) leans heavily on the word\u2019s Latin root, intelligere (to understand), defining intelligence as [1] the faculty of understanding; intellect; and [2] understanding as a quality admitting of degree; spec. superior understanding; quickness of mental apprehension; sagacity. While this focus on \u201cunderstanding\u201d does highlight the capacity to perceive meaning, it is overbroad; we need to look further for more clarity.", "Within academic circles, researchers do not have a universally shared definition of intelligence. Broadly speaking, there are four major viewpoints on intelligence that carry over to artificial intelligence research \u2014 each with proponents and critics. The first three groups \u2014 all concerned with humans \u2014 share a commonality: intelligence depends upon but is distinct from cognition. Where cognition refers to the underlying processes of the brain, intelligence is what can be achieved with it. Intelligence uses cognitive abilities to meet prescribed ends. The fourth group takes an alternative view that intelligence is broader than mere humans and animals and can be observed within biology. Let me elaborate.", "The General Intelligence Camp: This first group holds that intelligence is a general mental capacity; namely, the ability to deal with cognitive complexity. A rather succinct definition put forward by Linda Gottfredson in Why G Matters: The Complexity of Everyday (1997), and endorsed by fifty-two other researchers, states:", "\u201cIntelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings \u2014 \u201ccatching on,\u201d \u201cmaking sense\u201d of things, or \u201cfiguring out\u201d what to do.\u201d", "These researchers believe that general intelligence, also known as the g factor, can be measured by empirically testing reasoning, memory, knowledge, processing speed, and spatial ability. The output of these tests does not indicate intelligence per se, but gives an approximation of it \u2014 similar to the way fitness tests measuring various aspects of the body can give an idea of overall health. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, the psychologists Sir Francis Galton, James McKeen Cattell, and Alfred Binet systematized large-scale intelligence tests\u2014whose validity are still debated today.", "The Multiple Intelligences Camp: The second group believes that there are different types of intelligence. Holding that general intelligence fails to fully explain cognitive ability, researchers point to different modalities of intelligence that emerge in people. In extreme cases, specific terms like fachidiot in German and idiot savant in France emerged to reference those who display intelligence only within a narrow domain.", "Researchers have put forward different theories of how intelligence can be subdivided. In Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983), Howard Gardner argued that there are seven types of intelligence: visual-spatial, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and bodily-kinaesthetic. He later added three more: existential, laser, and mental searchlight. Alternatively, Robert J. Sternberg referenced aspects of general intelligence in Beyond IQ: A Triarchic Theory of Human Intelligence (1985) by breaking it into three subtheories of componential (analytical), experiential (creative), and practical (contextual) intelligence.", "In addition, the existence of emotional intelligence is a popular yet scientifically contentious idea. First appearing in the 1960s in papers by Michael Beldoch and B. Leaner, and later popularized in Daniel Goleman\u2019s Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ (1995), emotional intelligence is the capacity to identify and manage the emotions of oneself and others. Proponents correlate emotional intelligence to occupation outcomes, while critics point to its significance being low when controlling for general intelligence and personality traits.", "The Behavioural Camp: The third group does away with trying to tie intelligence to cognitive aptitude. Instead, it defines intelligence as the ability to solve problems. Because intelligence is the mobilization of cognition, it focuses on the achievement of outwardly observable results. As quoted by S. S. Corvin in Cambridge University\u2019s Handbook of Intelligence (2000), \u201ca person possesses intelligence insofar as he has learned, or can learn, to adjust himself to his environment.\u201d Although this viewpoint appears narrow in its encapsulation of intelligence, for reasons we will see later it is the favoured vernacular of artificial intelligence researchers.", "The Evolutionary Camp: Finally, the fourth group argues that all living things exhibit some sort of intelligent behaviour. Cianciolo and Sternberg point out in Intelligence: A Brief History (2004) that intelligence can ultimately be boiled down to the ability for organisms to adapt to their environment and learn from experience. This type of definition is often used by biologists \u2014 albeit cautiously to distance themselves from intelligent design. Driven by evolution and exponentiated by culture, nature generates organisms that adapt themselves to the environment for survival and reproduction. Throughout Intelligence in Nature: An Inquiry into Knowledge (2005), anthropologist Jeremy Narby uses the Japanese expression chi-sei, which loosely translates to \u201cknowingness,\u201d or the \u201ccapacity to know.\u201d There are countless examples of intelligent behaviour in nature, such as plants that bend their stalks throughout the day, bacteria employing unique swimming strategies in search of food, or monkeys that give unique warning signals for each type of predator. For this group, intelligence is quiet and unconscious, contextual to circumstance, concerned with survival over problem solving, and built on contingency.", "These four viewpoints are static definitions of intelligence. But intelligence changes within humans over time: Jean Piaget identified how it develops and transitions from infancy and childhood through to adolescence and adulthood. Intelligence also changes with culture: After James Flynn noticed intelligence increasing over time, he found that the cognitive complexity of an environment increased complexity of thought. Put another way, genes and environment interact to affect intelligence. Additionally, the impact of intelligence changes when looked at collectively: in Hive Mind: How Your Nation\u2019s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own (2015), Garrett Jones explores how intelligence at a collective scale translates into real world outcomes.", "Herbert Simon\u2019s dichotomy between the natural and the artificial played an important role in AI\u2019s history. As Simon writes in The Sciences of the Artificial (1969), the natural is produced by nature, while the artificial is produced by art. Although \u201cartificial\u201d carries a pejorative connotation, artificial processes are concerned with changing existing situations into preferred ones. Through the process of design, humans produce material artifacts that exploit the natural world to meet certain assigned ends. We might think of air conditioners, airplanes, bricks, bread, skyscrapers, smartphones, and so on.", "In the summer of 1956, the field of artificial intelligence was born at Dartmouth College. A two month study led by John McCarthy brought together leading mathematicians and scientists on the \u201cconjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.\u201d This was a highly ambitious undertaking reflecting the optimism and early milestones of its attendees: Herbert Simon predicted \u201cmachines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do,\u201d while Marvin Minsky wrote \u201cwithin a generation\u2026 the problem of creating \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 will substantially be solved.\u201d Put bluntly, this did not happen.", "As it did happen, the field prudently converged on more modest definitions of AI oriented around the achievement of goals \u2014 which is not dissimilar to our behaviourist camp\u2019s notion of intelligence. Experts put forth less specific definitions such as \u201cthe ability to solve hard problems\u201d (Marvin Minsky), \u201cthe ability to use optimally limited resources \u2014 including time \u2014 to achieve goals\u201d (Ray Kurzweil), \u201cachieving complex goals in complex environments\u201d (Ben Goertzel), \u201cany system that generates adaptive behaviour to meet goals in a range of environments\u201d (David Fogel), and \u201ccombining science and engineering in order to build machines capable of intelligent behaviour\u201d (Joanna Bryson and Jeremy Wyatt).", "Using these sorts of definitions, we see that AI is method agnostic; it is not prescriptive about which methods must be used to solve problems. Moreover, we see it has a history of addressing problems that we no longer consider as AI, such as devising tic-tac-toe strategies, creating mathematical proofs, recognizing handwritten text, or optimizing the prices of airline tickets. We now think of AI as only being concerned with solving problems that computers aren\u2019t currently capable of solving. As Douglas Hofstadter quips, \u201c[AI] is whatever hasn\u2019t been done yet.\u201d Likewise, in Society of Mind (1967), Minsky remarks \u201cthe very concept of intelligence is like a stage magician\u2019s trick. Like the concept of \u2018the unexplored regions of Africa,\u2019 it disappears as soon as we discover it.\u201d", "All in all, the \u201cintelligence\u201d in artificial intelligence, if anything, refers to the intelligence of its makers made manifest in machines.", "At the core of each instance of AI there is an algorithm \u2014 a set of instructions delivered to a computer to generate an output from an input. AI algorithms surround us: stoplights within a city coordinate themselves based on traffic patterns; smartphones conserve energy based on application usage; planes fly on autopilot based on a plethora of flight data; Facebook generates individualized newsfeeds based on a black box of user data. What unifies such discrete algorithms, and how might they be classified?", "There are many ways to categorize and organize the thinking within AI. For instance, tasks can be broken down into either classification problems to identify a group (or class) for a given observation, or regression problems to generate quantitative predictions. Or if categorizing AI based on caliber, there is artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) that specializes in one area, artificial general intelligence (AGI) that can apply intelligence to any problem, and a hypothetical artificial superintelligence (ASI) that surpasses human intelligence. Our focus is on the sub-AGI category since most expert forecasts place AGI decades into the future, and research in ANI is the intermediate step. Referencing Pedro Domingo\u2019s succinct review of the field in his book The Master Algorithm (2015), I will provide a cursory review of major viewpoints on the methods for creating AI.", "We first need to know that at the highest level, there are two competing approaches for generating AI: machine learning (ML) and knowledge engineering (KE). Machine learning is the process of teaching a computer to learn. It employs learning algorithms \u2014 algorithms that make other algorithms. By starting with a set of inputs along with their corresponding outputs, then passing the computer a learning algorithm, it writes a program that can produce the right outputs from a new set of inputs. To knowledge engineers, this is merely pattern recognition, not real knowledge. Knowledge engineering takes a different approach of having experts encode their knowledge of domains into a language that computers can understand. When faced with a problem, an expert system references logic and rules endowed by experts to solve it. Machine learning advocates fire back that the number of ideas needed to create an intelligent agent are infinite. Encoding knowledge is mere stamp collecting, and if the machine cannot learn, it becomes brittle when faced with new situations. The rivalry between ML and KE lasted for decades. Over time, ML became the predominant school of thought after delivering many significant successes. Still, some knowledge engineers believe that the limitations of ML will make eventually make themselves clear, clearing the path for a resurgence in KE.", "Another approach to creating AI lurking in the periphery \u2014 advocated by Ray Kurzweil and explored in depth by Robin Hanson in The Age of Em (2016) \u2014 is to emulate the human brain. Rather than worry about making software that accomplishes the various functions performed by humans, brain emulation essentially ports the \u201csoftware\u201d of the brain to a machine. While speculative in nature, its advocates posit that within the next century we will be able to scan a brain in spacial and chemical resolution, model the signal processing functions of individual brain cells, and create a cell-by-cell executable model of the brain in artificial hardware. Such an emulation could exhibit similar input-output behaviours of humans.", "Although ML is a subfield of AI, it has captured the spotlight. Domingos divides the ML community into five major tribes: symbolists, connectionists, evolutionaries, bayesians, and analogizers. Each tribe\u2019s approaches for devising learning algorithms harken back to natural intelligence, the natural sciences, and mathematics.", "Symbolists believe that all intelligence can be reduced to manipulating symbols \u2014 each an abstract representation of an idea, object, or relationship. Similar to the way mathematicians explain the universe through equations such as Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation, symbolists reduce reality into equations comprised of symbols. While knowledge engineering takes this approach by manually encoding knowledge, symbolist machine learning avoids this \u201cknowledge bottleneck\u201d by employing a learning algorithm that empirically constructs knowledge on its own. This learning is done through a process of inverse deduction: passing a computer data and inducing gaps in knowledge to reach generalized conclusions. This manipulation of symbols can be seen as a loose reinterpretation of Gottfredson\u2019s definition of intelligence.", "Connectionists reverse engineer the brain. Taking inspiration from how our brains\u2019 biological neural networks give rise to learning by reinforcing connections between neurons, connectionists model this through artificial neural networks. This is done by creating layers of artificial neurons that leverage a learning algorithm called backpropagation, which successively changes the connections in each layer to bring the program\u2019s output in line with what is expected. The brain as of yet is the ultimate learning machine; perhaps it has a universal learning algorithm we can learn from. Interestingly, inspiration has worked both ways: some hold that the human mind is an information processing system \u2014 where cognition and consciousness are a form of computation.", "Evolutionaries believe that the mother of intelligence is natural selection. Nature\u2019s learning algorithm is a fitness function that generates complex organisms through the selection and recombination of genes, which also mutate over time. Evolutionaries emulate this through genetic algorithms, where the fulfilment of a program\u2019s purpose is substituted for \u2018survival\u2019 as the measure of fitness, through which programs are evolved over generations with random mutations and/or breeding. Over many iterations, this learning algorithm produces better and better programs, mimicking the sort of intelligent behaviour we outlined in the evolutionary camp of intelligence.", "Bayesians hold that all learned knowledge is uncertain, and learning is the ability to deal with uncertainty. Programs go through a cyclical process of starting with a prior probability \u2014 a belief before seeing evidence \u2014 that gets turned into a posterior probability that incorporates new evidence. Bayesians use probabilistic inference as their learning algorithm, which leans heavily on Bayes\u2019 theorems that guide now to incorporate new evidence into the program\u2019s beliefs. Grounded in mathematics and statistics, it provides an intuitive way to acquire and refine knowledge.", "Analogizers believe that learning is recognizing similarities between situations and thereby inferring other similarities. Analogizers are a loose tribe unified only in making similarity judgements as the basis for learning. Their leading learning algorithms are based on support vector machines, which help judge similarity between different things. Some cognitive sciences like Douglas Hofstadter argue that analogy is core of cognition.", "It is important to note that each type of machine learning requires some degree of oversight from programmers, who provide training data to generate a program, and make tweaks to its parameters to improve the model. This oversight can come in the form of supervised learning where the programmer provides the correct output for each input, reinforcement learning where the programmer defines rewards for actions taken by the learning algorithm, and unsupervised learning where the learning algorithm operates on the input data without the guidance of known outputs or rewards. Once the generated program is deemed satisfactory by the programmer, it can be deployed more broadly.", "Domingos speculates on how the five tribes might be unified into one \u201cmaster algorithm\u201d capable of learning anything \u2014 his favoured path to AGI. In the future, with sufficient data and knowledge as input, such a master algorithm could exist. In the meantime, existing tribes will advance their learning algorithms, combine them with one another, or see new tribes form a new paradigm of learning algorithm. In any case, machine learning will continue to make dizzying advances on solving problems that make us rethink what machines are capable of.", "As advances in artificial intelligence continue, we may inevitably cycle between the various roots of natural and artificial intelligence to articulate the new capability. The issue of AI being often anthropomorphized will continue because we near automatically think of it in terms of the type of intelligence we know: our own. While AI employs a range of problem solving techniques inspired by natural intelligence, it bears limited semblance to the operations of a biological brains \u2014 which involves consciousness, feeling, and volition, among other things. Until a day that an intelligent agent achieves these higher-order traits \u2014 the possibility of which is hotly debated \u2014 the most productive, reflective, and honest representation of AI is to think of it as another family of artifacts; a set of tools used by humans that can achieve positive or negative ends.", "Your home for data science.
