I sure did at one point in my life. In this post, I will explain how a computer sees an image and understands it.", "A computer sees an image as 0s and 1s. Pixel is the smallest unit in an image.", "When we take a digital image, it is stored as a combination of pixels. Each pixel contains a different number of channels. If it a grayscale image, it has only one pixel, whereas if it is a coloured image, it contains three channels: red, green and blue.", "As shown in the above representation of a digital coloured image, each channel of each pixel has a value between 0 and 255. Each of these values represented in binary before a computer can understand the image.", "The next question is, how can it say that the given image contains a picture of a dog?", "In this case, just being able to read the image is of no use if it cannot understand what it means, or if it cannot describe what the image is about, and what it contains. This is where machine learning comes in.", "A machine (or a computer) can be taught how to understand an image and say what the image contains. This is an example of machine learning, teaching a computer to understand and describe an image. It is similar to how we teach kids to identify different alphabets or differentiate between an apple and a banana by showing examples of each case. This is exactly how a computer learns to identify objects in an image.", "Like humans have different skills and one of the skills is to identify an object in an image (a dog in the above image), computers have machine learning models, which can be thought of as a skill, to perform the same task. As humans need to be trained to perform a particular skill, computers need to train the machine learning model as well.", "In both cases, training happens by examples. Similar to how a kid is taught to identify an apple, a machine learning model can be taught how to identify an apple in an image by giving several example images that contain an apple. From these example images, the model learning features of an apple, like its shape and colour. Now when a new image of an apple is presented to this computer with this model, it can use what it had learned about apples earlier and identify that this new image also contains apple.", "This post was an introduction to how a computer reads a digital image and how it understands what the image contains.", "Found this post helpful?
