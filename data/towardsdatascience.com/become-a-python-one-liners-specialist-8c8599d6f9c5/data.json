Unlike other languages that require specific uses of curly brackets and semicolon, Python only cares about indentation. Up to this\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["All you need is one line!", "Python is a beginner-friendly language thanks to its easy syntax. Unlike other languages that require specific uses of curly brackets and semicolon, Python only cares about indentation. Up to this point, it has already seemed that Python cares for its users, isn\u2019t it? However it doesn\u2019t stop here, Python granted us even more convenience through its ability of writing one-liner code snippets. Though short, these one-line codes can be as powerful as a long and tedious program that is written in Python or any other languages.", "By using Python one-liner, you will be able to code less and achieve more, which directly translates to the increase in productivity. Most importantly, one-liner codes are more fun to read and will showcase your proficiency in Python languages.", "1. Swapping the value of 2 variables", "Most of you out there will probably do it this way.", "This will do the job, a\u2019s value is now 2 and b\u2019s value is 1. But, consider this one!", "And it even works with any amount of variables!", "List comprehension can be used to replace the for loop that is needed in making a list.", "Instead of using a for loop, you can just do this.", "You can also add use list comprehension to iterate an existing list and provide some criteria that need to be fulfilled by the element.", "The map method in Python executes a specific function for every element in a list.", "Here, we are typecasting the elements in the list into an integer type. You no longer need to iterate through each element by using a loop function and convert it one by one, map will do it for you.", "The filter method in Python checks iterables, for example, the elements of a list and removes the elements that return False (do not meet the criteria). In this example, we will take advantage of the filter method to find the common elements in two lists.", "Same as the map method, you don\u2019t need to iterate through each element anymore.", "Reduce method in Python is used to apply a function to every element until only one element is left. As the name suggests, the method reduces an array into a single element.", "Reduce function is defined in the \u201cfunctools\u201d modules, so don\u2019t forget to import it beforehand!", "Lambda function is a small anonymous (one-line) function that is capable to substitute a regular function that is declared with the def keyword. The above snippet is similar to this one.", "The power of lambda will be clearer when we use it as a higher-order function. A higher-order function is a function which takes other function/functions as arguments or returns other function/functions.", "Notice that by using a lambda function, we can easily use different lambda functions as the argument for func(x). Doesn\u2019t it give us a great amount of freedom?", "7. Use the reverse method to Reverse List", "Maybe you are all very familiar with the list slicing method I present below:", "However, this method will use more memory, so consider using the reverse method.", "8. Printing the same element many times using *", "Rather than using for loop like this one", "Now that we have looked into what we can do with just one line in Python, its time for implementing it. Here are some examples where you can apply what you have learned so far.", "Factorial of a number, denoted by n! is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Maybe most of you will be thinking of using a recursive function like this one.", "Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers that starts with 0 as the 0th number and 1 as the 1st number. The sequence proceeds with a number that is the sum of the preceding two numbers. The first 8 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. Intuitively, you can use recursion like this one.", "3. Check if a string is a palindrome", "A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward and forward. This snippet of code is not wrong:", "However, isn\u2019t doing it like this more elegant?", "We want to make the 2-D array given to be a 1-D array. It can be done by iterating through each element with for loops.", "However, we can achieve the same thing with this one-liner:", "Learning this one-liners Python tricks will not make you a programming wiz. Nevertheless, it will be a fun thing to do and it will help you to become more productive (fewer lines of code \u2192 less time needed). Besides that, it will be cool to add these tricks in your code. Psshh\u2026 You might be able to impress someone with this.", "I hope you will be applying these cool tricks directly in your code. Maybe some of these techniques will not sink in the first time you use it. Don\u2019t worry! As you use it more often, it will become more natural to you.", "Your home for data science.
