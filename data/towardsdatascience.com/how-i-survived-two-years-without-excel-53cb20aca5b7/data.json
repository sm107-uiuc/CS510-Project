Excel had been a part of my life since I started studying Mechanical Engineering in 1996. Without realising it, Excel became part of my routine and I used it for most things at work and at home. It just sneaked in and never left, until I realised it was limiting me. I noticed the rest of the world was moving on and I had to change to prepare myself for a new world where coding is the norm.", "The first 100 hours were the hardest but also the most rewarding.", "I stopped cold turkey, in one go, without looking back. I felt that was the only way for me to make the change. The first 100 hours were the hardest but also the most rewarding. When the first Excel requirement came up, I felt uncomfortable, I felt tension, almost started shaking, as I knew I had to do it in Python. Evenings I would spend on the most basic things, like reading data from a file (e.g. Excel sheets sent by others), sorting columns, renaming columns, changing formats (datetimes\u2026arghh), grouping data, calculating new columns, etc. I felt frustrated so many times as I knew how to do these things in Excel in a few clicks, but I persevered as I was determined not to relapse and lose face. Yet, everytime I managed to get things done, I felt super satisfied and got more energy to take on the next challenge.", "One evening I suddenly realised that when I felt frustrated, I was learning, in other words, frustration is part of the whole experience. Frustration is like withdrawal symptoms, i.e. a good thing.", "Before I stopped, I did prepare myself by learning some of the basics of Python. I knew that without preparation I would fall back into my old routines quickly. These are the things I did to learn just enough to feel comfortable to ditch excel. If this list is too long for you, focus on learning Pandas as this library is closest to excel in Python and your lifeline.", "I read these books to give me a solid foundation:", "It also helps to read articles on Python and coding written by ordinary people like yourself (i.e. you\u2019re not in this alone). I started reading various publications on Medium.com like:", "I followed one course through MITs OpenCourseWare (free of charge): \u201cIntroduction to computer science and programming in Python.\u201d This course introduces you to the basic concepts and the Spider IDE. It forces you to build new habits by practicing what you just learned. I don\u2019t think you need to follow an entire nanodegree to learn Python, a single course is enough and then quickly apply it in real life projects.", "I don\u2019t think you need to follow a nanodegree to learn Python. The most important thing is to work on real projects.", "Once prepared I felt comfortable to move across and like dealing with any other addiction (Excel in my case) you need to develop new habits quickly. New habits in this case mean you need to work on real life projects; Preferably projects in your work. For all these projects I used Jupyter Lab.", "A selection of projects I worked on:", "As you can see from these projects, I quickly moved into more advanced use of Python. These projects could not be done in excel, just showing how liberating it was to move away from excel and ultimately made me a better professional.", "Does this mean I completely stopped using Excel? Not entirely unfortunately. Only if someone sends me an excel sheet with quite some data wrangling included and it would take too much time to redo everything, I will work in excel. However, I stopped creating new excel sheets and now start with Python by default as I know I need to keep my newly acquired skills sharp.", "For me, moving away from Excel two years ago was enlightening and has opened up a lot of new opportunities. I survived for 2 years already and know I will keep it up. Goodbye Excel, not going to miss you\u2026", "Your home for data science.
