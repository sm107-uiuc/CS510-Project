The shortest path (SP) between a and b has the minimum total edge weight among all the paths\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Assume that we have a graph G with more than two nodes and pick two nodes a and b from this graph. The shortest path (SP) between a and b has the minimum total edge weight among all the paths connecting these two nodes. Such a path can be useful in many scenarios such as finding the fastest route in a road network where edge weights denote the time required to cross that road or finding the minimum cost needed to tranship a good from its source to its destination in a transshipment network.", "Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm is arguably the most popular SP algorithm that works in any graph with non-negative edges. It is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest paths to all nodes until it reaches the target. It starts blindly from the source vertex and explores the graph from the closest nodes discovered until that iteration.", "To find the closest nodes at each iteration, Dijkstra first assumes that all nodes are infinitely distant to the source. Then it updates the distance information (label) of the neighbors of the source node since it discovered a shorter path than infinity. It picks the closest neighbor as the new exploration node and updates its neighbors\u2019 labels as the length of the path to that node from the source. If a node already has a label, then its label is updated only if the new label is smaller. Note that at each iteration, we are guaranteed that the SP from source to the exploration node is discovered since all the edges are non-negative and thus we will not be able to discover a shorter path in the future. With this fact, the label update continues until the target becomes the new exploration node and when it is stopped, the SP is found.", "To exemplify, assume that a driver wants to drive to Rize from Antalya at minimum time. If we construct a graph from the cities of Turkey, where edge weights denote estimated crossing times of the roads, using Dijkstra with Antalya as the source and Rize as the target, we can find the desired path.", "The figure below shows the iterations of Dijkstra for the mentioned graph. In the first iteration, we label neighbors of Antalya with edge weights and find that Izmir is the closest city. We mark Izmir with green and continue exploring the graph. We then mark Ankara, Adana, and Istanbul to find the path to Rize. Note that even though we find a path to Rize at the 3rd iteration, we do not stop, since we did not mark Rize yet. In the 4th iteration, we find a shorter path and on the 5th, we mark Rize. In the last one, we show the SP with thick edges.", "Although Dijkstra managed to discover the SP, intuitions disagree with Dijkstra\u2019s iterations. If a human is asked to accomplish the same task, he/she would not probably search the paths through Izmir and Istanbul, since they are western cities and Rize is on the east of Turkey. Yet, Dijkstra blindly checks the edge weights and ignores the graph structure, even though it is available.", "Though an algorithm\u2019s opposing the human intuitions does not pose a problem, increasing iteration count does! By considering Izmir and Istanbul, Dijkstra wasted a couple of iterations, since these cities are not included in the SP. To decrease the wasted iteration count, we will use the A* algorithm.", "The problem of Dijkstra is derived from its lack of human intuition. In A*, we will use heuristics to overcome this problem. A heuristic is a function that informs the algorithm to enable a more directed search. In A*, heuristics are used to decide which node to consider at each step. Unlike Dijkstra that selects nodes only by the total distance to the source node, A* combines the same criteria with a heuristic function.", "To derive a heuristic for the above graph, consider the human that seeks the SP on the above graph. We stated that he/she would omit Izmir and Istanbul since they are western cities. With heuristics, we can drive the algorithm to do so as well! To reflect human intuition let us define the heuristic for each node as Euclidean distance to Rize.", "With this heuristic, A* will consider two criteria: path distance to Antalya and Euclidean distance to Rize. At each step, it will select the node with the minimum total of these two. To minimize the first criterion, it will pick a node close to Antalya, as in Dijkstra. On the other hand, to minimize the second criterion, it will pick a node close to Rize. Note that this was not considered in Dijkstra at all.", "In the figure below, we see each city associated with its heuristic, Euclidean distance to Rize. We see that A* finds the SP at fewer iterations. Instead of considering Ankara, Izmir, and Istanbul, it directly reaches Rize through Adana.", "Let us think of another scenario. Assume that we have a robot in the middle of a room that wants to reach a target in the corner. We can model the room as a graph in the grid structure and find the SP to minimize the robot\u2019s traveling time.", "If we use Dijkstra to find the SP, it will circularly consider each cell, whereas A* with Euclidean heuristic will use the diagonal directly. This situation is visualized in the figure below. Note the huge difference between iteration counts! You can refer to the linked video for more grid scenarios as well.", "A* algorithm is a valuable alternative to Dijkstra that should be considered especially when reasonable heuristics can be defined. A* is a flexible algorithm in the sense that, one can also increase the weight of the heuristic function during node selection, to pay more attention to heuristic or vice verse. However, most of the times defining a reasonable heuristic is significantly hard.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Teaching enthusiast.
