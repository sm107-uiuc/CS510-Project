Can an interrogator determine the gender of a man and woman correctly simply by having them write down answers to questions the interrogator asks? The catch is while the man is trying to aid the interrogator in identifying the genders correctly, the woman is tasked with deceiving you into thinking she is the man.", "Turing continued the question to say, instead of a man or woman, what if a machine was one of the two \u2018people\u2019 being questioned. Could the interrogator correctly identity who was the human? And if the machine was able to trick the interrogator into answering the question, is the machine thinking just as a person?", "simply put \u2014 \u201cCan machines think?\u201d", "Today, we spend a good part of our day talking to people online, through text, twitter DMs, and email. Rarely do we doubt that the person on the other end of the message understands us when we talk. Further, if I call to get haircut later this week, I don\u2019t wonder if the person on the other end of the line is a person\u2026 until now.", "What if that person isn\u2019t a person at all, but a chat bot or the google assistant? If the chat bot responds intelligently it would follow that they are intelligent and I would be none the wiser assuming that they are a person. The google assistant understands me, and that I want a haircut Thursday, but I also have an opening Friday (because there is nothing scheduled on my google calendar). So if the barber shop is booked Thursday, Friday is a good alternative.", "It\u2019s 2019, has a machine passed the Turing Test?", "Yes \u2014 depending on how you frame the test.", "This 55 second call was over fifty years in the making, starting with Turing\u2019s paper and continuing with Natural Language Processing (NLP) programs such as ELIZA and A.L.I.C.E. (winner of The Loebner Prize). Passing the Turing Test is akin to answering Turing\u2019s question \u201cCan machines think?\u201d with a yes. But, is this a claim we can actually make? Is all intelligence is appearing intelligent on an online chat or phone call? Does A.L.I.C.E. think or feel about the responses to my questions?", "To test this let\u2019s take another example.", "Imagine that a native English speaker who knows no Chinese is locked in a room full of boxes containing Chinese symbols (a database) together with a book of instructions for manipulating the symbols (the program). Imagine that people outside the room send in other Chinese symbols which, unknown to the person in the room, are questions in Chinese (the input). By following the instructions in the book, the person in the room is able to pass out Chinese symbols (the output) which are the correct answers to the questions. This person passes the Turing Test without understanding a word of Chinese.", "In other words, while the google assistant can give you the right responses, the assistant doesn\u2019t understand those responses in a meaningful way; it just makes a calendar event.", "John Searle published this argument in 1980, leading him to make the distinct between strong and weak AI. Strong AI is the claim that computers have mental capabilities and are not only able to understand games such as chess, but natural language. Weak AI is the claim that computers simulate mental abilities, allowing us to use them in psychology, linguistics, and chess training software, but there is no understanding. The narrow argument follows as", "Turing gave two examples of how a machine could \u201clearn\u201d in his 1950 paper. The first: teaching a machine to play chess, which is an abstract activity with explicit rules. The second: to \u201cprovide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and they teach it to understand and speak English\u201d, which would be more akin to teaching a child.", "Researchers at Facebook and Georgia Institute of Technology took the scheduling abilities of the google assistant one step further, to see if AI can not only converse, but negotiate. They started with a dataset of 5808 semi-cooperative dialogues to train a recurrent neural network, which imitates human actions.", "For the sake of brevity, here are some key points from the paper worth considering", "Instead of just looking at a large groups of text for statistical patterns as seen in natural language processing, Open AI researched agents developing their own language to communicate with. There are several motivating factors for this.", "Going back to the Turing Test, when does \u201csomeone\u201d understand language, when they respond appropriately in the context of conversation. Language is a functional tool we use that has added layers of semantic meaning. In the case of Open AI\u2019s research, they look to grounded compositional language to achieve understanding.", "\u201cCompositional\u201d language is the idea that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents. \u201cGrounded\u201d refers to that language based on experience. Without physically seeing (experiencing) \u2018red\u2019 one can\u2019t grasp what \u2018red\u2019 is.", "How does that apply to agents in Open AI\u2019s research? The agents are grounded in the two-dimensional space and build a sentence of varying length (dependent on the task) to carry out tasks in a group or multi-agent setting.", "Each agent was given a goal, whether to go from location A to B or to encourage a different agent to move to a specific location. None of the symbols used by the agents had a meaning before they began the task. The agents created the meaning of the symbols based on the task and environment. Also, another key factor is that the agents are rewarded cooperatively rather than competitively. This is where we see abstract compositional language emerge, agents working together with language without any exposure to human language use.", "This is to say that one day the computer that books your hair appointments just might be able to talk to you and to understand you\u2026", "\u201cWe can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done\u201d", "Your home for data science.
