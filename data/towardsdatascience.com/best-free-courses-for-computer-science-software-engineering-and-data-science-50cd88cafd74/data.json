Lots of their undergraduate and graduate-level course materials are for the students around the globe to use for free. I am going to talk about some of the resources here. I know there are so many very bright and talented students in the different parts of the world who cannot go to all those great schools. But they have the potential to learn. In the tech industry, you can get a job even in Google, without a tech degree. Only the knowledge matters. If you are interested to put the time and effort, you can become a tech giant even if you cannot go to a big school. Here are the resources.", "You will be amazed to know that you almost can get the course materials of all the undergraduate and graduate-level computer science courses free. You will find courses from all the areas of computer science including:", "introduction to computer science and electrical engineering,", "Here is the link for their free courses page.", "This is a huge piece of gold if you are looking to learn online in any tech field and also other fields. I am only focusing on tech learning. You can take high-quality courses from big-name universities for free.", "Search for your interest area in the search bar. You can audit the courses or pay to get a certificate. If you audit the courses, you will be able to learn but won\u2019t get a certificate. If you go to the course from the catalog page, a lot of courses will say an amount per month or audit for free.", "To find the audit option, click on the \u2018Take Course\u2019 button. On this page, there is the audit option.", "Another huge resource. There is a big pool of courses from all the well-known universities and well-known professors. You can learn almost all the areas I mentioned in the edx section. You just have choices. Try both edx and Coursera. Choose which works best for you.", "In Coursera also, you can pay to get a certificate or audit the course to learn only. But finding the audit option is a bit trickier here. I am explaining here.", "In the course description page, you will see the \u2018Enroll\u2019 option. But do not enroll from there. It will give only 7 days for free. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. You will find another \u2018Enroll\u2019 option. Click on that. A window will pop up. At the bottom of that window, you will see a small audit option. That\u2019s what you are looking for.", "You will find great quality free courses of any trending programming languages such as:", "All the trending frameworks such as:", "SQL, and No SQL databases, and much more.", "Code academy also has a very good set of courses. It is especially good for beginners. It has an inbuilt IDE where you can write your code and feedback right away. So in the beginning you even do not need to set up your own IDE. Courses are free. But you can get a subscription for $20 a month to get help from their mentors.", "Harvard also gives a lot of their courses for free. This is the course catalog:", "On this page, you will find some courses marked as free and some other paid courses. You can audit the free courses, in the same way, I explained in the edx section above. All the Harvard free courses are available in edx.", "There are a lot of other free resources as well. I am mentioning a few here.", "Udacity has a lot of nano degrees that are paid. Nt they have some good free courses as well. Those free courses are not expert level courses. They usually beginner level courses. Here is their course catalog. Search for free courses in the search bar.", "Udemy also has a lot of free courses. But not necessarily they are beginner level. Sometimes you may find good courses for free. They also keep giving discounts year-round.", "I am sure, you agree after seeing all the free resources that it is not necessary to pay to learn programming or computer science now. The only problem is, it can be hard to focus and stay motivated to keep learning alone at home. If you can find a friend who wants to learn with you that is best.
