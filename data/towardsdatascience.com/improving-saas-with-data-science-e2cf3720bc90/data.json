This 10-month project is focused on helping their sales team improve on customer expansion and retention strategies. Before I start diving into the details, take a look at what I will cover on this blog:", "SaaS stands for Software as a Service. It means that a vendor provides customers cloud-based services (i.e., hosting/maintaining servers, databases and code that make up an application) over the internet. Software Advice, a Gartner company that is one of the leaders in software services, explains that one of the biggest advantages of SaaS is that it allows customers to consume software without having to worry about hardware and infrastructure costs. It is also more secure, data-wise, and it allows for customization.", "Another important advantage of using SaaS is the pricing model. Rather than paying for software licenses, maintenance and support fees with on-premise software, customers who choose SaaS usually pay an annual or monthly subscription fee that will cover all of their needs.", "Customers pay SaaS vendors on a monthly or annual basis. Acquiring customers is expensive for such SaaS companies, so they will have to invest in their customers and wait a while before recovering any profits from that initial cost. Serial entrepreneur and author of Forbes #2 Best Websites for Entrepreneurs, David Skok, illustrates this concept with a simple example of customer cash flow. Imagine you spent $6,000 to acquire a new customer who is paying you $500 on a monthly basis. It will take 2 years before you see any profit from this customer:", "As we can see from the charts above, the initial investment shows positive results after some time. In other words, the business starts creating positive cash flow after a certain point in time. And the more the merrier! If one customer leads to success, then acquiring more customers and growing the acquisition rate will lead to a deeper curve of positive cash flow:", "We have seen that acquiring customers is expensive, but eventually that investment is worth it. That is, in SaaS business the revenue is generated over a long period of time, which is the customer\u2019s lifetime:", "\u201cIf a customer is happy with the service, they will stick around for a long time, and the profit that can be made from that customer will increase considerably. On the other hand if a customer is unhappy, they will churn quickly, and the business will likely lose money on the investment that they made to acquire that customer.\u201d \u2014 David Skok", "This is all related to subscriptions because:", "We will not focus on the customer acquisition part today, but in keeping the customers happy.", "You already know that we are the UC Davis MSBA practicum team working with a SaaS business, but who are we working with from their company?", "Since we care about generating more revenue, it is no surprise that we are working with their Sales & Operations team. However, we also care about keeping customers happy and, luckily for us, this company has an entire team dedicated to this goal, the Customer Success Team. They have been super helpful in providing lots of interesting data that combine customer usage data (from the company\u2019s platform) as well as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) information.", "Ok, now moving on to the fun part!", "Our practicum project aims to find key characteristics of customers that indicate whether that customer is ready to increase their business with the SaaS company or if that customer is about to churn. We will perform customer segmentation analysis as well as customer churn analysis to identify ways for this SaaS business to expand their revenue. The models will help the company transition from traditional intuition-based decisions to data-based decisions, and to re-define customer health metrics that can improve their customer strategies over the next few years.", "Our goal for the segmentation analysis is to expand business with current customers. In order to do this we will look at:", "The idea is to see what are the typical behaviors of different types of customers (big fish, casual customers, very active customers, etc.) In order to classify customers based on these metrics, we plan to perform K-means clustering. This is an unsupervised learning algorithm in which we will attempt to find homogeneous subgroups among the observations. Machine Learning expert and StatQuest founder, Josh Starmer (who is also a pretty good singer!) explains K-means clustering very nicely in this video.", "We will also utilize crucial SaaS metrics, such as the following, which are detailed on this useful cheat sheet created by B2B software leader Joel York:", "From using these metrics and many more from York\u2019s cheat sheet, we expect the data to tell us a story.", "Churn analysis seems very promising and we are super excited to begin this part of the analysis! A lot of studies have been done on this topic so there is a lot of material out there. One really cool example is Zuora\u2019s Chief Data Scientist Carl Gold\u2019s blog on Fighting Churn with Data. One reassuring concept that we learned about was that one of the ways to prevent churn is by having Customer Success teams. Gold explains that \u201cCustomer Success and Support Representatives prevent churn by making sure customers adopt a product and help them if they can\u2019t.\u201d If you remember from the \u201cWho is involved in this project?\u201d section above, we are lucky to be working with a Customer Success team that is guiding us towards understanding better the customer behavior and business insights. Rather than just throwing data at us, they are making an effort to actually work with us throughout the project.", "These are some of the approaches we are ready to try out in order to improve customer retention:", "There are so many tools and approaches that we could take for this section that it could be its own blog! The good news is that we have our data ready to go, great examples such as this tutorial, and a lot of time (after midterms) to tackle this challenge.", "Following the steps of a Data Science workflow in our project, we have gathered a robust understanding of our business problem, we have revised the data and prepared it for analysis, and we are about to start the modeling phase. Throughout the process, we will check in with the Sales & Operations and Customer Success teams to ensure our analysis is moving in the right direction.", "Stay tuned to see what interesting insights we find!", "Your home for data science.
