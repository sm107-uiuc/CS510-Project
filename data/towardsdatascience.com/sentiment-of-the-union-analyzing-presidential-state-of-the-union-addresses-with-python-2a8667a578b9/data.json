In this article, we\u2019ll adopt a data-driven approach in Python and leverage tools like sentiment analysis to better understand the development of these speeches over time.", "In a series of python notebooks, I\u2019ve looked at sentiment values of the different speeches, performed topic modeling, created WordClouds, and finally constructed a rudimentary measure of \u201chow much is being said\u201d by looking at the entropy values of each speech.", "Sentiment Analysis is a popular tool in Natural Language Processing that helps form a better understanding and analysis of a text by understanding the opinions expressed by it. Since we\u2019re considering a few different methods here, we won\u2019t dive too deep. First, we\u2019ll consider a simple representation of each speech\u2019s sentiment (\u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d) denoted by a single number, then see if topic modeling can help us derive any further insights.", "Before diving in, let\u2019s consider what we might expect from the addresses we\u2019re about to analyze. When Washington gave the first State of the Union Address in 1790, the scrutiny on him as the first POTUS caused him to take a cautious and deferential tone, making recommendations as opposed to the calls for action that we would have seen from George W Bush after 9/11. As a result, we might expect the sentiment value of Washington\u2019s addresses to be relatively \u201cneutral\u201d (without assigning a numerical value to it).", "That\u2019s enough speculation. Let\u2019s look at our results. I\u2019ve graphed the sentiment values produced by the first notebook below:", "You\u2019ll notice a spike near the right side of the graph that sticks out like a sore thumb \u2014 that\u2019s the 1981 State of the Union Address given by President Jimmy Carter. If we were to ignore this piece of data, the sentiment values of the rest of the addresses would appear to be much more closely related. Regardless, we\u2019ll take a look at this particular address when we begin to look at changes in sentiment over individual presidencies.", "Let\u2019s push a little bit further \u2014 since we know the sentiment values for speeches given by each individual president, we can look at the change in sentiment from their first to their last State of the Union address. Perhaps this will have some correlation with the success of their presidency.", "Running the numbers, we have the following observations:", "Beginning his presidency during a year of stagflation, it might make sense that if Carter succeeded in curbing the phenomenon then there would be a marked increase in the sentiment expressed in his addresses. Interestingly, Carter\u2019s last fifteen months as president were marred by crises including the Iran hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while Carter himself is usually evaluated as a below-average president.", "On a similarly interesting note, despite the agreement that Polk was a generally successful (although often overlooked president), the change in sentiment for his speeches was roughly 7. At the same time, it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to imagine that a president such as Polk would adopt a measured tone in giving speeches. At the other end, our sentiment model might be picking up on positive and hopeful statements from Carter\u2019s 1981 speech such as in the paragraph below:", "\u201c However, I firmly believe that, as a result of the progress made in so many domestic and international areas over the past four years, our Nation is stronger, wealthier, more compassionate and freer than it was four years ago. I am proud of that fact. And I believe the Congress should be proud as well, for so much of what has been accomplished over the past four years has been due to the hard work, insights and cooperation of Congress. I applaud the Congress for its efforts and its achievements.\u201d", "The language itself isn\u2019t anomalous, but the overall length of Carter\u2019s address, combined with the decidedly hopeful and positive language, would certainly have contributed to the score our model gave the speech. While Carter did not avoid mentioning difficulties, the intention of his speech was to paint a portrait of four years of progress. It would be natural that Carter wanted to sum up what he saw as the defining achievements of his administration and set a positive note for the future. This resulted in a more long-winded and hopeful speech than usual.", "In the second notebook, I performed topic modeling, a type of statistical modeling that helps us discover the abstract topics that appear in documents and texts. I used two models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) on a subset of the speeches, holding out the last two addresses given by Trump.", "For those looking for technical explanations of the two models, you can find a nice explanation of LDA and LSI in Edward Ma\u2019s article. Here, I\u2019ll primarily focus on what they can tell us about the speeches we\u2019re interested in. The LDA model gave us the following topic clusters (the output of the LSI model can be found in notebook 2):", "If we go past the words that are pretty clearly ubiquitous across all topics (\u201cunited\u201d, \u201cstates\u201d, \u201ccongress\u201d, \u201cyear\u201d), then what the topics can do is give us some insight into the type of language used during the speeches. Unfortunately, it\u2019s worth noting that the model doesn\u2019t give us much in the way of topics that integrate policy-specific language like \u201cagriculture\u201d or \u201crelations\u201d. On the other hand, words like \u201cmust\u201d, \u201cgreat\u201d, and \u201cpeople\u201d can tell us something more about the tone of the speeches, and how they have historically been used both as updates and as calls to action, drawing on Americans\u2019 strong sense of pride for their country.", "In the next part of our exploration, we\u2019ll try to construct a (very) rudimentary measure of \u201chow much the president is saying\u201d by calculating the entropy of each address individually. In information theory, entropy is defined to be the average rate at which information is produced by a stochastic (random) source of data. In this context, the entropy expresses our expectation of the information content of a speech, or how much uncertainty it resolves.", "For our purposes, we can think of the entropy measure as how concise the text is. The higher the entropy of a speech, the less concise it is and therefore the more it is \u201csaying\u201d. We\u2019ll use this thinking as a starting point and go from there. Below is a graph of the entropy of each speech, beginning from Washington\u2019s and ending at Trump\u2019s:", "Without going too deep, it\u2019s worth noting that on average, the entropy values seem to increase as time goes on with a fair number of dips. However, the values travel down significantly enough that we would probably be amiss saying that entropy has increased significantly from earlier to later speeches. One characteristic of higher-entropy speeches was longer length, but some further exploration in this notebook shows that this doesn\u2019t explain the whole picture. If you\u2019re interested in seeing some further analysis and perhaps taking this forward yourself, please check out the notebook entitled \u201cEntropy\u201d.", "In the final step of exploration, I generated a few WordClouds to visualize the following:", "If we consider the WordCloud of all addresses, we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that the most prominent words are the most general and widely applicable to the American people: \u201camerican\u201d, \u201camerica\u201d, \u201cnation\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d are featured. Words we saw in our topic modeling such as must\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d also make an appearance.", "At the same time, while they are given less precedence, topics that have both prompted lots of debate in recent years that also have historical roots also show up \u2014 these include \u201cdrug\u201d, \u201cimmigration\u201d, and \u201cterrorist\u201d.", "Next, we\u2019ll look at the ten oldest and ten newest addresses.", "Comparing the oldest to the newest addresses, there are some notable changes. In the WordCloud for the newest speeches, \u201cunited states\u201d is dropped almost entirely, while the words \u201cmust\u201d, \u201cgreat\u201d, and \u201ccountry\u201d make a far larger appearance than they did previously. The words \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201cstate\u201d also disappear, indicating some interesting rhetorical shifts in the speeches of early to contemporary presidents.", "If we remember from earlier the precarious nature of the presidency in its first few years, it makes sense that calls to action would be much more the norm in today\u2019s world than they ever were at that time \u2014 further, contemporary discourse has sparked a fair amount of rhetoric drawing on Americans\u2019 sense of pride, explaining the word \u201cgreat\u201d. The disappearance of words like \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201cstate\u201d might mark a transition away from more theoretical discourse about the function of a nation-state that the Founding Fathers considered so deeply.", "Finally, let\u2019s compare WordClouds of the State of the Union Addresses given by our two most recent presidents: Barack Obama and Donald Trump.", "Of note are the larger presence in Obama\u2019s cloud of the words \u201cus\u201d, \u201cmake\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d, \u201chelp\u201d, \u201cjob\u201d, and \u201cevery\u201d. Trump\u2019s cloud features the words \u201camerica\u201d and \u201cnation\u201d, as well as \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201ccountry\u201d with greater emphasis. We can also spot the word \u201cdrug\u201d with some ease, although we can\u2019t in Obama\u2019s cloud. While some of the largest words are generic, the differences between the two clouds and the rhetorical suggestions they imply indicate differences in Obama\u2019s and Trump\u2019s interests and policies.", "Obama\u2019s streak as a proponent for positive change and a politician who often used speeches (as he did in his campaign) to engender a sense of community among his listeners explains the presence of words like \u201cus\u201d and \u201cevery\u201d, while his domestic healthcare policy and focus on that might explain words like \u201chelp\u201d. The words we noted in Trump\u2019s clouds are reflective of the considerable doses of nationalism present in his speeches. The dominating size of the word \u201cwill\u201d in both clouds suggests promises from both presidents.", "As a recap, we\u2019ve analyzed the texts of the State of the Union Addresses given by presidents since George Washington, first using a basic sentiment measure to look at the positivity and negativity in speeches and the shifts in these values for each president. We then considered topic modeling to see if we could draw inferences about topics of interest in State of the Union Addresses. Next, we considered entropy as a measure of compressibility and a rudimentary measure of the \u201ccontent\u201d of a speech. Finally, we used WordClouds to look at topics germane to all presidents as expressed in these addresses, and at differences between a few interesting groups and individuals.", "Tools like NLP can help us analyze interesting trends in and develop new insights about historical documents, from speeches to books. The presidential State of the Union addresses are important in the sense that they can tell us about the state of current events throughout American history and paint portraits of optimism and pessimism over time. While helpful, a purely technological analysis of the situation can lead us to potentially misleading conclusions as it did with Roosevelt if we don\u2019t take the time to examine the documents ourselves. As we go forward, we should continue to use tools such as sentiment analysis for the powerful insights they can provide, but remember that when analyzing text and speeches in particular, it\u2019s necessary to take into account numerous contextual and rhetorical factors that models often can\u2019t understand as well as humans can.", "[7] Presidency of Franklin D.
