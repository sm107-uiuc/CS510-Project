Political actors take \u2018positions\u2019 on issues, they perform \u2018U-turns\u2019 and of course they are situated on either the \u2018left wing\u2019, the \u2018right wing\u2019 or the \u2018centre ground\u2019. Such language is not purely academic either, but extends into the lexicon of all politically engaged individuals; be they politicians, journalists or the general public. However, the use of spatial language in a political context is principally hypothetical, \u201cpurely conceptual and impossible to observe physically\u201d (Laver and Benoit, 2012, 195). As such, considerable energy must be devoted by individuals to understand the many variables from which relative political positions are derived.The purpose of this study is to present a physical framework upon which these variables can be used to map the preferences of aggregated groups (such as voting constituencies). To do this I break the rest of the study down into three parts, whilst utilising the UK\u2019s 2019 General Election as context. 1) Firstly I begin by discussing the conceptual notion of political space, thereby providing the colour and context necessary for the endeavour. 2) I then examine and critique the existing methodologies and academic approaches for projecting political space. 3) Finally I explain how principal component analysis (\u201cPCA\u201d) can be used to reduce the many dimensions of political space into an intuitive rendering. In this section I will also demonstrate the merits of PCA by utilising constituency level data from the UK to show how quantitatively bundling correlated variables \u2014 political or otherwise \u2014 can be used to understand which political party each constituency was most likely to support in the General Election and why.", "1) The Conceptual Notion of Political Space", "In political science the conceptual notion of space is given physicality by ordering policy preferences/ political agents along a linear line according to a specific variable (see Figure 1). In doing so a spectrum of similarity is created \u2014 with the Euclidean distance between points representing degrees of difference (Adams et al., 2005, Schofield, 2008). Linear policy spectrums are subsequently the bedrock for many pervasive ideas which dominate not only the academic field of politics, but also its real-world practice: examples being the Downsian notion of \u201cmedian voter theorem\u201d, as well as the \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d wing understanding of political preference.", "Figure 1: Hypothetical One-Dimensional Axis of Policies in UK 2019 General Election", "This simple framework for mapping single variables onto a one-dimensional frame can then be extended to create a multi-dimensional frame for multiple variables. Such a frame can theoretically incorporate a near limitless number of dimensions and therefore presents challenges even at the conceptual level. Subsequently, attempts at literality are usually eschewed in favour of grouping correlated variables (which can either be explicit policy preferences or based upon demographics) into broad themes such as social (liberal to conservative) or economic (free market to state managed) (see Figure 2). Simple categorisation can of course be problematic, for instance in the 2019 General Election opposition to an additional runway at Heathrow could be mapped as liberal/state managed, even whilst being advocated by the Prime Minister: a conservative/free marketeer. However, by using this methodology, political scientists can create parsimonious points of geographic space to place political preferences. These maps are subsequently able to incorporate more information than the simple one-dimensional scale.", "Figure 2: Hypothetical Two-Dimensional Axis of Policies in UK 2019 General Election", "The practical task of rendering political preferences upon a physical space is composed of two parts. The first stage is to estimate the latent dimensions upon which preferences can be plotted, the second is to map the preferences upon these dimensions. In the existing literature, contrasting approaches taken toward the first stage of the process define and differentiate methodological styles. Subsequently, I categorise the approaches to the first stage into two broad groups and examine these. The groups are defined as those which estimate positions upon scales which are defined a priori, and those which estimate positions upon scales which are defined inductively from data.", "Both methods for estimating the dimensions of scales rely upon the conceptual framework discussed in the previous section (dimensions are determined by grouping correlated variables into broad themes). For the a priori estimation of dimensions this means a qualitative approach utilising expert analysts\u2019 prior knowledge to create and scale dimensions. It is generally considered the superior method as the use of prior knowledge greatly reduces the complexity of the task and builds upon hundreds of years of political discourse (Laver and Benoit, 2012, 198). However, the approach can of course be subjected to many of the common critiques levelled against any piece of qualitative research. Primarily this includes problems with regard to replicability, comparability and providing sufficient analysis to larger datasets.", "An obvious example of this issue can be found within the work on the topic by Mcelroy and Benoit (2007). Their work collated expert opinions on European politics and attempted to infer from this a spatial understanding of European parties\u2019 policies. The physical representation was initially built upon a two-dimensional frame, with the same axis as those featured in Figure 2. However, in follow up work the social dimension on the y-axis was substituted for views on EU integration. As a result, the spatial location of political parties completely shifted, meaning the new positions could not be compared against previous iterations, let alone other surveys. Similarly, their use of expert analysis has issues comparable with interview-based research \u2014 there is no guarantee that different experts will utilise the same dimensions as one another, or even that the same experts would produce the same analysis twice. Additionally, whilst their method could be used to map the political parties of the European Union, it would be far too labour intensive to attempt to map all the political constituencies in the European Union \u2014 which is a comparable task to that which I undertake in the final section.", "Meanwhile, for research which has attempted to derive the spatial location inductively, the approach is quite different and far more quantitative in nature. These quantitative approaches are typically based upon identifying latent dimensions through techniques such as factor analysis (I in fact utilise a variant of this approach in the next section). Such methods again scale dimensions in the manner described for the conceptual framework, however in this case the bundles of correlations are explicitly calculated to derive the broad groupings of variables. One extreme example of this approach is by Gabel and Huber (2000), who map the entire Comparative Manifesto Project onto a single dimension \u2014 the left-right wing economic scale.", "The issue with this approach is that by leaving the basic vectors completely open, we are left with positions which are \u201cessentially unverifiable\u201d (Benoit and Laver, 2012, 198). The consequence of this is that the positioning of actors is instead recognised through existing conceptions of policy dimensions and requires expert analysis to derive any insight from the map \u2014 the aforementioned case of Gabel and Huber\u2019s work being an obvious example as it relied upon left/right wing economic scales. Since maps should strive for universal accessibility, such a technique is left wanting. As such, in the next section I propose that by calculating political space inductively, and then deliberately layering existing knowledge on top, we can offer valuable insight about what variables mean with regard to political agents\u2019 policy and party preferences without any significant prior knowledge being required.", "3) Using PCA to create a spatial representation of the political preferences for the constituencies of England and Wales in the UK 2019 General Election", "The task described so far can be understood as a multivariate analysis in which the end goal is to reduce dimensionality. PCA is amongst the inductive tools which we can utilise to achieve this task. It is an appropriate tool since its explicit purpose is the compression of multiple variables in a manner which allows them to be mapped on a two-dimensional graph. The methodology achieves such by analysing the co-linearity (or lack thereof) amongst variables (Figure 3) in the original dataset and converting these into new variables (principal components). The newly created variables can then be plotted with similar groups clustered together and differences shown by distance \u2014 as such the methodology is still recognisable within the traditional conceptual framework of political space.", "The dataset which I have used to perform the analysis consists of a mixture of potentially relevant and potentially non-relevant indicators collected from the UK constituency level database. The purpose of blending relevant and non-relevant variables is that in political science we cannot always know in advance which variables matter. Subsequently, I have incorporated potentially non-relevant variables to disadvantage the model, thereby providing a critical case and more robust example to justify future use of this methodological approach (Hancke, 2009).", "The variables used are as follows (House of Commons Library, 2020):", "\u00b7 Proportion of jobs below minimum wage", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are Women", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are Men", "\u00b7 Proportion of families which own a home", "\u00b7 Proportion of population aged over 65", "\u00b7 Proportion of population aged 35\u201365", "\u00b7 Proportion of population aged 16\u201335", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are white", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are black", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are Asian", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are mixed race", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are other race", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which voted remain", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which voted leave", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are obese", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are depressed", "\u00b7 Proportion of population which are managers", "\u00b7 Median house price to median Income level", "The data is publicly available and linked to in the bibliography. In this research only constituencies in England and Wales have been included. Binary variables such as men/women or leave/remain do not need to both be included in the PCA. However, they have been since the end visualisation can then be more easily understood.", "Figure 3: Correlation Matrix of UK Constituency Level Data", "By using PCA we can create a systematic framework which is easily reproducible and can scale the dimensions and position the variables. Figure 4 shows the initial product of PCA. From this point we can then use prior knowledge to infer that constituencies in the bottom right are likely akin to the top right of the scale shown in Figure 2 (socially conservative and economically liberal). Similarly, we can identify the opposite corner (likely inner-city voters judging by racial diversity and broadband speed) as being socially liberal and economically left wing. Additionally, the axis titles tell us that Euclidean distances across the x-axis account for more variance than across the y-axis (i.e. horizontal distance represents more difference than vertical distance). Therefore between these two clusters is where the greatest possible difference occurs. Unfortunately, as evidenced by this analysis, such a map is best understood through the prism of existing political dimensions and possesses the flaws which I criticised Gabel and Huber\u2019s work for.", "Figure 4: PCA of UK Constituency Level Data", "To increase the explanatory power of methodologies which infer dimensions from data, as well as reduce the need to rely on expert insight, I colour code constituencies by the party which they voted for (Figure 5). Such a practice is not novel, but within political science it has seen little to no application. However, the result of doing so is that we can easily identify the variables most associated with particular political parties and where each constituency sits relative to one another. Therefore we have shown that a quantitative approach can incorporate a large number of variables and create an intuitive map when we layer additional information.", "Figure 5: PCA of UK Constituency Level Data with Party Vote Colour Coded", "Going one step further, we can also identify the seats which Labour lost to the Conservatives in the 2019 General Election (Figure 6). This allows us to see that the seats which Labour lost are associated with 1) an older demographic, 2) voting Leave in the referendum and 3) a high percentage of jobs below minimum wage. Additionally, high proportions of obesity and depression also appear to be associated with this position \u2014 though intuitively we can assume this is related to levels of wealth. There is one notable exception to this trend \u2014 in the bottom left of the map we can see Kensington (the option of identifying individual points is possible but not shown below as it would crowd the visualisation) \u2014 this was a remain seat Labour won in a previous election but then lost in the General Election.", "Interestingly, the map suggests Labour should have courted poorer Leave voters since these seats are far closer to the Conservative cluster of seats than the metropolitan Remainer seats \u2014 although such a statement of course ignores the possibility Labour could have lost seats to third parties. Regardless, we can clearly see that a colour coded PCA offers an effective way to understand the political positioning of actors.", "Figure 6: PCA of UK Constituency Level Data with Vote Switch from Labour to Conservative Colour Coded", "In the above report I have shown how PCA analysis is a tool well aligned to the processes of creating a spatial representation of politics, as defined by the general conceptual understanding which exists in political science. Additionally, I have demonstrated its appropriateness for identifying policy preferences when analysing aggregated groups of voters, and that colour coding creates an easily interpretable map. In doing the above I have also presented novel insights into the UK 2019 General Election, as well as a method for creating political strategies with application to the real world. Further research into this area may wish to attempt similar approaches with methods such as t-SNE plots and multi-dimensional scaling and compare results. Geographically weighted PCA, to account for spatial heterogeneity in the data, also warrants further investigation.", "Adams JF, Merrill S and Grofman B (2005) A Unified Theory of Party Competition: A Cross-National Analysis Integrating Spatial and Behavioral Factors.
