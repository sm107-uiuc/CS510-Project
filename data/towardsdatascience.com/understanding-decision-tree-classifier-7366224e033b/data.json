Decision Trees are also used in tandem when you are building a Random Forest classifier which is a culmination of multiple Decision Trees working together to classify a record based on majority vote.", "A Decision Tree is constructed by asking a series of questions with respect to a record of the dataset we have got. Each time an answer is received, a follow-up question is asked until a conclusion about the class label of the record. The series of questions and their possible answers can be organised in the form of a decision tree, which is a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes and directed edges. A tree has three types of nodes:", "In a decision tree, each leaf node is assigned a class label. The non-terminal nodes, which include the root and other internal nodes, contain attribute test conditions to separate records that have different characteristics.", "Let us construct a Decision Tree intuitively given a dataset before diving into the mathematics of it.", "When we examine this dataset, we see:", "To construct our decision tree intuitively given this dataset, we begin with the target attribute Defaulted Borrower", "The above-mentioned steps might be digestible in a single reading, I encourage you to read it again and have a look at the figure below to understand how the steps proceeded.", "The above tree induction comes packaged with a couple of issues that need to adhered of while building a decision tree.", "\u2192 How should the training records be split?", "For every recursive step of the tree growing process, there must be selected an attribute test condition to further divide the records into smaller subsets.", "\u2192 How should the splitting procedure stop?", "Continue expanding the node until either all the records belong to the same class or all the records have identical attribute values.", "Decision tree induction algorithms must provide a method for expressing an attribute test condition and its corresponding outcomes for different attribute types.", "Note: The attribute values can be grouped together as long as grouping does not violate the order property of attribute values.", "The measures developed for selecting the best split are often based on the degree of impurity of child nodes. The smaller the impurity, the more skewed the class distribution.", "Example: A node with class distribution (0, 1) has zero impurity whereas a node with uniform class distribution (0.5, 0.5) has the highest impurity.", "D = training set, where v belongs to D and is a tree node,", "Let us understand the above impurity measures with some examples:", "\u2192 To determine how well a test condition performs, we need to compare the degree of impurity of the parent node (before splitting) with the degree of impurity of the child nodes (after splitting).

There are two strategies for overcoming this problem. The first strategy is to restrict the test conditions to binary splits only. This strategy is employed by decision tree algorithms such as CART. Another strategy is to modify the splitting criterion to take into account the number of outcomes produced by the attribute test condition. For example, in the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, a splitting criterion known as gain ratio is used to deterrnine the goodness of a split. This criterion is defined as follows:", "Let us try to understand this algorithm in practice with a sample dataset.
