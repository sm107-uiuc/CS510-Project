Our basic human physiology has evolved from our primal ancestor\u2019s sight capacity to the current level of perception detection and analysis we have today.", "The phrase \u2018motion analysis\u2019 is self-descriptive; in layman terms, it\u2019s generating an understanding of how an object moves within an environment.", "But let\u2019s describe motion analysis with more technical terms", "Motion analysis is the study of locomotion and trajectory of objects bodies.", "Now we have an overview of what motion analysis is, but where is it used?", "Motion analysis can be applied in various industries and disciplines. In medicinal related institutions, motion analysis is used as a non-intrusive method of observing the movement of patients with mobility impairments.", "In video surveillance, motion analysis is utilized in video tracking and facial recognition.", "Motion analysis is an overarching task that can be broken down into many components.", "Each of the mentioned components is a noteworthy field that requires another medium article. Several research efforts have gone into the exploration of methodologies of solving each component efficiently.", "I won\u2019t go into too many details, but I will provide a necessary explanation of some components: Object detection, motion detection, and pose estimation. This article will mainly touch on how they relate to motion analysis, and finally, how machine learning is utilized within them.", "The keyword here is \u2018Detection\u2019. To be able to understand and conduct analyses of a body, we first have to detect the body within the digital content (sequence of images) provided for analysis.", "Let\u2019s provide a proper definition of Object Detection:", "Object detection as a computer vision task is defined as recognizing the presence of an object of interest from a specific class in images or sequential images (videos).", "The task of object detection usually involves illustrating bounding boxes around the instances of the object of interest and recognizing the class the detected object belongs to. In specific scenarios, we are focused on identifying one object within an image; in some other cases, we are interested in multiple objects for detection.", "There are several examples of scenarios where the Object detection application flourishes, such as visual search engines, face detection, action detection, ariel image analysis, pedestrian detection, and gesture recognition", "Commonly, using Machine Learning techniques, there are two main approaches to Object Detection implementation, the first being designing and training a network architecture from scratch, including the structure of layers and the initialization of weight parameter values, etc.", "The second approach is to utilize the concept of Transfer Learning and leverage a pre-trained network that\u2019s trained on a large dataset before the onset of your training on a custom dataset.", "This second approach eliminates the lengthy time disadvantages accompanied by the first-mentioned approach, which is that the time taken to train a network from scratch is far more considerable and will require more effort when compared to adopting a pre-trained network.", "Let\u2019s take a step back and observe Object detection as a computer vision task and its development over the years. Before the introduction of convolutional neural networks to the solving of Object detection, traditional machine learning techniques were leveraged to identify objects in images.", "Methods such as Histograms of Oriented Gradients(HOG) introduced around 2005 used a combination HOG/SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature transformation) to identify interest points within images based on normalized local histograms of image gradients.", "The result is to generate a HOG descriptor that is affine invariant and used in a detection chain that introduces an SVM(Support vector machine) to detect objects of interest-based on the HOG descriptors. This technique worked relatively well for general detection scenarios such as pedestrian detection and produced perfect results when evaluated against the MIT pedestrian database.", "It should be noted that Object detection can be further broken down to Object segmentation. Object segmentation algorithms and techniques produce as outputs highlighted pixels of object presence as opposed to bounding boxes; an example of the methods used for Object Segmentation is presented in the link below:", "A quick note on motion detection.", "Motion Detection is the process whereby an image containing a moving object is subject to image processing techniques that enable the tracking of motion through either differential methods or background segmentation, in which the moving aspects within the images are extracted by discarding the motionless parts of the images to isolate the moving part.", "This technique is mostly dependent on the observation of the intensity of pixels in an image to determine if the pixel belongs to a background class or not. By identifying the progression of the intensity of pixels between frames or pictures, a deduction of motion can be drawn where there is a notable change in intensity.", "Motion detection is a fundamental aspect of motion analysis because detection of motion is required to determine what and where to conduct analysis upon.", "More importantly, computer vision and machine learning techniques have reduced the requirements of motion detection from hardware monitoring devices within a controlled environment to state of the art algorithm that only requires a camera to conduct detection and further analysis.", "Pose estimation is the process where the position and orientation of the vital body parts and joints of a body are derived from an image or sequence of images.", "The output of pose estimation is a 2D or 3D rigid representation of the configuration of the pose of the body within the image(s). The output of a pose estimation solution-based application for motion analysis is generally an image that is generated by the algorithm that depicts in some form or manner the location of the significant body parts and joints of subjects of interest within the original image", "Pose estimation has developed within computer vision and become a prominent field in its own right. The relationship of pose estimation with other areas of study within computer vision and machine learning, such as Object detection, tracking, and motion analysis as encouraged the development of various techniques to solve pose estimation.", "I am going to get a bit technical.", "Earlier methods devised to solve pose estimation presented techniques that were either based on components or implemented modular solutions. Some solutions initially separated a silhouette of a human from images with still background, and then estimate the position of the joints and limbs.", "Other solutions proposed techniques that were also stage based solution that involves the detection and extraction of 2D figures representational of the humans in a video sequence or sequence of images and then goes on to generate a 3D pose estimation based on the 2D figures and tracklets.", "In my opinion, I have barely scratched the surface of this topic, but at least if you have made it this far, you have gained some understanding of motion analysis and its sub-components.", "In future articles, I will take a deep dive into some of the components of motion analysis mentioned and include some code as to how they can be implemented for practical usage.", "If you enjoy informative articles such as this, feel free to follow me and be updated once I release similar articles in the future.", "Your home for data science.
