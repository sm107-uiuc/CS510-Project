As a result, full-cycle data science projects that involve these stages will be more valuable since they prove the author\u2019s abilities to work independently with real data, as opposed to a given cleaned dataset.", "Fully understanding the value of an end-to-end data science project, I always wanted to build one but not able to, until now :)", "I have recently finished my Ideal Profiles project. Since it\u2019s a major project that involves many moving parts, I want to document the process and the lessons learned, which is a further learning opportunity (inspired by William Koehrsen\u2019s great post on the value of data science writing).", "In my opinion, a full-cycle data science project should include the following stages:", "The biggest counter-argument for working on a Kaggle project is often that it\u2019s only focused on the second stage. Therefore, in this project, I made sure that all three stages are covered.", "For the first stage, I did web scraping to get the data and since the data was dirty, I had to wrangle to make the data ready for analysis. Then I made various data visualizations and performed analyses as stage two. Lastly, I wrote posts to communicate findings and launch this project into production.", "Of course, I could have made this project even more complete by including a machine learning component, e.g. using NLP to classify job postings based on contents, but that will delay the project completion time significantly which brings us to the next point:", "Potentially, there can be an unlimited number of things to work on for a given project, but in reality, we only have limited time. To coordinate these two competing factors, we need to be disciplined.", "For me, \u201citerative thinking\u201d really helped \u2014 look, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, so let\u2019s build something that works and ship it first, and then we can always come back to improve with more features. On the other hand, this also means we need to be able to deal with \u201cnon-perfectness\u201d and not get fixated on details.", "With this philosophy in mind, I was able to delay some very tempting features and put them in the To-do\u2019s section of the project doc. One of them was to use a larger dataset by scraping data from Indeed USA instead of the Canadian site.", "Given the end-to-end nature of the project, there were many different aspects to work on \u2014 web scraping, data preprocessing, plotting\u2026If we put all codes in one Jupyter Notebook, it\u2019ll be too long and too complex to manage. I then decided to use Python scripts combined with a central Jupyter Notebook to solve this problem.", "I divided supporting functions into three big categories and housed them in three corresponding scripts:", "This way, I was able to maintain a super light and organized central Notebook. Functions are then imported and called from the Notebook as needed like this:", "As many of the scraping scripts I found online didn\u2019t work, I was determined to make sure that my project is reproducible. Aside from solid code, a robust README document and a complete environment dependency file were also part of the solution.", "Good coding practice does matter! In particular, I found the following practices incredibly useful in coding larger and more complex projects:", "These things may seem trivial when you have a project that is a 30-line Jupyter Notebook, but can really be critical when dealing with a major project that needs hundreds of lines of code!", "I used to feel comfortable with just basic Matplotlib skills. However, for this project, I not only needed to combine several plots into one but also had to do detailed customization such as rotating axis tick labels\u2026at that point, basic Matplotlib skills simply won\u2019t suffice anymore.", "It actually turned out to be a great opportunity to learn Matplotlib. Once I learned what it can do, I found it impossible to look back, simply because, Matplotlib is really powerful! Its object-oriented approach allows you to modify almost anything\u2026Check out the below tutorials to find out:", "That\u2019s all, the final blog post about the Ideal Profiles project I recently completed. You can find the other two articles here and here.", "What\u2019s your thought? Anything I missed or I could improve on? Please feel free to comment below.
