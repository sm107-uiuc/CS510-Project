existing ones. In this process, a lot of data is collected and generated which needs to be processed. The aim of this post is to share some techniques from data science for the clinical setting. Furthermore, a case study is presented which has also been published in a scientific journal. Note that most mentioned aspects are certainly not limited to the clinical world and can be encountered elsewhere as well.", "First, let\u2019s share some definitions of expressions that are often used in clinical studies (taken from Wikipedia).", "Biomarker: A measurable indicator of some biological state or condition. Biomarkers are often measured and evaluated to examine normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.", "Primary outcome: A clinical endpoint that provides evidence sufficient to fully characterize clinically the effect of a treatment in a manner that would support a regulatory claim for the treatment. It is important that primary outcomes are \u201chard\u201d, i.e. measurable and well-defined criteria, e.g. death within 30 days after intervention or remission (reduction or disappearance of the signs and symptoms of a disease).", "Secondary outcome: Additional clinical characterization of a treatment but could not, by itself, be convincing of a clinically significant treatment effect. Secondary outcomes are correlated with primary outcomes and support the success of a study. They can be \u201csoft\u201d, e.g. a patient\u2019s perceived pain on a scale from one to five.", "Surrogate endpoint: A measure of effect of a specific treatment that may correlate with a real clinical endpoint but does not necessarily have a guaranteed relationship. The National Institutes of Health (USA) defines surrogate endpoint as \u201ca biomarker intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint\u201d.", "Generally, demographic attributes (age, sex, race), biomarkers (hemoglobin, heart rate, leukocytes), and treatment parameters (dose, frequency) are the features (independent variables) and the outcomes/endpoints are the outputs (dependent variables).", "The question whether (and how) it is allowed to work with patient data arises frequently, so it might be helpful to make some comments concerning the so-called Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The way clinical trials work is that a sponsor (e.g. a pharma company) writes a proposal on what the trial/study is about, which then has to be approved by some ethics committee. Once the sponsor has permission to conduct the study, investigators (e.g. physicians in a hospital) can start to recruit patients for the clinical trial. (Note that there is the possibility to be a sponsor-investigator, which is the case for research groups at hospitals.) The physicians have to inform their patients in detail about the study, its benefits for the society, but also some potential risks. They are not permitted to pay them for their participation, but those who participate can be compensated in some other way. Patients who sign the informed consent form agree on participating and providing their data, and these \u201csubjects\u201d receive then a patient identification number. The dictionary that maps firstname/lastname to patient identification number has to be stored safely. The patients will be examined by study nurses and physicians, who will collect the data and store it in a database. Note that these patients might visit the hospital only once or several times (longitudinal studies), and they are allowed to leave the study whenever they want. The data collection process is very expensive, since this data is generated by experiments. Furthermore, as the participation potentially stresses the patients, the investigators have to make sure that the data they generate/collect is of high quality.", "Once there has been collect enough data from a cohort, one can start to analyze. Before talking about the data science approach and its challenges, it should be stated how analyses are usually performed in epidemiological studies.", "Let\u2019s assume the research is conducted in pneumology, and the group wants to investigate the influence of \u201csports\u201d on lung functionality, i.e. whether sports (e.g. time per week spent on endurance sports) makes the lung \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d. Lung function is determined by spirometry and provides the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), which will be defined as outcome. Since it is a continuous variable, some regression will be performed, which will be likely linear. A subset of the cohort will be sampled, e.g. those who have no missing values/outliers in certain features, or those patients that are within some range of output values (and one will draw a flow chart of which patients are included in the model so that it is clear for whom it is valid); the population is then very well-defined. Next, the physician(s) will explain which other effects have to be included in the model to correct for changes of FEV1 (i.e. already known effects). For example, someone that smokes/has asthma/is exposed to environmental pollution will have a lower FEV1 compared to someone that does not smoke/has no asthma/is not exposed to pollution. A (linear) regression (with these few normalized continuous and categorical variables) will be performed, and the coefficients will be compared according to their magnitudes (and signs) to discuss the relative influences.", "Alternatively, there are two subgroups, e.g. those with less than two hours physical examination and those with more than that. Each subgroup has a mean and standard error in terms of measured FEV1, and a Student\u2019s t-test/Mann-Whitney U test is performed and it is checked whether the p-value is below 0.05 (corresponding to a 95% confidence interval). If so, the result is said to be statistically significant, i.e. there is an influence.", "These are some standard methods from (bio)statistics. One could be surprised by the fact that variables are selected in advance because of the fact that the unexpected can not be found in this manner as it is never known (completely) which variables to include in the set for outcome \u201ccorrection\u201d. However, it is not yet common practice to collect many biomarkers. On one hand, this is slowly changing, and it is discussed to collect data more systematically. On the other hand, there is the desire to apply machine learning methods in cases where a lot of data has been collected.", "In contrast to the classical approach, in which everything is well-defined and preselected, the data science approach is more open. The formulated question is the same, but all variables are included and the population does not have to be stratified. Let\u2019s look at an example from nephrology. There is this cohort of chronic kidney disease patients, i.e. people whose kidneys stopped working and who need renal replacement therapy (dialysis), and it is observed that some patients die after the initiation of the therapy. It is not fully understood why this happens, i.e. investigating patient mortality is the task. Maybe the treatment process is not yet optimized, maybe it is patient dependent. However, the idea is to develop a model with as few uncorrelated variables as possible while still keeping the model performance. Some data about demographics, treatment parameters, and lab values for each patient is available as a time series (usually, such a question is answered by a survival analysis/Kaplan-Meier estimation).", "Let\u2019s mention some of the problems that one might encounter without talking much about data preprocessing, as there are other articles about it already.", "After a first run of the random forest with a total of 105 variables a long list in descending feature importance is obtained.", "It is very likely that some of those variables are correlated. Furthermore, with decreasing importance, the contribution of a feature to the overall performance is diminishing. One could either set a minimum importance threshold after which features become irrelevant or fix the number of features (and let this determine the threshold) \u2014 both approaches are equivalent \u2014 so the 20 most relevant features are kept in this particular case. In addition, among sets of correlated features (with a threshold above/below of +/- 0.7 in terms of rank correlation), those with higher clinical relevance are retained.", "Furthermore, it is important to remove variables which result from non-uniform sampling (sampling bias). For instance, if many more older than younger patients are part of the cohort, it is difficult to make a statement about the influence of age of patient on death. Maybe younger patients leave the study because they are prioritized in receiving an organ transplant. Such variables have to be carefully examined, as they can lead to false conclusions.", "The final model contains 12 features and predicts with an accuracy of 80%. It is good to compute a ROC curve to demonstrate the performance (another option would be to construct the confusion matrix); in that case, the area under the curve should correspond to the accuracy. The model is better than random guessing since the curve is above the diagonal. Ideally, the model performance should be compared to some gold standard if available, since only then the performance can be really evaluated. If there is no gold standard available yet, even a performance slightly better than random guessing would be sufficient \u2014 theoretically. The models fail to predict some cases, so there might be not enough information to predict all deaths. Alternatively, some of the samples could be totally unrelated to the disease (usually, it should be documented why someone died).", "Another way of representing the two groups (and see how distinguishable they are) is by plotting them by a dimensionality reduction method such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. The size of the points is inverse proportional to the albumin levels as this is the most important feature. A larger point has a higher probability of dying within five years after a first dialysis. We see that fragile patients tend to cluster, and they overlap with robust patients. A possible interpretation is that these robust patients are in danger of dying. It can also be seen that some deaths occur in states which are more similar to the robust state. This could mean that not documented accidents of any kind might be included in the dataset. Furthermore, there are no evident outliers.", "The figure below shows the final list of variables in the model. The relevance of albumin is known since the 1990s, and it demonstrates that the method works. Note that this approach could also be used in biomarker discovery. Although albumin proves to be a good marker in this particular scenario (hemodialysis), it is worth mentioning that it is not a very specific marker of death since it hints on a set of other possible pathologies such as dehydration, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, liver damage, etc.", "It is also of interest to look at the direction in which the effect(s) occur by calculating the partial dependence of features. For albumin, we see that a lower value increases the probability of dying, and this threshold is in agreement with what has been reported before. One could now come up with the idea to provide patients with albumin, but this would only work if this was the root cause of death and not just a symptom. But generally speaking, this would be a way to develop personalized treatments/therapies.", "In the field of clinical research, it is important to work with as much accuracy as possible. Although physicians already face one\u2019s work with a lot of skepticism, one should do this as well. If false conclusions are drawn, one may come up with treatments/procedures which could potentially harm patients. However, if the job is done well, many lives can be saved \u2014 e.g. by creating useful applications to predict a patient\u2019s status.", "Your home for data science.
