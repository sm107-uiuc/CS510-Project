Agents can learn, reason about others, adopt norms, and interact with humans in both virtual and physical settings. This field includes contributions to many areas across artificial intelligence, including game theory, machine learning, robotics, human-agent interaction, modeling, and social choice. While the majority of the work is academic investigations with lab-based experiments, there have also been a growing number of real-world deployments with direct impact on governmental and commercial organizations. The international AAMAS conference, now in its 19th year, is taking place online, and attendance is free, while registration typically costs over $700 USD.", "This conference begins on Saturday May 9, with two days of workshops and tutorials. Monday May 11-Wednesday May 13 has over 300 paper presentations and keynote presentations by luminaries such as Carla Gomes, Alison Heppenstall, Sergey Levine, and Thore Graepel. The ACM SIGAI Autonomous Agents Research Award talk will be delivered by Muninder P. Singh, and Dominik Peters will give the Victor Lesser Dissertation Award presentation.", "While all videos will be available on underline.io through the end of 2020 for asynchronous viewing, underline.io will also support live Q&A sessions during the event. Proceedings of the conference will be available online, free of charge, as always.", "If you are interested in learning more about the exciting area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems, we hope you will join us!", "\u2014 Matthew Taylor, on behalf of Amal El Fallah Seghrouchni and Gita Sukthankar, AAMAS\u201920 General Chairs", "AAMAS 2020 invited submissions for a general track, a Blue Sky Ideas track, and a track to present papers from JAAMAS (the journal Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems) that had not previously been presented at a major conference. The Blue Sky Ideas track was chaired by Alessandro Ricci and Juan Antonio Rodriguez. Rym Zalila-Wenkstern and P\u0131nar Yolum solicited papers for the JAAMAS Presentation Track from the papers that appeared in JAAMAS within the preceding 12 months.", "A group of Area Chairs (AC) was selected to help oversee the review process of the main track. The ACs performed an initial check of submissions and recommended summary rejection of those that did not meet the AAMAS scope, submission or formatting instructions.", "Jointly with the program chairs, the chairs of the ten areas were responsible for appointing Senior Program Committee (SPC) members, who in turn helped identify a strong and diverse set of Program Committee (PC) members. PC could review for more than one area. Every paper was reviewed by at least three PC members, overseen by an SPC member who ensured reviews were clear and informative. After authors were given an opportunity to respond to the reviewers, the SPC member led a discussion where the reviewers considered each others\u2019, and the authors\u2019, comments. The area chairs in turn worked with the program chairs to make final decisions about acceptance for the papers, to ensure uniformly high quality.", "AAMAS 2020 attracted a good number of high-quality submissions: the overall acceptance rate for full papers was 23% (186 out of 808 reviewed submissions were accepted).", "While all the accepted papers are of high quality, a selected few papers from the main track were nominated for the Best Paper Award and the Pragnesh Jay Modi Best Student Paper Award. The Best Paper Award was presented at the conference to the best paper, and the Pragnesh Jay Modi Best Student Paper Award was given to the best of the remaining papers primarily authored by a student. The Best Student Paper Award was sponsored by Springer. The nominees for these awards are listed below, alphabetically by the first author\u2019s last name; papers primarily authored by a student are marked with an asterisk (*). These papers were also nominated for expedited review at the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).", "In addition, the IFAAMAS Influential Paper award will be presented at the conference for the following two papers:", "Your home for data science.
