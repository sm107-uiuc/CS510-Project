The articles in this series are notes based on the course, with additional research and topics for my own learning purposes. For the first course, Data Scientist Toolbox, the notes will be separated into 7 parts. Notes on the series can also be found here.", "An important tenet in the Scientific field is that unfalsifiable theories don\u2019t exist, in other words, there isn\u2019t something called scientific proof. What standardizes and evaluates a scientific theory is an evidence. More + better evidence = better scientific theories and vice versa. That said, all scientific knowledge we have today is tentative, which means they\u2019re subject to confirmation and are conjectures (we do our best to understand the world around us, and form theories about them, but they\u2019re not final and can be disproved.)", "In Statistics, it\u2019s the same story. You can\u2019t prove with 100% certainty that, e.g it will rain tomorrow at 1 pm, or who\u2019s going to win the election. All statistical tests do is assign a certain probability to the data at hand and indicates the likelihood that the results are from random fluctuations in sampling (reference).", "That said, this article will be focusing on significance testing, explaining what p-value is with examples, and how it\u2019s being exploited (p-hacking) in the research field, something is known as the reproducibility crisis.", "P-value tells you the odds that a result occured might be of random chance.", "To get a more concrete idea of what p-values are, we\u2019ll look at it from a research point of view, that is how it is utilized in statistical analyses or tests \u2014 significance testing.", "But first, the terms you have to know about are:", "Let\u2019s say an experiment is conducted to deduce whether listening to classical music improves focus. To do so, they assign 100 people to sit in a room, and they\u2019re required to do a concentration test whilst wearing headphones with classical music playing. Then, they have another 100 people who participate in the said test without any music. The results of both of these groups are then compared.", "Null hypothesis = no difference between classical music vs no classical music", "Alternative hypothesis = the opposite basically, there\u2019s a difference \u2026", "To prove that listening to classical music increases focus, the experimenters must be able to reject the null, which is usually this big hurdle that researchers must clear through. If they\u2019re unable to do so, that is, there isn\u2019t enough evidence or data to reject it.", "In this case, let\u2019s say the experimenters did statistical analyses on the data, and arrive at a very small p-value, they rejoice and publish papers on the topic.", "So what does a small (significant) p-value mean again? Here are a few key points", "If you think about it, if achieving a p-value of fewer than 0.05 means validating one\u2019s research, and allows them to publish it on papers, it\u2019s very tempting to intentionally hack at that value in one\u2019s favor, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.", "Very briefly, this crisis is about researches and experiments in the scientific field having to achieve the golden number of <0.05, which incentivized people to intentionally tweak certain conditions in their favor. This is called p-hacking.", "P-hacking also can be related to Big Data and better technology we have today, which allows these tests to be done rapidly.", "To see an example of P-hacking in action, check out FiveThirtyEight\u2019s great article which has a live working example that you can play with.", "Just a simple example of where you might encounter p-values here\u2019s an example of a linear regression model using the Boston Dataset, along with that is the F-statistics of the model which contains the p-values.", "This image above is showing the F-statistics of the significance test using the summary() function.", "Prerequisites for this significance test include that the error term, \u03f5 in the model is independent of x, and is normally distributed, with zero mean and constant variance. And setting the significance level at .05", "Briefly put, if you look at the bottom right, you\u2019ll see p-value < 2.2e-16 . This means the p-value is a lot less than 0.05, which means we can reject the null hypothesis that \u03b2 = 0. Hence, there is a significant relationship between the variables lstat and mdev in the linear regression model.", "By the same vein, p-values also help determine whether the relationships observed in the sample exists in the larger population as well. Thus, if p-values are statistically significant, there is evidence to conclude that the effect exists at the population level as well.", "Of course, p-values merely tells you that there\u2019s a correlation. To tell how well your model fits the data, that\u2019s where the R-squared values come in. Moreover, residual errors are the \u201cerrors\u201d in your model (distance between the regression line and data point) and F-statistics is simply comparing the joint effect of the variables (the higher the better). All these are crucial elements in interpreting your hypothesis testing.", "More about the above regression in my kaggle notebook. If you want a complete introduction, check out this article. And another article about interpreting P-values and coefficients in Regression Analysis here.", "Consciousness \u2014 a product of the mysterious, ineffable mechanism underlying the transmission of electrical signals between 86 billion neurons in our brains \u2014 gifted humankind with the ability to have subjective experience about our surroundings, to ponder about the past, present, and future, to question about the world, to fathom the unfathomable.", "Our incredible minds gave birth to many amazing discoveries and breakthroughs, and our many ways of reasoning about the world helped us simplify the complex around us. But with the rise of information and technology that speeds up connectivity and connects the world together comes sacrifice in truth and the plague of misinformation. Thus, we have to understand that all of us have biases, and we are inclined to act based on incentives, and our attention in this modern world is constantly being capitalized by technology.", "To conquer that, we have to be conscientious about our actions, reflect on them, and learn from our mistakes. We must learn to set our attention on what matters, pursue what is meaningful and not what is expedient, surround ourselves with good people, and act not out of selfishness, but for the greater good of society, and the world.", "Jordan Ellenberg, author of \u201cHow Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking\u201d has great insights on significance testing:", "The significance test is the detective, not the judge. The provocative and oh-so-statistically-significant finding isn\u2019t the conclusion of the scientific process, but the bare beginning.", "And a summary of the null hypothesis:", "To end this article here\u2019s some truth about what statistics is.", "The purpose of statistics isn\u2019t to tell us what to believe, but to tell us what to do. Statistics is about making decisions, not answering questions. \u2014 Jordan Ellenberg", "Thanks for reading and stay safe.", "If you want to be updated with my latest articles follow me on Medium.", "Follow my other social profiles too!", "Be on the lookout for my next article and remember to stay safe!", "Your home for data science.
