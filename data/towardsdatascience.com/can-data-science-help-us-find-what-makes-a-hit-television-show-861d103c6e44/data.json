This article would present the investigation which went in and what were the results I got post training on neural networks as well as leveraging pre-trained Watson NLU and Personality Insights models. The most challenging part of the journey was to prepare data by randomly searching for public web transcripts of these shows on the internet.", "Generally, I approach a data science project by asking a lot of intuitive domain based questions, seek feedback from experts and add/modify my questionnaire. Working backward keeps me aware of my success criteria and unless I am convinced of the results, I continue iterating with better questions, models and better/more data. Please note here that convincing results by no way means getting an outcome aligned to my expectations. We do data science to investigate the factors which leads to facts and later predict using these attributes as ground truth and not vice versa. It\u2019s an art based on science.", "While working on this project, I also wrote two articles here and here.", "Here, I asked the following questions", "1. Is it the consistency in the way individual Characters speak and behave?", "2. Is it the repeat shots at locations thereby making your audience feel like they know the place over time?", "3. Is it the similarity/difference in the way different Characters speak and behave?", "4. Is it the balanced distribution of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, anger, disgust etc. which makes a show interesting?", "5. Is it the similar/different personality of Characters that keeps the audience connected?", "6. Is it the interesting flashbacks which binds the audience?", "I would address these questions one by one. There can be obviously many more questions and that is why feedbacks from domain experts must be sought/researched before starting to work on any data science project to confirm that you are asking the right set of questions.", "For this analysis, I planned to use the following three shows \u2014 Friends, The Big Bang Theory and The Breaking Bad, which I thought would create a fair mix for analysis.", "After extensively searching the internet, I got the html transcripts from the following URLs.", "Following is a sample of what these transcripts look like.", "Below is a brief illustration of how I prepared dataset for modeling from raw html transcripts acquired from the links above.", "Please note that I have simply copied the html content here to .txt files. We can even use web scraping instead of copy+paste. But, please remember that before scraping web pages, we might need authorization. After I run the above steps, I get my dataset for each sitcom ready to be used for modeling. A sample from the dataset created looks like the following.", "It took significant effort on my part to generate these datasets. So, I uploaded them on Kaggle so that they can be used by the interested parties. The datasets can be found for Friends, The Big Bang Theory, The Breaking Bad.", "The code for data preparation and engineering can be found individually for each sitcom here.", "I am using Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for emotion detection of the characters. Natural Language Understanding is a collection of APIs that offer text analysis through natural language processing. This set of APIs can analyze text to help you understand its concepts, entities, keywords, sentiment, and more. At the core of natural language processing (NLP) lies text classification. Watson Natural Language Classifier (NLC) allows users to classify text into custom categories, at scale. NLC combines various advanced ML techniques to provide the highest accuracy possible, without requiring a lot of training data. Behind the scenes, NLC utilizes an ensemble of classification models, along with unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, to achieve its accuracy levels. After your training data is assembled, NLC evaluates your data against multiple support vector machines (SVMs) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) using IBM\u2019s Deep Learning As a Service (DLaaS). The code corresponding to each sitcom for sections 1, 2 and 3 can be found here.", "I have introduced a variable \u2018Emotion Quotient\u2019 to understand which emotion is most prominent with respect to other emotions on the show.

The IBM Watson Personality Insights service uses linguistic analytics to extract a spectrum of cognitive and social characteristics from the text data that a person generates through blogs, tweets, forum posts, and more. Watson found Trump \u201cboisterous.\u201d I would be using it on the transcripts to understand the personality of individual characters. The code corresponding to each sitcom for sections 4 and 5 can be found here.", "I am focusing on Big Five results from WPI defined as below here.", "The personalities of all the characters on Friends look similar.", "The personalities of all the characters on The Big Bang Theory look similar.", "The personalities of all the characters on The Breaking Bad does not look very similar.", "The personalities of all the characters on Friends have a similar distribution of attributes.", "The personalities of all the characters on The Big Bang Theory have a similar distribution of attributes.", "The personalities of all the characters have a similar distribution of attributes.", "We often notice that some shows are repeatedly shot at same locations. For example, when we think of Friends, the mental picture in our thoughts is often in Central Perk or at Monica\u2019s or Chandler\u2019s apartment. For Big Bang Theory, what comes to our mind is Leonard and Sheldon\u2019s apartment. So, I thought, why not find out top 5 locations for these shows and infer/discover the underlying strategy therein. The code for section 6 can be found here.", "Friends did not have much variation in the places it happened. That succeeded in binding its audience to to the show.", "The Big Bang Theory did not have much variation in the places it happened. That succeeded in binding its audience to to the show.", "I did not have data for the Breaking Bad to plot the top locations at this time.", "I am using neural network (keras-tensorflow) to identify different Characters from each other.

We can infer this, as all the three popular shows reflect this in their analysis.", "A. Yes, both the shows \u2018F.R.I.E.N.D.S.\u2019 and \u2018The Big Bang Theory\u2019 confirm to this. Unfortunately, I could not find location data for \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019.", "A. They can be quite similar, as well as different. We did not get a solid evidence here on this from the confusion matrices we observed for the three shows.", "A. Yes, the results from Watson NLU on the input from three shows confirm this.", "A. The results reveal that it\u2019s obviously the similarity in personality which wins here.", "A. Unfortunately, the \u2018flashback\u2019 word does not appear in transcripts, so could not analyze this.", "If you are fortunate to have a show running long, try to establish consistency in the speech and behavior of individual Characters over the episodes.\u201d", "There should be minimal variance in the set of shooting locations. This would instill a sense of belonging to the environment and culture of the sitcom in the audience.", "The personality of the Characters on the sitcom should blend together, as the Personality Insights results highlight.", "The distribution of emotions are leaning towards a particular emotion. F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is a show of primarily joy and sadness; The Big Bang Theory is leaning towards joy and sadness as well. Breaking Bad is a show mostly made of anger and sadness. The takeaway is keep the emotion quotient of the show coherent over a period of time.", "The Characters can be different or similar to each other as long as the above criteria are met.", "I want to wrap up by looking at the Characters who are most popular on these three shows and their personality profiles.", "In the Q&A session during my talk, I got few interesting questions and remarks as below.", "Q. How are the results going to be improved/enhanced if we add facial expression analysis using computer vision techniques?", "A. Given time, I would love to try this out or if somebody does, please share the results :).", "Q. Game of Thrones was shot at multiple locations? How could these results justify that?", "A. I agree it was shot at several locations but still the most dominant were few like Westeros, Winterfell etc. So, the results look aligned here.", "Q. What differences would it make if the show was shot in front of a live audience?", "A. I believe that it would impact the show following positively since liking and joy are quite infectious. If I watch the audience laughing and enjoying, it would definitely generate an interest in the content.", "The approach I have followed here is one way to go about understanding the factors leading to a hit tv show. There can be alternative ways as well.
