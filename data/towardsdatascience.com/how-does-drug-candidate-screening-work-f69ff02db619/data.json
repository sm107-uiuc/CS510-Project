Most pharmaceutical companies do \u201cin silico\u201d screenings in advance of real-world trials: They want the best possible chance of filtering through a \u2018hit\u2019 with as few \u2018miss\u2019 costs as possible.", "In background research for our most recent pieces on antivirals efficacy that fundamentally rely on data science and drug-docking, I realized that there aren\u2019t a lot of drug docking \u201chow-to\u2019s\u201d for the data scientist audience. This apparent gap in the data science arsenal made me feel kind of sad because data scientists could be among the most prolific users of these tools to great effect. It would be perfectly OK if there was a generation of \u2018biochemical data scientists\u2019 wielding biochemical software tools towards solving some of humanity\u2019s greatest health challenges.", "This would be possible if data scientists could overcome any fear or unfamiliarity of dipping into the open-source tools of the trade. Definitely embrace your fellow biochemist/molecular biologist/virologist, but don\u2019t fall into the trap of believing you couldn\u2019t possibly have unique scope on their domains. Quite to the contrary, practitioners of these sciences can benefit enormously from your support. From experience, the smartest among them even welcome you with open arms.", "Then to drop an early pebble into that pond, here is our primer on drug-docking for the data science community, as illustrated by our approach in applying these tools toward one application in particular \u2014 virology.", "At EMSKE we developed an automated screening process to assay candidate plant compounds in silico on the main protease (\u2018Mpro\u2019)of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. (This protease is not to be confused with the virus\u2019s 2nd protease, called PLpro).", "A good antivirals screen unlocks the capacity to do early, high-volume \u201cthumbs-up/thumbs-down\u201d indications for targeted viral enzymes. Why target the main protease? So long as a safe drug candidate (that\u2019s demonstrated in vitro to have inhibitory efficacy on this critical enzyme) can make its way through the human metabolism and cross cell membranes, then it\u2019s a one-shot-kill for the virus. Not the only viral protein worth targeting, to be sure, but a better choice than, say, a spike inhibitor where you need to tackle a plurality of the spikes to have any efficacy against its entering cells.", "Our screen rests atop a drug docking tool called Autodock Vina. Autodock and Autodock Vina are open-source tools put out by Scripps Research Institute. Rooted in machine-learning, it uses gradient-descent to find conforming, polarity-attractive \u201cposes\u201d of candidate compounds to conform onto any of a protein\u2019s receptor sites that are under study. The Autodock family of docking software has been extensively applied for screening by life sciences researchers across the body of published biochemistry literature for over a decade. Vina is a cost-function and scoring refinement of Autodock which improves the hit-miss accuracy and significantly improves computation speed compared with the original Autodock. Here is the general workflow of autodocking tools:", "Now you\u2019re almost ready to do a docking run! The remaining item to sort out is the search box. Vina does its gradient-descent search by iterating across the many-dimensional space of 3D location, orientation, and ligand rotational bond conformations. It searches within a three-dimensional volume search box that the user specifies in units of Angstroms. The user also specifies a center for the search. Together, these parameters allow the selection of either a \u2018blind\u2019 search, which means a search volume encompassing the entire protein (we use 150 Angstroms\u00b3). For targeted docking to active sites, a tighter search volume (we use 30 Angstroms\u00b3) narrows the search and speeds up computation.", "Using a 3D visualization program like PyMol, it is easy to determine the coordinates for blind docking (typically the estimated geometric center of the protein). For a targeted site, just open up the human-readable pdbqt file itself and find the target site\u2019s amino acids of interest. The active site\u2019s amino acids are ascertained from published literature for the protein of interest. For SARS-CoV\u2019s Mpro, we usually look at the active site defined by A-histidine-41 & A-cysteine-145. (\u2018A\u2019 refers to one of the two chains of amino acid that combine to form the totality of this enzyme protein).", "Under gradient-descent with a cost function defined by the ligand-protein complex\u2019 energy level, Vina iterates the ligand\u2019s position, rotation, and structural pose vis-a-vis the protein\u2019s surface. Rather than directly taking into account the attraction of opposite charges on the ligand molecule and the protein receptor surface, it looks pairwise at the atomic bonds between the ligand and receptor that would be created in a given pose. Vina generates results along a -4 to -12 scale (formally: in units of kilocalories per mole). In other words, docking software like Autodock Vina thinks in terms of minimizing the \u201cenergy level\u201d of a set of chemical bonds determined by a compound\u2019s pose against a protein receptor site.", "Our application of Vina essentially maintains this scale but applies some basic logic and averaging over an appropriate number of trials over a combination of protein receptor sites. That way our results (where the more negative number is more likely to be more inhibitory) may better reflect a compound\u2019s propensity to defeat the virus\u2019 ability to replicate itself, as illustrated next.", "When the earlier SARS virus first struck in 2003, there was sufficient time and funding in follow-on years for researchers to do in vitro inhibitory studies of the virus\u2019 main protease Mpro (often referred to as 3CLpro in the older SARS literature). Researchers were studying to determine which compounds would inhibit this proteases\u2019 growth in a petri dish (referred to as in vitro).", "Why target a protease? Because it\u2019s a one-shot-kill for viruses. Proteases\u2019 efficacy as a target was well-established especially thanks to the HIV protease inhibitors that came out in the 1990s.", "Critically, the SARS 2003 coronavirus is very, very similar to the current 2019 coronavirus. The two virus\u2019 main proteases specifically are 95% identical in amino acid sequence, and differ primarily in their three-dimensional folding structure.", "Treating in vitro results as our \u201csource of truth\u201d, we compared the results of our Autodock studies on the 2003 SARS Mpro with researchers\u2019 in vitro results compound-for-compound over the 16 years since that epidemic. However it is difficult to know which target site in real life the in vitro researchers managed to bind their inhibitory compounds to. And just as a real compound can bind to different sites with the potential to inhibit, so too can we target autodocking at different sites.", "Therefore we must explore different combinations of the autodock targeting results. By comparing combinatorially results from blind, A, and B docking studies (first, in isolation and then second, in different combinations with each other) and compare against real-world in vitro data for the same compounds, we arrive at the following resulting combination that features the highest correlation with real-world data:", "We achieve an R\u00b2 of 0.362, a value that is not atypical for biochemical virology investigation.", "Correlation in hand, we can now develop a classifier for separating out the inhibitory \u2018hit\u2019 ligands from the worthless \u2018miss\u2019 ligands.", "In vitro researchers treat any compound that inhibits with a concentration of 100 uM (micromolar) or less to be the low-side cutoff for an in vitro \u2018hit\u2019. That corresponds to a log10 value of 2.0. Therefore we trained our classifier by comparing Autodock Vina results of 27 compounds as simulated against multiple active sites of the similar, original SARS (2003) coronavirus Mpro with those actual, in vitro lab inhibitory results of the same compounds. Our best-fit-to-reality formulation of Vina results across several active sites yields the following hit-miss chart:", "Benefiting from this training set, we assayed our formulation of Vina results against an additional 8-compound test set. The classifier demonstrated that anything with a -7.7 kcal/mol score or above should be classified as a \u2018hit\u2019.", "Results of our ML classifier\u2019s test set of 8 additional compounds, also based on SARS-2003.", "Based on the test set, our classifier demonstrates a classification accuracy of 87.5%.", "Please consider yourself encouraged to tool up and try your own docking studies at home. There are many viral enzymes (and normal biochemical process proteins) of interest out in the wild that one can try to dock to. As demonstrated above, just make sure to keep your simulations grounded by comparing results against published real-world in vitro findings. You want to keep the false-positives and true-negatives to a minimum, but humility requires accepting there will be some of each of these even so.", "And as alluded to in the beginning of this post, even once you have in vitro hits, there\u2019s still the entire pharmacokinetics modeling process that needs to be applied for any substance that\u2019s ingested (this is called ADME modeling), and cellular membrane entry modeling in case your drug candidate needs to enter inside of a cell. There\u2019s even drug-interaction modeling to avoid the unintended consequences of a drug in the human body. These tools are at an earlier level of maturity than drug docking, but perhaps biochemically-equipped data scientists can contribute to enabling those efforts to reach maturity faster.", "But overall the computer is a perfectly safe environment to run simulated biochemical assays. (It\u2019s when it comes time to draw conclusions and start the lab tests that the concern begins). But till you reach that point, then, by all means, D\u0336o\u0336n\u0336\u2019\u0336t\u0336 Try this at home.", "As the global community of drug-dockers are fond of saying \u2014 \u2014 \u201cHappy docking!\u201d :)", "The author would like to recognize 1.the originators and contributors to the open-source Autodock, Vina, MGLTools 2. the MTiOS hosted docking initiative; and 3. Yu Wai Chen, PhD, Protein Crystallography, Cambridge University for his efforts spanning decades to build awareness of computational drug-docking tools.", "Update 3 September: This description earlier stated that Vina takes into account the polarity of atomic pairs between the receptor and ligand. In fact that is not the case; rather Vina applies a score based on the type of bond created between two atoms, but without performing a physics-based polarity model between the atoms. This is intentional, as it matches up better with real-world protein-ligand binding affinities than physics-based models in place prior to Vina\u2019s development.", "Your home for data science.
