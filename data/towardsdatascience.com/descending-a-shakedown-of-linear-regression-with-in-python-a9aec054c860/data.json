Using that line, both visually with the naked eye and as a starting point in other predictive models, we are able to predict, with a certain level of accuracy, what future/added data points will be.", "Take this set of random points between 1.0\u201310.0 and plot them on a scatter plot.", "With this set of points, a trend can be seen almost immediately.", "But knowing exactly the values of the line, its slope, and its intercept are not values that can be attained just from looking at the raw plot.", "Applying linear regression, we can see the actual line of best fit. From here we can extend the line forwards and be able to see approximately where data points beyond 10.0 and less than 1.0 can be predicted.", "Simple enough, but rarely will data ever be this clean, condensed, or straightforward.", "What if we used data like the Spotify Song Attributes dataset and plot some data from there..", "There are many models and ways for finding out what the line of best fit for data that can\u2019t be visually interpreted as easily.", "We are going to work to find the line of best fit using 2 principle methods of Linear Regression.", "Always begin with loading in necessary imports and creating the data and variables", "Going forward, there are a lot of complex math formulas and techniques from statistics and calculus.

Also known later as the \u2018weights\u2019, these values will remain the same for these calculations, as long as our x and y data remains the same as well.", "To calculate the slope and intercept, we would need the following formulas to compute the Mean Square Error the weights, w1 and w0.", "The left side image shows the conversion of mathematical symbols to their associated variable. On the right side, are the formulas to compute the formulas for w1(slope) and w0(intercept). This process, if done by hand, takes an in-depth knowledge of calculus, specifically solving multivariable equations and finding partial derivatives.", "Once we find the values of w1 and w0, we then use those formulas to solve for the actual value of w1 and w0.", "It is a lengthy process, but with the numpy library, we are able to streamline this process.", "This will print out the statement (for the particular example).", "A easier way to understand y_pred=w1*x+w0 is to think of it in its more familiar form, y=mx+b . The y_pred is the predicted line based on the w1 and w0 we previously found.", "Intuitively, it may seem a bit odd, but it does make sense when we look at the clustering (another style of analysis), and that our data does seem to have a low positive trend.", "We can use the Mean Square Error to analyze the validity of this line.", "This concept is simple in that we are looking at the differences between the actual point and the predicted point.", "This is done on all the data points (summation), divide by the amount of points (mean), and find the square (square) to eliminate any negative numbers. A value of 0 is not possible, but the closer to zero, the better. This is reflected in the code.", "Veeery close to zero and that is great! That tells us the error value is very low and so our line is quite accurate.", "This algorithm, as with many others, can be used in the fields of Computer Science, Data Science, and everywhere that tech touches.", "It is by using these capabilities that we are able to handle data and process quicker, and more efficiently, and use it to assist us in moving towards the future.", "Your home for data science.
