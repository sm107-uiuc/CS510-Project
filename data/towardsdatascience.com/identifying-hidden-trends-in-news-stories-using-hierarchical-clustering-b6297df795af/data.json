This works great in normal times, however, in midst of the covid-19 pandemic, it poses a serious problems for us since news stories now have a faster turnaround cycle.", "One way to fight this problem is by running text clustering algorithms on news stories collected in a short time period and identifying emerging trends before they start affecting our pretrained sentiments analysis models too much.", "As an example, since the Covid pandemic began, we started seeing a drop in performance in our sentiments analysis models. We mitigated this by running text clustering and topic models and found that a new topic/cluster was emerging around some tokens such as \u201cpaycheck protection program\u201d, \u201clockdowns\u201d, \u201cmasks\u201d, \u201cvaccines\u201d, \u201cairborne\u201d. We kept saving data from these \u201cnew\u201d clusters until we had enough datapoints to retrain our supervised models.", "You can get recent (<24 h) news articles in structured format by accessing a public News data API which exposes data from media monitoring database from Specrom Analytics. You have to register for a free account with Algorithmia. You will get 10,000 credits a month when you sign up and that should be plenty for over 500 API calls a month.", "To get your API key, go to dashboard, and click on My API Keys as shown below.", "Algorithmia has client libraries for all popular software languages, so let us get the python client by typing the text below on bash or command line.", "Each LatestNewsAPI call gives us a maximum of 100 results, so we will have to paginate about 10 times if we want to fetch 1000 news stories which probably should be sufficient for a clustering demo in this tutorial. The API itself allows you to filter by topics, in addition to specifying a keyword query for main content of the article and the title. You can also specify filtering by list of domain addresses since there are over 60,000 news sources being currently indexed by this database.", "However, in this case, I have filtered it only by specifying \u201cbusiness\u201d in topics.", "Let\u2019s load the results up in a pandas dataframe and create a word cloud to see the initial distribution of words in top 1000 news stories.", "Let us vectorize the documents using tf-idf vectors and reduce dimensions by singular vector decomposition. For a complete discussion on how to preprocess text please refer to an earlier blog article.", "At this point, we are ready to create text clusters using agglomerative clustering. One issue with all text clustering algorithms is the need to specify number of text clusters beforehand as a hyperparameter. There are empirical methods available like the \u201celbow method\u201d for k means clustering but they take far too much computational resources to be practical to run it everyday.", "However, Agglomerative clustering is extremely fast which allows us to iterate through a large number of possible cluster values with news data and check for the growth of the number of cluster members pretty inexpensively.", "We are not necessarily interested in largest clusters identified here; that will probably be dominated by things we already know through our existing text analytics pipeline or by experience. More interesting are the hidden news stories of the day with might be getting traction in number of multiple outlets.", "Let us print top terms per cluster for 6 n_clusters.", "The top two clusters represent predictable news about covid-19 hardships and economic fallout around the world. However, the other clusters seem to have an interesting keyword mix as shown below:", "So it looks like cluster 2 is talking about some 5G related issue with Huawei which is related to British government. We can filter our dataframe to see members in cluster 2 and we can see right away that it is an emerging news trend which was sparked off by a Reuters article couple of days ago when they reported about British government asking Japan for alternatives to Huawei for 5G wireless network.", "Cluster 4 is about Trader Joe\u2019s branding being perceived as racist which creating a spate of negative stories about that brand.", "Once you have identified new clusters, you can run a name entity relationship model to identify top entities in the cluster, run a sentiments analysis to see it\u2019s impact and also check on news propagation flow on whether the cluster is expanding in coming days or not as part of enterprise social listening app.", "We used the same technique to find lot\u2019s of interesting emerging topics in past few months and it has made our text classification and social listening models more robust to the fast changing world we are in today.", "Your home for data science.
