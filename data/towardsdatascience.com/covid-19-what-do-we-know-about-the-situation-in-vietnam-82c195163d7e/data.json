Meanwhile, Vietnam currently has only 270 COVID-19 confirmed cases in total with NO FATALITIES. And now, Vietnam is on its 16 straight days with no new locally transmitted cases and 8 straight days with no new cases. This leaves us so many questions to ask.", "As a data analyst with molecular biology and bioinformatics background, also had worked a lot (experimentally) with PCR/qPCR (the standard testing method used for COVID-19) in the past, I was interested in COVID-19 since the early day when WHO announced a small cluster of the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan in December 2019. While the pandemic took its course and rolled peaks across borders, my interest has grown bigger in a mix of many topics: testing (testing, and more testing), early testing and contact tracing, epidemic surveillance, the SARS-CoV-2 genome, patient\u2019s symptoms, vaccine development, etc. Living in the Bay Area (CA, USA), often spending my early morning reading/watching coronavirus live updates/briefings around the world, I have been quite familiar with the COVID-19 situation and the approaches many countries have implemented to control the pandemic. The low number of cases in Vietnam has raised many questions for us all. Therefore, I decided to collect data and study it independently using all the information available on the internet.", "One ironically important thing about the Vietnam health care system is the fact that privacy laws are not as stringent as in the U.S., Canada, or Europe. Therefore, COVID-19 patient data in Vietnam is publicly available. In some cases, detail got seriously down to their addresses, names, their personal contacts, their daily activities, and habits (buying stuff in which shop in the market, for example).", "In the rest of this article, I will show you the Vietnam COVID-19 patient dataset and step through the answers to some questions above. (Testing and contact tracing \u2014 quarantine deserve their own notes, which are coming soon).", "Sharing a border with China, Vietnam reported its first COVID-19 confirmed cases on January 23, 2020, around the same time as other countries, such as South Korea (January 20), the U.S. (January 21), the UK (January 31). Since then, each country has had its own specific strategy to contain the outbreak. Most countries have now shifted from the containment paradigm \u2014 early tracking, isolating the infection sources \u2014 to serious mitigation paradigm \u2014 tactics to reduce transmission. Although losing some F0 cases, Vietnam still has remained safely in the containment stage.", "The curve has been flattening with a significantly low number of active cases (COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized) (Figure 3). Note that in Vietnam, all COVID-19 patients, including the asymptomatic cases, were hospitalized. In contrast, in the US, asymptomatic cases or people with mild symptoms are recommended to stay home except to get medical care.", "The number of daily cases has remained low in the single digits throughout the course of the pandemic, and during its peak, the number of daily cases has been below 20 (see the graph of daily cases in Figure 4).", "Interestingly, the growth rates of COVID-19 imported and locally transmitted cases had the same trend, which added up to the total confirmed cases. In addition, the number of imported cases has remained larger than locally transmitted cases. This trend indicated that Vietnam has been able to control the outbreak consistently over time: the local cases had never surpassed the imported cases.", "Note: Diseases have no borders, so as this novel coronavirus. Therefore, this analysis is equivocal and should be views as a reference only.", "The COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam can be described with 2 different waves. (A full picture of Vietnam COVID-19 pandemic, including the confirmed case, timeline, patient profile, source of infection, major infection cluster, etc. could be found in this note).", "This trend is pretty much consistent with what happened in the U.S. (the U.S. got more COVID-19 cases from Europe than from China)", "Remember that this piece of the report could be biased for the following reason: To have a generalized view of the infection source, in this analysis, all the countries, including \u201ctransit\u201d countries were included. Many countries might show dominance in the infection source list because they are the major international travel hubs where patients transited, such as the U.K., Russia, United Arab Emirates, etc.", "In this infection source list (Figure 5), the UK dominantly linked to 54 confirmed cases (27% of imported cases), almost 3 times larger than France, the second infection source linked to 19 cases. The reason behind this fact is not simply just because the UK is one of the busy international travel hubs. But, it indicated that the actual number of COVID-19 cases was likely very much higher in the UK since the early days of the outbreak. The UK has been criticized for its coronavirus response. There were no appropriate and quick measures being taken at that time: no quarantine, no travel ban, \u2026 Note that the majority of foreign COVID-19 patients in Vietnam were from the U.K (Figure 6).", "Why did Vietnam get more COVID-19 cases from Europe and the U.S. more than from China, a neighbor sharing a land border and intensive daily trading relationship with Vietnam? A mystery to us. Other variables such as the local weather (temperature, humidity), ethnic background and genetic variation, vaccination profile, culture, and social behaviors, and especially people awareness (Wuhan epicenter was the hot trend on social media and news in Vietnam at that time), could contribute in slowing down the virus spread coming from China.", "The trend of age seems to link to the specific infection clusters in Vietnam: Foreigners who were in their young age link to the Buddha Bar & Grill (a restaurant and bar) cluster; the majority of Vietnamese female patients were linked to a food supply company for Bach Mai hospital, etc.", "=> Currently with this small dataset, it is unable to tell if there are any age-gender population groups that may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. The outbreak in Vietnam appeared largely under control when all the cases seem to link to specific clusters and travel groups.", "The situation could have been worst if there were no EARLY testing and quarantine in Vietnam.", "Among all 270 Vietnam COVID-19 confirmed cases, only 35.2% of patients showed symptoms before or right after they tested positive for the virus. Remarkably, only 6.3% of cases reported COVID-19 associated symptoms (shortness of breath/pressure in the chest/mild pneumonia/respiratory failure ). The majority of symptomatic patients reported mild cold/flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, etc.) (25.4% of all cases).", "Among symptomatic patients, the common symptoms include fever, cough, and sore throat.", "What can we infer from this result?", "If Vietnam did not respond swiftly with tests and early quarantine people, more than 90% of these COVID-19 cases would have continue to frequent communal and public places, unwittingly spread the virus in the community.", "What would happen if Vietnam applied the same policies about testing as in other countries, for example, the U.S. (where I am currently living and understand the situation the most)? A catastrophe: more than 90% of the patients would have not been qualified for a COVID-19 test. Before any serious COVID-19 associated symptoms were detected on those patients; before they were \u201cdeteriorated enough\u201d to be qualified for testing; and while they were wandering around waiting for the test result, the virus would have been silently spreading. There would have been many \u201chot spots\u201d since the first wave of the infection (January 23, 2020). And the situation would have been strikingly serious when the second wave of infection from Europe was in its full swing (starting on March 06, 2020, with patient #17). (See more details about the two infection waves in Vietnam here).", "The average duration of hospitalization for Vietnam COVID-19 patients (the majority had mild symptoms) was around 2 weeks. In an uncommon case, the patient BN51 had gone through 13 times of testing before being officially discharged (See reference and note on the Vietnam COVID-19 patient dataset).", "Foreigners had a longer hospitalized time compared to Vietnamese patients. The reasons could be because of the environment inside the hospital (food, language barriers in healthcare), ethnic background and genetic variation, and/or their age group: the majority of foreigners are retired travelers who tend to be more vulnerable to the virus.", "Discharge criteria for COVID-19 cases on the Vietnam Health Ministry\u2019s website are as follows:", "\u201cCOVID-19 patient can be discharged after 2 continuous negative laboratory tests within 48 hours, reported no fever for at least 3 continuous days, having normal vitals, normal blood test, improving chest X-ray. The discharged patient must be sent into quarantine (at home/hotel) for 14 more days.\u201d", "There was 1 case whose hospitalized time is only 1 day. The reason for that might be:", "A detailed note discussing COVID-19 testing will be available soon.", "Some patients who have a long hospitalization period (more than 30 days) indicated that their conditions had been more severe. The data on severe patients was not so consistent among different sources (timelines for severe symptoms in each patient, their patient IDs, etc.) so it was omitted from the analysis. However, you still can have a look at the Vietnam COVID-19 dataset. And here is an insight into it:", "Among a few COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), some were intubated and recovered; 2 -3 cases have received ECMO treatment (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and intensive dialysis. But so far, no death. Severe COVID-19 patients have shown signs of improvement; thanks to the tremendous efforts of healthcare workers and hospitals. Early responses (case identification, isolation, contact tracing, quarantine) has helped avoid the burden on the healthcare system and hence, reduce morbidity and mortality.", "\u201cA good rule of thumb is that, once your city or town has a confirmed Covid-19 death, the virus has probably been in your community for about two weeks.\u201d", "This rule might not be a real fact, but it is so encouraging to think that Vietnam has remained \u201csafe\u201d when there has been no confirmed COVID-19 death so far.", "What have Vietnam officials been working on to contain the virus? Stay tuned, a visualization for this will be available soon on my Medium page.", "With such a small sample size (270 COVID-19 confirmed cases) and the publicly available patient dataset, we can have a good insight into COVID-19 patients\u2019 profiles.", "The curve has been flattened; Vietnam has been lauded as \u201can outlier success story in the pandemic\u201d; and the Vietnam government has started lifting some distancing measures and closures. Nevertheless, the whole country needs to remain vigilant, be patient, and be \u201cready to ramp up measures as and when needed\u201d. Otherwise, until the coronavirus vaccine and/or specific, effective treatment for COVID-19 are available, Vietnam might lose the progress they have made.", "My other notes on the same topic:", "A full picture of Vietnam COVID-19 patients", "** Note about the asymptomatic/symptomatic cases", "Caution about the health condition data: I don\u2019t have any insiders nor documents from the hospitals. The health condition of patients was collected from the Vietnam Ministry of Health\u2019s website and Vietnam mainstream media, which has 2 remarkable limitations:", "(i) The described symptoms of each patient rely on patients\u2019 and their close contacts\u2019 memories, which could have been fuzzy.", "(ii) The health records were not officially collected from hospital documents, so these were likely underreported.", "However, the data I\u2019ve got is still a good source of reference for the following reasons:", "(i) The mainstream media seems \u201cthirsty\u201d for information, thus, they had reported any possible information. For example, patient BN204 was reported with no symptoms, but the other person who stayed in the same quarantine room recalled that the patient did sneeze. And this trivial symptom was reported. So it is unlikely that mainstream media missed any cases.", "(ii) For many cases, there is no mention of the health condition of the patient (I reported these cases as \u201cNot reported\u201d). Others were reported that their \u201cheath conditions were stable\u201d (which were reported as \u201cNot reported (stable condition)\u201d, we may assume that they showed no symptoms at all.", "(iii) When summing up the cases of \u201cNot reported\u201d, \u201cNot reported (stable condition)\u201d and \u201cNo symptom when positive\u201d, we got 64.8%, which is close to 63.33% asymptomatic confirmed cases published on the Vietnam Ministry of Health\u2019s website.
