Still, there are some key fundamental concepts and ideas that are present in the simplest of neural network architectures, all the way to complicated state-of-the-art architectures.", "This article will introduce some fundamental neural network architectures, techniques, ideas and algorithm through a collection of articles that were previously written by myself.", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the fundamental building blocks of many deep learning applications.", "Everyday computer vision solutions to tasks such as image classification, object detection, pose estimation, depth estimation are solved through the implementation of carefully designed CNN architecture.", "Throughout my academic and professional career, I have found that it\u2019s vital to have an in-depth awareness of the internal components that are employed to develop widely used CNN architecture.", "Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning have made access to state of the art CNN architecture easier. Nonetheless, it is beneficial to take a step back to the simplest architectures and earliest deep learning research papers and understand the initial building blocks of what we today observe as Deep Learning.", "The articles below explore the AlexNet research paper and also include how to implement an AlexNet CNN architecture for the task of image classification.", "\u201cAlexNet was first utilised in the public setting when it won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge(ILSSVRC 2012 contest). It was at this contest that AlexNet showed that deep convolutional neural network could be used for solving image classification.\u201d", "The implementation of the AlexNet architecture in the article below is conducted using Keras and TensorFlow 2.0. Two libraries that deep learning practitioners are more than familiar with.", "The article below is a breakdown of the research paper that introduces the AlexNet architecture. In this article, you\u2019ll find explanations of common machine learning terminologies such as dropout, augmentation, normalisation etc.", "Apart from understanding the implementation details of neural network architectures, it\u2019s equally crucial for machine learning practitioners to know the reasoning behind the design and implementation decisions taken by the researchers at the time.", "The LeNet paper showcased the possibility of leveraging convolutional layers for character recognition. It paved the way for networks such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet and pretty much all convolutional neural network-based architecture today.", "It\u2019s worth reading the research paper as it introduced techniques and concepts such as local receptive fields, sub-sampling, weight sharing.", "The article below covers the implementation of LeNet architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.", "The rest of the articles below explore the techniques and concepts introduced in the LeNet research paper in further detail.", "Machine learning is riddled with techniques and algorithmic quirks that have been created by researchers to either squeeze out optimal performance from a neural network or control certain neural network\u2019s internal components to achieve optimal results.", "Techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, l1/l2 regularisation have found commonplace in many machine learning curriculum and courses. These common techniques are utilised frequently in a number of neural network architectures, so it\u2019s essential that practitioners understand the intuition behind these techniques.", "The articles below cover major machine/deep learning techniques, including how their implementation using TensorFlow and Keras.", "The deep learning field is overwhelmingly technical, it\u2019s easy for practitioners to get lost in programming languages, libraries, open-source projects and research papers. But there is a fun part to deep learning, at least as fun as it can get.", "Natural Style Transfer(NST) is a deep learning technique that takes the content of an art piece and the style of another and combines the two to create a unique take on two distinct artistic creation.", "What\u2019s more fascinating is how the style transfer technique works. Although the practical application of NST might not be immediately realised, the technical knowledge and creativity component of the algorithm makes this topic of deep learning worth exploring.", "To conclude this article I\u2019ll include a technical exploration of the learning process that occurs within a neural network. Gradient descent is an introductory topic to many machine learning practitioners.", "\u201cGradient Descent is a very common optimization algorithm, and most likely, the first optimization algorithm a lot of Machine learning engineers and Data scientists are introduced to.\u201d", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
