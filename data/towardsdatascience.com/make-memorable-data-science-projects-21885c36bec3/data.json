There are many qualified candidates, and it can be difficult to differentiate them. For me, the easiest way to separate the strongest applicants from the weaker ones is through looking at their github or kaggle projects.", "After you\u2019ve explored The Projects You Should Do to Get a Data Science Job, it is time to experiment with a few modifications to really make them POP.", "Below are a few of the ways that you can take your projects to the next level.", "Make your projects unique \u2014 Projects should start with a good story. If you have a compelling reason for working with a specific data-set, this gets my attention. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell the story of your project in the github README or at the top of the Kaggle workbook. Unique projects are also harder to replicate. Unfortunately, I have seen some candidates copy work or entire projects without accreditation.", "Collect your own data \u2014 It is pretty easy to get a data-set from kaggle.com. I love it when candidates use alternative approaches for getting data. If they are using an API or scraping the data from a website, this shows me that they are willing to put in the time to get the information that they want. Being able to use API\u2019s and scrape data are extremely valuable tools for data scientists. When doing this for a project, you are demonstrating that they have these skills.", "Use advanced feature engineering \u2014 The model that we build is only as good as the data that goes into it. It is impressive when you get creative by adding new features or by improving the existing features. My most common example of this relates to geo-spatial data. If you have the latitude and longitude of a location, you can find its distance from another location. This distance is almost always more useful than the individual points.", "Reduce features when necessary \u2014 Some of the models that you would like to use don\u2019t handle sparsity or multicollinearity well. If you know why and when to use PCA or other feature reduction techniques, this is always a bonus.", "Build ensemble models \u2014 These methods are fairly commonplace; however, they usually produce the best results. If you haven\u2019t explored combining multiple models, you are being left behind.", "Put them into production \u2014 If you build a API or website for your project, you are completing an end-to-end analysis. One of the most important skills a data scientist can have is to make their work useful. You are showing the practicality of your work by making it accessible to other people.", "Make them valuable to someone \u2014 Doing a project for yourself is great, but sometimes you can use your projects to help others. Perhaps you could do an analysis that helps your local non-profit reduce their costs or helps an animal shelter increase their adoption rate. Projects like these have tangible outcomes and measurable, real world, results. Data science should be about making real-world impact and these projects illustrate that.", "Hopefully these tips will improve the quality of your work and help you to get noticed by employers!", "Your home for data science.
