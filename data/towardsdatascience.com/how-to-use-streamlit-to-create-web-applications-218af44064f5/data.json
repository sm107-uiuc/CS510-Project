These developers take in ideas and images and translate them into code in order for those ideas and images to appropriately display on websites. Data Scientists don\u2019t usually handle front-end development and are more focused on the internal functions of an application or website. They are more concentrated on the back-end of development. As a result, many data scientists may be uncomfortable with the concept of developing a front-end application to display their data science projects. But, there is a simple solution that makes the coding of front-end development much simpler.", "That solution is a Python library called \u2014 Streamlit!", "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes the development of web apps much simpler as well as aesthetically pleasing. This library, like a lot of other Python libraries, makes a complicated and technical task easier for data scientists. The process of coding out a front-end for a data science project is no longer as time-consuming and labour-intensive as it once was.", "Sign up for a Medium Membership here to gain unlimited access and support content like mine! With your support I earn a small portion of the membership fee. Thanks!", "In order to demonstrate the Streamlit usage process, we will begin by taking one of our data science projects:", "And convert the code from that project and turn it into something interactive and visually appealing.", "For a little background on this project, the main idea was to implement unsupervised machine learning to cluster together dating profiles and then match them within their own respective clusters. This would potentially reduce incompatible matches and increase the likelihood compatible profiles would find one another. To learn a little bit more on the coding and development of this project, click the article below:", "This article delves deeper into the clustering algorithms used and the process to create and code those algorithms with a dataset of our own custom dating profiles.", "The nature of this project just begs for user interactions. If we had a dating algorithm that was all just a demonstration then what use would that be? To show the full extent of this project and the capabilities of using machine learning for dating profile matchmaking, we must be able to interact with the algorithm and input data from a user.", "This is where we can implement Streamlit to create a simple user interface that anyone can interact with.", "In order to run Streamlit, we must first install the streamlit library. After it has been installed, then create an empty .py file which we are going to use to code out everything we need for our application to run properly. Feel free to use any IDE you wish.", "Let\u2019s start by importing the libraries and dataset we will be using.", "Here we are loading in all the libraries necessary for our app to run. The datasets are stored in .pkl files. The origin of these datasets were covered in this article:", "However, we refined the process to take in actual labels or categories instead of the numerical values before, which you can see in the Github link below:", "The next thing we imported was the classification model to be used on user inputted data. If you feel the need to learn how we classified the new user data, then check out this article:", "In order to organize our script, we\u2019ll have to create some helper functions to streamline the process when we run our script in Streamlit. We will use these functions later on.", "Let\u2019s explain what each of these functions do:", "The categories used here are options for each profile to select from. It also is the list of choices for the user to input in their own dating profile.", "In order to accurately represent the selections for each fake profile, probabilities for each choice were established based on the popularity of each choice. When choices are randomly selected then these probabilities will be taken into account.", "When a new user interacts with the application, they will be presented with the selections above for each category in their dating profile.", "Now, this is where the streamlit library comes in. Here we will start using streamlit functions in order for our app to run smoothly. Click here to find the documentation for all of the following functions.", "The code above tells streamlit to display the title, headers, and image for the web app. This will be one of the first things a user will see when presented with page.", "Here we are taking in new data that the algorithm will use to find the Top 10 most similar profiles. The information will be stored in a Pandas DataFrame. We are also using our example_bios() function to display random example bios for user reference. We are using Streamlit\u2019s functions to take in text input as well as an optional checkbox that will randomize that category selection if they choose to do so.", "Next, we will have the user make selections if they choose not to randomize their choices.", "Here we do a check to see if the user did or did not check the box asking for random values. If they did choose random values, then the new user profile will contain random values selected for them. However, if they chose to select the values for themselves, then they will be able to select the values for themselves.", "By using the multiselect() function from streamlit, we can have the user select as many choices for the specified category. The slider() function will allow the user to choose their age by interacting with the slider widget. The selectbox() function acts like multiselect except the user can only choose one option.", "After the data has been selected, the first of the formatting process begins by converting the lists given from the multiselect() function to a string and the rest of the dataset as well. This process is done by implementing our string_convert() function within a loop.", "After the user has made their selections for the categories and has entered a bio for themselves, then they will be presented with their dating profile based on the following code:", "From here, the user can update their profile if they wish to change some of their selections or they can proceed to find their Top 10 dating profiles by clicking the highlighted button.", "The following code will execute when the button is clicked. Once it has been clicked then a loading or progress notification will pop up because of with st.spinner(): streamlit animation. This progress bar will display until all the code below it has executed.", "Underneath the spinner function, the helper functions we defined before will be executed to find the Top 10 profiles based on our new user profile data. After the Top 10 profiles have been found then streamlit\u2019s success() (which displays a success notification) and balloons() (which briefly covers the page with animated celebratory balloons) functions will execute. These functions are not completely necessary but are there to make the process more visually appealing.", "After the process is complete, then the Top 10 similar profiles will be displayed:", "We have successfully coded out a streamlit application for our dating algorithm! But in order to view the application in all its glory, you will need to run the application in the command terminal. (Click here for more information). Once we have ran the application in the terminal, we can interact with it as much as we desire.", "Now there may be some potential ways to improve the overall project and presentation so feel free to mess around with the code. Another, way to vastly improve this project is to allow anyone to use the application by just giving them a link to the app. That would require hosting the application on the cloud by either using AWS or Heroku. Be on the lookout for the next article which will delve into deploying the application on the cloud!", "Your home for data science.
