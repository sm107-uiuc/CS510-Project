Originally legalized in 1931, Amendment 13 put an expiration date of January 2020 on all dog racing in the state.", "The Amendment was one of those rare proposals in today\u2019s hyperpolarized times that actually enjoyed bipartisan support: The amendment was proposed by the then-State Attorney General, Republican Pam Bondi, and had support from The Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida, Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, the League of Women Voters, the state\u2019s young Republican caucus \u2014 -the list goes on. Those in support of the ban rallied around one core concern: the welfare of the animals. Greyhounds are incredibly lithe and quick, capable of soaring around the track at speeds rivaling a car. But, unlike a car, when they crash into each other or into the wall, there\u2019s no airbag. Hundreds of animals were recorded as dying at Florida tracks since records started being kept in 2013.[1] Even when they don\u2019t perish in deadly accidents, dogs are routinely found to have been injected with stimulants; steroids, epo, even amphetamines and cocaine, are frequently found in their bloodstream.", "On the flip side, owners and track operators vociferously argued that these were only a few bad apples. They claimed that shutting down the track would kill their livelihood, pose economic ramifications for their communities and the state writ large, and put an end to a tradition that went back nearly a century. Plus, they claimed, greyhounds were bred to be working dogs; according to them, the best things they could do by the dogs is have them race in safe, controlled environments. Others, like the Tampa Bay Times argued that greyhound racing was on its way out anyways. Most tracks weren\u2019t turning much of a profit and haven\u2019t been for quite a while; people have largely lost interest in betting on greyhound racing. Their bit was that we\u2019d all might as well just wait for it to die from economic asphyxiation.", "At the end of the day, though, none of these arguments seemed to persuade the voters all that much. Over 69 percent of them voted yes on the measure, easily surpassing the 60 percent threshold needed to become part of the state\u2019s constitution.", "As a social scientist specializing in political behavior, I often find myself looking at things in the social world and going \u201coh this is cool!\u2026But why?\u201d This vote was one of those occasions, and was interesting to me on a couple levels.", "First, I noticed most of the coverage surrounding the issue concerned the animal rights controversy and the push-back from breeders and track owners. While this is valuable, there wasn\u2019t much on what motivated the voters \u2014 -the 5.4 million people who went to the polls to assert that they wanted this practice to end. What factors motivated their position? Why did they turn out to vote and why did so many vote yes? This was very clearly an important issue to a lot of different kinds of people. I thought it\u2019d be worthwhile just to dig a little deeper from that perspective alone.", "But as I thought about it, the more I realized that the there was a subtle angle to this that dug right at the heart of classical theories of voter participation and choice. Although their arguments were strongly repudiated (possibly because of how baldly self-serving they were), the breeders and owners were right about one thing: these tracks could be a pretty substantial economic interest to the areas immediately surrounding them. There\u2019s a \u201crational\u201d incentive for people living nearby to want to keep them around. There\u2019s been research on how voters reacted to ballot propositions about constructing sports stadiums nearby[2], but there hasn\u2019t been any research that I\u2019m aware of that looks at how proximity to a preexisting resource affects votes surrounding keeping them.", "For the sake of transparency, I can\u2019t exactly claim to be entirely unbiased about this topic. There\u2019s another reason why the question of how tracks affected voter choice and participation stood out to me. I\u2019ve got some fur in this game.", "When election day came, I left the ballot blank on Amendment 13 because I don\u2019t think the issue should be a part of our constitution one way or the other; this is a matter of policy and policy, I feel, should be passed through the legislature rather than be made obdurate by making it a part of the state\u2019s foundational charter. My wife, however, voted \u201cYes\u201d on the ban. When I read that passing the law would mean that thousands of dogs would go homeless, I insisted that we adopt one. After all, our household was partially responsible for their condition \u2014 -the least we could do was open our home and hearts to at least one. (This may or may not have dovetailed with my long-term desire to adopt a dog anyways\u2026).", "Long story short: Meet our greyhound, The Dude (or \u201cDude\u201d for short).", "Dude raced for nearly 3 years under the name \u201cFlyin\u2019 Snapdragon.\u201d During that time, he ran 167 races and won nearly 10% of them. He was retired the month after the vote, although it\u2019s more likely than not that this was going to happen regardless of the outcome. Greyhounds usually compete between the ages of two and five; Dude was just shy of four-and-a-half on his last race.", "We don\u2019t know much about his life during those first four-and-a-half years aside from the sparse metrics tracked for the benefit of gamblers. We know that he could (and still can) reach nearly forty miles an hour in the span of three strides. We know that he fiends for chicken feet and rabbit jerky; we used this to our advantage when we were teaching him how to go up and down the stairs. We know that he got his first toy when he got to his fosters\u2019 house, before he came to ours. We know that his stomach and rump has been balded \u2014 possibly irrevocably, and most likely from having been forced to repeatedly lay on unpadded surfaces for too long. We know that he still knows the sound of the firing gun; he stands stiff, his muscles visibly taut, like a compressed spring straining to uncoil, whenever he hears anything from a stray firework to a muffler backfiring.", "We know that he\u2019s a happy, affectionate boy and that he\u2019s enjoying his retirement. We know that he\u2019s very loved and that he\u2019ll never be for want of toys and comfortable bedding again.", "I don\u2019t want to insinuate that all the people who raced and owned the dogs are heartless or evil. I know that a lot of them care very deeply for their animals and balk at the suggestion that they would do them any harm. But it is, in my view, a problematic industry, filled with perverse incentives. I try my best not to let that view color my quantitative analysis, but I\u2019m not going to insult anyone\u2019s intelligence by pretending that I\u2019ve magically cleaved it off when it comes time to crunch the numbers. After all, its presence is evident in the fact that I\u2019ve even chosen to investigate the topic in the first place. The best I can do is be as upfront and transparent as I can in every step of my analysis.", "On the one hand, we might expect people who lived (and voted) near the tracks would prefer to keep them open. There\u2019s a lot of money being generated by these tracks and people might not want to have a valuable economic resource taken from them. This tracks with classic theories of pocketbook voting: people vote for things that are in their economic self-interest.", "On the other hand, people living closer to the tracks might be less supportive of keeping them open. Being closer during the election (when information against the sport was more readily available due to the activists being more, well, active) might make them reluctant to support having something so controversial so close. After all, no one likes to feel complicit in the mistreatment of animals; the physical proximity may make it difficult to rationalize away feelings of responsibility. Even if voters near the track support the industry as a whole and are skeptical of animal rights activists\u2019 claims, they may not want the track and all its controversy near where they live. In short, they may not mind greyhound racing as an enterprise but feelings of Not In My Back Yard (or NIMBY, for short) may be taking priority.", "Just as with vote choice, the decision of whether or not to vote at all could be driven by proximity to the track in two ways. Those who were closer to the track might be more interested in the issue, which could make them more likely to vote on it. But that proximity might mean that they\u2019re more ambivalent, more conflicted between feelings of NIMBY, economic self-interest, and a bunch of other factors. Ambivalence means that people will not feel much more strongly one way of the issue or another; if people don\u2019t strongly prefer one option over the other, they\u2019re less likely to vote on the issue in general.", "There are, in short, a few different ways that proximity to the tracks could have affected voter\u2019s behavior in 2018. I decided to investigate which, if any, held up to scrutiny. After conducting a spatial analysis of voter turnout and vote data, I found that proximity to a greyhound track, on average, made people more likely to support Amendment 13 but that they were less likely to turnout.", "The next couple sections detail my methods and how I constructed the data. Anyone interested in just the results should skip ahead to the Analysis header.", "There are a few ways that I could have gone about this. Ideally, we could look at records of how everyone in the state voted and compare where they live to the nearest race track. At least that would be ideal if statistical theory was our only consideration. As always, it isn\u2019t. The biggest, most obvious issue is that this would be a violation of the secret ballot. As a general rule, people don\u2019t want everyone to know how they voted \u2014 -which would be necessary with this approach.", "Another possibility is to commission a survey of people randomly selected from the state\u2019s voter file and ask them how they voted. However, while survey data can be incredibly useful in trying to flesh out why people act the way that they do (I\u2019ve designed, implemented, and analyzed surveys for my research; you\u2019re never going to hear me trash-talk them wholesale), they may not be too terribly helpful when asking people to recall how they voted on something over a year ago. People tend to forget their actual position and rationalize that they voted for the option that actually won.", "Instead, I use data that I\u2019ve constructed for VEST (the Voting and Election Science Team), which takes precinct-level shape-files from each county (largely gathered and constructed by the indomitable Brian Amos), merges in precinct-level vote counts on every state-level race in 2018, and aggregates them into a single statewide file. This lets me look at levels of support and turnout for Amendment 13 at the level of each of Florida\u2019s roughly 6,000 precincts[3] and also see how close they are to the state\u2019s open greyhound tracks. I then use linear regression[4], a common tool in computational social science and machine learning, to estimate the effect proximity has on precinct-level voter behavior and see if the effect is statistically significant. I do this analysis in R and have published all of the code I used to do so in my Github \u2014 -although I will also be posting code throughout this article to show how I came to my conclusions.", "In order to figure out how proximity to the state\u2019s greyhound tracks affected political behavior, it might first help to figure out just where the states tracks were in 2018. Emphasis on the past-tense. Depending on who you read, there were 11, 12, or 13 tracks operating in 2018. In 2019, that number has reduced down to six (at time of writing). Shockingly, none of the news reports came with detailed latitude and longitude coordinates on where these tracks were. Surrounded by all of this confusion, I decided to consult \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336l\u0336l\u0336-\u0336k\u0336n\u0336o\u0336w\u0336i\u0336n\u0336g\u0336 \u0336o\u0336r\u0336a\u0336c\u0336l\u0336e\u0336 Wikipedia. Specifically, I looked to their article on Greyhound Racing in the United States to get the names of all the tracks that are on record as operating in the state. I then searched for these names on Google to see if there were any news articles dated prior to November of 2018 that talked about the track shutting down. If the track was still operational at the time of the election, I counted it. This brought me to 13 active tracks in 2018.[5] I then found and recorded the latitude and longitude coordinates for the locations per Google Maps. These can be found at the link above and loaded in by reading the csv.", "Once we\u2019ve settled on how many racing tracks were in the state in 2018 (and where they were located), we can move on to loading in the Florida\u2019s precinct shapefiles. As noted above, I use the st_read function from the sf library. Because the VEST data don't log z coordinates (it makes about as much sense to ask what the elevation of an electoral district is as it is to ask about the sound of a one-handed clap), I let R know that we don't need to worry about that particular dimension.", "What we do need to worry about, though, is how we\u2019re going to compare the location of the greyhound track (a point) to a voting precinct (a polygon \u2014 -and frequently weird, irregular-looking ones at that). The solution I chose to implement was to measure the distance from the center of the precinct (also called the centroid) to the closest track. This boils down to assuming that the precinct centroid represents the average home address for the voters living there. This isn\u2019t 100% true, strictly speaking. Sometimes the centroid suggests that people are living smack-dab in the middle of an uninhabited area, like a lake, a forest, or \u2014 in true Florida Man fashion \u2014 a swamp. But without census data or georeferencing every record in the state voter registration file, it\u2019s a serviceable assumption that reflects the best we can reasonably do.", "Fortunately the st package also has the st_centroid function, which does exactly as the name suggests: finds the centroids of all the spatial objects in the dataframe.", "Using a combination of ggplot and geom_sf, we can take a glance at where all of these centroids are.", "The places where the points melt into amorphous blobs show areas where lots of precincts are packed closely together. Non-coincidentally, these are also some of the most densely populated areas in the state.", "Now that we have the center of the precincts and the location of the state\u2019s dog tracks, we\u2019re just about ready to compare the distances between the two. First, we have to let R know that the tracks dataframe should be read as a spatial object rather than a standard dataframe.", "If we look at information I gathered about the state\u2019s tracks, we can see that the geographic information is represented in two columns: longitude (long) and latitude (lat). The st_as_sf function will convert it into spatial data using these two columns.", "You\u2019ll notice I\u2019ve set an option called \u201ccrs\u201d to a string of seemingly random numbers. CRS stands for Coordinate Reference System \u2014 -and is a necessary consequence of trying to flatten a 3D globe into a 2 dimensional rectangle. Carl Friedrich Gauss was the first to definitively prove that a sphere can\u2019t be flattened to a plane without some kind of distortion.[6] The CRS specifies which of the many widespread, handy distortions we\u2019re using. 4269 sets it to the federal government\u2019s standard NAD83. We need to set the CRS of the tracks to be the same of the precinct centroids, or else we won\u2019t be able to adequately compare the distances between them.", "Now that the data can properly relate to each other, I use the st_distance function to measure the distance between the precinct centroids and the dog tracks. This creates a large matrix (which I've named track.cent.dists) where each row represents a precinct centroid and each column, a greyhound track. The value is the distance between them in meters ([m]). I convert track.cent.dists into a dataframe (that I've called dists.df). I've put a snapshot of the first five columns and rows to give a sense of what it looks like.", "Each of the roughly 6,100 precincts in the shapefile is associated with 13 distances; one distance for each of the states 13 then-operational tracks. While that information is interesting, I\u2019m only interested in the distance of the closest track: that is, the minimum distance. If I were to just use mutate and create a new variable based off the minimum of all the columns (V1, V2, V3...V12, V13) like this:", "it would give me 6,100 rows worth of 330.274[m] \u2014 -which is the shortest distance between a voting precinct and a dog track. Instead, I need to go row-by-row and select the minimum value. There\u2019s a really handy function in the tidyverse called rowwise that lets me do just that. (I also divide the number by 1609 meters to get its value in the more American-standard miles).[7]", "Because each precinct is evaluated in the order it\u2019s listed in the centroid dataframe, we can recover the precinct identifier VEST assigned using cbind.", "And we can then use these IDs to merge with the data in the original precinct statefile. (Be careful to use sp::merge rather than the normal merge when dealing with spatial data!)", "The final step in preparing the data for analysis is to construct my measures for precinct-level vote choice and turnout. For these, I lean on the variables originally found in the VEST data, which are now in the dataframe I\u2019ve called Spatial.Doggies. For vote choice, I divide the number of yes votes on Amendment 13 (G18AM13Yes) by the total number of votes cast on the amendment (G18AM13Sum). For turnout, I divide the number of votes cast on Amendment 13 by the number of registered individuals in the district (SumRegis). I topcode this value at 1 (equal to 100% turnout) to account for counties that counted people voting in precincts aside from those that they registered in.[8] I also remove one precinct name that contains no data and appears to be used by Palm Beach County to designate empty precincts (PAL00NP).", "Using the data we\u2019ve constructed and ggplot, we can see how proximity affected both vote choice and turnout. The figure below shows how distance impacts both precinct-level support (left) and turnout (right) for Amendment 13.", "By and large, most of the state\u2019s precincts were pretty supportive of the measure: the average level of support was 68.5 percent, which tracks pretty dang close to the overall state level of 69.0 percent. It cleared the required 60 percent threshold to become part of the state\u2019s constitution in well over 75 percent of the state\u2019s precincts. Yet even with this general level of support, there\u2019s a pretty clear pattern as shown by the orange trend line: the closer the precinct was to a greyhound track, the greater the voteshare was for banning them.", "The story for turnout is a little more complicated. The 2018 election had extraordinarily high turnout; we haven\u2019t had midterm turnout rates this high since before World War One. And that got a lot of people \u2014 relatively speaking, at least \u2014 voting on the greyhound issue too; the average precinct saw 59.4 percent turnout across the state. But instead of being higher for precincts closer to the tracks, turnout was estimated to be at its lowest. The data suggest a curvilinear pattern, where turnout goes up as we move away from being immediately proximate but start to slink back down once we\u2019ve passed a critical point. This could possibly be that people nearby are ambivalent about the tracks, discouraging them from voting, while people further away are too distant to feel strongly one way or another.", "While this is illuminating, the story is assuredly bound to be more complicated. Looking back at where the state\u2019s racing tracks were located, it seems like the only places that are 120 miles away from any of them are pretty rural. The dog and track owners claimed that racing was a part of their heritage; that could be an argument that is more readily taken up by people in the more rural part of the state since, historically, the people living in such areas in the state tend to be disdainful of perceived government involvement in their heritage. Plus, there could be other confounding factors. Maybe the precinct is more liberal? Even if the Amendment was proposed by the state\u2019s then-Republican Attorney General, animal rights tends to be a cause more zealously taken up by liberals and progressives. Maybe they were more likely to turn out on the amendment because they were already participating in the state\u2019s gubenatorial or senate races? Dog racing may not be something that people went out of their way to vote on, but why not do it if they were already out?", "This is where OLS regression comes in handy. Increasingly used in data science (and the workhorse in quantitative social science for nearly half a century), OLS enables researchers to estimate the independent effect of a particular variable, holding all others included in the model constant. It\u2019s got some wonderful statistical properties that lets it do this (at least when everything works right[9]) \u2014 -but for the intents and purposes of this investigation, all we need to know is that it allows us to see if the effect of distance is still significant when we control for other relevant factors.", "Unfortunately, the VEST data are lacking in this respect. Normally for research on turnout and vote choice, it\u2019s best practice to control for things like age, race, sex, party ID, gender, level of education, interest in politics, feelings about the issue, or at least as many of these things (and others) as we can. The VEST data do not have any of the psychological variables \u2014 it\u2019s kinda outside the project\u2019s purview \u2014 nor any descriptive variables. In theory, it should be possible to take the state\u2019s voter registration file from 2018 and estimate precinct-level characteristics. In fact that\u2019s actually the project\u2019s next planned step when I can squirrel away a couple hours. There are some workable proxies for some of the concepts that provides a decent test for the theory. Specifically, precinct area (a proxy for ruralness), the number of registered voters (a proxy for precinct population), the quotient of registered voters and precinct area (population density), the percent of the precinct that voted for the Democratic gubenatorial candidate Andrew Gillum (precinct-level party ID), and the turnout rate for the governor\u2019s race (down-ballot stimulation). The next couple lines of code adds these variables to the Spatial.Doggies dataframe.", "The next step is to construct a set of linear regressions with precinct-level vote choice and turnout as the outcome variable.", "The table above shows the results of the regression models and the statistical significance of the variables. (For those who are new to understanding regression models: Positive numbers in the estimate columns means that an increase in that number is associated with an increase in the outcome variable; negative results are associated with a decrease in the outcome. Smaller numbers in the significance column means larger degrees of statistical significance). In explaining both the level of support in the precinct and the amount of turnout, distance from the tracks were statistically significant. For every 10 miles of distance a precinct was from the nearest track, average support for the measure dropped by about 1.1 percentage points. This is consistent with the idea that voters wanted the tracks out of their metaphorical backyards \u2014 whether because of increased concern or just to avoid the headache isn\u2019t clear from this analysis. And for every 10 miles of distance, the precinct was expected to have about 0.2 percentage points higher turnout. This is consistent with the idea that the voters were more ambivalent on the topic; they were quite possibly cross-pressured by concerns impelling them to vote both yes and no, so they opted not to vote at all. Both of these values easily exceed traditional levels of statistical significance; we can be quite confident that the effect of mileage from the nearest track isn\u2019t zero. Those numbers don\u2019t seem like a lot, but that\u2019s on the higher end of normal when thinking about the literature on persuasion and turnout effects \u2014 although that\u2019s usually focused on the level of individuals and not voting precincts, so it\u2019s a bit of apples to oranges.", "(As a bit of a nerdy stats digression: Even if I didn\u2019t have all the variables I\u2019d prefer, the models still do a pretty good job at explaining the outcome. The turnout model had an R2 .36 \u2014 -which is actually quite good for social science research \u2014 \u2014 and the R2 in the turnout model was about .95, which is extremely high and extremely rare. These numbers mean that my models explain 36 and 95 percent of the variance in the outcomes, respectively \u2014 -meaning that even these simple models do a pretty good job at explaining precinct-level vote choice and turnout. It can always be improved, but I\u2019m fairly confident that the relationships being observed here is at least in the right general direction.)", "To wrap up my analysis, I decided to visualize each of the state\u2019s precincts based upon whether they had low, medium, and high turnout and low, medium, and high support, relative to the rest of the state [10]. I\u2019m saving how I made this map for another post, but I thought it was simply too cool not to share.", "While the vote itself is history, this story is far from over. Track and dog owners are currently suing the state, claiming that the state\u2019s Constitutional Revision Commission unconstitutionally targeting their industry. They argue that, at the very least, they deserve to be compensated for the worth of their animals and/or property. One owner claimed that each of their dogs was worth up to $50,000. If that\u2019s the case, then we got Dude for an absolute steal. It cost us only $300 to adopt him from our local Greyhound Rescue of America chapter and the joy he brings in our lives makes that 50k look like a paltry sum. (And, believe me, I don\u2019t say that lightly given my student loans\u2026)", "It would be difficult to drum up support for these individuals are really after: a repeal. Amendment 13 passed with overwhelming support across most of the state in a high turnout year. Even the voters in the same precinct as one of the tracks weren\u2019t inclined to vote to keep them open. It may not necessarily be because they disagree with the idea of dog racing \u2014 -the evidence from the precinct-level turnout is consistent with what we\u2019d see if proximal folk were highly ambivalent \u2014 -but there\u2019s a cost that comes with having something that controversial so close to home.", "At least in Florida, greyhound racing has run its course.", "Peter R. Licari is a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Florida specializing in American Political Behavior, and Political Methodology. The opinions expressed are his own. He can also be found on YouTube and on Twitter(@PRLPoliSci). What little spare time remains is dedicated to long-distance running, video games with his ever-patient wife, Stephanie, walking his dog, Dude, and holding oddly productive one-sided conversations with his cat, Asia.", "[1] There\u2019s also very little evidence to suggest that these data are complete. In fact, the lack of fastidious record keeping was among animal activists\u2019 complaints", "[2] (In short, it depends on how much the stadium would disrupt their lives and livelihoods.)", "[3] Electoral precincts are districts maintained by the county to make administering elections more manageable. Generally, people are assigned to vote in a particular precinct based off of the address listed in their voter registration. There can be anywhere from a handful to a few thousand people registered to vote in each precinct.", "[4] I opted for linear regression over logistic regression because, although I\u2019m using proportions, I do not have access to the pattern of the underlying values (due to the secret ballot). I could have conceivably used tobit regression, but there was no evidence of censorship \u2014 -values were pretty generally reasonably constrained.", "[5] As an aside, it also allowed me to piece together the ambiguity because even Wikipedia noted 11 tracks in 2018. Several tracks are operated by the same company, housed out of the Jacksonville area. For my analysis, what mattered is that people were near the place where the dogs physically raced \u2014 -so I stuck with the 13 figure.", "[6] The applications to mapping is immediately obvious, but this gets even more complicated by the fact that the Earth isn\u2019t a perfect sphere.", "[7] That\u2019s right fellow track athletes, current and former: a mile is not 1600 meters. It\u2019s a hair over 1609. It turns out very few of us actually have recorded times in the true one mile race as opposed to the 1600. It may seem pedantic, but it translates to about 1.3 seconds slower at world record pace.", "[8] Before anyone jumps the gun (pun intended): This doesn\u2019t mean that people committed fraud by voting in the wrong precinct. Some counties are more lenient about where they\u2019ll let people vote than others. People going to the wrong spot is rare \u2014 -and voter fraud is even rarer \u2014 -so it\u2019s an unfortunate but infinitesimal amount of error in the data.", "[9] For the curious, I also ran the models controlling for geographic clustering in the error term. The results were substantively similar.", "[10] I defined low and high both as being more than one standard deviation away from the average value. Medium, then, was within a 1 standard deviation difference", "I\u2019m a data scientist and social scientist specializing in political behavior.
