I have been training my model for 10 hrs but my model is yielding very bad accuracy although it performs exceptionally well on training data what\u2019s the issue ?", "Bob : Oh !! It seems your model is overfitting on training data, Did you use regularization ?", "This kind of problems related to overfitting is common in ML and there are many ways to avoid such problems but why does this problem occur ?", "It seems pretty simple process to train a model :", "The main cause of overfitting may be traced back to the starting two processes, collection and pre processing of data. A data collection that has uneven distribution of features, contains noises, random fluctuations in data, a very high variance may have an opposite effect on model training. These random errors and fluctuations are learned by the model while training so well that training data model\u2019s accuracy becomes very high causing overfitting of data. Sometimes more than required training can lead to overfitting.", "It can be observed easily that higher the weights higher is the non linearity, so an easy way would be to penalize the weights while they are updated. At this point we have two such techniques using this idea.", "The way this works is that it adds a penalty term with a parameter \u03bb in the error function that we need to reduce. W is nothing but the weight matrix here.", "Here, \u03bb is a hyper parameter whose value is decided by us. If \u03bb is high it adds high penalty to error term making the learned hyper plain almost linear, if \u03bb is close to 0 it has almost no effect on the error term causing no regularization.", "L1 regularization is often seen as a feature selection technique too as it zero out the respective weights of features undesired. L1 is also computationally inefficient on non-sparse cases. L1 may be seen sometimes being called as Lasso regression.", "L2 regularization may not seem quite different from L1, but they have almost non similar impact. Here weights \u2018w\u2019 are squared individually and then added. L1\u2019s feature selection property is lost here but it provides better efficiency on non-sparse cases. Sometimes L2 is known by name ridge regression. parameter \u03bb works same as L1.", "Early Stopping : We have added penalty to control the values of weights till now but there are other ways to regularize too, what if when the train error starts going down and test error starts going up while training, we stop the training. This will give us the desired setup of train test error. This technique is often termed as early stopping. This technique may give us the desired result but generally this is not recommended by some people.", "Dropout : This is an interesting way to regularize a neural network first proposed by Srivastava et.al.(2014), The paper proposed that some of the nodes in a layer must be randomly picked and should be dropped/ignored during training.", "Every node is provided with a probability of being dropped, say a node has drop_prob =0.4, so it has 40% chance of being dropped and 60% chance of being picked up. Every time this probability will cause neural network to change its shape, looking as a new network every time. This technique seemed to have pretty much solved the problem of regularization. Probability of dropping is not kept high as it will make the network sparse causing underfitting.", "Data Augmentation : We may see overfitting problems in computer vision and data augmentation is a better solution for this. We just need to augment the images on our own like flip, crop, rotate the image.", "This type of augmentation seem to yield a better result as it gives a chance to train on some deformed images and other variations also data augmentation helps when there is less data is available.", "These are a few regularization techniques that are helpful in tackling with overfitting. Sometimes tuning hyper parameters may give the desired result but if there is no improvement then these above techniques surely solve this problem.", "Your home for data science.
