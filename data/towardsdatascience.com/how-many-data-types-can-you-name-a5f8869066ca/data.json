Got them? Now let\u2019s play bingo! (Look for the bolded words.)", "Back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, it was fashionable to kick a statistics textbook off with a first chapter on the basics of data.", "To make sure that students had something to memorize for their first test, opening chapters usually included some jargon for different kinds of data:", "What is counting versus measuring? Poetry. It sounds cute if you\u2019re a beginner, until you recall a lesson from elementary school about how integers are real numbers too. (And is any measurement really continuous if your instruments aren\u2019t precise? And aren\u2019t those instruments just counting?) Or you take a math class on measure theory, whereupon your head explodes. Never mind, you\u2019ll get the gist if you don\u2019t think about it too much.", "If your Baby\u2019s First Stats book didn\u2019t make the continuous-versus-discrete distinction, it might have preferred these terms:", "Categorical data can be divided into:", "You might also have been taught jargon like:", "When the data are nominal, they identify a category but they don\u2019t carry any notion of rank or scale. Ordinal data tells you about order (thank goodness for sensible jargon), but \u2014 as with clothing sizes \u2014 the distance between small and medium might have nothing to do with the distance between medium and large. Cardinal data means you\u2019ve got a constant interval between ranks, as with Starbucks cups (where the increment is 4 ounces of liquid: Tall = 12 oz, Grande = 16 oz, Venti = 20 oz). Cardinal data can easily be reduced down to ordinal or nominal, but you need context (outside data / experience) to attempt augmenting your data in the opposite direction. If I tell you that I drank \u201ca lot of espresso\u201d this morning, you\u2019d have to know me better to understand what that actually means.", "You may have learned to split numerical data into:", "The reason students are taught this ratio versus interval distinction is to remind them to be careful with mathematical operations on quantities of arbitrary scale, since that\u2019s something only someone half as smart as you would do.*", "Be careful with mathematical operations on quantities of arbitrary scale.", "If you keep your wits about you and your nonsense radar tuned, you needn\u2019t worry about this distinction.", "Another subcategory of numerical data has to do with imperfect information. Imagine attempting to record the IQ of an alien whose intelligence so far outstrips ours that we can\u2019t begin to measure it.", "Note that sometimes censored data will be recorded without any kind of > indicator, so what you\u2019ll see is relatively few 159s and then a whole surprise of 160s. Aha! That\u2019s the calling card of data censorship.", "Not all data you encounter will be accurate or useful. In fact, most of it will be dodgy. Keep your wits about you.", "It\u2019s bad enough when our tools aren\u2019t able to fulfill our measurement wishes, but things get even stickier when bad data has a cognitive/social origin. Humans make data, so it tends to inherit the (potentially flawed) perspectives of its authors\u2026 which brings us to the concept of biased data. That topic deserves its own set of articles, available here.", "The discussion above is in danger of giving you the impression that a datapoint always fits in a single number and that every observation is hermitically sealed from its neighbors. Not so! Time for more jargon:", "In moving from univariate to multivariate, you\u2019ll be expanding your view from random variable to random vector\u2026 but why stop there? There\u2019s a whole array of fun to be had with a random matrix. By the way, you\u2019re looking at a random matrix at this very moment, since that\u2019s how images are stored.", "If random vectors are too bland for you, feel free to play with random sequences or random processes instead.** These are sequential data, characterized by an obsession with order. Examples include songs, stock market data, reinforcement learning training sets, and predator-prey systems. What makes order so important is that the previous step in the sequence or process has an important influence on the next one. In other words, we\u2019re talking about the kind of dependent data (as opposed to independent data) where nearby entries of the vector are correlated.", "When it comes to real-world sequential data, the culprit behind the correlation structure is often either time (time series data) or space (spatial data) or both (spatiotemporal data). Some people prefer the term panel data for multidimensional time series data. Special cases include longitudinal data and cross-sectional data.", "While we\u2019re enjoying this bingo frenzy, I\u2019d better not forget to mention sample data versus population data as well as some provenance-related terms, such as structured data versus unstructured data, primary data versus inherited (secondary) data, captured data versus exhaust data, raw data versus processed data. If you\u2019re interested in snarky explanations, head over to my article on data provenance.", "If you\u2019re a computer science enthusiast, your instinctive answer is probably, \u201cThe number of data types depends on the programming language.\u201d", "In this context, data types are much stricter, defining the operations that can be done and how those data are stored. The tricky thing is that there\u2019s usually more than one way to skin, er, *store* a cat and the whole question of the \u201cright\u201d data type boils down to what\u2019s efficient given the underlying rules of the language you\u2019re using.", "For example, if you were working with a five in a language like C++ or Python, your needs dictate whether you\u2019d choose to store it as int(5) or as float (5.000000000000000) or some of the other types from the bingo boards below.", "Additional precision often comes at a memory cost, so when you\u2019re working with data at scale, choosing the leanest data type for your needs could yield huge savings in terms of hardware cost/time. Similarly, you might try to save on memory use in C++ by storing that 5 as a char (just the character \u201c5\u201d, costing 1 byte instead of 4) but then you\u2019d have to deal with the annoyance of converting it back to some kind of number in order to do math with it. This can also be costly in terms of hardware and time. If you\u2019re considering becoming a professional software engineer or a data engineer, you\u2019ll need to commit the effort to become one with your languages\u2019 data types.", "In computer science, the pedagogical focus is on preventing the computer from doing stupid things with data. In statistics, it\u2019s about preventing *you* from doing stupid things with data.", "These statistical terms are useful as clues about the information you can tease out of your data and which mathematical operations will produce nonsense.", "In other words, the various statistical terms are useful as clues about the information you can tease out of your data and which mathematical operations will produce nonsense. Consider, for example, all these different ways of recording the day of the week:", "From the Python coder\u2019s point of view, you\u2019ll be mumbling \u201cinteger, string, float, string (okay, date, but\u2026 string), integer\u201d as you read the columns. When you peer at it through a statistics lens, you\u2019ll struggle to restrain a few expletives.", "The bottom row shows what happens if you try to take an average. When it works, you\u2019ll wish it didn\u2019t. While you might have chosen to store the day as an integer (see how that November date messes with the last column?) or as a float with week.day (the average in column 3 says week 1 day 9), that\u2019s not what the information, ahem, means.", "When you\u2019re in the data science game, it\u2019s vital to think about the kind of information you\u2019re working with so you can torture it humanely, only subjecting it to transformations that preserve meaning.", "It\u2019s your responsibility to prevent your tools from committing crimes against common sense.", "If you shove your data into someone else\u2019s code, it will mindlessly attempt to follow instructions written by some caffeine-guzzling engineer who knows nothing about your situation. Don\u2019t expect the software to tell you that you shouldn\u2019t take an average of 1.1 through 2.7. That\u2019s on you.", "Data types in statistics typically have analogs in your favorite programming language, though it\u2019s not a one-to-one mapping (there\u2019s an art to choosing data types to make your code purr). To oversimplify, continuous data maps nicely to the floating-point number, count data to the integer, binary data to the Boolean, and categorical data to the enumerated type. Everything has a buddy on both sides of the fence, though I\u2019ll be the first to admit that multiple names for the same thing doesn\u2019t make learning all this any easier. The good news is that you needn\u2019t memorize anything (unless your professor sets silly exams) since you\u2019ll naturally absorb what\u2019s useful as you make use of it.", "In computer science and engineering, the concept of data types is strict, since each programming language comes with concrete rules on how data types are treated, what you can do with them, and how they\u2019re stored.", "In computer science, it\u2019s about preventing the computer from doing stupid things with data. In statistics, it\u2019s about preventing *you* from doing stupid things with data.", "In statistics, data types relate to how we think about the information conveyed by a quantity rather than how that quantity is encoded (although eventually, one hot day of coding, we\u2019ll find ourselves rolling up our sleeves to ponder the encoding as well).***", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "Let\u2019s be friends! You can find me on Twitter, YouTube, Substack, and LinkedIn. Interested in having me speak at your event? Use this form to get in touch.", "*Try not to take my jokes too literally; IQ is another example of interval data. And it\u2019s also an example of major issues with bias and measurement validity, but that\u2019s a story for another time.", "**Yes, you can upgrade to matrix versions here too, e.g. video data. These are called random fields. Other extensions of the random vector include random networks, which let you play with a bunch of random vectors / matrices / processes all linked by a graph.
