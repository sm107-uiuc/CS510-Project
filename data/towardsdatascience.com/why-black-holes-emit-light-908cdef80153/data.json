As a result, black holes can only absorb matter. A consequence of this property is that the size of black holes never decreases. However, when quantum effects are taken into account, this scenario changes drastically. As this article will show, due to vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields in the vicinity of its surface (the so-called event horizon), the black hole emits particles, such as photons (particles of light), neutrinos and others. Black holes, therefore, are not completely black! The author of this groundbreaking discovery was the famous British physicist Stephen Hawking.", "The prediction that particles are emitted by static black holes surprised (to put it mildly) the physics community. Previous work, also by Hawking, showed that rotating black holes create particles. But contrary to his expectation that, in the absence of rotation, no particles would be produced, he found that even static black holes create particles.", "In this article, I will follow the derivation in Mukhanov and Winitzki of the Hawking temperature for a massless scalar field in 2-dimensional spacetime (the derivation in 4-dimensional spacetime can be found in Hawking\u2019s original paper).", "The standard explanation of the origin of the Hawking radiation is the following. Quantum fluctuations are, in general, characterized by the constant production of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. What often happens in the vicinity of the black hole\u2019s event horizon is that one of the two particles crosses the horizon while the other particle escapes as Hawking radiation.", "Though this explanation is ubiquitous, it does not correspond precisely to the actual computation, which will be explained here. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Schmelzer and Baez.", "The Schwarzschild black hole is nonrotating and spherically symmetric. It is the simplest black hole and contains only one parameter, its mass M. The 2D Schwarzschild line element in spherical coordinates reads:", "For a detailed explanation of the expression above see the following article.", "Eq. 1 seems to indicate that there are two singularities (locations in spacetime where the gravitational field becomes infinite) in the Schwarzschild metric, one at r=0 and another at r= 2M, the so-called Schwarzschild radius. More specifically, substituting r= 2M, the two components of the line element become:", "However, as will be shown in the next section, the only physical singularity of the Schwarzschild black hole is at r=0. The apparent singularity at r = 2M is, in fact, merely a coordinate singularity that can be removed by changing to a new system of coordinates. To show that, we will introduce the so-called Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates.", "The Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates are obtained as follows. First, one defines the \u201ctortoise coordinate\u201d r*(r) and the corresponding tortoise lightcone coordinates:", "Notice that r* is singular at r = 2M. This implies that the tortoise lightcone coordinates, which are also singular at r = 2M, do not cover the region where r < 2M, which is defined as the interior of the black hole. To cover the full Schwarzschild black hole spacetime, we need to change our coordinate systems again. This new coordinate system will be the analytical extension of the Kruskal\u2013Szekeres lightcone coordinates which is defined as follows:", "Now compare it with Eq. 1. We see that with this choice of coordinate system, the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius r=2M vanishes. Hence, as previously mentioned, r = 2M is a coordinate singularity (an artifice of the coordinate system) and not a physical singularity. This means that when a free-falling observer crosses the radius r = 2M, he will not feel anything unusual.", "Now, note that the Kruskal\u2013Szekeres lightcone coordinates have the following domain of validity: -\u221e< u <0 and 0 < v < \u221e. These coordinates do not cover the region r < 2M. In other words, they are valid only outside the black hole, for r >2M. Note, however, that the line element Eq. 5 is well-defined for all -\u221e< u <\u221e and -\u221e < v < \u221e, covering all Schwarzschild spacetime. We must then analytically extend the coordinates u and v to include values u > 0 and v < 0.", "Following Mukhanov and Winitzki we can express the new, Kruskal\u2013Szekeres lightcone coordinates (u, v) in terms of the original (t, r) using Eqs. 3, 4, and 5. We obtain the following two relations:", "Provided we analytically continue u and v, these relations will be valid for all Schwarzschild black hole spacetime.", "To obtain the well-known Kruskal-Szekeres diagram for the Schwarzschild black hole we introduce two new coordinates, namely", "Now, to cover the full diagram we have to extend the coordinates (u, v). Expressing the extended variables (u, v) in terms of the original coordinates (t, r) we obtain two sets of coordinates, namely:", "The Kruskal-Szekeres diagram is shown below:", "For simplicity, let us write the action of a scalar massless field in curved spacetime with two-dimensions:", "The scalar field equation corresponding to S can be written in terms of lightcone tortoise coordinates or Kruskal\u2013Szekeres lightcone coordinates. In both cases, it is a sum of two terms:", "This is a consequence of the conformal invariance of S (which is explained in more detail in one of my previous articles). The As and Bs are well-behaved functions (with and without the \u201c~\u201d). A simple example is the following solution:", "The Schwarzschild line element written in terms of the lightcone tortoise coordinates is given by:", "At very large distances from the black hole, this line element becomes:", "We see that very far from the black hole, the proper time of a stationary observer coincides with t in Eq. 15. Hence, this observer associates the modes with positive \u03c9s (the frequencies with respect to t) with particles (see Mukhanov and Winitzki).", "As usual in quantum field theory, we expand the field in terms of creation and annihilation operators:", "The vacuum corresponding the b annihilation operator is called Boulware vacuum and it contains no particles according to the observer that is located at large distances from the black hole:", "Since, as we saw before, the lightcone tortoise coordinates only cover part of the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime (outside the horizon), the Boulware vacuum has singular behavior on the horizon, and therefore it is not physically valid. Furthermore, the corresponding energy density would diverge at the horizon and quantum fluctuations would generate a strong backreaction which would invalidate the underlying hypothesis of a weakly perturbed classical gravitational field.", "In contrast with the lightcone tortoise coordinates, the Kruskal\u2013Szekeres lightcone coordinates cover all Schwarzschild black hole spacetime and are well-defined (nonsingular) at the event horizon. In the neighborhood of the horizon the line element in Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates reads:", "Hence, an observer that moves across the event horizon is associated with a mode with frequency \u03c9 > 0 with respect to T. Again expanding the field as in Eq. 16 we obtain:", "The nonsingular vacuum state now has a finite energy density leading to a small backreaction of the quantum fluctuations, keeping the classical gravitational field weekly perturbed as it should. The Kruskal vacuum, which obeys", "can, therefore, be identified with the \u201ctrue\u201d vacuum close to a black hole.", "Now, for the distant observer, the Kruskal\u2013Szekeres vacuum contains particles! Their number density can be obtained following precisely the procedure at the end of one of my previous articles, linked below. The only modification we need to do is to substitute the acceleration a by the term 1/4M (the so-called surface gravity).", "We then obtain the following expression for the thermal spectrum measured by the distant observer and the corresponding Hawking temperature:", "The Hawking radiation is very dim and is swamped by the radiation emitted by the enormous amounts of hot gas that fall into all black holes we currently identify.", "That could be one of the reasons why it hasn\u2019t been observed yet. From Eq. 21, we see that only black holes with tiny mass would emit Hawking radiation with measurable intensities.", "My Github and personal website www.marcotavora.me have some other interesting material both about physics and other topics such as math, machine learning, deep learning, and finance.
