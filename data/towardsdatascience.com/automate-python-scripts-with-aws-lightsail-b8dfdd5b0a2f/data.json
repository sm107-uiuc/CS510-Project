When most people hear the words data science, they often think machine learning and AI, but really most of a data scientist\u2019s time is spent on various kinds of work. In this blog I will be focusing on the data collection automation using AWS Lightsail.", "The project outlined below is all hosted on my github", "1. Create a AWS Lightsail Ubuntu instance", "2. Apply a dedicated IP address to the instance", "3. Install Python3.7 and PIP on the Ubuntu instance", "4. Clone python repository to the instance", "5.

Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS if you just need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly \u2014 a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP. After you create your instance, you can easily connect to it. You can manage your instances using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, or Lightsail command line interface (CLI).

Click on the Create instance button (circled above).", "2. Under pick your instance image, select Linux/Unix", "5. Choose your instance Plan: For this project I will be using the cheapest option ($3.50) as it is more than sufficient to run most python scripts. Also, don\u2019t forget the first month is free!", "6. Name your instance: For this project I named the instance \u201cUbuntu-Automation\u201d", "After selecting Create Instance you will be returned to the AWS LightSail dashboard.

While the instance is being created, the status will be \u201cPending\u201d like in the screenshot below:", "The status will change to \u201cRunning\u201d once the instance has been created. You will also see the IP address assigned to the instance, for my instance the IP address is 3.227.241.208. This IP address is dynamic and will change every time you reboot the instance. Depending on the project you plan on hosting it may be necessary to set a Static IP address.", "Creating a static IP is optional and only necessary if your project requires it. I will be creating a static IP address because I open my SQL server only to this IP address for security reasons.

Users that set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.
