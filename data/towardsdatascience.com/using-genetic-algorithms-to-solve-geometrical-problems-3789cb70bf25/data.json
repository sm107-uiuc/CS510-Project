This ted talk featured a segment where a car model was generated using an intuitive AI. This segment was brief and did not go into the specifics of what type of AI and how it was achieved, so I decided to try and replicate a smaller scale version of this project, using genetic algorithms.", "Why did I pick genetic algorithms? Genetic algorithms, unlike neural network, can generate content easily, without the need to convolute an image and then transpose it back into its original dimensions. Additionally, it is extremely difficult to find data on car models in the right format, so that a GAN or a Neural network can have a reference point to start with.", "With the project type outlined, the question remains: How should I simplify the problem?", "Instead of generating low-air-resistance cars, I will go with the simple idea of creating a shape of the largest area, consisting of n points, in a join-the-dot type fashion.", "The area of the shape will be calculated using the Shoelace formula. A brief explanation of how it works can be deduced from the name: The cross multiplication of the coordinates of the points creates a shoelace type pattern.", "I will then use a genetic algorithm (adapted from this code to train neural networks to generate shapes) to generate a list of numbers, that can be then converted into coordinates, which draws out a shape, in which the area can be measured.", "The prerequisites are the basic dependencies that the program needs to function. Random is for the random generation of agents, numpy for the initialization and manipulation of matrices, and IPython display for removing the clutter on the screen.", "For the sake of simplicity, the only activation function I will use for this project is the sigmoid function.", "The polyarea function is an implementation of the shoelace algorithm using numpy as the mathematical basis.", "This is the start of the program, with the creation of the genetic algorithm class and the execute function.", "The agent has a blueprint that contains the instructions for a network propagation. Within the agent\u2019s init, a neural network class initialized, and its weights randomly generated based on a given matrix structure.", "This function, given the population size and network structure as parameters, generates a population of agents, with neural networks of randomly generated weights.", "We will be feeding latent points as the input to the neural networks. Because of this, the network will have multiply tries to generate the shapes. The average area of these shapes will be recorded.", "Theoretically, the algorithm will generate an agent that can consistently generate high area shapes with n points. Observing these shapes will give insight into creating large areas.", "This part of the program is the selection algorithm, that sorts the agents in reverse order, based on their fitness values. It then exterminates all agents that are not in the top fifth of this list.", "Two random parents, from the top 20% of the population are chosen. They then breed. How is this done:", "This hopefully allows for the good traits of good parents to be passed on to their offspring.", "For every agent, there is a 10% chance that a mutation will occur. In this case, mutation refers to a certain weight value being replaced with a random float value. This is done by flattening the weights, finding a random weight to change, and then finally reshaping the weights to be reinserted into the agent.", "Paste this final bit of code into the function and the function should run when called.", "One can change the number of points that the program can use to create the shapes, as well as the number of times the program can generate points, to get the average. Change these values around and you might find something interesting!", "You might be thinking: What is the purpose of this project? Why is this project useful? Two reasons.", "Firstly, from a pragmatic standpoint, to progress to more complex models, such as those involving physical forces or multi-dimensional shapes, more experience with the program is required.", "Secondly, it is useful for curiosity. If I chose to adapt the network to output the number of points as well as the coordinates of the points, I could use machine learning to reinforce the theory that hexagons hold the largest area to myself!", "If you want to see more of my content, click this link.", "Your home for data science.
