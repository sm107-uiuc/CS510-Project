However, the basics of machine learning are incomplete without a comprehensive understanding of the various regression models available. The objective of this article is to provide beginners and aspiring enthusiasts with the skillset and framework needed to explore and advance in this field. Welcome to the beginning of the future.", "So what exactly is regression? Regression is a statistical tool that helps in identifying and implementing a relationship between dependent and independent variables of a given dataset. However, when talking about linear regression in specific we consider a linear relationship between one independent and one dependent variable. We will use relatively simple datasets to understand these concepts.", "Now, the above equation is the mathematical representation of linear regression and various such regression lines can be formed for a given set of data. However, the best fitting regression is one that best fits the given dataset, and results in the best possible prediction.", "Our dataset forms the basis of prediction for any given model and must provide an accurate reflection for our prediction. For any dataset to be usable for the implementation of machine learning models its must be cleaned and sorted. This article will describe various such data processing methods.", "The dataset provided above shows data that provides the individual SAT scores and GPA of an individual, thus providing us with an ideal scenario for the application of linear regression. The snapshot consists of only 10 data points, however, the actual dataset consists of 84 such data points.", "We will be coding using python as our primary language, to implement these models, our first step should be to import all the necessary libraries required, in this case.", "NumPy: adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.", "pandas: it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.", "matplotlib: is a library used for graphical representation.", "next, we import the given dataset using \u201cpd.read_csv\u201d and store it in a variable. It is beneficial to make variables as self-explanatory as possible.Lastly, we must allocate our independent variable to variable x and the dependent variable to y, we do this by using \u201c .iloc\u201d method to select the respective columns for the implementation.", "Split the dataset into two parts- a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train your model and make it \u201clearn\u201d from the dataset, whereas the testing dataset will allow us to test our trained model and check its accuracy.", "The sklearn library is used for various data processing functions. We use this library to divide our dependent variable(x) and independent variable (y) into their respective test sets and training sets.", "Where the magic happens: training your very first machine learning model", "Next, we again use our sklearn library to train our model using the training set partition of our dataset. We create an object by the name of the regressor and use it to call Linear Regression.", "we simply use the command above to predict \u201cx_test\u201d for our trained \u201cx_train\u201d model.", "Now we must visualize our results to understand how our regression line matches our data points. We use Matplotlib to do this.", "Our subsequent regression models will work with multiple variables, this is an important milestone in machine learning since various outcomes are dependent on more than a single independent variable. Multivariable regression is the gateway to a plethora of such applications.", "Let us consider a dataset which we will use for all the subsequent models.", "Our current dataset looks considerably more complicated in comparison to our previous dataset this is owing to a larger number of columns that act as multivariable factors that influence our outcome.", "We will use sklearn to import our model and implement it on our X_train and y_train partitions of data.", "This time we will predict actual results from our model, we will do this by implementing the following lines of code.", "We use the regressor object to call the predict method on our X_test partition then we use the subsequent lines of code to simultaneously print y_pred and y_test. This helps us compare our predicted values with our expected values.", "The article above is a brief introduction to the world of data, it is based on the idea of using data as a powerful tool to make accurate predictions. I will be writing about various other regression and classification models and their application to build on this foundation. Stay tuned.", "Your home for data science.
