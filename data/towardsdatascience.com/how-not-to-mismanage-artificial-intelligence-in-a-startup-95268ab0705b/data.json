Instead, complement an existing product with AI.", "Solve a problem with software or hardware, sell that, then augment it later with AI. Or if you\u2019re an AI expert, join an existing startup as a late stage cofounder.", "This way, you\u2019re already sitting on data, and have room to experiment.", "It\u2019s easier for Audi to start working on self driving cars than for a room of AI PhDs. The latter needs to acquire proprietary data, and make industry connections before even beginning.", "Machine learning is best focused on marginal improvements. That means, going from 100% to 110%.", "Building competency in AI+domain takes time, no matter how much previous experience you have.", "Classifying dog breeds in a Kaggle competition (where you\u2019re given classes in advance), doesn\u2019t necessarily transfer to a real domain where you need to come up with classes yourself.", "A good strategy is to find repetitive decisions that team members are already making, and try to automate those. Processes with existing SOPs are ideal.", "Build up competence before solving the game changing problems. Anecdotally, if it\u2019s hard for a human to ingest information and make a decision, it will be near impossible for an AI to do it.", "Don\u2019t expect to throw data at a neural network and have solutions come out the other side. This doesn\u2019t happen outside large companies\u2019 press releases.", "Often there is a huge component of software engineering integrated with the AI, stacked over multiple layers, even if it looks simple from the outside.", "Use AI to solve small narrow problems and stack these together in combination with domain knowledge.", "Deep learning rarely generates miracles, but incremental improvements over time can.", "Your data is your moat. You worked hard to collect it.", "Train your models in house rather than feeding data to an AI service from one of the large cloud providers.", "They\u2019re more than happy to transfer learnings from it to any other paying competitor. That\u2019s not what you want.", "For very marginal improvements outside your core product, the risk can be worth it. But as a general rule, don\u2019t let anyone near your data.", "Most of the time, this is not that difficult.", "We\u2019re past the point where mentioning \u201cAI\u201d gets you extra points with customers. There\u2019s been too much hype.", "Everyone is pretending to use AI nowadays. So focus more on solving your customers\u2019 problems than projecting cool tech.", "If they ask about the AI, great. Otherwise, take their money and solve their problem.", "They\u2019ll be equally happy however it was accomplished.", "After an experiment, always writeup what was tried and the results. This includes wild successes and complete failures.", "Staff will come and go and brains will forget. Knowledge is difficult enough to transfer with good documentation.", "So if you\u2019ve spent days, weeks or months on a project.
