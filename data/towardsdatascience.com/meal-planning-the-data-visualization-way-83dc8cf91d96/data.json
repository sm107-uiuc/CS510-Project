And curry. And order sushi!", "Actually picking food to make for a whole week is a balancing act between everyone\u2019s preferences, our budget, and a bunch of opinions about what constitutes healthy choices. And, we would also like grocery shopping to be easy, and to not have to buy a large quantity of something that will go to waste (looking at you, bunches of coriander).", "So, I built a small app that generates meal plan suggestions and visualizes the overlap between ingredients. Because you upload your own data file of recipes, you can choose how to categorize ingredients, and therefore the app can help optimize for whatever is important to you. For example:", "The tech here is not complicated. Basically, the app takes a file with a list of recipes, associated metadata (like the URL) and a list of ingredients by category. It looks like this:", "You pick an initial recipe of interest to get started, and then the algorithm adds new recipes to the meal plan until you have 5 (or however many you want). The next recipe is selected by intersection over union \u2014 the count of ingredients that a recipe shares with all ingredients in the meal plan so far, divided by the count of all ingredients. This formula is then randomized slightly so we get recipes that share something in common, but not ten different versions of paella.", "Intersection over union actually maps pretty closely to my thought process for doing meal planning in the dark old pre-app days. So, I designed the output to visualize which ingredients are common or unique to each recipe.", "Ingredients are colored by the \u201ccategory\u201d specified in the recipe file. This makes it really easy to see whether we have a variety of proteins, or veggies, or grains, or whatever. You could conceivably set the categories by the grocery store where each item is cheapest/most regularly available, or by the categories used by a diet regimen.", "Above I can see that two of the meals have rice, and two have noodles, and another one doesn\u2019t have any carbs. Maybe I want to buy bread for that? One meal has no protein, so maybe I want to add something to the recipe. We use several veggies in multiple recipes, so it makes sense to buy in bulk. Scallions are also frequent offenders in the \u201ctoo much per bundle and hard to freeze so they end up going bad category\u201d, so it\u2019s good that they are used in three recipes.", "The application is built on Jupyter Lab and uses Jupyter Widgets for controls.", "You can search recipes by name and ingredient.", "You can change the number of recipes per week and get new meal plan suggestions.", "You can save meal plans and return to them later.", "Lastly, hovering over a recipe will show it\u2019s name and metadata. We use this for the cookbook or URL where the recipe lives, but you could also add cuisine, number of calories or weight watchers points, etc.", "You can access the app on Binder, or clone it from GitHub. The only thing required is a file of recipes that you like to make. Ours has 300+ rows and took a couple hours of going through cookbooks to create. Alternatively, the app loads by default with a sample file of recipes pulled from the Spoonacular API. You can get as many recipes as you want using the get_sample_recipes.py script, although note that the free tier has a daily limit of several hundred. You\u2019ll need a free API key to do this. This is a good option if you want to explore new cuisines and foods, as Spoonacular\u2019s recipes are drawn from all kinds of food websites and blogs.", "Please let me know in the comments if this tool is useful to you!", "Your home for data science.
