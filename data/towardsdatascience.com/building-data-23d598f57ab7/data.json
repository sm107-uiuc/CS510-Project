As the first Data Engineer at a startup in Toronto I had lofty goals, great new-ish/slightly borrowed ideas, and I even had phases so everything would fit nicely into my grand plan. Don\u2019t get me wrong, failure isn\u2019t a bad thing, and I got plenty of shit done. But I knew the problems, I knew the solutions, I had everything grouped in phases. How could I fail? How did I???", "Lets start from the beginning, Day 0, I thought long and hard about what I wanted to accomplish and how I\u2019d do it, so lets start there. Lets democratize data!", "Phase 1 would see the removal or update to legacy event tracking goal and replaced with consolidated 3rd party APIs from segment.com. I would Keep everything else as untouched as possible and build anew in parallel since business needs can\u2019t take a backseat to greatness.", "Phase 2 is where the modern serverless data infrastructure was born. I would use the latest and greatest data technologies, everything open source and maybe even some \u201cbleeding edge\u201d alpha shit to make a fool(and future) proof infrastructure. This would provide us with all the scalability we could ever foresee, while also allowing for analysts and data scientists to access, discover and build actionable insights \u2190 one of those ideas I borrowed.", "Phase 3 wait for it\u2026Self-serve. Need I say more? Any talk about data engineering, data culture or data-driven decision making, isn\u2019t complete without the dream of a self-serve reporting BI platform where every employee knows, uses and loves SQL.", "Phase 4 data products, both internal and external facing. The data team should not only facilitate providing data that is easily accessible and discoverable, but also, particularly at a small company, should drive things such as an A/B Experimentation Platform, Data Science workflows, Data APIs for the product team to hook into and an official home for all data related documentation across the organization such as Airbnb\u2019s Knowledge Repo.", "Mixed in with all of that were lunch-n-learns, data surveys, best/better practices for making data-driven decisions, etc etc. Your basic data-university-within-the-company approach.", "I failed. Not only did I fail fast and fail often, but also, I often failed pretty slowly, grinding it out trying to understand what was happening before my eyes.", "Today, I\u2019d like to write a little story about what I\u2019ve experienced personally across my data career and what I\u2019ve learned by reading stories from others across Medium. And maybe at the same time I\u2019ll come up with what I would have done differently.", "Data Engineers, in theory, aren\u2019t responsible for \u201ceverything data\u201d at an organization. There\u2019s no one liner in the default role description across the internet which states", "Data engineers collect, transform and publish data enabling data driven decisions at an organization\u2026ALSO they create, maintain and evangelize the data culture we all know, love and want.", "But in quite a number of cases, particularly in early stage \u201cdata maturity\u201d companies, this is the requirement whether or not the employee or employer know it.", "Data culture is something you hear about A LOT and personally I\u2019m a strong proponent for a top-down approach to data culture, meaning, if your CEO isn\u2019t into it and doesn\u2019t demand data-backed results from his direct reports, you\u2019ll have no luck getting anyone else to care about a data driven culture.", "But in most startups, at least from what I can tell, this seems to be the case. Primarily because small companies either have one maybe two \u201cdata people\u201d so any data related responsibilities get shifted away from everyone else and onto the data people. In early stage data maturity companies, particularly startups, the first data engineer will almost always have to take on the role of promoting data knowledge and enthusiasm at the company along with the normal expected data engineering stuff.", "For better or worse, this is what happens and instead of arguing about how to fix it, I want to write about my experience of dealing with it. I\u2019m currently a Data Engineer, but I\u2019ve had multiple Data Analyst and Software Developer roles across enterprise and startup companies. And in each new role, the scientist part of my brain, always wanting proof, made me the data person at ever company or team I was apart of.", "Nurturing a data culture was something I found quite exciting when I first joined my current company. The idea of building something new, not just the infrastructure, that in some way would direct the overall data strategy at the company was thrilling. But how do I create this data culture? Can we define it? The internet gives you the sense of data culture to be a single, cut-from-solid-metal intricate mould, where looking directly at it defies all understanding of how anything so complex can be the creation of mere humans.", "But for me, a data culture is a catch all umbrella, which for clarity sake, I\u2019d like to split out and group into 4 sections. My own personal catch all mini-umbrellas. And this is where the story begins about my opinion and experience on Building Data.", "Every company seems to want or need a Data Engineer these days. What this person does for the company varies to a large degree depending on the industry and data maturity of the company. This can span across startups to large been-around-forever type enterprise companies.", "My primary role was to fix problems, support people and build an infrastructure. But not in so few words, it was more like", "To simplify, consolidate, manage, maintain and provide reliable data to all stakeholders within the organization, but first fix, remove and/or replace what\u2019s not working \u2014 A typical startup Data Engineering need", "The concept is pretty straight forward but there\u2019s always a gotcha and one of the them is to remember the company still has to function while you\u2019re tolling away building infrastructure. Meaning, the company\u2019s current and short term needs must still be supported, stakeholders still need metrics to view and BI analysts still need dashboards and charts to analyze. This is where ridiculously good priority skills, multi-tasking skills, communication and expectation management skills come into play. If you have none of those, then becoming the first (or one of the first) data engineers at your company was probably a bad idea for you and your company.", "A close second to the \u201cgotcha\u201d list, is how hard it is to fight want vs need and the real need to balance building for the future but not the distant future. Unless you\u2019re specifically a \u201cdata\u201d company, or perhaps an IOT company, your first foray with a data infrastructure shouldn\u2019t be the much hyped data lake. This applies to your data tools as well, I\u2019m looking at you Looker. Think baby steps or perhaps not baby steps but toddler size steps. There\u2019s no need to spin up a kubernetes cluster to run your two Python scripts in Docker containers. But that doesn\u2019t mean your infrastructure starts with cron running on a server under your desk.", "A good, simple and typical starter batch processing infrastructure may look like AWS S3, Redshift, Airflow on EC2/hosted (or AWS Glue) and your BI tool(s) of choice. You may also want to add on a monitoring stack, be it Prom+Grafana or just AWS CloudWatch. With this setup you can easily scale up and out, replace parts or move the whole thing to another provider (limited vendor lock-in). You can also easily add on workflow tools for the Data Scientists or Data Analysts, which at this point, your company probably doesn\u2019t have yet. And a company with their first data engineer is now probably expecting some data democratization to happen (that\u2019s \u201csynergy\u201d between data and democracy for those not in the know) and with that comes the much hyped self-serve BI platform/analysis tools.", "The phrase \u201cself-serve\u201d is like fools\u2019 gold or perhaps a pet snake or the scorpion and the frog, basically anything that looks great at first and then bits you in the ass the first chance it gets.", "Self-serve BI, aka democratizing data, is when someone imagines a world where tools with intuitive drag-n-drop interfaces are actually intuitive for all, people only ask questions they can\u2019t answer themselves and everyone knows SQL. Users who do excel would have most likely done so with any tool provided the right resources were available to help. These are users who are enthusiastic to learn more about the tool and data, and don\u2019t mind the learning curve associated with the reward. However, in reality, creating a self-serve analysis environment gives you a mixed bag of mass confusion, greatness and stupidity such as", "Self-serve will overwhelm you and underwhelm your stakeholders. If you\u2019re not prepared with a lot resources \u2014 people to help, documentation, time to kill \u2014 this venture will kill any productivity you had as a data engineer, and maybe even your soul. You\u2019ll be much better off working closely with one or two key members of other teams, helping them learn the new systems, and discover the data, letting these semi-data people help work directly within their own teams then opening up the flood gates know as self-serve BI environment later down the road.", "If no one trusts the data you\u2019re providing, it\u2019s not worth providing it. I learned quickly that a semi-great looking infrastructure spitting out data isn\u2019t enough. People need to use that data to view results and gain insights into anything from marketing campaigns and conversion rates to A/B experiments and user in-app behaviour. If your end users simply don\u2019t believe the metrics you\u2019re providing, they\u2019ll quickly stop using your data. And if you\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll at least tell you that they don\u2019t trust the data\u2014 and yes, that\u2019s being lucky. The only thing worse than end users not trusting your data, is users who don\u2019t trust your data, stop using it, find alternatives and never tell you about it.", "Single (one) source of truth is a good way to isolate the good and the bad when it comes to data trust.", "In information systems design and theory, single source of truth (SSOT) is the practice of structuring information models and associated data schema such that every data element is stored exactly once. Any possible linkages to this data element (possibly in other areas of the relational schema or even in distant federated databases) are by reference only \u2014 Wikipedia", "In English, and in context, having your metrics rely on one table or process gives you two great things 1) single point of failure but also a single point for fixing that failure and 2) if the metric is wrong, everyone using that metric is wrong by the same degree.", "I think my first point is pretty simple to understand and appreciate. If something breaks, like it inevitable will, it can only break in one place and you\u2019ll only need to fix that one place to get every downstream process and report using the correct metric again. But let me dive into point two(2) a bit as no one likes getting wrong data but it sounds like I\u2019m saying that\u2019s a good thing. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s a good thing that everyone is wrong by the same degree. In my experience, one of the worse things that can happen to have a working pipeline processing data incorrectly; however, worse than that, is having downstream processes and reports requiring the same metric but having different wrong answers. When you realize the problem, it\u2019s one of those times where you sit silently staring at the screen, take a deep slow breathe in and out, then say \u201cShit. That\u2019s not good\u201d. And that\u2019s were SSOT comes in. You can use different data sources, transform and wrangle your data together but in the end if your metric is using one table, set of tables or process as its base, and all other processes utilizing its output as their own base, you will never get a metric giving a different wrong answer across pipelines.", "Hard to believe but this all goes back to data trust. If stakeholders don\u2019t have or lose their trust in the data, it\u2019s hard to bring it back. SSOT helps prevent that from happening, so spending a lot of time here would be well worth it for any data engineer but particularly one who\u2019s entrusted with building a culture reliant on data.", "Appreciation. Not in the sense of needing people to appreciate the work you do but the data itself and how they can use it to achieve their own goals. Data appreciation needs to fostered among team members and the company as a whole, without this a \u2014 so what? \u2014 attitude will always get in the way of people utilizing everything you\u2019ve provided.", "If a data engineer creates discover-able, reliable, trustworthy data-marts but end users don\u2019t gives a shit, was the data engineer really successful?", "This is probably more of a company culture topic but if you\u2019re given tools to help you succeed in your role would, you use them? This is where data appreciation comes in, where your end users care about what you\u2019re doing and more importantly they care about why you\u2019re doing it. You and your infrastructure exist for one reason \u2014 provide business insights, either directly or indirectly, your infrastructure must facilitate this. If users can\u2019t, voluntarily or by other means, appreciate those wide dimension tables or those time-series metrics you\u2019ve painstakingly provided, you serve no purpose. Period.", "At a startup (or any company at an early stage of data maturity), your role as a Data Engineer probably means you have to not only build an infrastructure but also build this \u201cappreciation\u201d for data, to evangelize data within and throughout the organization. Failing to do this efficiently would result in your own overall job failure. Build it and they will use it, does not apply here.", "Data driven decisions or any iteration of this theme is basically the concept of business users utilizing data insights to make, verify and/or validate their decisions, before they action them. These decisions could be the foundation of a hypothesis for an experiment or an explanation of a failed marketing campaign or the reason to invest in a particular product feature. The point being, you rely on data to help you make decisions, this facilitates a more efficient process and allows you to work on things that matter, things that bring value to you and your organization.", "While many people love the notion of data driven decisions and beg for more data, others push back. It\u2019s natural wanting to keep doing what you\u2019re use it, I myself do it from time to time which is why I mentioned earlier that I\u2019m a strong proponent to the top-down approach of data culture and here\u2019s why \u2014 imagine you\u2019re a Sr. Manager of a feature team who just deployed a great new feature into your amazing product. Answer these questions for me", "Pretty simple questions that you could probably guess at with a big YES to Q3, because why wouldn\u2019t you fix a few bugs and enhance a few things to a feature that\u2019s already in production? But what if your boss, in a great top-down fashion, demands that any decision you present to her must come backed with data? Now you have a whole set of new questions like, \u201cdid I even instrument this new feature to capture the data required to answer the questions?\u201d or maybe \u201cwhy is the data showing me very few customers are actually using the feature but my gut tells me doing great?\u201d. Version 2 is going to be a tad bit hard to justify now that v1 has no data supporting its success.", "Many more questions and insights, both good and bad, come when you\u2019re referencing data but none of that is possible if the data driven culture doesn\u2019t come from the top down. You\u2019re either pumped about getting your hands on data, or you\u2019re not. And if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s just too easy to ignore the extra effort required unless you\u2019re gently pushed into the right direction.", "And although you\u2019re not the person making those data driven decisions, we\u2019re talking about a situation where you\u2019re the only data person at the company and everything data related falls onto your shoulders. And this is probably the hardest (and most important) part of the role at any company when you\u2019re building data.", "As a story about building data, you might have had the impression or anticipation for some technical diagrams, an example Airflow DAG code block somewhere or at least some pseudo code. But I think all of those things come and go. Either the industry changes, the role description changes or more often than not, the technology, process and technique changes. Plus, there are PLENTY of Medium stories out there already talking about how to build a data infrastructure, or how to use Airflow with K8s.", "For me, and in the context of this story, building data is a lot more than just the tech stack X for company Y at startup stage Z. At some stage of acompany\u2019s life, they need their first employee to help code a new feature, first IT guy help provision all those new laptops, first HR member and somewhere down the line, their first data person. That data person, the first real full-time data person, the data engineer, will inevitably have do more than just write a couple of cron jobs, python scripts and connect the dots from one tool to another. In order to not fail, that person will need to build a data infrastructure, she\u2019ll need to build trust between end users and the data she provides, she\u2019ll need to build user\u2019s appreciation for the tools they have and the data that can facilitate them reaching company goals, she\u2019ll need to build a data driven decision making mindset among her peers. And as the data person, as the Data Engineer, all of this is encapsulated into her role, all of this is encapsulated into creating a data culture at a company that starts from zero.
