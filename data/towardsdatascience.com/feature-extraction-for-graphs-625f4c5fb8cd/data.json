Each node is interconnected with each other and this is important information that we can\u2019t just ignore. Fortunately, many feature extraction methods have been created for graphs. These techniques can be divided into node level, graph level, and neighbourhood overlap features. In this article, we will look at the most common graph feature extraction methods and their properties.", "Heads up: I\u2019ve structured the article similarly as in the Graph Representation Learning book by William L. Hamilton [1].", "One of the simplest ways to capture information from graphs is to create individual features for each node. These features can capture information both from a close neighbourhood, and a more distant, K-hop neighbourhood using iterative methods. Let\u2019s dive into it!", "Node degree is a simple metric and can be defined as a number of edges incident to a node. Mathematically, it can be defined as:", "where A is the adjacency matrix, and du is a degree of the node u. This metric is often used as initialization of algorithms to generate more complex graph-level features such as Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel.", "The eigenvector centrality metric takes into account 2 aspects:", "In other words, nodes with a high eigenvector centrality should have many neighbours that are also highly connected to other nodes.", "The maths behind this metric is based on the recurrence algorithm using matrix equations and is rather complex. I will spare you the gory details of this mathematical equation but if you are interested in that, [1] have a nice explanation on that topic (page 19).", "Intuitively, we can think of this metric as how tightly groups of nodes are connected together. It measures a proportion of closed triangles in the neighbourhood of the node [1]. The clustering coefficient for node u can be defined as:", "Where (v1, v2) \u2208 \u0190 means that nodes v1, v2 have a connection between them. v1 and v2 are defined as an arbitrary pair of nodes that neighbours to node u.", "We can say that it is a ratio of the number of edges between neighbours and the number of node\u2019s neighbours (node degree) [1]. Values that are close to 1 means that all neighbours of the node u are connected to each other (right yellow circle on the picture), whereas values close to 0 mean that there is barely any connection between node\u2019s neighbours (left yellow circle on the picture).", "It is a learning-based approach that takes a graph as input and learns and output representation for the nodes [4]. It reapplies techniques that were used in the language modelling to a graph domain. This algorithm consist of two main parts:", "In the DeepWalk we apply a random walk generator to generate short sequences of nodes. Then, SkipGram is applied to encode vertices into lower dimensional space using the generated sequences of nodes.", "DeepWalk algorithm is a bit more difficult understand so I recommend looking at their original paper (it\u2019s really well written!), or this article.", "Other important features for nodes include centrality methods such as PageRank, Local Colouring, or learning-based methods such as HOPE [2].", "What if we want to capture information about the whole graph instead of looking at individual nodes? Fortunately, there are many methods available that aggregate information about the whole graph. From simple methods such as adjacency matrix to more complicated kernels such as Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel, or path-based kernels. There are many different ways to extract global information from graphs; in this section we will explore the most common ones.", "If there were a single graph-level feature that you should know, it would be the adjacency matrix. This is simply a sparse matrix that contains information about the connection between two nodes. If there is \u201c1\u201d, it means that there is a connection between two specific nodes. The a_ij element in the matrix, where i is a row and j is a column, will indicate if there is a connection between nodes Vi and Vj.", "The Laplacian matrix contains the same information about the connectivity as the adjacency matrix but in a slightly different way. It is simply defined as:", "In this equation, L is the Laplacian matrix, D is the degree matrix, and A is the adjacency matrix. The degree matrix is simply a diagonal matrix where each element on the diagonal represent how many neighbours each node has.", "It is not a single metric but\u00a0rather\u00a0a\u00a0type. The idea behind it is quite simple\u200a\u2014\u200awe just aggregate node level features in some way [1]. For example, we can take a mean of node degrees, or a histogram of the edge connections.", "WL Kernel is an improvement of the Bag of Nodes approach where we iteratively aggregate information from the node\u2019s neighbourhoods [1].", "The algorithm can be summarized in a few steps [1]:", "This kernel is quite widely used in cheminformatics where it\u2019s often extended to molecular data. For example, circular fingerprints algorithm is based on the WL Kernel.", "Graphlet is defined as a small subgraph of size k \u2208 {3,4,5}. The idea behind the graphlet kernel is simple: we count the occurrence of graphlets within the graph. Comparing all possible graphlets is an NP-hard problem so there are alternative techniques such as sampling fixed number of graphlets which reduce the computational complexity [5]. Mathematically, the graphlet kernel is defined as follows:", "where G and G\u2019 are different graphs that we can compare. f_G and f_G\u2019 are vectors where the ith element correspond to the frequency of occurrence of a certain graphlet_i [5]. We can normalize these vectors to account for higher frequency counts for graphlets of smaller size [5]:", "Graphlet kernels are widely used in bioinformatics and cheminformatics where it is particularly useful to know the frequency of occurrence of certain substructures within molecules that are represented by graphs.", "Path-based kernels create feature vectors by applying random walks or shortest paths over labelled nodes and edges of the graph [7, 8]. The methodology of this kernel is similar to the graphlet kernel but instead of graphlets, we examine different paths within the graph [1]. Path-based kernels that use the random walk will examine paths generated at random. Those that are based on the shortest paths, will only investigate the shortest path that connects two nodes.", "There are many more algorithms/models that create graph level features. Other examples include GraphHopper kernel, Neural Message Passing, or Graph Convolutional Networks.", "The node and graph level features fail to gather information about the relationship between neighbouring nodes [1]. This is often useful for edge prediction task where we predict whether there is a connection between two nodes and its type. The neighbourhood overlap features address this problem and measure both local and global overlaps in the graph.", "Local overlap measures are metrics that quantify the similarity of the neighbourhood between two nodes. Most of these metrics are very similar and they are just slightly different in terms of the normalization constant [1].", "For example, Sorenson index computed between node u and v is given by the following equation:", "The numerator term counts the common neighbours between those nodes. The denominator term (d_u + d_v)/2 is an average of nodes\u2019 degrees.", "Another metrics, such as Salton index, Hub Promoted index, or Jaccard index just differ from the Sorensen index by the normalization constant.", "A slightly different metric is the Resource Allocation (RA) index. This metric measures the importance of the common neighbours between nodes u and v [1]. It does that by summing an inverse of node\u2019s degree of all common neighbours.", "Global overlap metrics capture the information if certain nodes belong to the same community in the graph. Instead of only focusing on two adjacent nodes, we look at nodes from a more distant neighbourhood and check if they belong to the same community in the graph.", "One of the common methods is the Katz Index that counts all possible paths between two specific nodes:", "There is an interesting property of the adjacency matrix A where ith power of that matrix indicates if there is a path of length i between two nodes u and v [10]. The \u03b2 term is a kind of normalization constant where we can choose what path lengths should matter the most (i.e. short or long).", "The Katz index is biased and will generate higher similarity scores for nodes with higher node degrees [1]. To overcome this problem, LHN similarity metric was proposed that takes this bias into account:", "The metric is normalized by the expected value of the Adjacency matrix (raised to the ith power).", "We\u2019ve seen 3 major types of features that can be extracted from graphs: node level, graph level, and neighbourhood overlap features. Node level features such as node degree, or eigenvector centrality generate features for each individual node whereas graph level features such as WL, or Graphlet kernels capture information from the whole graph at once. Neighbourhood overlap features, for example, Sorensen index or LHN similarity, create features that measure a common neighbourhood between two nodes.", "In this article, I\u2019ve summarized the most popular feature extraction methods for graphs. Of course, there is many more, that I didn\u2019t have time to mention here. In the reference section you can find very useful literature if you want to dive deeper in this topic :)", "Thank you for reading the article.
