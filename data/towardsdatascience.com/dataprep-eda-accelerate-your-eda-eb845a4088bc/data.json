They rely on you to give them a clear and convincing voice\u201d \u2014 Stephen Few", "Most of the industries today have recognized data as a valuable asset. However, what you do with the data and how you utilize it is what helps you get those additional profit figures or that new discovery that is going to create a revolution.", "When you start working with a dataset most of the trends and patterns are not apparent. Exploratory data analysis helps one to carefully analyze data through an analytical lens. It helps us draw conclusions to get an overall sense of what\u2019s happening with the data. Uncovering these hidden relationships and patterns are critical to build analytical and learning models on the top of the data.", "The general workflow of EDA looks as follows:", "Dataprepare is an initiative by SFU Data Science Research Group to speed up Data Science. Dataprep.eda attempts to simplify the entire EDA process with very minimal lines of code. Since we know that EDA is a very essential and time-consuming part of the data science pipeline, having a tool that eases the process is a boon.", "This blog intends on providing you an easy and hands-on experience of everything you can do with dataprepare.eda. So let\u2019s dive into it, shall we?", "In order to simplify things, we have worked on a Fraud Detection dataset. The data has columns like amount, original balance, origin account, destination account, etc. and finally a label column that indicates if this transaction was in fact a fraudulent transaction or not.", "The dataprep.eda package has 4 submodules. We shall explain each one of them:", "We provide an API plot() to allow users to analyze the basic characteristics of the dataset. It plots the distribution or bar chart for each column to give the user a basic sense of the dataset.", "If a user is interested in one or two specific columns, it provides a more detailed plot for the specific columns by passing column names as the parameter.", "If x contains categorical values, a bar chart and pie chart are plotted.", "If x contains numerical values, a histogram, kernel density estimate plot, box plot, and qq plot are plotted.", "If x and y contain numerical values, a scatter plot, hexbin plot, and binned box plot are plotted. If one of x and y contain categorical values and the other contains numerical values, a box plot and multi-line histogram are plotted. If x and y contain categorical vales, a nested bar chart, stacked bar chart, and heat map are plotted.", "We provide an API plot_correlation to analyze the correlation between columns. It plots the correlation matrix between columns. If a user is interested in the correlated columns for a specific column, e.g the most correlated columns to column \u2018A\u2019, the API can provide a more detailed analysis by passing column names as the parameter.", "Top \u2018k\u2019 attributes\u2019 correlation heatmap (here, k=1)", "Correlation of specified element with all other attributes. (ie. newbalanceOrig with everything else).", "All the correlation values that lie within the given range. (-1, 0.3) for newbalanceOrig will appear in the plot.", "Correlation between two attributes with line of best fit and most influential points.", "We provide an API plot_missing to analyze the pattern and impact of missing values. At the first glance, it shows the position of missing values, which allows the user to be aware of data quality for each column or find any underlying pattern of missing values.", "To understand the impact of missing values from a specific column, users can pass the column name into the parameter. It will compare the distribution of each column with and without missing values from the given column, such that the user could understand the impact of the missing values.", "4. create_report: generate profile reports from a Pandas dataframe.", "The goal of create_report is to generate profile reports from a pandas DataFrame. create_report utilizes the functionalities and formats the plots from dataprep. It provides information like overview, variables, quantile statistics (minimum value, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, range, interquartile range), descriptive statistics (mean, mode, standard deviation, sum, median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness), text analysis for length, sample and letter, correlations and missing values.", "The above 3 APIs in combination work towards easing the EDA process.", "To support this, we conducted a survey to compare dataprep.eda to traditional python EDA implementation. We surveyed 10 people (a mix of real-world Data Scientists and University students studying Data Science). The survey was based on 3 key performance indicators:", "As we can see, most people spend about an hour and half over EDA on an average. This result establishes the fact that we need tools to speed up EDA process.", "2. Readability: Here we made a comparison of the two approaches to see how readable they are.", "Clearly, dataprepare.eda provides a more lucid and readable code.", "3. Lines of code: Does dataprep.eda really reduce the length of code?", "In addition to the above key performance indicators, dataprep.eda also proves to be better at several other aspects compared to normal python implementation and even existing data profiling libraries like pandas profiling. Let\u2019s take a look at how these three approaches perform when pitted against each other.", "2. When we talk about these methods and their capabilities to support out of memory data, Dataprepare.eda is the only one that supports out-of-memory data processing. This proves to be very useful in today\u2019s era of Big Data.", "3. The plots generated by dataprep.eda are all interactive but matplotlib and seaborn only create static plots. This facilitates deeper understanding of the plot.", "We asked several industry professionals and university students to give their feedback on this amazing tool.", "Here\u2019s what some of them have to say:", "\u201cThe library looks really good. Eases the work by a great margin. All the best for the venture\u201d \u2014 Dhruva Gaidhani, Software Developer at Amazon", "\u201cSpotting missing values is efficient. I usually spend a lot of time on EDA. The library has definitely eased a few functionalities.\u201d \u2014 Manan Parasher, Alumni of SFU", "Data science is adapting every second as we speak. We are exploring the lengths and breadths of almost all the domains right from sport analysis to medical imaging. These times call for us to channel the power of AI and Machine Learning into developing things that will make an impact and save those few seconds. Having tools like data prepare at our disposal enables us to carry out the preparatory tasks more efficiently.", "Dataprepare.eda excels at tasks like checking the data-distribution, correlation, missing values and the EDA process in general. The ease of coding and readability also facilitates novices to use dataprepare library. All in all, Dataprepare.eda serves as your one-stop library for carrying out all the preparatory analysis tasks. It\u2019s an upcoming library with a promising future!", "Your home for data science.
