I am proud to pursue this excellent Online MS program. You can also check the details here.", "Brownian motion, or pedesis, is the randomized motion of molecular-sized particles suspended in a fluid. It results from the stochastic collisions of the particles with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid (energized due to the internal thermal energy). The aforementioned fluid is supposed to be at the so-called thermal equilibrium, where no preferential direction of flow exists (as opposed to various transport phenomena).", "Brownian motion is named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, who first described the phenomenon in 1827 while observing pollens (from the Clarkia pulchella plant) immersed in water, through a microscope.", "For a long time, the scientific community did not think much of it. Then, in 1905, a 26-year old Swiss patent clerk changed the world of physics by analyzing the phenomena with the help of the laws of thermodynamics.", "Albert Einstein published a seminal paper where he modeled the motion of the pollen, influenced by individual water molecules, and depending on the thermal energy of the fluid. Although this paper is relatively less celebrated than his other 1905 papers, it is one of his most cited publications. In fact, Einstein\u2019s explanation of Brownian motion served as the first mathematically sound evidence that molecules exist.", "You can read this enjoyable article commemorating the 100-year of Einstein\u2019s paper.", "The many-body interactions, that yield the intricate yet beautiful pattern of Brownian motion, cannot be solved by a first-principle model that accounts for the detailed motion of the molecules. Consequently, only probabilistic macro-models applied to molecular populations can be employed to describe it.", "This is the reasoning behind the description of Brownian motion mostly as a purely stochastic process in its modern form. Almost all practical application also adopts this approach.", "Mathematical properties of the one-dimensional Brownian motion was first analyzed American mathematician Norbert Wiener. The resulting formalism is a real-valued continuous-time stochastic process, called the Wiener process", "It is one of the best known stochastic processes with attractive properties like stationarity and independent increments. Consequently, it finds frequent applications in a wide range of fields covering pure and applied mathematics, quantitative finance, economic modeling, quantum physics, and even evolutionary biology.", "The concept and mathematical models of Brownian motion play a vital role in modern mathematics such as stochastic calculus and diffusion processes. The Wiener process is also used to represent the integral of a white noise Gaussian process, which, often acts as a ubiquitous model of noise in electrical and electronics engineering. The same idea is also applied to model noise and errors in filter design and random/unknown forces in control theory.", "In quantum physics, diffusion phenomena related to the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations are studied with the help of Brownian motion. It also underlies the formation of the rigorous path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. For example, using the Feynman-Kac formula, a solution to the famous Schrodinger equation can be represented in terms of the Wiener process. The model of eternal inflation in physical cosmology takes inspiration from the Brownian motion dynamics.", "In the world of finance and econometric modeling, Brownian motion holds a mythical status. It features prominently in almost all major mathematical theories of finance. In particular, the famous Black-Scholes option pricing model, for which Myron Scholes received 1997 Nobel prize in economics, depends on this formalism.", "The core equation at the heart of generating data points following a Brownian motion dynamics is rather simple,", "where Yi could be a basic stochastic process like Random Walk or sample from a Normal distribution.", "The Jupyter notebook for the implementation can be found here.", "In the Python code below, we define a class Brownian with a few useful methods,", "We can use a basic stochastic process such as Random Walk, to generate the data points for Brownian motion.", "We can generate Brownian motion data by drawing from Normal distribution.", "We implemented the Geometric Brownian Motion model in the class as a method.", "In the demo, we simulate multiple scenarios with for 52 time periods (imagining 52 weeks a year). Note, all the stock prices start at the same point but evolve randomly along different trajectories.", "Note that the dynamics are controlled by the mean and variance parameters of the underlying Normal distribution. This somehow emulates the growth trend and the \u2018volatility\u2019 of the stock.", "For example, a stock with a positive growth trend will have a positive mean. For this particular simulation, the choice of the mean (mu) is 0.2 and the choice of standard deviation (square root of the variance) is 0.68.", "We define a utility function for plotting first.", "Note that, although the scenarios look sufficiently stochastic, they have a downward trend. This is because even with a positive mean, we have a slightly high spread or volatility.", "We simulate the stock price again with slightly less volatility (but with the same mean as before) and get a completely different outcome this time. The trend looks neutral i.e. some scenario shows an increase in the stock price after the 52-week time period, whereas some show a decrease.", "If we lower the volatility, even more, we get a clear positive trend.", "In the following example, we show a two-dimensional Brownian motion much like the actually suspended particle in the fluid medium goes through.", "We showed how to generate random datasets corresponding to the Brownian motion in one and two dimensions. We also showed an application of the idea in stock price simulation using the Geometric Brownian motion model.", "Having a ready-made Python implementation for this important stochastic process is extremely important because of its ubiquitousness in various real-life applications.", "For example, data science practitioners can readily take this implementation and integrate it with their model of a stochastic process when they are analyzing a quantitative finance or physics model.", "Again, the Jupyter notebook for the implementation can be found here. Readers are welcome to fork it and extend as per their requirements.", "Also, you can check the author\u2019s GitHub repositories for code, ideas, and resources in machine learning and data science.
