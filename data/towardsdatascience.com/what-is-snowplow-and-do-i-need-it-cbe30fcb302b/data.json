You look into Google Analytics 360. Do you want to give your business the tools you need to better understand its customers? Of course you do! Access to raw event data, insights based on all information as opposed to just a fraction of it? Sounds good! As you are getting ready to sign up, you notice Analytic\u2019s price tag \u2014 starting at $150k / year. Gulp. What now? Certainly not all businesses can justify such a flabbergastingly high price.", "An alternative to Google Analytics that often pops up is Snowplow. Snowplow is a data collection platform actively developed by Snowplow Analytics. Snowplow can \u201ccollect\u201d many kinds of telemetry data, but has a special place in its heart for clickstream data, offering many features relevant for web tracking out of the box.", "Snowplow Analytics provides its platform in various formats, including as a managed service called Snowplow Insights. All of its core components are open-source and can be used for free in a build-it-yourself, self-managed way. You can have your own production-ready, scalable real-time data ingestion pipeline running in the public cloud for around $200 per month. Smaller deployments or dev deployments are possible too (using Snowplow Mini) at around $40 per month.", "Snowplow can \u201ccollect\u201d all sorts of telemetry data, but has a special place in its heart for clickstream events", "Of course, such a simple price-based comparison of Snowplow and Google Analytics is not useful. The overlap between these products is actually surprisingly small. As someone who just deployed Snowplow to the Google Cloud, I know it took me a while to figure out whether Snowplow fulfilled our needs. This story introduces you to what Snowplow is, and whether it can be of use to you.", "Compared to other posts, such as the Snowplow for Media series, this story emphasises what Snowplow actually does by diving into its architecture and deployment, instead of focussing on the value of the data that its trackers generate. With a good understanding of this architecture you can make up your own mind, and decide whether Snowplow should be a part of your data analytics efforts too!", "What exactly is a data collection platform? At its core, Snowplow consists of a processing pipeline capturing, cleaning, enriching and saving all the information that is presented to it through calls to a HTTP endpoint. GET and POST requests go in the pipeline, and out comes structured data in blob storage or a queryable database. Snowplow also comes with a number of utilities such as a JavaScript web tracker and tracking SDKs that will generate these HTTP calls in response to actions taken by your users on your website or in your app, for example in response to page views or page clicks.", "HTTP requests go in the pipeline, out comes queryable structured data", "Snowplow started out as a web analytics platform, only supporting tracking with their web tracker and their own tracker protocol. Now, it aims to be a one-stop shop for all your event data collection efforts. Want to capture subscribe events to your mailing list backed by MailChimp? Snowplow has you covered! Capturing custom events generated by your own application? That\u2019s no problem either! Website tracking almost seems boring when you think of all the internet of things (IoT) data you could be getting your hands on. Snowplow allows you to define and use custom event schemata. It accepts data from everywhere, while providing direct access to every bit of raw data it collects. Snowplow easily scales up to thousands of collected events per second.", "Obtaining \u201cinsights\u201d from this raw, structured data, however, requires you to put in some elbow grease. Snowplow does little to process the data it ingests for you, and if you expect it to present you with easily-interpretable graphs or enlightening statistics you will probably be disappointed. A basic installation of open-source Snowplow collects data really well, but does little beyond collecting, cleaning and saving data in a structured format.", "Snowplow does not come with a GUI. When collecting clickstream data, it simply provides you with atomic events, such as page click, page view or page ping events; no \u201cuser flows\u201d or derived statistics like scroll depth. This makes sense knowing that Snowplow is not limited to ingesting clickstream data. Snowplow is therefore also not a true drop-in replacement to Google Analytics. In fact, it totally makes sense to run Snowplow and Google Analytics in parallel!", "Snowplow is not a true drop-in replacement to Google Analytics", "You\u2019re not left completely to your own devices either. Snowplow does have a number of analytics SDKs in place that can help you analyse the data it generates. There\u2019s also the Snowplow web data model project helping specifically with the analysis of clickstream data by grouping atomic tracking events into browsing sessions.", "So, Snowplow collects all kinds of event data, processes them and then saves them by letting the data flow through \u201ca pipeline\u201d. Let\u2019s make this process a bit more tangible. The Snowplow processing pipeline looks like this:", "This section discusses how data flows through the pipeline, and what interfaces connect the different components of the pipeline.", "Data generated by a Snowplow tracker (e.g. the Snowplow JavaScript tracker), a web hook or a call from one of the Snowplow tracker SDKs hits the collector component. The collector is a basic web server open to HTTP requests, that encodes and publishes all incoming data on a message bus. If the request does not include a cookie identifying the user, it also embeds a randomly generated cookie into the Set-Cookie HTTP response header.", "The enrichment component is a subscriber to this message bus implementing the Snowplow enrichment process. During this process, Snowplow validates incoming data, verifying that it is specified in a protocol that it understands. It then extracts event properties and enriches events. At the end of the enrichment process, events adhere to the Snowplow canonical event model. Enriched events are published on another message bus.", "The enrichment component is without a doubt the most complex and interesting part of Snowplow. If you want to know more about it, check out my follow-up story:", "The storage component subscribes to the message bus to which the enrichment component publishes. It persists messages in blob storage or a queryable data store such as BigQuery or Redshift. If the target storage is a (structured) database, event properties map onto columns.", "Components have multiple compatible implementations, allowing you to use those that best suit your needs. Some implementations use cloud-native technology specific to a particular public cloud, such as the storage component Snowplow BigQuery Loader interfacing with BigQuery on GCP and running on Cloud Dataflow. Others are built on open-source technology and can easily be deployed on your own hardware, such as the Scala Stream Collector which runs on the JVM and can push messages not only to AWS Kinesis or Cloud Pub/Sub but also to Apache Kafka.", "What do the messages used for communication between components look like?", "Some Snowplow components do not implement the (streaming) interfaces as presented above. These components process data in batches. The short of it is that you should ignore batch implementations and only bother getting to know the streaming processing pipeline presented above, as Snowplow\u2019s batch processing pipeline has been deprecated. If you for some reason still would like to know more about batch processing, check out my story.", "Snowplow batch processing has been deprecated", "Snowplow\u2019s enriched canonical events can be stored to blob storage or a structured database. The precise format of the data that exists your pipeline depends on the storage component you use. Component implementations optimize for the properties of the target data store.", "When dumping the data into BigQuery, all events are dumped into a single big events table. After initialization, before even adding a single event, this events table already has about 128 properties!", "As you can see, all properties are marked as NULLABLE. (In fact some are legacy and equal NULL for all of my records. Before Snowplow started using an extensible event type scheme, they would just add columns to a fat table with columns relevant for web analytics. The columns of this fat table define what is now an \u201catomic event\u201d.) Because BigQuery is a columnar data store, columns that are always NULL do not actually cost anything: adding columns does not increase the size of your table or decrease the speed of querying. Adding events of a new type adds even more columns to the events table.", "New columns will be NULL for all older data, and NULL for all new records that are inserted but of another type.", "Not all data stores have the same properties as BigQuery. Consequently, not all data stores use the same \u201cfat table\u201d-approach as the BigQuery storage component.", "For example, when storing data in Redshift on AWS, every event results in a record in a table atomic.events. Inserting data of a new type results in the creation of a new table; entries in this table can be joined to atomic.events. Snowplow refers to this event-splitting procedure as shredding.", "Snowplow takes HTTP requests and saves them to a data store in near real-time. That does not sound particularly exciting; many cloud datastores have a HTTP front-end too, and can\u2019t you just dump Pub/Sub events to Cloud Storage automagically? Why bother with Snowplow?", "Compared to generic telemetry data gathering offerings, such as Amazon Kinesis (Data Analytics) or Azure Application Insights, Snowplow offers you the advantage of validation and enrichment of incoming data. Only clean data enters your database! When tracking web applications, Snowplow also sets cookies from the server side on your own domain allowing for reliable tracking across browsing sessions. However, Snowplow is more complex to install and keep running, and relatively expensive if you are processing few events.", "By validating incoming data, Snowplow makes sure only clean data enters your database", "Compared to applications that offer advanced processing of types of data, Snowplow offers you custom extensibility, access to the raw data, the ability to ingest many different kinds of data, and a low price. Examples of specialized service are Google Analtyics or Matomo for web analytics, and applications such as New Relic, Datadog or honeycomb.io for application monitoring. However, unlike these specialized programs, Snowplow does not really further process or analyse your data; it does not even offer you a GUI. Comparing these programs to Snowplow is not always useful.", "So, what does a deployment of Snowplow actually look like?", "Our current deployment looks like this:", "If you want to deploy Snowplow to GCP yourself, the official installation instructions and this blog post by Simo Avaha are excellent resources. You may also want to check out this or this collection of deployment scripts. I decided to forego these scripts in favor of Terraform combined with some custom scripts of my own.", "There\u2019s also guides for installing Snowplow on AWS. Currently, there\u2019s no official support for Azure, and no Azure-specific component implementations.", "If our deployment looks complicated or expensive to you or if your are just looking to explore Snowplow\u2019s capabilities, you should take a look at Snowplow Mini. Mini implements all necessary components (and more) in a single image that can be deployed to a single virtual machine. It allows you to run a full Snowplow stack on GCP for around $40 / month. Snowplow Mini is not recommended for production use as it is neither scalable nor highly available.", "Any mistakes or something you feel I missed? Let me know in the comments!", "I work at Data Minded, an independent Belgian data analytics consultancy, and this is where I document and share my learnings from deploying Snowplow at Publiq.", "Publiq is a non-profit organisation managing a database of activities in Flanders, Belgium.
