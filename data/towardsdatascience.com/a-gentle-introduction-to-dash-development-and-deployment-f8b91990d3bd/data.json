Step 1: Drool over the D3 gallery\u2019s sexy & interactive plotsStep 2: Fall off the steep learning curve of Javascript Step 3: Go back to making mediocre seaborn plots", "Enter Dash, an approachable yet powerful framework for building interactive web visualizations in pure Python. Since it\u2019s built on top of D3, you get the aesthetics you craved (here are some community examples). Dash has an excellent introductory essay, and an exemplary tutorial that will teach you to make an interactive visualization within 1\u20132 hours. I want to be clear that I am not writing a tutorial on Dash (seriously, theirs is excellent), nor am I debating the merits of Dash vs Altair or Bokeh (I\u2019ll leave that to experts and their witty decision trees).", "So why did I write a tutorial on Dash development? Lost in the thoroughness of the user guide is the concise picture of a common workflow \u2014 building and deploying an interactive visualization. If you\u2019re a bit fuzzy when it comes to git features branches, Heroku, or virtual environments, it\u2019s easy to get snagged beyond the tutorial\u2019s simple visualizations. Before you plumb the depths of Stack Overflow, here is an effective workflow that has helped me build multiple dashboards (example) and avoid common pitfalls. I used the following workflow to develop the GitHub tutorial and above Heroku app.", "Once again, this tutorial is about building non-trivial Dash apps and deploying to Heroku, so we must use version control and GitHub. For ease of entry, I made a boilerplate branch in the tutorial repo. Note: You may be familiar with cookiecutter, an automated tool for project setup. Plotly provides a dash component boilerplate, and there is at least one dash app boilerplate. Mine is a lightweight version that\u2019s sufficient for this tutorial.", "In addition to the trivial Dash app, I have included the necessary files for Heroku deployment. These files are well documented in Heroku\u2019s Python quickstart. In short,Procfile, runtime, and setup tell the remote Heroku server how to run your app, and requirements lists the Python packages (and their specific versions) for building your app\u2019s virtual environment. Step 1: create your own Git repository Step 2: Clone or download the tutorial\u2019s boilerplate branch and manually add those files to your Git repository (this is cleaner than forking the entire Git repository). Step 3: Create your virtual environment. I am using a conda environment with pip as the package manager. Open a terminal and run conda create -n dash_tutorial pip. (adding pip to your environment makes it easier to track packages via pip freeze later on). Note that my runtime uses Python 3.7.2.Step 4: Install your packages. First, make sure you\u2019re in your environment: for Windows, run activate dash_tutorial. If you\u2019re just following the tutorial, you can copy my exact environment by running (with the environment activated and within your git repo)(env_name) C:/path/to/dash_tutorial> pip install -r requirements.txtIf you\u2019re using the boilerplate for your own app (and not using a cookiecutter template), you want an environment with the newest versions of packages. You can pip install the latest Dash libraries, as well as pip install jupyter pandas and any other libraries you intend to use for your app. At this point, you may be frustrated that I promised a \u201cgentle\u201d introduction then burdened you with environment management. However, environment diligence is crucial to making your Heroku deployments smooth (and really, for any non-trivial Python development). If you really wanted, you could build your full Dash app before dealing with Heroku deployment, but in my experience Heroku deployment is tricky for beginners, and it\u2019s easier to debug deployment with a toy app before you build a complex one you can\u2019t deploy.", "Step 5: Run the app locally.  (env_name) C:/path/to/dash_tutorial> python app.pyThis launches a local server which you can access by navigating your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8050/. You should see something like", "Step 6: Create your Heroku appIf you don\u2019t have a Heroku account, refer to their Python quickstart for quick installation and configuration. Otherwise, create a Heroku app by heroku create my-app-name (note that app names must be unique, so you can\u2019t use e.g. dash-tutorial) Step 7: Deploy to HerokuRun git push heroku master If you don\u2019t get errors, visit your app, whose url is made from https://my-dash-name.herokuapp.com/If all went well, you should see the exact same output as your local server.", "At this point, you have a solid framework of app development. Referring to the earlier workflow diagram, you will now develop app features on git branches using the following steps (which I labeled with letters to signify the separate and cyclic process). I will show examples from the tutorial repo\u2019s features branches: the first of which makes a scatterplot, the second adds a choropleth map.", "A) Create a git branch.In the tutorial repo, I ran git checkout -b scatterplot to make a branch in which I will add the first interactive scatterplot. B) Add featuresThe common workflow is writing code in your favorite text editor or IDE, then launching the local server. Below is the stripped-down code for the interactive scatterplot, excerpted from the first feature branch\u2019s app.py (and shown in the above app). I usually start by copy-pasting code from simple examples like the Dash tutorial\u2019s scatterplot (which explains layout and callbacks).", "For minor tweaks, you can iteratively write code and see updates using Dash\u2019s autoreloader. Below, I launch the local server, then change the colorscale by adding autocolorscale=False argument to the choropleth map, and immediately see the updated map.", "For certain tasks, like data munging, I find that it\u2019s worth writing code in Jupyter notebooks before adding it to app.py.", "I have found that it isn\u2019t particularly helpful to develop Plotly code in a Jupyter notebook. It takes a few extra setup steps, and the Dash autoreloader gives decent stack traces for debugging. If you want to run Plotly in a notebook, you need to import special tools, as below:", "C) Push to Heroku from feature branch Once you\u2019re happy with the version of your app running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/, it\u2019s time to redeploy. You could merge your branch to master then push master to Heroku, but I find it more comforting to deploy from my feature branch before merging it to master. This is done via git push heroku branchname:master.", "E) Push and merge your feature branch If your deploy goes well, push your branch:  git push --set-upstream origin branchnameGo to GitHub, create a pull request (PR), then merge your PR. It\u2019s probably best practice to git push heroku master after merging the PR, but if you have clean feature branch workflows, you can just deploy from feature branches.", "Continue developing feature branches, and redeploying to Heroku.", "My app works locally but not on Heroku1) Double check your environment. Make sure your requirements.txt is up to date (run pip freeze > requirements.txt and make sure to commit any updates). 2) Heroku has some repo structure requirements. For example, make sure your Procfile is in your app\u2019s root directory. 3) Occasionally, differences in operating systems between your local device and Heroku can create gnarly bugs. For example, I wrote an app that ran locally on Windows, with data.CSV read by pd.read_csv('data.csv'). It successfully deployed to Heroku, but then wouldn\u2019t run on Heroku\u2019s Unix system, breaking with FileNotFoundError: 'data.csv' does not exist.", "Dash allows you to make powerful visualization apps in pure Python. Besides the files necessary for Heroku deployment, the tutorial\u2019s app.py module includes all data transformations, plotting, and app layout code. It\u2019s quite possible that\u2019s enough for your purposes. As your app develops, you may need to refactor your code into multiple modules, for example: - Refactoring data transformations, color palettes, etc into separate modules that allow your app.py module to focus on the app itself.- Styling your app with your own CSS- Writing your own components in React.js", "Your home for data science.
