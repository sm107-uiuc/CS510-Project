Tableau is an ideal choice for creating maps because of its ability to provide high quality, descriptive visualizations with only a few clicks. In this blog post, I\u2019ll demonstrate the power of Tableau by using it to investigate traffic accidents in Chicago over the past few years.", "Let\u2019s imagine a hypothetical scenario where the city of Chicago has obtained funding for an initiative to make driving conditions safer in the city. Part of the budget is going to be allocated to redesigning intersections and streets where there are a high number of accidents. As a data scientist involved in this project, your first task is to use the city\u2019s traffic data in order to determine which areas need the most attention.", "The Chicago Public Data Portal contains a comprehensive data set about the locations and details of all traffic accidents that have been reported in the last few years. For each individual accident, one can find information about the posted speed limit, the number of injuries, lighting conditions, the weather conditions, etc. Most importantly for us, the location of each accident is reported as a longitude and latitude.", "We\u2019ll first need to read the data in with Tableau. Since I\u2019m using Tableau Public, I\u2019ve just downloaded the data and connected directly to the csv file. If you\u2019re following along, you should see the following screen after opening up a blank worksheet.", "We\u2019ll start by simply populating the columns and rows with the longitude and latitude pills, respectively. Since we want the number of accidents at each location, we can take the Number of Records pill and place that under marks with the count measure. I\u2019ve also changed my marks to the gold-red color for this example, but that step is optional. Now, we should have a map! When mousing over the different points, we\u2019ll be given information about how many crashes occurred at each location.", "Great! In just a few clicks we were able to make our map and we\u2019re now ready to investigate! Right?", "There\u2019s a BIG problem with the map we just made. If you\u2019ve been looking at the data on the Chicago data portal, or with another tool such as Python, you may have noticed that the longitude and latitude coordinates are precise to 9 decimal places. This is simply way too much precision for what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here.", "When you zoom in and mouse over different coordinates on the map, you\u2019ll notice that there are many locations with clusters of accidents, but Tableau only reports the longitude and latitude to 2 decimal places.", "To get around this issue, we\u2019ll need to make our own rounded latitude and longitude measures to three decimal places using Tableau. If you\u2019ve never done this before, right click on the latitude measure and go to create -> calculated field. Then, type in the following:", "Be sure to do the same for longitude. Now, we can replace the original latitude and longitude pills with our new measures and turn them into dimensions. Now when we mouse over different locations, we\u2019ll start seeing a more aggregated count of the number of accidents.", "The map we have now is more informative than the one we started with, but it could still be better. For starters, it just isn\u2019t very visually appealing. To remedy this, we can do the following:", "1.) On the toolbar at the top of the screen, select Map->Background Map-> Streets.", "2.) Select the Map option on the drop down under marks. You may also want to play with the size setting a bit.", "Now, this is starting to look a lot more like an actual map! There are still just a few small problems, though. It turns out that this dataset actually contains a couple of points which are incorrectly marked as being at longitude 0. We\u2019ll filter those out by right clicking our round_lon measure and selecting filter. Then, just set the values to be something which is at most closer to the longitude and latitude measures of Chicago. The exact number doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 it just needs to be something that isn\u2019t near 0.", "Next, you may have also noticed that there are a large number of accidents right at O\u2019Hare International Airport. If you\u2019ve ever driven in the pick-up and drop-off areas of this airport, this may not surprise you at all. The issue for us is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be any detail about where accidents may be occurring in this area. Since we\u2019re mostly interested in the main parts of the city, we\u2019ll just exclude these points from our map. To do this, select the point in the middle of O\u2019hare and click on \u201cexclude.\u201d", "Now that we\u2019ve taken care of the outliers, we\u2019re nearly done! Let\u2019s circle back to the original problem statement. Remember that we were interested in the areas that have a high number of crashes. This means that we probably don\u2019t want to have our vision clouded by all of the points that only have one or two accidents. In order to make viewing our map easier, we can introduce a sliding filter which allows us to hide any points where the number of accidents in below a given threshold. By right clicking on our mark for the number of accidents, we can select \u201cshow filter.\u201d You should now have a sliding bar on the right which will allow you to restrict the map to only show points with numbers of accidents within the provided range.", "That\u2019s it for now! To summarize, Tableau allowed us to get a working version of our map almost immediately just by dragging the longitude and latitude to the columns and rows. By limiting the precision of our longitude and latitude measures, we were able to perform more descriptive aggregation when counting the number of traffic accidents. Finally, we used Tableau\u2019s filtering and exclusion features in order to eliminate outliers and make things a bit more dynamic.", "You can find the completed sheet made in this tutorial here. There are still lots of interesting questions that we can answer with this map by introducing a bit more functionality. For instance, what if we wanted to know how the number of accidents in different locations has been changing from year to year? What about month to month within a given year? Are certain areas responsible for more accidents because of a particular weather condition? I encourage you to play around with this map to try and answer these questions as well as any of your own!", "Your home for data science.
