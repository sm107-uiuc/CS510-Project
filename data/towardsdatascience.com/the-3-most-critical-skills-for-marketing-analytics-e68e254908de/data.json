This makes it a rich and rewarding business to support as an analyst or a data scientist, as the volume and utility of data can be incredibly high, increasing the need and the scope of potential projects for the analytics professional.", "Marketing data has some important pitfalls, however, that can de-rail Marketing analytics programs:", "In this article, I\u2019ll explain the 3 critical skills that will enable you to overcome these pitfalls.", "SQL and data manipulation skills aren\u2019t going to be enough to effectively get all the data you\u2019ll need to measure marketing programs \u2014 unless you want to manually download excel spreadsheets every day. You\u2019ll need to learn how to code with REST APIs to automatically pull ad platform/click-stream/and other marketing data.", "The biggest lie that you may have been told is that you need to be a developer to work with APIs. The truth: you don\u2019t. Here are a couple of tips and tricks that will get you 80% of the way there:", "It\u2019s more than likely that your website is the primary place you send traffic and clicks with your marketing campaigns. Subsequently, to tell a complete marketing story you need to understand web analytics, clickstream data, and how that data ties to the ads you are creating.", "Here\u2019s a simple example of some raw click-stream data:", "You can see there is a timestamp, a unique identifier, the URL, and an SDID column that contains the unique campaign identifier from the URL tracking parameters (The tracking parameters are the values after the \u2018?\u2019 in the URL).", "When campaigns are created in an ad platform (Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, etc.) \u2014 information from those campaigns or ads needs to tie back to the URL where traffic is being directed. This typically happens with URL tracking parameters, but you\u2019d be surprised how many marketing teams are either a) not tagging anything, or b) tagging ads inconsistently or incorrectly. Any discrepancy between tagging and analytics is going to mean huge gaps in the data that you are trying to collect, which will make it extremely challenging, or impossible to effectively measure marketing campaigns.", "Due to the complexity of this process, I always recommend that the analyst/data scientist/whoever is going to be in charge of measurement of marketing programs, be involved with or create the tracking and tagging strategy herself. Typically the marketing team or agency will create the tagging strategy, which often leaves valuable data off the table due to a misunderstanding of the data gathering and cleaning process (for example, using the same unique identifier on multiple advertisements will make it impossible to tell which ad was responsible for the traffic/conversions/etc.). When the analyst herself owns this process, getting clean data at the end will be infinitely easier.", "The above process is something that rarely happens, even with marketing teams at the biggest most technical companies. Typically, the marketers will use Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics dashboards OR they\u2019ll default to platform-specific analytics. This can work sometimes \u2014 especially if you\u2019re primarily an eCommerce company. Problems arise when you want all the data tied together \u2014 which currently can only be done by an analytics professional who understands the dynamics of what I\u2019ve discussed above. B2B businesses are especially susceptible to this problem as many B2B sales take place in conference rooms and not online. So to actually measure marketing impact on sales you have to somehow connect marketing data to CRM data \u2014 which is incredibly challenging without the right analytics talent \u2014 i.e. someone whos learned these critical skills.", "Once you have clean data compiled and integrated, then you\u2019re ready to make that data digestible for marketing and sales teams to consume. This may be the most difficult and nuanced skill of all, as it requires you to move outside of doing technical analytics and data work, and spend time with business and marketing practitioners. You need to have a few things clear before you can create a dashboard or report that can effectively communicate marketing performance:", "The three skills I\u2019ve outlined above are absolutely critical for doing good marketing analytics. Without them, you\u2019ll be unable to effectively measure and report on your companies marketing programs. With them, you\u2019ll become a rare asset that will quickly make you the marketer's best friend.", "Questions or comments? You can email me at cwarren@stitcher.tech.
