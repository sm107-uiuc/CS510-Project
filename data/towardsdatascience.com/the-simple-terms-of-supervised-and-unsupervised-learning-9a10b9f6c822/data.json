In this case, you have been given a bunch of images of vehicle types.", "Supervised learning means that our training data is made of images and their corresponding class labels. Let\u2019s say you have pictures of cars, bikes, buses, and others, all with their proper name or known as the ground truth. Next, you can train an image classifier that takes in an image as input. The goal is to produce a label that is as close to the actual class label as possible. As you train the classifier, it tries to improve its accuracy.", "Supervised learning means we have a particular identified target; in this case, the known label, to aim for during the training process. When the model is highly accurate at learning, we achieve successful training on how to predict actual labels, given new data it hasn\u2019t seen before. In other words, data that wasn\u2019t part of a training set.", "Let\u2019s think about how you might approach this task if we were not given any labels. So our training set is made of unlabeled images. We\u2019ll have to take an unsupervised approach. This means that instead of relying on giving information about how to group all labeled data, we have to find natural groupings in the data.", "You can train an algorithm to separate images into clusters according to perceived similarities in color or geometric traits. But you don\u2019t have a way of checking that these groupings are correct or incorrect. So there is no measure for accuracy.", "You have to develop a new metric for separating data into groups. Something like the distance between similar and different groups of data, and at the end of the training, will end up with an image clustering algorithm. The way images are clustered together is meant to give us some insight into what patterns naturally emerge from a given dataset.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss a little bit about model design and algorithms selection. Choosing an unsupervised or supervised approach has a lot to do with your end goal.", "Unsupervised learning is often most useful when your end goal is relatively simple.", "For example, when you only want to group similar observations, you don\u2019t need a lot of detail about each view. To arrange vehicles into cars, bikes, and buses, you probably don\u2019t need the specific car model. Alternatively, say you\u2019ve been asked to distinguish between different models of cars, like images of a Tesla versus Toyota Prius.", "You may want to go the extra step of labeling your vehicle image data to train a specific classification model (Jing et al., 2012\u00b9). If you have a lot of unlabeled data, you may be wondering how to label this data efficiently. Unfortunately, data labeling is an intensive human task. Ideally, you\u2019d want to send your raw images to people who can manually draw bounding boxes around different car models, as recognizing car models is a problem you are solving.", "Lorbach, Poppe, and Veltkamp (2019) also think of ways to automate data labeling tasks with the help of an active learning model, the machine learning model that can learn from initial human annotations. The services like Amazon SageMaker\u00b3 combines these two capabilities and approaches by sending the data to real humans and creating an active learning model for future tasks into one feature called ground truth.", "Ground truth tries to solve the problem of going from raw data to label training data. It allows you first to send some of your data to be labeled by humans than having gotten this initial labels. It trains a machine learning model that learns to automate this labeling task in the future. Overall, these reduce the time and cost of labeling similar datasets in the future by about 70 percent.", "One commonly used image segmentation technique is K-means clustering. It\u2019s a machine learning technique that separates an image into segments by clustering or grouping data points with similar traits.", "K-means is called an unsupervised learning method, which means you don\u2019t need to label data. Instead, unsupervised learning aims to group and characterize unlabeled datasets. In doing so, it often identifies patterns and similarities in groups of data. You can give K-means a set of any unlabeled data.", "So, you can give K-means a set of any unlabeled data, like the pixel values in an image, and tell it to break it into K clusters where K is a variable whose value you choose.", "Supervised learning lets you collect data or generate outputs from previous experiences. You train the machine using data that is labeled. However, unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique where you do not require to supervise the model, and it helps you to find all kinds of unknown patterns in data.", "Wie Kiang is a researcher who is responsible for collecting, organizing, and analyzing opinions and data to solve problems, explore issues, and predict trends.", "He is working in almost every sector of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. He is carrying out experiments and investigations in a range of areas, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Recurrent Neural Networks.", "Your home for data science.
