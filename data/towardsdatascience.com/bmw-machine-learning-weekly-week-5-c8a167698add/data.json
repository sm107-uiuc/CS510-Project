No single test exists, and brain scans alone can\u2019t determine whether someone has the disease. Furthermore, it is not always obvious when patients are in the early stages of the disease. Alterations in the brain can cause subtle changes in behavior and sleep patterns years before people start experiencing confusion and memory loss. Researchers think AI could recognize these changes early and identify patients at risk of developing the most severe forms of the disease. Dina Katabi and her team at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and AI Laboratory developed a subtle flat white device that could recognize movements, like pacing and wandering, which can be signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. The device knows when a person gets out of bed, gets dressed, walks to their window, or goes to the bathroom. It can tell if they are sleeping or have fallen. It does this by using low-power wireless signals to map their gait speed, sleep patterns, location, and even breathing pattern. All that information gets uploaded to the cloud, where ML algorithms find patterns in the thousands of movements makes every day. Devices equipped with such algorithms could be installed in people\u2019s homes or in long-term care facilities to monitor those at risk. For patients who already have a diagnosis, such technology could help doctors make adjustments in their care.", "A woman was struck and killed on Sunday night by an autonomous car operated by Uber in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The accident involved a Volvo that Uber had outfitted with radar, cameras and other sensors and computer gear that enable it to navigate without input from a driver. Although a safety driver was in the vehicle at the time, it was in autonomous mode when it struck and killed the biker. A (quite explicit) video with footage from the vehicle\u2019s interior and exterior camera can be watched here. MIT Technology Review published an article reflecting on the potential repercussions of the fatal accident, conclude that, so far, the public has (unexpectedly) shown little sign of turning against the technology of autonomous driving, even after such incidents. Nonetheless, car manufacturers such as Toyota decided to take autonomous driving cars off the road for now.", "ML can be extremely beneficial in proving a case in point when attempting to convince authorities that certain laws are not enforced sufficiently. For example, Alex Bell, a 30-year old computer scientist in New York City created a prototype of a deep learning algorithm (a type of ML) that studies footage from a traffic camera and tracks precisely how often bike lanes are obstructed by delivery trucks, parked cars and waiting cabs, among other scofflaws. The project focused on one city block, over the course of 10 days. The work took about three weeks (see source code here). It is an analysis that it out of the ordinary compared to most NYC Traffic data analyses. The preliminary findings were stark: Using traffic-camera footage trained on one bus stop and two bike lanes (one for traveling north, the other for heading south), Bell found that the bus stop was blocked 57 percent of the time, while the bike lanes were blocked 40 percent of the time.", "Your home for data science.
