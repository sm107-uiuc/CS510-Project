If you are thinking \u201cYES I DO\u201d then this is the article for you.", "Thanks to machine learning you can scan your face features and compare it with a database of 2.6 million faces of over 3.000 celebrities.", "After reading this guide, you will know the following:", "To know which celebrity is most similar to ourselves, we have to perform the following steps. These steps will be explained in more detail throughout the article:", "Before we get into the coding, we need to have a high level introduction of some concepts. Face recognition is the process of identifying people from images. Thanks to recent developments in the machine learning field, we are now able to let the model itself learn which features it should extract from the images.", "Deep convolutional neural networks are currently dominating the image classification domain. The trend in the latest years is building deeper neural networks to solve more and more complex image classification tasks. Since the scope of this article is rather limited, we will just explain the intuition behind it.", "The process goes as follows, we feed the network a face image. This face image will then be fed to multiple layers (the convolutional base). In the first layers, the basic features are detected: edges, corners,\u2026. The middle layers detects parts of objects. In our case, they might learn to detect: eyes, noses, ears,\u2026 . In the last layers, they learn to recognize full objects, in different shapes and positions. Then based on all these detected features, the classifier makes a prediction.", "Resnet50 is a deep learning convolutional neural network that achieved state-of-the-art results on standard face recognition datasets. It used the VGGFace2 dataset which is a large-scale face dataset which contains over 3.31 million images of 9.9131 subjects. The main difference with a standard convolutional neural network is that it uses residual learning. This means that instead of trying to learn features, it tries to learn the residuals. A more extensive explanation can be found here.", "First, we need to install the necessary packages. To be certain to have the same results as me, I suggest you run this code on the google colaboratory environment. A colaboratory notebook executes the code on Google\u2019s cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware regardless of the power of your machine. Best of all, it is completely free!", "Import the installed packages as follows:", "For the sake of this exercise, we import a picture of Channing Tatum. This makes it easily reproducible for everyone and also proves the accuracy of the model. Change the url link with a image link of yourself (hint: you could use the image url of your linkedin account).", "The image is now loaded in. Since our model only needs the faces, we need to extract the face out of the image. For this we use the mtcnn package. The MTCNN achieves state-of-the-art results and is capable of detecting various face features (eyes, mouth,\u2026). More information about MTCNN this can be found here.", "We then determine some face extraction parameters:", "We call the detector to detect the face in the image given. We see that the face was detected with 99,8% probability. The key points are assigned coordinates.", "By using the box variable, we can determine the coordinates of the face.", "After selecting the face in the image, we resize our face to the required format for ResNet-50: 224,224.", "The ResNet-50 model expects to have multiple images as input. Currently, we have only one image. To solve this discrepancy, we expand with 1 dimension so we have a 1 x 224 x 224 x 3 shape instead of a 224 x 224 x 3 shape.", "Machine learning models needs to be fed with consistent data. To make sure that all our images are consistent, we have to apply a normalization function. Luckily we can use the preprocess_input function from Keras to normalize our face images. This function will normalize the pixel values ranging between 0 and 255 to make them suitable for deep learning. Don\u2019t forget to set the version parameter to \u201c2\u201d to have the specifically preprocessing for ResNet-50.", "All the preparation is now done. Great job!", "Here, we initialize our ResNet50 model by calling the VGGFace instance. We double check what inputs the model expect and what outputs the model will give.", "Next, we let our model predict the preprocessed face.", "The face has now been predicted. We just need to decode our predictions and print it out in a readable manner.", "And there you go! You just performed a prediction with the help of a convolutional neural network. If you performed this with the Channing Tatum image, don\u2019t forget to try it out with an image of yourself to see with which celebrity you have the biggest similarities.", "In a next step, we could apply transfer learning. Transfer learning refers to the process of re-using a pre-trained model of one problem and applying it on a different problem. We could use this state-of-the-art ResNet-50 model and re-train the classification layer on a different set of people.", "The full code can be found on my github. I would suggest using google collab when executing the code.", "Your home for data science.
