I\u2019ve recently found some time to experiment neural language processing for a very specific use-case related to my daily work, sentiment analysis of customer reviews on fashion items.", "I\u2019ve been working in fashion e-commerce for almost four years now, and something really important for any e-commerce is customer reviews. So I was wondering, \u201cwhat if we could anticipate customer\u2019s review, so we could help them before they even ask\u201d. If you look at Amazon, or App Store reviews, imagine if you could reduce all the negative feedbacks. So I looked into it a bit more closely, and it took me only a couple hours to get something working.", "So let\u2019s say we have a product page where customer can leave a review and, as a business, I want to limit the negative one but also help my customers. From that point of view, my idea is simple, if the customer types something negative, we would show a button for customer support. But how to know if it\u2019s negative?", "Well, that\u2019s the part it\u2019s getting interesting. I\u2019m going to use some basic neural language processing (or NLP) algorithm to do a sentiment analysis of it. This part mix more knowledge of data analysis and a bit of machine learning than iOS development, but bear with me, Apple made it very straightforward for us.", "First, I needed some data to train my model on. Lucky enough, I\u2019ve found a dataset of women\u2019s clothing reviews on Kaggle with more than 20 000 records. That\u2019s enough to start. It includes rating and review but a recommendation field.", "From that data, I need to define what is a \u201cpositive\u201d feedback and \u201cnegative\u201d one. I\u2019m not a data scientist, I don\u2019t have much background on this, so I only applied a simple logic: if the customer rated the item 4 or 5 (out of 5) OR if the customer recommended the item, then I would consider it positive. Otherwise, it would be negative. I believe, I genuinely believe I do the same: if I recommend a service to a friend, or if I leave a good review, it would be at least a 4.", "Ideally, you want to keep a neutral review as well, to balance out, but I\u2019ll keep it simple for time being.", "From there, I applied that rule to the whole dataset. Now we can train our machine learning model in Swift.", "With CoreML and CreateML, Apple made it very easy for developers to create new machine learning models base on predefined computed one. Since I\u2019m interested in sentiment analysis in text, I\u2019ll be using MLTextClassifier for this. I was surprised how short the code was to build it.", "When running, this will take a couple minutes. Compare to my previous try in fashion image classifier, it feels way faster.", "Now that the first version of my fashion sentiment analysis model is ready, let\u2019s test it. Good thing, I can still do that in Xcode Playground.", "Based on the result, it seems working decently, and that blows my mind.", "Of course, I can manage to have false positive using more complex and nuanced sentence, with double negation for instance, but for the time I spent on this, I\u2019m very happy with this first result.", "From here, I can drop this model into an iOS app and from there, when a user pauses typing during a review, I can let the device run a quick sentiment analysis on it and show a \u201ccall customer support\u201d to prevent him to leave a bad review but also help him improve his user experience overall.", "I can also work further on the model itself, the more data you have and the more time you spend on tweaking the model, the better accuracy you\u2019ll get. Each project is different, and I feel that each model should be, to adapt to your own problem.", "In conclusion, starting from a user experience problem or a business one, we found a way to improve the user experience by using machine learning and simple data analysis concepts. If this seems far from iOS development of day to day, it amazes me how fast it was to prototype a first version. Obviously, the more complex is your app (and product), the more data you would need to refine and keep the accuracy high.", "For now, this one is limited to women clothing items, but it makes me wonder how far we could go to keep the UX of our iOS app really sharp.", "You can read the original article on https://benoitpasquier.com.", "Your home for data science.
