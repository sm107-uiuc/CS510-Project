Machine learning techniques are used to evaluate a piece of text and determine the sentiment behind it.", "Sentiment analysis is essential for businesses to gauge customer response.", "Picture this: Your company has just released a new product that is being advertised on a number of different channels.", "In order to gauge customer\u2019s response to this product, sentiment analysis can be performed.", "Customers usually talk about products on social media and customer feedback forums. This data can be collected and analyzed to gauge overall customer response.", "Taking this a step further, trends in the data can also be examined. For example, customers of a certain age group and demographic may respond more favourably to a certain product than others.", "Based on the information collected, companies can then position the product differently or change their target audience.", "In this article, I will guide you through the end to end process of performing sentiment analysis on a large amount of data.", "We will be using the Reviews.csv file from Kaggle\u2019s Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset to perform the analysis.", "I use a Jupyter Notebook for all analysis and visualization, but any Python IDE will do the job.", "Checking the head of the dataframe:", "We can see that the dataframe contains some product, user and review information.", "The data that we will be using most for this analysis is \u201cSummary\u201d, \u201cText\u201d, and \u201cScore.\u201d", "Text \u2014 This variable contains the complete product review information.", "Summary \u2014 This is a summary of the entire review.", "Score \u2014 The product rating provided by the customer.", "Now, we will take a look at the variable \u201cScore\u201d to see if majority of the customer ratings are positive or negative.", "To do this, you will have to install the Plotly library first.", "The resulting plot looks like this:", "From here, we can see that most of the customer rating is positive. This leads me to believe that most reviews will be pretty positive too, which will be analyzed in a while.", "Now, we can create some wordclouds to see the most frequently used words in the reviews.", "Running the code above generates a word cloud that looks like this:", "Some popular words that can be observed here include \u201ctaste,\u201d \u201cproduct,\u201d \u201clove,\u201d and \u201cAmazon.\u201d These words are mostly positive, also indicating that most reviews in the dataset express a positive sentiment.", "In this step, we will classify reviews into \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative,\u201d so we can use this as training data for our sentiment classification model.", "Positive reviews will be classified as +1, and negative reviews will be classified as -1.", "We will classify all reviews with \u2018Score\u2019 > 3 as +1, indicating that they are positive.", "All reviews with \u2018Score\u2019 < 3 will be classified as -1. Reviews with \u2018Score\u2019 = 3 will be dropped, because they are neutral. Our model will only classify positive and negative reviews.", "Looking at the head of the data frame now, we can see a new column called \u2018sentiment:\u2019", "Now that we have classified tweets into positive and negative, let\u2019s build wordclouds for each!", "First, we will create two data frames \u2014 one with all the positive reviews, and another with all the negative reviews.", "As seen above, the positive sentiment word cloud was full of positive words, such as \u201clove,\u201d \u201cbest,\u201d and \u201cdelicious.\u201d", "The negative sentiment word cloud was filled with mostly negative words, such as \u201cdisappointed,\u201d and \u201cyuck.\u201d", "The words \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cgreat\u201d initially appeared in the negative sentiment word cloud, despite being positive words. This is probably because they were used in a negative context, such as \u201cnot good.\u201d Due to this, I removed those two words from the word cloud.", "Finaly, we can take a look at the distribution of reviews with sentiment across the dataset:", "Finally, we can build the sentiment analysis model!", "This model will take reviews in as input. It will then come up with a prediction on whether the review is positive or negative.", "This is a classification task, so we will train a simple logistic regression model to do it.", "For reference, take a look at the data frame again:", "There are a few steps we need to take:", "We will be using the summary data to come up with predictions. First, we need to remove all punctuation from the data.", "The new data frame should only have two columns \u2014 \u201cSummary\u201d (the review text data), and \u201csentiment\u201d (the target variable).", "Taking a look at the head of the new data frame, this is the data it will now contain:", "We will now split the data frame into train and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training, and 20% will be used for testing.", "Next, we will use a count vectorizer from the Scikit-learn library.", "This will transform the text in our data frame into a bag of words model, which will contain a sparse matrix of integers. The number of occurrences of each word will be counted and printed.", "We will need to convert the text into a bag-of-words model since the logistic regression algorithm cannot understand text.", "We have successfully built a simple logistic regression model, and trained the data on it. We also made predictions using the model.", "Now, we can test the accuracy of our model!", "You will get a confusion matrix that looks like this:", "The overall accuracy of the model on the test data is around 93%, which is pretty good considering we didn\u2019t do any feature extraction or much preprocessing.", "I hope you learnt something useful from this tutorial. A good exercise for you to try out after this would be to include all three sentiments in your classification task \u2014 positive,negative, and neutral.", "Thanks for reading, and remember \u2014 Never stop learning!", "The world is a university and everyone in it is a teacher.
