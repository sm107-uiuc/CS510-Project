Regarded as mecca of ideas, they have attracted the most high-level speakers such as Bill Gates, Al Gore or Stephen Hawking. As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx have published more than 2000 talks of up to 18 minute length available for free on the Internet.", "What if you could set up a model that would predict whether the speaker giving the TED Talk is a man or a woman? A bit like predicting the authorship of a book, is there a technique to classify documents according to a certain characteristic?", "Yes! And I show you how.", "Using a dataset containing the transcripts of 1060 TED talks, I apply a naive bayes classifier to predict whether the talks were given by a female or male speaker.", "Before I create the document-feature-matrix, I take a quick look at the distribution of my main variable of interest: gender. The code below shows that the dataset is biased: most of the speakers are male. Why is this important? We need to consider this carefully when we apply the naive bayes classifier as this might strongly influence the performance of the algorithm!", "But let\u2019s leave it like that for now.", "The basic steps in creating a document-feature-matrix is to first create a corpus defining the text field and then apply the basic pre-processing techniques including the removal of stopwords and tokenisation. I also randomise the rows to make sure the division between train, dev and test set is completely random.", "I can now start with my first model. Note that I rely here mainly on the commands from the quanteda package in R. I divide my dfm into three: a train, a dev and a test set. Usually, the randomisation of the rows should ensure that you keep approximately the same class distribution (i.e. male vs. female) across the three different datasets. But always make sure to check if this is really the case.", "Now, I train my naive bayes classifier and run it. The first model is done!", "To evaluate the performance of my model, I run a confusion matrix as shown below. The following metrics are important to consider: accuracy, prevision, recall and F1. With a level of accuracy of 0.6557 one could say that my model is performing well. However, in the case of my biased dataset (remember that there were more male than female speakers in the dataset?), looking at accuracy levels as a metric for model performance can be misleading. Why? Because your model will predict the dominant class most of the time and still achieve a relatively high overall accuracy.", "That\u2019s why it is always better to look at other metrics as well.", "A precision of 0.083 indicated that my model has a high number of false positives. Similarly, a recall of 0.461 also indicated that my model has some false negatives. A level of F1 of 0.141 is also low and suggests a weak accuracy of the model. Thus, these metrics suggest that my model actually does not fare well at predicting whether or not the TED Talk speakers are male or female. It\u2019s time to adjust it!", "What happens if I remedy to the gender imbalance in my dataset? To do this, I rely on a common sampling method. Basically, I seek to transform my imbalanced data into a balanced distribution so that it hopefully improves my model. The modification occurs by altering the size of the original dataset and providing the same proportion of balance.", "In R, packages such as ROSE and DMwR help us perform sampling strategies quickly. Here, I use the ROSE package.", "As a first step, I start with oversampling: I bring the female number to an equal level with the male number (i.e. 795 each). In other words, I have instructed R to over sample the minority female class until it reaches the same level as the male class and thus the total set should comprise of 1590 observations.", "In a second step, I perform undersampling: I lower the number of observations for my majority class (male) to equal the minority class (female, i.e. 265 each). In other words, I have instructed R to undersample the male class until it reaches 265 and thus the total set is reduced to 530 observations.", "In a final step, I achieve balance by combining both under and oversampling methods. This can be achieved using the method = both. In this case, the minority class is oversampled with replacement and the majority class is undersampled without replacement. This balanced dataset is considered best to fit my model as simply oversampling can lead to a number of repeated observations while simply undersampling can deprive the dataset from important information.", "As such, I know have a new balanced dataset (TedTalks_balanced) that I prepare for the naive bayes classifier in the same way I did before with the unbalanced dataset: I make sure to randomise the rows, create a corpus, run the basic pre-processing techniques and subsequently create a new dfm.", "Similar to my first model, I also split the balanced dataset between a training set (60% of the observations), a dev test (20% of the observations) and a test set (20% of the observations).", "I then apply the naive bayes classifier as shown in the code below.", "Not surprisingly, my newly adjusted model fares much better when it comes to evaluating its performance. The level of accuracy is higher but most importantly, I have high levels of precision, recall and F1 which points to a low number of false positives or false negatives. Thus, by balancing the dataset using the ROSE package, I was able to significantly improve the performance of the algorithm in predicting whether or not a TED Talk was given by a male or a female speaker.", "Finally, I test my model on the test set. The results of the confusion matrix shows that the model performs well in predicting the gender of the TED Talk speaker. I have very similar accuracy, precision, recall and F1 values than on the dev test.", "That\u2019s it! Creating a naive bayes classifier in natural language processing is easy and allows you to predict cool things such as the gender of a TED Talk speaker.", "Simply make sure to check the distribution of your variable of interest as biases can significantly affect the performance of your model. Also, accuracy should not be taken as the only metric when assessing your model as it can sometimes be misleading. Instead, always include other metrics such as precision, recall and F1.", "I regularly write articles about Data Science and Natural Language Processing \u2014 if you would like to keep updated about my articles don\u2019t hesitate to follow me!", "Your home for data science.
