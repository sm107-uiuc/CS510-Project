I have finished lots of ML and AI courses, and I felt it was time for me to give back to the community.", "So I started a blog on Blogger named LightSpeedAC, to share my knowledge to the thousands willing to get into artificial intelligence, machine learning or deep learning. I began by writing a couple of introductory blogs on NNs and, of course, an MNIST tutorial. I feel that although writing a data science or AI blog isn\u2019t too hard, and there are a few things you\u2019ve got to keep in mind. And I\u2019m going to share them with you.", "For a beginner, the blog shouldn\u2019t look full of foreign words and terminology. Yes, ML does have a few scary words, yet most of them mean surprisingly simple things! Also, keep it as less theoretical as possible. I found that people were more interested to know how it works and then directly move on to the code. I deliberately kept the blog\u2019s name LightSpeed to ensure interest.", "Another super-important thing is to write what you mean, and mean what you write. If your blog is titled Zero to Hero of AI and you finish with an MNIST tutorial, that\u2019s total clickbait! Also, being frank to the reader always helps in many ways.", "The last thing I wanted to say was that an AI blog that teaches some concept has to have code!! A theoretical blog may be easier to write, but you end up giving them the knowledge they have no means to implement. And quite obviously, the code needs to be full of comments and explanations, as the reader should be able to follow through every line. It always helps if you encourage the reader to play around with some lines of code, like hyperparameters.", "An additional tip, to make your blog reader-friendly, is using Grammarly to ensure spotless grammar. It is more important than you think! I wrote a blog about the importance of grammar for bloggers.", "It is always good to write about something people haven\u2019t written about before, although that\u2019s not always possible. I knew that there were thousands of MNIST tutorials, yet I still wrote another. Why? Because I felt that none of them had line-by-line code comments like mine. Another time, I wrote a blog about Activation Functions. Again, I knew that there were hundreds of them, some here on Towards Data Science, that were very good in content. Yet most of them explained the function. I, on the other hand, did a comparison and details about what activation to use and in what circumstance. Thus, I wrote this manual of activation functions. Find the opportunities and grab them!", "Naturally, that would be the very next question. This one doesn\u2019t have a clear answer, I suppose. I took many different paths and regularly checked what worked and didn\u2019t.", "The first thing I tried was Quora. And there are two stories to this. My co-author (my brother, practically) also tried the same for our blog. Both of us started at about the same time. After 18 days, I was booming with 4k views and getting good traffic due to my 80 answers, and my brother was facing a 2-week ban from Quora.", "What was the reason for these drastically different results?", "My answers on Quora were genuine, with less than 40% of them having links to my blog site. I ensured that the reader would want to go to my website to learn better. I wasn\u2019t spamming, just helping.", "My brother\u2019s, as you can guess, were spam.", "If the question is \u201cHow does a good blog look?\u201d", "He would answer \u201cA good blog looks like this.\u201d", "By that story, I meant to make you understand how to get traffic from Quora, and how to get a ban.", "The next thing I did, which was even more useful, was emailing. I mailed lots and lots of companies requesting collaborative opportunities. Some replied while others didn\u2019t. But the best part was the feedback every company gave. And I am talking big companies like Coursera, Grammarly and even deeplearning.ai! These emails helped me significantly increase market presence.", "I blogged regularly, like every two days, which helped increase my presence. Also, I removed several low-performing blogs to help maintain content quality.", "If you\u2019re starting a blog, that\u2019s great! Comment below with the link!", "Mail me up at my Gmail for any TensorFlow, Keras, TFjS or Python doubts or projects!", "Thank you, and have a beautiful day!", "Your home for data science.
