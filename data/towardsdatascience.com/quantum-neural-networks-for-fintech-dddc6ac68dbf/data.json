We will also provide links to a tutorial on Github training the model on pharmaceutical sales data.", "What is a quantum neural network? To answer this, we need to understand the concept of qubits and a quantum circuit, a basic diagram used in quantum computing to depict operations on qubits. Quantum circuits are very similar to circuit diagrams depicting logic gates operating on binary bits used in classical computing such as on your phone or laptop. Qubits are the quantum computing version of bits, and behave differently than bits. Many speak of qubits as though they are mystical and exist as \u201cboth zero and one at the same time.\u201d This is actually incorrect though, and an oversimplification of their behavior, sweeping the mathematical precision under the rug. This is done either out of misunderstanding on the author\u2019s part or out of an expectation by the author that the reader\u2019s knowledge or attention span is lacking. The appropriate way to think of the state of a qubit is as a position on a sphere, such as the surface of the earth, with the North Pole being \u201c1\u201d and the South Pole being \u201c0\u201d. Quantum gates operate on this position, moving it around the globe.", "If we have several qubits we can operate on them individually with several gates, or simultaneously with a single multi-qubit gate. We draw a circuit diagram to represent which qubits pass through certain gates at a particular time. For a basic introduction to qubits and basic concepts from quantum mechanics, Leonard Susskind\u2019s book \u201cQuantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum\u201d is quite good for newcomers with only a little linear algebra as a prerequisite.", "Certain quantum circuits behave very much like the neural networks we know and love from machine learning. We can develop \u201cvariational quantum circuits\u201d that mimic the behavior of the deep neural networks that have become so popular and effective in deep learning. The gates in these circuits behave like layers of a neural network, and we can train them in various ways to perform all the same tasks as the neural networks you might use in TensorFlow or Pytorch.", "In fact, in many cases, quantum methods provide an extreme improvement in computational power and accuracy. Even simulating such methods classically has shown up to 100x improvement as seen in applications of TensorNetwork, a library built by Google which uses TensorFlow as its backend and allows users to replace layers of a neural network with a tensor network. If you\u2019re not familiar with what tensor networks are, check out my other post on how they can be used to simulate quantum circuits, and how they are being used in machine learning by Google and others.", "Okay, so quantum circuits can be trained like neural networks and can perform tasks that neural networks can. Then what? Well, then you can run it on an actual quantum computer! I know, most of the news you\u2019ve read says quantum computing is still several years out and that practical applications are still unclear. That information is horribly outdated and inaccurate. Don\u2019t believe me? Try out IBMQ Quantum Experience and see for yourself. IBM currently allows users to sign up for a free account and develop code in Qiskit, which can then be run on one of the IBM quantum computers. In fact, I have a Github tutorial repo showing you how to use open source software PennyLane to perform various quantum machine learning tasks! Let\u2019s have a look at one of those examples.", "As we can see below, the quantum neural network, based on photonic quantum computing in Strawberry Fields, learns to smooth the noisy data (seen in red).", "If you don\u2019t know much about FinTech, or financial technology, it\u2019s just a buzzword for technology applied to finance and investing. It can be anything from an app that tracks your spending to the latest and greatest in machine learning models for stock trading. Our example is a model for fitting 1-dimensional functions to time series data. In particular, this is a modified example from PennyLane that is trained on some synthetic data, as well as on some pharmaceutical sales data over a period of about 17 years from an Australian drug company. The data has been rescaled, but otherwise unprocessed and unaltered. The model took anywhere from 12\u201324 hours to train. The time it takes for training the simulated version should not come as a surprise due to the fact that simulating quantum circuits is generally quite difficult for classical (bit based) computers to do. The results of the function the model has learned can be seen in red.", "The applications of quantum machine learning are no longer a prediction of what is to come, they are a reality, and a fascinating one at that! A few things should be mentioned at this point. First, the number of qubits required to perform these computations is well within the capabilities of current quantum computing hardware. Second, not only is this a task we can perform on current quantum computers, but we actually have enough qubits on current hardware to use something called \u201cquantum error correction.\u201d This is a way of encoding redundant information into multiple qubits so that errors in computation are mitigated (the interested reader can also refer to \u201cQuantum Computing for Topological Codes\u201d for an introduction to quantum error correction).The number of qubits needed to use quantum error correction depends on the problem. So in some cases we are able to implement error correction on current hardware. When we consider the fact that many quantum machine learning algorithms such as the binary classifier tutorial I have on Github, require only a single qubit, and even the most basic publicly available hardware at IBM has five times that many qubits, it\u2019s not hard to see we are well within the realm of seeing real applications of quantum computers to things like time series function fitting and classification problems. Seeing businesses begin to invest in integrating quantum machine learning into their business model is purely a task of helping them understand how and why the technology is useful at this point.", "If you have ideas to share, questions, or if you are in need of consulting services for quantum machine learning contact the author via LinkedIn, visit The Singularity website, or checkout the Github tutorials.", "Your home for data science.
