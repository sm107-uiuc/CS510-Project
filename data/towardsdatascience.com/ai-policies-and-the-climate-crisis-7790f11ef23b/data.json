Looking at AI strategies from China, France, India, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States there is a clear difference in how the climate crisis is being addressed. China, France and India has a clear priority to do so whereas Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States do not.", "The strategies are part of an overall policy within each country as such the described strategies is used to represent AI Policy within each country and may not do so fully. There is more to the AI Policy for each country than is written in these documents whether they are plans or strategies, however these various strategy documents or plans will be the focus of this article.", "According to Jessica Cussins Newman in her report Toward AI Security there has been a great increase in the number of AI National Strategies & Policy Initiatives in the years between 2016\u20132018. I am very indebted to the work of Newman in writing this article, as she has been mapping AI Security and by doing so gathering an overview of different strategies that in turn gave me a better overview.", "I will run through the six countries in alphabetical order.", "One of the most extensive analysis of AI Policy around the world which I have found so far has been undertaken by Jessica Cussins Newman and is focused on AI Security. To begin I would say clearly that climate is not mentioned specifically in China\u2019s A New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u89c4\u5212), AI Policy from 2017. On the other hand \u2018sustainable\u2019 is mentioned four times. There was two mentions of environmental protection. I will discuss these four mentions of sustainable; two of environmental protection; and the context within which they are mentioned. I have found six focal points that can be linked to addressing the climate crisis within China\u2019s AI strategy from 2017.", "\u201cWe shall develop intelligent economy, construct intelligent society, safeguard national security, build the ecosystem with cluster integration of knowledge, technology, industry and mutual support of talent, system, culture, foresee the risks and challenges, propel sustainable development as the center of the intelligent, and as a result comprehensively enhance the social productive forces, national strength and national competitiveness for the purpose to speed up the construction of innovative countries and the science and technology power of the world, to achieve \u201ctwo hundred years\u201d goals and to provide strong support for the great rejuvenation of the nation.\u201d", "The first mention of sustainable is mentioned in the second section called \u2018Overall Requirements\u2019 within the first point \u2018(A) Guiding Thought\u2019. Towards the end the 200 year goals are mentioned. The Two Centenaries (Chinese: \u4e24\u4e2a\u4e00\u767e\u5e74) is a set of goals advanced by General Secretary Xi Jinping following the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2012. It is said to be the basic foundation for achieving the \u201cChinese Dream\u201d, another ideology advanced by Xi. They were formed back in the 80\u2019s. The goal for 2020 is the elimination of extreme poverty in China, linking it to GDP.", "\u2018Can hold continued nature\u2019, as such this relates perhaps to ecology as well as the other notion of ability to sustain.", "Sustainability has been a great part of China\u2019s current strategies, however linking it partly to GDP may be unfortunate as this has been shown increasingly to be an indicator which can have adverse effects. Exchanging this measurement tool could be fortunate, however then it may not be an easy way to retrospectively track.", "\u201cThe development of artificial intelligence is a complex systemic project related to the overall situation. In accordance with the layout of \u201cbuild a system, grasp the dual attributes, adhere to the Trinity, strengthen the four support\u201d , we shall form the strategic path for an healthy and sustainable developments of artificial intelligence.\u201d", "The Trinity mentioned here is dubious, and I may be wrong. However Carl von Clausewitz, who sought to illuminate the \u201ctrinity\u201d of strategy by connecting the relationship between the people, the military, and the government, Sun Tzu looked at the interdependencies between these actors while accounting for the role of nature, terrain, and laws in shaping strategy. Granted I may be wrong.", "On the other hand it is more likely that it refers to the goal of (1) a stable yuan, (2) open borders and (3) control of its own interest rates. This has been dubbed the impossible trinity.", "This section talks not only of the goal, and that sustainability is at the center, it also insists that the path to the goal must be healthy and sustainable.", "\u201cWe shall focus on the major scientific frontier issues of artificial intelligence, take into account the current needs and long-term development, break through the basic theory of artificial intelligence bottlenecks as the focus, and ensure that advanced layout may lead to artificial intelligence paradigm transformation of basic research, promote crossintegration of disciplines for sustainable development and depth applications of artificial intelligence and provide strong scientific reserves.\u201d", "In the translated document crossintegration is mentioned, and I have chosen to translate it to trandisciplinary.", "It is unsure in what way this will be ensured, and which \u2018type\u2019 of disciplines that should be involved. The focus on integrating disciplines is an interesting thought as this has proven challenging in many setting. It is certainly necessary in an academic, business or government environment that there are strong scientific reserves to help facilitate this collaboration as well.", "\u201cHigh performance computing infrastructure. Continue to strengthen the supercomputing infrastructure, distributed computing infrastructure and cloud computing center construction. Build a sustainable ecosystem for the consistent development of highperformance computing applications. Promote the next generation of supercomputer research and development applications.\u201d", "Since the pathway to AI must be \u2018sustainable\u2019 it makes sense that there needs to be a sustainable ecosystem for development. Sustainable and consistent may of course be open for interpretation, and the speed at which the development is outlined may be a challenge to the sustainability of the projects that occur.", "\u201cArtificial intelligence brings new opportunities for social construction. China is in a comprehensive stage of building a well-off society, population aging, resource environment constraints and other challenges are still grim and the application of artificial intelligence in education, medical care, pension, environmental protection, urban operation, judicial services and other fields will greatly improve the precision level of public service, comprehensively enhancing the quality of life of the people.\u201d", "This goal is too general to say much in specific, and yet specifically mentioning AI to be opportunities in a set of different areas. The main point to drive home here is that there is a wish to increase precision in public service. There has been a want from governments to be more accurate and specific operating in an ambiguous world with large population. China is the most populous country in the world with 1,379,302,771 people estimated in 2017. It is hard to equate quantitative understanding to quality of life, however with this large number it is clear that making sense of this data or making decisions is likely to involve a large degree of automation.", "\u201cIntelligent environmental protection. Establish big data platform for smart monitoring in the atmosphere, water, soil and other environmental areas. Build land and sea interaction, land and earth interaction, and information-sharing intelligent environment monitoring network and service platform. Research and develop intelligent forecasting models and early warning programs for resource energy consumption and environmental pollutant discharge. Strengthen the environmental protection and intelligent prevention and control systems for sudden environmental events in BeijingTianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Economic Zone and other major national strategic regions.\u201d", "This relates both to ensuring the protection of environmental sites and predicting sudden changes in the environment. Sudden changes are expected to occur more often going forward, and therefore it is important to be able to use more accurate models to predict or understand what is happening across a large area. Forecasting would necessarily have to be a collaboration which has been the case across the world for weather data, however the will to measure and forecast is nothing new \u2014 adding artificial intelligence to the mix is not a strange course of events.", "We can see six focal points that can be linked to addressing the climate crisis within China\u2019s AI strategy from 2017. I would argue it is addressed within the strategy and there can be initiatives developed on the basis of these points, or arguments made to bring projects to life within these focal points. I have added one question to each point.", "As a final remark I realise there are controversies about China that do not make these points unproblematic. I am not blind to these, however it is important to understand how we can work together to address the climate crisis \u2014 because it is a dire crisis and China has the largest population on the planet, we are all dependant on how China handles this pervasive issue.", "My topic for this week is looking at the AI Strategy in seeing the context in which they mention the climate, sustainability, environment and ecology. Largely taking a look at how they address the climate crisis in their AI Strategy. I have taken a surface look at: \u201cFor a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence: Towards a French and European Strategy.\u201d written from the 8th September 2017 to 8th March 2018.", "In the most ultimate French way it starts with a picture of the author who is a Mathematician and Member of the French Parliament. It was a mission assigned by the Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe. Part of the report consisted of travelling around to different AI hubs in the world and learning more about the topic. It was a team consisting of a varied collection of people.", "Straight off it is clearly visible that the French AI strategy has space dedicated to considering the climate and ecology when thinking about the development of artificial intelligence. The fourth section in their document is dedicated to using artificial intelligence to create a more ecological economy.", "In the executive summary of the report it is said that:", "\u201cCarving out a meaningful role for artificial intelligence also means addressing its sustainability, especially from an ecological standpoint. This does not just mean considering the application of AI in our ecological transition, but rather designing natively ecological AI and using it to tackle the impact of human action on the environment. This is an urgent matter as world data storage requirements, inherently correlated to the development of digital technology and AI, could exceed available worldwide silicon production out to 2040.\u201d", "Natively ecological AI sounds a bit like fluff, but there has been talk of different AI solutions that are not trained on massive datasets. As well as storing less data, so it has a practical discussion point elsewhere, and is talked of in the industry particularly in France. The question of resources is a good one too, which I have not seen mentioned enough elsewhere (particularly in the US strategy).", "Then again it was the Paris agreement which the world talks of, and it would be very sad indeed if the epicenter of a massive change with great agreement did not take these points seriously. \u201cAI must be included in initiatives emerging as part of the Paris Climate agreement and the Global Pact for the Environment.\u201d It is said as well to be a strategic imperative:", "To do this it is argued that there has to be a devoted space for AI research and energy resource optimisation research to meet. These thoughts include too a consumer perspective creating a platform to make consumers more aware of their choices in technology. \u201cThis platform should also include a simple calculator to enable all citizens to gain greater awareness of these impacts and compare the environmental footprint of the various products, services, software and hardware.\u201d", "The cloud industry is mentioned in particular, that: \u201cPublic authorities must also act to make the value chain greener and support the European cloud industry to promote its ecological transition.\u201d Uniquely, because I have not seen it elsewhere, this report argues for not only open software, but open hardware: \u201cLastly, making the AI value chain greener will clearly require open hardware and open software\u2026\u201d The last point, that was mentioned by China as well, was gathering large amounts of climate data.", "On page 103 it is argued that it has to be part of the international agenda.", "\u201cFrance could propose setting up a major event along the lines of the COP 21, to showcase exemplary and highimpact initiatives. It could also be more closely involved in the convergence of the two transitions, ecological and digital, within international forums, particularly the G7, where discussions concerning AI were initiated and where France is shortly to take over the presidency\u201d", "One specific existing project is mentioned that I would like to bring forward as well. The Tara Oceans Project: freeing-up massive amounts of data concerning the oceans for the purposes of understanding and modelling a planetary biome. It is argued too that France needs to make more public data available. There is a table presenting the possible use of public data in regards to the environment.", "Table from \u201cFor a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence: Towards a French and European Strategy.\u201d p.29 retrieved the 6th of November.", "It is stated in the report:", "\u201cBy 2040 the energy required for computation will equally have exceeded world energy production\u201d", "It is said in the report that digital energy consumption is increasing by 8.5% per year and its contribution to world electricity consumption could reach 20% in a moderate scenario or even 50% in a pessimistic scenario by 2030. We can therefore see consumption multiplied 10-fold in 20 years\u2019 time.", "Although AI is a potential threat to the environment, it is also a potential solution. They argue that the ESEC, the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council, needs to play a major role in the strictly political debate on artificial intelligence and its consequences.", "The French/European AI strategy has a clear focus on the environment and does not only talk of abstract priorities, but specific ways to address the issues.", "I found India\u2019s AI Strategy to be thorough dealing with a wide variety of different topics. The discussion paper National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence was released in June 2018. Jessica Newman in her analysis claims that the AI Strategy for India is quite extensive compared to others (such as the UK), covering a wide variety of topics. I am not saying this is bad or good, however I was interested to see how much climate concerns are present in the strategy.", "In the Indian strategy \u2018climate\u2019 is mentioned six times. Environment is mentioned in a different context relating more to people. However sustainability is mentioned quite a few times too.", "\u201cAs global climate becomes more vulnerable and unpredictable, dependence on unsustainable and resource intensive agriculture will only heighten the risks of food scarcity and agricultural distress [\u2026] The Indian agriculture sector is vulnerable to climate change due to being rain dependent. Varying weather patterns such as increase in temperature, changes in precipitation levels, and ground water density, can affect farmers especially in the rainfed areas of the country. AI can be used to predict advisories for sowing, pest control, input control can help in ensuring increased income and providing stability for the agricultural community.\u201d", "Not too long ago in 2017 more than 55% of Indians made a living from farming.

Similarly, India has been a pioneer in a sustained push for clean energy revolution by leading the International Solar Alliance, and setting an ambitious target of 100GW of installed solar energy capacity by 2022. With 20GW of installed solar capacity, India is well and truly on its way to achieving this target.\u201d", "India has made a goal to install large amounts of solar power in the country to become more renewable, and this is a goal worth striving for.", "\u201cGovernment data sharing: Government of India has large amounts of data lying in silos across ministries.

As jobs based on technology become prominent, so will the need to develop applied skills in a continuously changing environment.\u201d", "AI in education plattforms is an interesting proposition.", "\u201cToday, incumbents continue to enjoy an oligopoly in building sustainable business models in AI for two main reasons: (a) they can successfully buy data in the informal market setting due to availability of resources and reach to negotiate one-time contracts continually, and (b) they have specialised departments to work on different facets of the development value chain.\u201d", "This is a conversation of informal versus formal data. It seems informal data is relatively easy to get hold of in India, however as otherwise good data quality is needed so I can see this being an issue.", "Lastly this slide makes some good points regarding which areas we could invest effort into addressing the climate crisis.", "According to the Russian news agency TASS: \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin approved the National Strategy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence for the period until 2030.

Even at a governance or ethics tracks it does not seem like this word is the one that gets a crowd excited. On the other hand perhaps that depends on what \u2018types\u2019 of policy that you suggest to implement \u2014 discussing issues or areas for possible policy-making may not seem appropriately action oriented. Then again policy is a course or principle of action adopted or proposed, as such a framework for action. The British framework for action is the AI Sector Deal and it is in short what I will discuss in this article: how does it related to the climate crisis?", "First off we can start by saying that despite being updated on the 21st of May 2019 the AI Sector Deal does not mention the word \u2018climate\u2019, it does not mention the word \u2018crisis\u2019 either for that sake.

Seeing the prolonged Brexit negotiation is not an enlightening or bright process at all. Reading the current AI strategy in the United Kingdom was equally drab, it seems the United Kingdom is out of touch with its population or the global community when it does not mention at all climate or sustainability.", "In academia however one initiative that I find of interest is the Oxford Initiative on AI\u00d7SDGs. One possibility is for this initiative led by professor Luciano Floridi which lecture AI in Society \u2014 Opportunities and Risks you have to see.

To consider itself successful I would argue the initiative has to influence at least the local strategy in the United Kingdom in a different direction.", "Looking at the strategies of China, France and India there is a general focus on the environment and sustainability. It is easy to spot early on in the United States statement on the Whitehouse website in the Artificial Intelligence for the American People that there is no focus on climate change. The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan: 2019 did not contain many thoughts regarding the climate crisis either nor the ecological environment. Then again this may not come as a surprise since the President Trump formally pulled out of the Paris agreement, and this is being formalised to come into effect one day after the election of a new president.", "Thus since the current strategies and plans can be said to have no vision in regards to climate change, environment nor sustainability we have to look elsewhere for vision.", "The 23rd of October 2019 a post was made to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI).
