As of today (Mar 17, 2020), there are over four thousands of cases and 75 deaths in the United States, and these numbers are expected to go up in the next week or so, making the prevention and treatment of this respiratory illness a top priority at the national level.", "To help address this problem, researchers and leaders from the leading AI institutes, including Allen Institute for AI and Microsoft, and the federal government agency (i.e., the National Library of Medicine) have teamed together with extensive collaboration, resulting in the release of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) of scholarly literature about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and other kinds of coronavirus.", "This dataset is available on the Kaggle\u2019s website, which is publicly accessible to any AI researchers through the link below. Researchers in the AI world can\u2019t be unfamiliar with Kaggle \u2014 an online community of data scientists and machine learning researchers.", "As part of the Google company, Kaggle is best known for organizing various machine learning and data science challenges, including the current one \u2014 COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge, or simply CORD-19 Challenge.", "The CORD-19 dataset consists over 29,000 articles, among which 13,000 have full text. All of these articles are related to the study of coronavirus, such as case reports, transmission routines, environmental factors, and treatment strategy explorations. However, not all of these articles aren\u2019t machine-readable such that it\u2019s hard to utilize AI tools to extract useful information for us to battle this infectious disease.", "Fortunately, researchers from the Allen Institute for AI worked hard and helped AI researchers transform the content of this enormous size of literature into machine-readable form, which makes it possible for data and text mining using a machine learning approach.", "The Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Disease and 21st Century Health Threats of the US NASEM and the WHO identified 10 scientific questions that are vital to address this international crisis.", "These questions include studying the transmission and incubation of the virus, risk factors for getting the COVID-19, the origin of the virus, and the proper medical practice for treating this disease.", "The full list of the challenge\u2019s tasks are available on Kaggle\u2019s website.", "The winner of each task will get $1,000 as the prize. The winning submission is the one that has the best score against the evaluation criteria.", "This CORD-19 has attracted 122k views with over 3,000 downloads. More than 70 researchers have contributed to this challenge. In particular, the latest daily download number has exceeded 2,000.", "I hope that more AI researchers can help address this challenge.", "Your home for data science.
