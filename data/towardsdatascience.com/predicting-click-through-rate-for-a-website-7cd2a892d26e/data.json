From the above table, it is clear that title proximity tfidf, description proximity tfidf and city match contains null values.", "Since this dataset is about how many customers who visit the website click on apply, it may not be a lot and we can assume that it will be an imbalanced data. Let\u2019s find out if we are correct or not.", "As we can see that the distribution is indeed imbalanced. For handling such cases, there are various techniques like undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, using metrics like AUC. But those will be discussed later.", "Below are the observations from this table:", "Correlations allow you to look at the relationships between numeric features and other numeric features.", "Correlation is a value between -1 and 1 that represents how closely two features move in unison. You don\u2019t need to remember the math to calculate them. Just know the following intuition:", "Most of the features are not highly correlated to one another. The only two features which have some correlation is the main query tfidf and title proximity tfidf (around 0.8).", "One of the most important steps in Exploratory Data Analysis is outlier detection and treatment. Machine learning algorithms are very sensitive to the range and distribution of data points. Data outliers can deceive the training process resulting in longer training times and less accurate models. Outliers are defined as samples that are significantly different from the remaining data. Those are points that lie outside the overall pattern of the distribution. Statistical measures such as mean, variance and correlation are very susceptible to outliers.", "Outliers can occur in the dataset due to one of the following reasons,", "However, in this article, I will be detecting outliers using boxplot method. If you want to learn in-depth on how to detect and handle outliers, please refer to this article. Box plot diagram also termed as Whisker\u2019s plot is a graphical method typically depicted by quartiles and inter quartiles that helps in defining the upper limit and lower limit beyond which any data lying will be considered as outliers.", "In brief, quantiles are points in a distribution that relates to the rank order of values in that distribution. For a given sample, you can find any quantile by sorting the sample. The middle value of the sorted sample is the middle quantile or the 50th percentile (also known as the median of the sample).", "Below are the boxplots for our dataset.", "As you can see, there are a lot of outliers in the dataset. Removing them might result in the loss of important information.", "Data cleaning is one those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. Sure, it\u2019s not the \u201csexiest\u201d part of machine learning. And no, there aren\u2019t hidden tricks and secrets to uncover.", "However, proper data cleaning can make or break your project. Professional data scientists usually spend a very large portion of their time on this step.", "Why? Because of a simple truth in machine learning:", "In other words\u2026 garbage in gets you garbage out. Even if you forget everything else from this course, please remember this point.", "In fact, if you have a properly cleaned dataset, even simple algorithms can learn impressive insights from the data!", "Obviously, different types of data will require different types of cleaning. However, the systematic approach laid out in this article can always serve as a good starting point.", "The first step to data cleaning is removing unwanted observations from your dataset. This includes duplicate or irrelevant observations. Our dataset contains quite a few duplicate entries which will be removed.", "Missing data is a deceptively tricky issue in applied machine learning.", "First, just to be clear, you cannot simply ignore missing values in your dataset. You must handle them in some way for the very practical reason that most algorithms do not accept missing values.", "\u201cCommon sense\u201d is not sensible here", "The following are the most commonly recommended ways of dealing with missing data:", "If you want to know about them in greater detail, please refer to this article. In our case, two of the features (title proximity tfidf and description proximity tfidf ) contains mostly 0, hence I will replace missing value by 0. For city match feature, distribution of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s are almost equal. Here I have the option of either dropping the values which contain null or using substituting by mean. I have removed the values in this case.", "Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.", "In general, you can think of data cleaning as a process of subtraction and feature engineering as a process of addition.", "This is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for 3 big reasons:", "Below are some of the ways we can perform feature engineering but please note that this is not an exhaustive compendium of all feature engineering because there are limitless possibilities for this step. The good news is that this skill will naturally improve as you gain more experience.", "In our case, since there is not much domain knowledge about the dataset, we are restricted in our application of feature engineering. The only feature engineering that I have applied is multiplying the two features which were correlated (title_proximity_tfid and main_query_tfidf) to create a new column named main title tfidf.", "Some of the factors affecting the choice of a model are:", "An important criterion affecting the choice of algorithm is model complexity. Generally speaking, a model is more complex is:", "Besides this, the same machine learning algorithm can be made more complex based on the number of parameters or the choice of some hyperparameters. For example,", "Making the same algorithm more complex increases the chance of overfitting.", "Logistic Regression models fit a \u201cstraight line\u201d. In practice, they rarely perform well. We actually recommend skipping them for most machine learning problems.", "Their main advantage is that they are easy to interpret and understand. However, our goal is not to study the data and write a research report. Our goal is to build a model that can make accurate predictions.", "In this regard, logistic regression suffers from two major flaws:", "As mentioned above, logistic regression suffers from overfitting and difficulty in handling non-linear relationships. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by artificially penalizing model coefficients.", "Types of regularization are Lasso (L1), ridge (L2) and elastic net (compromise between ridge and lasso)", "Decision trees model data as a \u201ctree\u201d of hierarchical branches. They make branches until they reach \u201cleaves\u201d that represent predictions. Due to their branching structure, decision trees can easily model nonlinear relationships.", "Unfortunately, decision trees suffer from a major flaw as well. If you allow them to grow limitlessly, they can completely \u201cmemorize\u201d the training data, just from creating more and more and more branches. As a result, individual unconstrained decision trees are very prone to overfitting.\u200b", "So, how can we take advantage of the flexibility of decision trees while preventing them from overfitting the training data?", "Ensembles are machine learning methods for combining predictions from multiple separate models. There are a few different methods for ensembling, but the two most common are:", "2. Boosting: attempts to improve the predictive flexibility of simple models.", "3. LightGBM: Light GBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses a tree-based learning algorithm. Light GBM grows tree vertically while other algorithm grows trees horizontally meaning that Light GBM grows tree leaf-wise while other algorithm grows level-wise. It will choose the leaf with max delta loss to grow. When growing the same leaf, Leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than a level-wise algorithm.", "There are many other algorithms as well like Support Vector machine, Neural Networks, etc. but we won't be taking it here.", "For our case, I will be using XGBoost, Random Forest and LightGBM.", "Metric that we will be using is AUC. Initial AUC values that we got", "Search for parameters of machine learning models that result in best cross-validation performance is necessary in almost all practical cases to get a model with the best generalization estimate. A standard approach in scikit-learn is using GridSearchCV class, which takes a set of values for every parameter to try, and simply enumerates all combinations of parameter values. The complexity of such search grows exponentially with the addition of new parameters. A more scalable approach is using RandomizedSearchCV, which however does not take advantage of the structure of a search space.", "Scikit-optimize provides a drop-in replacement for GridSearchCV, which utilizes Bayesian Optimization where a predictive model referred to as \u201csurrogate\u201d is used to model the search space and utilized to arrive at good parameter values combination as soon as possible.", "Bayesian optimization, a model-based method for finding the minimum of a function, has recently been applied to machine learning hyperparameter tuning, with results suggesting this approach can achieve better performance on the test set while requiring fewer iterations than random search.", "After applying Bayesian Optimization along with Cross-Validation, AUC values:", "Although the improvement is not quite significant, the Bayesian optimizer was able to perform the tuning operation with greater speed.", "Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classification or regression models via a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor. The base-level models are trained based on a complete training set, then the meta-model is trained on the outputs of the base level model as features.", "The base-level often consists of different learning algorithms and therefore stacking ensembles are often heterogeneous. In our case, I will be combining XGBoost and LGBoost outputs and will be using Voting classifier which is a package available in Scikit-learn.", "After stacking the two outputs, AUC score improved
