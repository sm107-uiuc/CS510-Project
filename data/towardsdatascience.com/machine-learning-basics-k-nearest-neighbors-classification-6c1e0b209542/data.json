Also, I had described the implementation of the Logistic Regression model. In this article, we shall see the algorithm of the K-Nearest Neighbors or KNN Classification along with a simple example.", "The K-Nearest Neighbors or KNN Classification is a simple and easy to implement, supervised machine learning algorithm that is used mostly for classification problems.", "Let us understand this algorithm with a very simple example. Suppose there are two classes represented by Rectangles and Triangles. If we want to add a new shape (Diamond) to any one of the classes, then we can implement the KNN Classification model.", "In this model, we have to choose the number of nearest neighbors (N). Here, as we have chosen N=4, the new data point calculates the distance between each of the points and draws a circular region around its nearest 4 neighbors ( as N=4). In this problem as all the four nearest neighbors lie in the Class 1 (Rectangles), the new data point (Diamond) is also assigned as a Class 1 data point.", "In this way, we can alter the parameter, N with various values and choose the most accurate value for the model by a trial and error basis, also avoiding over-fitting and high loss.", "In this way, we can implement the KNN Classification algorithm. Let us now move to its implementation with a real world example in the next section.", "To apply the KNN Classification model in practical use, I am using the same dataset used in building the Logistic Regression model. In this, we DMV Test dataset which has three columns. The first two columns consist of the two DMV written tests (DMV_Test_1 and DMV_Test_2) which are the independent variables and the last column consists of the dependent variable, Results which denote that the driver has got the license (1) or not (0).", "In this, we have to build a KNN Classification model using this data to predict if a driver who has taken the two DMV written tests will get the license or not using those marks obtained in their written tests and classify the results.", "As always, the first step will always include importing the libraries which are the NumPy, Pandas and the Matplotlib.", "In this step, we shall get the dataset from my GitHub repository as \u201cDMVWrittenTests.csv\u201d. The variable X will store the two \u201cDMV Tests \u201dand the variable Y will store the final output as \u201cResults\u201d. The dataset.head(5)is used to visualize the first 5 rows of the data.", "In this step, we have to split the dataset into the Training set, on which the Logistic Regression model will be trained and the Test set, on which the trained model will be applied to classify the results. In this the test_size=0.25 denotes that 25% of the data will be kept as the Test set and the remaining 75% will be used for training as the Training set.", "This is an additional step that is used to normalize the data within a particular range. It also aids in speeding up the calculations. As the data is widely varying, we use this function to limit the range of the data within a small limit ( -2,2). For example, the score 62.0730638 is normalized to -0.21231162 and the score 96.51142588 is normalized to 1.55187648. In this way, the scores of X_train and X_test are normalized to a smaller range.", "In this step, the class KNeighborsClassifier is imported and is assigned to the variable \u201cclassifier\u201d. The classifier.fit() function is fitted with X_train and Y_train on which the model will be trained.", "In this step, the classifier.predict() function is used to predict the values for the Test set and the values are stored to the variable y_pred.", "This is a step that is mostly used in classification techniques. In this, we see the Accuracy of the trained model and plot the confusion matrix.", "The confusion matrix is a table that is used to show the number of correct and incorrect predictions on a classification problem when the real values of the Test Set are known. It is of the format", "The True values are the number of correct predictions made.", "From the above confusion matrix, we infer that, out of 25 test set data, 23 were correctly classified and 2 were incorrectly classified which is little better than the Logistic Regression model.", "In this step, a Pandas DataFrame is created to compare the classified values of both the original Test set (y_test) and the predicted results (y_pred).", "Though this visualization may not be of much use as it was with Regression, from this, we can see that the model is able to classify the test set values with a decent accuracy of 92% as calculated above.", "In this last step, we visualize the results of the KNN Classification model on a graph that is plotted along with the two regions.", "In this graph, the value 1 (i.e, Yes) is plotted in \u201cRed\u201d color and the value 0 (i.e, No) is plotted in \u201cGreen\u201d color. The KNN Classification model separates the two regions. It is not linear as the Logistic Regression model. Thus, any data with the two data points (DMV_Test_1 and DMV_Test_2) given, can be plotted on the graph and depending upon which region if falls in, the result (Getting the Driver\u2019s License) can be classified as Yes or No.", "As calculated above, we can see that there are two values in the test set, one on each region that are wrongly classified.", "Thus in this story, we have successfully been able to build a KNN Classification Model that is able to predict if a person is able to get the driving license from their written examinations and visualize the results.", "I am also attaching the link to my GitHub repository where you can download this Google Colab notebook and the data files for your reference.", "You can also find the explanation of the program for other Classification models below:", "We will come across the more complex models of Regression, Classification and Clustering in the upcoming articles.
