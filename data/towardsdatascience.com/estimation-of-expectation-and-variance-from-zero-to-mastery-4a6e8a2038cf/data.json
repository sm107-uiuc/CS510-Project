It is essential for data scientists to deeply understand the subject in order to tackle statistical problems and understand machine learning.", "Let do a quick test to check your understanding.", "Intuitively, the expectation is the average of a large number of independent realizations of the random variable. Let say X is our observation concerning the daily snow level, we want to estimate the average snow level. Therefore, we observed n data points on X and get an average \u2014 \u03bc.", "When we are given a distribution, we sum up the value of all events \u2014 x that takes on a probability.", "The variance measures the spread between each of our data points and our mean.", "When the sample size approaches infinitely large, it can be interpreted as 1/number of observation*sum(value of each observation -mean)\u00b2", "Remember the variance has another form, which you have probably come across. Here is the derivation", "These two formulas are essentially the same.", "Remember statistics is anything computable given the samples. If we use the same formula as above to get the sample variance with small sample size, it turns out that it will be biased. That means it does not approximate the underlying population variance well enough. So you need to multiply the biased variance by n/(n-1) to get the unbiased sample variance.", "Unbiased sample variance = 1/(number of observation-1)*sum(value of each observation -mean)\u00b2", "First, what does asymptotic mean? In statistics, it just means approaching the limit of infinity. That\u2019s the core of the Central Limit Theorem where the underlying sample distribution gets closer and closer to the population parameter as sample size increases and we say that it will eventually approach the normal distribution with bell-shaped, symmetric form, and tails on both sides.", "With that being said, asymptotic variance just means the variance is approximated based on the assumption that the number of our sample approaches infinity.", "When our population distribution is unknown, we estimate the parameters of the underlying distribution. However, there is more to getting an average because it is not always the best option if the underlying distribution is volatile.", "Here are some useful approaches to get a good estimator.", "MLE is the most important estimation method in statistics. This method aims to find the most likely parameters that describe the observed data. To do this, we simply take a partial derivative on our pdf with respect to our parameters and set that to zero. If it is too hard to do the derivative, there is a trick called the Log-likelihood, in which we simply take the derivative on the natural logarithm of the function to get the local maximum.", "Here is an example, you took observation X and found that they follow a pdf of x*\u03b8*e^(-x\u00b2/\u03b8) with a parameter \u03b8, you want to find an estimator that best describes the underlying data. So you took n samples and take the derivative on the log-likelihood. Doing the following calculation, you found out that the estimator that best describes the underlying data is sum(Xi\u00b2)/n.", "What if we need to derive the asymptotic variance of some samples? It\u2019d be nice if our sample size is large, and we can just derive them using Central Limit Theorem. However, what if our sample size is not large enough and we still want to estimate the underlying distribution of our population? What if we don\u2019t even have a well-defined PDF, so we can\u2019t even use MLE to estimate our distribution?", "It is called Delta\u2019s method, which takes advantage of the Taylor approximation to get a similar asymptotic result from the Central Limit Theorem. I am not going to talk about Taylor Series too much here but it is a method that takes differentiation to approximate the underlying function. Delta\u2019s method is using the same way. It takes derivative on our parameters and approximates another form of variance that has the normally distributed property.", "In a multivariate hypothesis testing, we want to test if both expectation and the variance equal to our proposed parameters. What if we want to find out the variance of our variance? Fisher information gives you a covariance matrix between the mean and the variance. There are two ways to calculate it.", "This method allows you to calculate any order of statistics. For example, calculating E[X] and E[X\u00b2] allows you to get both expectation and variance. Also, you can map the parameter of interests from one way to the other.", "This approach is very flexible. M-estimation can be used to estimate the mean, median, and quantiles of \ud835\udc4c for a given \ud835\udc65 even without having to assume a statistical model.", "A simple example can illustrate this law. Let say you go get groceries. How much you spend each trip depends on whether you go to Costco (P = 0.4) or Walmart(P=0.6). On average you spend about $100 on Costco and $80 on Walmart. You then want to find out the expectation of the grocery cost, which is calculated as 100 * 0.4 + 80 * 0.6 = $88.", "This topic is essential to derive the regression function. It explains why our function is Y = a+bx that it is the minimizer.", "Suppose you are predicting Y given X, you derived f(x,y)= 2X+Y that lives on a sample space of[0,1]\u00b2 What is the conditional expectation of Y given X? What about the variability around the prediction Y?", "Here we do need to understand the Bayes rule to derive the conditional pdf for X given Y. If you need a refresher, I will talk about it towards the end of this article.", "But first, you need to find the marginal PDF, which can be easily integrated from the joint pdf with respect to y.", "To find the conditional expectation and conditional variance, it takes the following derivation.", "Let say we will go out to groceries in a day with a probability of 0.2 if it is snowy, and with a probability of 0.6 if it is not snowy. The probability of snowing in a day is 0.1. Then we ask ourselves, what is the probability of a snowy day given we decided to stay home that day?", "In Bayesian statistics, we incorporate our new observation to update the prior to get the posterior distribution. Let say we pick a coin from a bag of 4 and they have a prior bias at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8. You pick a coin at random and toss it. It turns out landing on head 3 out of 6. Given this information, how would you update the bias of the bag of coins?", "The idea is that standard deviation captures the uncertainty and thus gives us information on our posterior distribution. Prior in this sense can be replaced by Jeffrey\u2019s prior, which takes the square root of the Fisher Information. if you remember right, fisher information is just another way to calculate the variance based on MLE.", "Next time when sometimes ask you to compute the expectation or variance of an underlying distribution, you want to clarify some assumptions: Is the function of the data computable? What is our sample size? Is our data assumed to be normally distributed? Do we assume any conditionality? What is it used for? Those questions will help you understand how to compute it in a proper way.", "Your home for data science.
