Follow along, and you\u2019ll learn a wide range of new skills.", "I used Kaggle\u2019s used car data set because it had a variety of categorical and numerical data and allows you to explore different ways of dealing with missing data. I divided out my project into three parts:", "The first thing that I always do when tackling a data science problem is getting an understanding of the dataset that I\u2019m working with. Using df.shape, df.columns, and df.head(), I\u2019m able to see what features I\u2019m working with and what each feature entails.", "I like to use df.nunique(axis=0), to see how many unique values there are for each variable. Using this, I can see if there\u2019s anything out of the blue and identify any potential issues. For example, if it showed that there were 60 states, that would raise a red flag because there are only 50 states.", "For numerical data, I use df.describe() to get a quick overview of my data. For example, I can immediately see problems with price, as the minimum price is $0 and the maximum price is $3,600,028,900.", "Later on, you\u2019ll see how I deal with these unrealistic outliers.", "Before continuing with the rest of my EDA, I used the code above to remove all columns where more than 40% of the values are null. This leaves me with the remaining columns below.", "Before removing the outliers for price using the interquartile (IQR) method, I decided to set the range of price to more realistic numbers, so that the standard deviations would be calculated to a more realistic number than 9,575,025.", "The IQR, also called the midspread, is a measure of statistical dispersion and can be used to get identify and remove outliers. The theory of the IQR range rule is as follows:", "You can see in the boxplot above that I significantly reduced the range of price using this method.", "Using .describe() again, we can see that the range of price seems much more realistic than it initially was, but year and odometer seem a bit off (for example the max value for year is 2021).", "By partially using my intuition and partially guessing and checking, I removed the following columns:", "After cleaning the data, I wanted to visualize my data and better understand the relationships between different variables. Using sns.heatmap(), we can see that the year is positively correlated with price and odometer is negatively correlated with price \u2014 this makes sense! Looks like we\u2019re on the right track.", "For my own interest, I plotted some categorical attributes using a bar graph (see below). There are many more visualizations that you can do to learn more about your dataset, like scatterplots and boxplots, but we\u2019ll be moving on to the next part, data modelling!", "To be able to use categorical data in my random forest model, I used pd.get_dummies(). This essentially turns every unique value of a variable into its own binary variable. For example, if one of the manufacturers is Honda, then a new dummy variable called \u2018manufacturer_honda\u2019 will be created \u2014 it will be equal to 1 if it is a Honda and 0 if not.", "Next, I scaled the data using StandardScaler. Prasoon provides a good answer here why we scale (or normalize) our data, but essentially, this is done so that the scale of our independent variables does not affect the composition of our model. For example, the max number for year is 2020 and the max number for odometer is over 200,000. If we don\u2019t scale the data, a small change in odometer will have a greater impact than the same change in year.", "I decided to use the random forest algorithm for a number of reasons:", "I spent a lot of time finding the best definition of feature importance and Christoph Molnar provided the best definition (see here). He said:", "\u2018We measure the importance of a feature by calculating the increase in the model\u2019s prediction error after permuting the feature. A feature is \u201cimportant\u201d if shuffling its values increases the model error, because in this case the model relied on the feature for the prediction. A feature is \u201cunimportant\u201d if shuffling its values leaves the model error unchanged, because in this case the model ignored the feature for the prediction.\u2019", "Given this, we can see that the three most important features in determining price are year, drive (if it\u2019s front-wheel drive), and odometer. Feature Importance is a great way to rationalize and explain your model to a non-technical person. It\u2019s also great for feature selection if you need to reduce your dimensionality.", "That\u2019s it for my project! I hope this inspires people who want to get into data science to actually get started.
