I know! A Data Science Project as Festive as the Season!", "Data Science has many applications; so many in fact, it is nigh impossible to even be considered proficient in half of them! But, that shouldn\u2019t dissuade us from trying to become as equipped for the future as possible. I challenge you to take on this project and have a once in a lifetime opportunity to serve as Santa\u2019s \u201cpocket\u201d Data Scientist!", "As a precursor to this project, note that this project is designed to be a challenge project. You are given the tools and supplies, but the method is left up to you! While the \u2018answer key\u2019 is provided on Github, you should have everything you need in the data to figure it out. This project also serves to introduce you to some tools you may not be familiar with, yet.", "Congratulations! Welcome to the North Pole Ranks! You have just been promoted to Senior Data Scientist at CANDi (Central Association of Northern Delivery Inc). Santa has just exchanged Wikr Me usernames with you to make sure he can maintain constant encrypted contact with his number one Data Scientist \u2014 on the off chance something goes awry *foreshadowing intensifies* you will be prepared.", "As 2am approaches, you settle into your desk with a hot cup of CoCo (I highly recommend you get into character by getting a cup IRL), when all of a sudden you get a Code Red Alert! Santa\u2019s sleigh has gone down somewhere in Manhattan! Luckily, your years of training at the CCA (Candy Cane Academy) have prepared you for this exact scenario. Santa needs to get to a WiFi hotspot ASAP to upload his delivery itinerary to the North Pole so the B team can pick up where he left off and finish the deliveries! Luckily, due to Santa\u2019s affinity for the Grande, Iced, Sugar-Free, Toasted White Chocolate Mocha at Starbucks, he requires all of his employees to keep a list of Starbucks locations on hand at all times.", "1. Find Santa\u2019s coordinates in the ReadMe and save them", "2. Get the list of Starbucks Addresses from the Github repo and make sure the data is clean", "3. Get your data upload/download speed GIS file (Santa needs a hub with an upload speed over 80mbps \u2014 provided by Ookla)", "4. Merge the Starbucks Address list to the SafeGraph location data using Placekey (in the Repo)", "5. Cross reference the merged file with Ookla\u2019s DL/UL file to find out which Starbucks are an option", "7. (BONUS): Cross reference the Ookla/SafeGraph POI Dataframe with your foot-traffic data to find the location with the fastest upload speed and lowest foot-traffic to keep Santa COVID-safe.", "First and foremost, I must make it abundantly clear that there are a million ways to open a present, just like there are a million ways to solve this project. If you come up with a better / more efficient way to solve these steps (especially the GeoPandas section) please leave a comment below to help out your fellow scientists!", "With that out of the way, let\u2019s dive in!", "You can view the entire GITHUB REPO with code", "Step 1: This step is pretty straight forward, access the ReadMe file and you will find Santa\u2019s coordinates", "Step 2: You will find the list of Starbucks addresses in the file labeled \u2018Santas Starbucks List\u2019. In order to check the data, simply read it into Pandas and check for Nan or Null values. If any rows have Nan or Null, you can decide to drop them or keep them after looking over them.", "Step 3: For step 3, there are quite a few ways to go about it. You can just read the data from the zipped file, you can extract the data and read in the shapefile, or you can use the parquet file and convert it as needed. I chose to use the parquet because it read in and processed much quicker than just the shapefile.", "Step 4: You will need to get an API key from Placekey.io (don\u2019t worry it is free and possibly one of the most useful tools you will invest in learning). Once you have your key, you can plug your address in to assign a Placekey to each address that will allow you to merge to other datasets without having to worry about correcting for things like Street, St, st, street, str, etc. You will want to get a Placekey for both your Starbucks data and SafeGraph POI data to then merge on Placekey. This will allow you to get the Lat, Lng of each Starbucks.", "Step 5: This step will probably be the most challenging for most users. You will need to convert your newly created POI merge file to a shapefile in order to check for Lat, Lng within the polygons of the Ookla dataset. You can find the full code HERE. Once you have the master Dataframe with Starbucks addresses and their respective Upload and Download speeds, you can choose the one with the fastest Upload speed for Santa to go to", "Step 6: Comment below with your optimal Starbucks location for Santa to go to", "Step 7 (BONUS): For this one, you will need to go into the bonus folder and find the patterns file that will give you all of NYC\u2019s foot-traffic data for the past week \u2014 courtesy of SafeGraph. Merge the data to your master DF on SafeGraph Place ID to find the lowest foot-traffic that still meets your requirement for over 80mbps download speed.", "That\u2019s it! You did it! Congratulations, you saved Christmas and possibly learned something while doing it!", "I hope this has been both a festive and educational exercise and wish you all a Merry Christmas! If you have any questions about the project feel free to connect via Twitter or Linkedin.", "A special thanks to the teams behind the products used in this project", "\u201cPlacekey is a free, universal standard identifier for any physical place, so that the data pertaining to those places can be shared across organizations easily. \u2026 It\u2019s a movement of organizations and individuals that prize access to data.
