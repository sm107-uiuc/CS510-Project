Data Analysis with music can be a very interesting mix of inspiration and concentration for a data analyst or a data scientist. And building your own music player is an amazing way to learn more about python and its potential. Maybe some modules that I will use in this article could be helpful in the deployment of your next machine learning model.", "If you follow each step in this article, the final output will be like this!", "The first step is to create a directory called environments where to store all your virtual Environments and install the python modules. In this way the program is available only within the set environment and not throughout my computer.", "So, open your terminal and create a directory as below.", "And be sure to be into the directory \u2018Environments\u2019.", "The second step is to use a module virtualenv to create isolated virtual environments.", "Now, we can create a virtual environment named myenv. If you have installed python 3 you can easily digit:", "Inside the directory myenv there is a copy of Python interpreter, the standard library and the various supporting files.", "We can activate the environment with the following command:", "Then, we need to install Pygame. Pygame is a module that is used for creating videogames. For creating our MP3 Music Player we will use the sound component.", "In this second phase, I will use Atom as python editor.", "So I will import the following modules.", "After we have imported the modules, we need to create the interface and establish the interaction with our operating system.", "So to create the interface, we will write the following code that permits to create the interface, add the title of the interface and set the dimension of the interface.", "Now, it is time to create a directory that prompts the user to choose the folder where the music files are listed. To do that the OS module will help us to create interaction between the interface and our operating system.", "Instead, the following code presents a variable called play_list which brings the interface to display the items to the user. In addition, we create a for loop in order to push the program to select each item from the song_list and insert them into the Listbox.", "For what concerns loading and playing sounds, we use pygame as below.", "In this last part, we will see how to create commands such as play, stop, pause and unpause in order to control the music player. To create these commands we will build some functions and we will use tkinter to create the button in the interface.", "Then we can create the buttons for the interface of our music player.", "Now, we create some variables that permit us to see the song that is running on the top of the application.", "With the pack method, we can arrange our button in a horizontal way. The last code music_player.mainloop() helps us to run the application.", "Finally, to run the music player, go to your terminal, activate the environment and run the program that we have saved as MyPlayer.", "Now, you have your own music player and you can listen to songs when you work with data. Sometimes working with data could be very challenging and having your own mp3 music player is very helpful.", "In addition, I think that building an mp3 music player or other applications can really help you to know new Python modules and at the same time learn more about Python programming.", "I always say that the better way to improve your programming skills is building something or automating a process. That permits you to have more confidence with programming and it is very useful for your personal portfolio. All these aspects can become your points of strength as a Data Analyst or Data Scientist.", "Thanks for reading this. There are some other ways you can keep in touch with me and follow my work:", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Analyst, Data lover & Dreamer. My aim is to make Data Science accessible to everyone.
