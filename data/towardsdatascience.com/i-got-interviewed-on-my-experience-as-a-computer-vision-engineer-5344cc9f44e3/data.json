I\u2019ve written articles on my studies, interviews, work experience and more.", "So I saw a video interview or podcast only as an oral narration of one of my articles.", "This article is an extension to the interview I had on Ken\u2019s podcast. Key topics and areas I mention in the interview are supplemented with more detailed information in this article.", "Below is a list of subject areas I touch upon, to provide an idea of the content covered in both the interview and this article", "Below are the questions asked to me by Ken in the interview, and the answers I provided, with some additional detail were necessary.", "If you have questions that you feel that I might be able to answer, then please use the comment section to address me directly and I\u2019ll do my best to respond.", "My interest in data science or instead, machine learning, is purely fueled by the growth mindset I\u2019ve developed ever since I started my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering (BSc).", "Data Science and associated fields such as Deep Learning are currently at the core of most tech products and companies. And it\u2019s only natural for a professional technologist, like myself, to gravitate towards AI-related fields.", "Apart from the serious motivations for getting involved in data science and machine learning, I have to admit that I was influenced by movies like Matrix, Avatar and Ex-Machina.", "I find exploring the reality of a future with automated tools, and general artificial intelligence fascinating. I want to be instrumental in the production of such a future.", "Transitioning from working as a professional web developer to a machine learning academic was one of the most prominent scene changes I\u2019ve experienced.", "Firstly, it was challenging to get into an academic mindset fully.", "The main difficulties were around the change of work type.", "Within a professional setting, you are usually working on practical tasks such as bug fixing, feature engineering and testing.", "Whereas, in an academic environment, you are concerned with cramming as much knowledge as possible before your next exams.", "I found it hard to get into the habit of having long four to five-hour sessions of essay writing, as opposed to hours (sometimes weekends) of bug fixing.", "However, the transition moving from a professional web development career to a machine learning related career was a bit easier.", "One main reason the transition from a web developer to an ML Engineer is due to the fact that I ensured that the typical fast-paced startup working environment that I was accustomed to was maintained when seeking machine learning roles.", "As a Computer Vision/Machine Learning Engineer, my role is very technical, and I tend to code 70\u201380% of the time.", "The rest of my role is spent on research and development, mainly exploring the latest state of the art techniques to common computer vision tasks and reading research paper.", "Reading research papers is one of the significant differences between working as a full-stack web developer and a machine learning engineer.", "Apart from that, the grind is mostly the same.", "The choice was pretty simple and straight forward.", "I had an interest in AI, more explicitly gaining in-depth knowledge within AI topics and obtaining a recognised qualification within relevant areas of AI.", "At first, I started my learning journey by taking the iconic Andrew Ng Coursera course on Machine Learning.", "But, my role as a web developer became very demanding, therefore spending time studying ML after work hours became almost impossible.", "I decided to go back to grad school for a year to get the focus and forced discipline I required to ensure the majority of my efforts were dedicated to amassing as much knowledge of key subject areas within machine learning and more broadly, AI.", "I don\u2019t think going to grad school was needed for me to transition into the field.", "As a web developer, you are somewhat aware of general advancement within the technological landscape, and AI/ML was slowly making its way into the products I worked on.", "Eventually, I would have explored areas such as entity extraction and sentiment analysis with natural language processing, since one of my side projects leveraged Google NLP APIs for text analysis.", "Speaking from an employability standpoint, I have to admit that going to grad school and obtaining an advanced degree in ML allowed me to apply to more roles than if I didn\u2019t have an ML related degree.", "Most data science roles I applied for required individuals with an MSc in machine learning or other related topics.", "I do think this requirement is specific for the roles I was applying for (roles at startups). Some ML entry-level positions accept candidates that displayed a desire to learn and an impressive portfolio.", "Short answer, I came to the face to face interview with precisely the type of machine learning solutions the employer needed. I essentially showed them I could solve their problems.", "The more extended version of how I landed my first role out of grad school involves a series of phone interviews and face to face interviews.", "My first interaction with my current employer was a phone discussion with the CTO.", "This initial phone discussion wasn\u2019t too technical, and the aim was to gauge my soft skills as opposed to hardcore programming or ML skills.", "The conversation flowed naturally as both myself and the CTO found common ground in the libraries, and technologies we utilised to build applications. It turns out the CTO had some web development background.", "This conversation probably lasted around 30 minutes.", "The next conversation I had was with a machine learning expert with a background in natural language processing. This conversation was technical, and we touched on my academic experience.", "We also had conversations on how I would tackle a variety of machine learning/data science tasks such as object detection, data mining and cleaning etc.", "There were some queries into the ML libraries I had used to train and implement ML models, which at the time was PyTorch.", "As stated, the conversation was very technical; we even touched on ML model deployment and common ML pitfalls such as unbalanced dataset, overfitting etc.", "This technical phone conversation lasted well over an hour. Still, just like the conversation with the CTO, it felt natural, and the whole discussion sounded like two team member talking about best practices and transparent machine learning processes.", "The last stage of the interview process was a face to face discussion with the CEO and CTO.", "I was very interested in the position for several reasons, it had the level of autonomy I desired, and it was in a Startup.", "Before my final interview, I examined the problems that the team in the company needed to solve.", "With less than 48 hours to the final face to face interview, I put together a mobile application that essentially leveraged deep learning technologies to solve one of the company\u2019s pain points.", "The face to face interview went smoothly, and for my final trick, I presented the application I had spent a couple of days building, and they were beyond impressed.", "One thing I should note is that I built an android mobile application, whereas the company only developed mobile games on iOS devices.", "They were mainly impressed by the extra mile I was willing to go and also the speed of taking an idea or app concept to a usable application.", "Computer vision is concerned with the process by which we equip systems with the ability to derive scenic understanding from visual input data.", "Essentially we are equipping systems with the ability to see as humans do.", "For individuals who are new to the field, it\u2019s probably necessary to distinguish the difference between computer vision and deep learning.", "Without getting too technical, computer vision is concerned with teaching systems how to see, and deep learning is one of the successful and dominant approaches to how we achieve the ability to derive scenic understanding from visual data.", "I explain more about computer vision and deep learning in the articles below.", "Two things drew me to computer vision and deep learning, it\u2019s very relevant, and it was the only module I confidently understood in my studies.", "Computer vision is everywhere in the world today; there isn't a week that goes by that you don\u2019t read research developments on self-driving cars or facial recognition software.", "And deep learning approaches to computer vision has made the transferability of research knowledge to actual usable product occur at a fast rate.", "Within my role, I\u2019m solving the integration and utilisation of deep learning models that solve tasks such as pose estimation, semantic segmentation and face detection, within camera-enabled devices.", "I\u2019m currently utilising tools such as TensorFlow lite, Coreml and other open-source packages to extract scenic understanding form deep learning model and convert the model\u2019s outputs into useful representative data that can be leveraged by game developers to build camera games and interactive effects.", "For more information on my day to day responsibilities, the article below goes into details.", "A relevant project I\u2019m currently undertaking is the development of smartwatch applications that can track the proximity between the hand and the face.", "The primary purpose of this project is to increase smartwatch wearers cautiousness level of hand to face contact when in public areas, all to limit covid-19 transmission through a facial opening such as the nose, mouth or eyes.", "I\u2019ve developed a Wear OS version of the app and currently in the process of developing a Fitbit version.", "More information on the project is available in the link below:", "There are tons of benefits to be realised for both yourself and the broader data science community through sharing content.", "Self-promotion, exposure, job opportunities, reinforcement of learning, personal brand building, increased network, and more, are just a few of the benefits I have realised from almost a year of creating and sharing AI/ML content on Medium.", "I started taking writing on Medium seriously in late 2019.", "After completing my MSc, I needed to gather more practical skills to improve my level of employability.", "In academic institutions, you study and learn in preparation for an exam at the end of the year.", "On the other hand, outside of academic institutions, there is no examination or anyone to monitor and scrutinise your learning.", "I realised that a method of ensuring I understood the theoretical and practical machine learning ideas and concepts was to share the information I have learnt with the broader machine learning community.", "Medium was the go-to platform, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.", "Through sharing content on Medium I\u2019ve retained knowledge, I would have initially lost; subsequently, I\u2019ve built some form of personal brand and widen my network.", "Speaking to Ken was fun, and I\u2019ll probably do some more interviews in 2021.", "I\u2019m no AI expert \u2014 I still have a lot to learn, I also haven\u2019t solved AI (yet \ud83d\ude09).", "I\u2019m simply navigating through the fields and domains of Artificial Intelligence, picking up practical knowledge and experiences one epoch at a time.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
