A rich and diverse set of ethnicities, languages and cultures, side by side with a history permeated by armed conflict and political tension. A growing economy boosted by commodities such as coffee and cocoa, side by side with appalling levels of child labor and frustrating educational achievement.", "The purpose of that first trip had been to kick-off a discussion of how a successful experience spearheaded by MGov in Brazil \u2014 Eduq+, a nudgebot that sends parents text messages meant to encourage them to engage in their children\u2019s school life \u2013, could be adapted to benefit Ivorian school children. With astounding impacts on Brazilian students\u2019 attendance, learning and grade progression (yielding Government a return on investment of over 1,000%), could similar impacts be replicated in the much more challenging setting of Sub-Saharan Africa?", "There were several reasons to believe the answer might be no. First, because about 50% of Ivorian parents are estimated to be illiterate. What is more, among those who can read, at least half of them report to be unable to read in formal French. Would text messages work in that context? Second, because teacher absenteeism is thought to be so high in Ivory Coast \u2014 it has been found to be circa 60% in similar settings \u2014 that perhaps engaging parents would have no effect in learning; after all, what good is it to be in attendance if students are so seldom learning anything in school?", "In the year that ensued, a heavy machinery was set in motion to make sure transferability could be successfully achieved. Extensive consultations with all stakeholders of the local educational system were undertaken, local partnerships were established, and unsuccessful experiences in neighboring countries were reviewed to inform our work.", "Three key changes were brought about to maximize the odds that the positive impacts found in Brazil would transfer to Ivory Coast. First, Eduq+ would not only reach parents by text, but also by audio messages. Second, and most importantly, audio messages would be delivered in 7 different languages \u2014 simplified French and six local dialects \u2013, according to each participant\u2019s choice. Third, teachers would also be targeted by Eduq+, with the goal of encouraging them to miss fewer classes, and to be more effective in their time use inside the classroom.", "To learn about which constraints are really key to transferability, each innovation has been randomly assigned (in an ongoing study joint with Sharon Wolf, University of Pennsylvania). In some schools, neither parents nor teachers would receive messages; in other schools, either only teachers or only parents would receive messages; in the remainder, both parents and teachers would be targeted. Whenever parents were assigned to receive messages, in half of those schools parents were assigned to text messages in simplified French (there is no written version of the dialects), while in the other half parents were assigned to audio messages in their language of choice.", "The goal was set to track impacts of each version of Eduq+ on students\u2019 attendance, learning, grade progression, and dropout rates.", "This is when the story I want to share begins.", "A very important problem was brought to our attention early on in the process: the Ministry of Education had no systematic data on students\u2019 achievement, grade repetition rates, dropout rates, or even attendance.", "Ivory Coast is not alone in that respect: I would dare to say no country in Sub-Saharan Africa tracks such data systematically. Even in further-ahead developing countries like Brazil, it has been only 10 years since we started tracking learning yearly for every school. Even then, attendance data is typically unavailable and requires partnerships with the local governments.", "What happens when a Ministry of Education has no data? And what have we done to tackle this issue?", "When the State of Goi\u00e1s rose to the top of the ranking of high-school achievement, the Education Secretariat attributed it chiefly to the State\u2019s policy of reacting fast when students missed multiple school days in a row. According to the State, that was perceived to be the best predictor of dropout, which fell by at least half once the policy was introduced.", "The State had to launch a huge task force to ensure attendance data was made available timely . While teachers take attendance daily in writing, they typically only enter such data in an online system at the end of the school year \u2014 when it is too late to take action with respect to early absenteeism and dropouts.", "As exciting as it sounds, Goi\u00e1s\u2019s policy was not really scalable: there are physical limits to the number of call center positions that can be set up within the Education Secretariat, and such service is expensive to outsource. As a result, one of the key policies that presumably made Goi\u00e1s rise through the ranks is no longer in place, and has not been systematically adopted by other States.", "In the context of an experiment aimed at creating a scalable version of this policy \u2014 using Eduq+ to inform parents timely about their children\u2019s attendance, a joint project with Eric Bettinger (Stanford University), Nina Cunha (FH360), and Ricardo Madeira (University of S\u00e3o Paulo) \u2014 we found that even S\u00e3o Paulo, the wealthiest Brazilian State, has no real-time information system to track students\u2019 attendance.", "That, of course, was costing the school system dearly: our research has shown that communication with parents was able to decrease absences by 15% and decrease grade repetition by 1/3 among 9th graders, by bringing children\u2019s school life to parents\u2019 top of mind.", "In the context of that study, we had to create a simple system which allowed teachers to report children\u2019s weekly attendance/behavior online, in a coarse way intended to be as easy and non time-consuming for teachers as possible while still conveying some useful information to caregivers. 2/3 of teachers filled in information about their students in a typical week, even on the absence of monetary incentives!", "While Eduq+ still has not even scratched the surface of its market potential \u2014 Brazil has about 40 million school children \u2014 it has been growing in scale every year, currently reaching about 200,000 active users in the country.", "Taking advantage of that successful experience, the plan in Ivory Coast was to deliver one connected tablet per participating school such that, in each school, an administrative staff member could fill in information about teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 attendance weekly on MGov\u2019s platform.", "But that was when we learned that \u2014 surprise! \u2014 the Ministry did not even know where the schools were\u2026", "So we started with the basics. Now we can put schools on a map and show weekly teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 attendance at the school level, for the 100 schools we are working with in this first year of our partnership with TRECC.", "As simple as it may seem, this is nothing short of revolutionary. It gives the school system, for the first time, the minimum tools it would need to plan, monitor and take actions based on evidence.", "This is, of course, just the first step. We will eventually be able to show at high frequency our best predictions for whether students\u2019 literacy and numeracy are improving at different schools.", "How could that even be possible, if the Ministry has no standardized tests in place at an yearly basis, what to say in higher frequency?", "The answer lies in drawing from the insights of epidemiology and public health. When we want to predict whether a disease is spreading, we don\u2019t rely exclusively on diagnostic counts, which can be very slow to obtain and subject to under-reporting in poor regions with scattered communities, miles away from the nearest clinic. Instead, we rely on higher-frequency surveys which follow a protocol for identifying diseases. Has the child been feeling unwell? Has she experienced fever? Fast breathing? If the answers are systematically yes, then we can predict with some confidence an incidence of pneumonia.", "Having said that, surveying also is subject to challenges, like zero-inflation: the tendency of most participants not to answer (or under-report). What is interesting is that, taking advantage of nice statistical properties, while the prediction model tends to be quite innacurate for the individual, it gets more and more accurate for more aggregate units \u2014 like villages.", "As a result, nowadays there are good models to predict epidemics spreading early on, while there is still time to act before it is too late. Brazilian startup Epitrack does exactly that, in Brazil, the United States, and elsewhere.", "Could we do the same for Education? The parallel suggests in principle we could, especially if we were trying to get accurate predictions from schools based on individual reports.", "The challenge is that, different from the quest of predicting diseases, there is no obvious protocol for predicting learning. In fact, it is a problem that has not yet been solved by scientific researchers.", "At this very moment, MGov is testing 10 different protocols in the context of Brazil, to assess what is the best \u201cthermometer\u201d to assess in high frequency \u2014 as often as bi-weekly \u2014 which schools are improving and which are not.", "Here is a word of caution. A detailed look at our study about communicating with parents suggests information was not really necessary to improve learning. Drawing parents\u2019 attention \u2014 in other words, nudging them to engage in their children\u2019s school life \u2014 was enough to induce the large achievement gains we have documented in that study.", "That is not to say, however, that information was irrelevant to other stakeholders. There is still huge value for the Education system in knowing where to act, especially when it comes to time-sensitive issues such as students\u2019 systematic absences in the first part of the year, and the strikingly high teacher absenteeism. Knowledge is always power \u2014 when it is used wisely.", "We must, however, also confront the issue that, sometimes, having access to the right data is not enough. Brazil is a leading example. It has amazing data on student-level performance. But it still barely uses them\u2026", "The graph above showcases how schools in areas with the same socio-economic level display aberrant discrepancies in performance. IDEB is computed as the average of Math and Language assessments, penalized by grade repetition in the school (hence, a score between 0 and 10). We can see that some schools embedded in similar conditions have a 7-point difference in students\u2019 achievement.", "The only reason such a difference may exist and persist is because Government is not systematically taking advantage of such data to pair schools to remedy their inequalities or to induce them to learn from each other.", "AI could help Government make the best use of data without the need to wait for costly and lengthy political decisions.", "For one, connecting schools that are relevant pairs (but that differ systematically in recent performance), say by automatically sharing templates for filling in funding requests from support programs, such as PDE Escola, in Brazil. This program allows schools below the national IDEB average to request courses or physical investments from the federal government, based on a community-driven self-assessment. Why doesn\u2019t the Ministry of Education automatically share with low-performing schools what other similar schools (that have improved, instead) have requested in the past? This could be easily rolled-out through AI \u2014 it is a low-hanging fruit.", "Another example is teacher training. Teacher value-added in Brazil is low: students learn little, and 90% finish high school without the minimal Math skills required for that level of instruction. To make it even more challenging, the new common core curricular standards require changes in the way teachers do their job. How is the country to ensure teachers receive on-the-job training to do that?", "One way to do it is by sending teachers text messages to systematically support their understanding of the new standards, and share resources to help them prepare new lesson plans. Not every teacher needs the same support, though. AI could allow customizing training programs to each teacher\u2019s needs, based on predictions of what features of those programs maximize learning for each classroom, drawing on the very same \u201cthermometer\u201d I have described before.", "Of course, technology always entails promises and perils: (1) ethical dimensions should be carefully considered, (2) algorithms must be cautiously combined with experimentation to ensure they do not replicate inequality, and (3) outcome data (or at least proxies for those) must be generated in high enough frequency to allow for timely fine-tuning.", "MGov is working hard to address those issues.", "Every day that goes by in which we fail to provide decision-makers with better data on which to base their inputs, or in which we fail to leverage technology to help Government directly take advantage of better data instead of circling around in complex and lengthy political decision-making, we fail a whole generation of students who want to learn but do not get the tools and resources they need.", "We came to accept this as business as usual. This needs to change. The power of data must be unleashed, or we will keep failing those children\u2019s futures.", "One of the top under-35 Brazilian innovators, according to MIT Technology Review, and social innovation specialist at the WEF Expert Network."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
