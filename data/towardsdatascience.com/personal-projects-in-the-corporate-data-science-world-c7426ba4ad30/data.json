I will discuss the content that the projects should cover as well as some important red lines that you obviously should not cross with the choice of your projects.", "I think most of you will agree if I say: it is important for data scientists to have ongoing projects besides a full-time job. The reason why I like to emphasize the necessity is fairly simple: we will only grow in life if we do things that we have not done before. This also holds for data science.", "If you are working in corporate data science, you are probably spending a lot of time on particular products. In some companies these product life cycles are nearly infinitely long. The consequence is that if you join large corporates, they will already have products in place. You are usually working in a developer team and will be adding particular features to these products. And if you transfer from one product development team to the next, you usually stay in your comfort zone, which means that if you were the NLP guy before, it is really likely that the next product feature you are supposed to develop will also demand NLP features. Further, you usually will have existing methods to solve specific problems such that a method is implemented for one feature and recycled for another. The focus lies more on trimming the existing method to a new set of questions and less on developing a new method from scratch. This is simply how the corporate world is working because this ensures fast results, which reduces internal development cost.", "To prevent any misunderstandings: I really love to do so! One of the best things I discovered after transitioning from academia to the corporate industry is that the development time for specific features is extremely short and you are really forced to deliver features in a short amount of time. I only profited from that choice I made after finishing university, since I discovered many data science tasks, which I never would have related to a data scientist. I also would go so far and say that the industry is the best way to become a full-stack data scientist.", "But the initially described circumstances keep in place. While you will grow as a data scientist in terms of getting faster by rounding developing cycles over and over again, you may have problems to discover new fields of data science methods. Therefore, it is important to have an open eye on new methods coming up by personal projects. The will to never stop learning will impress coworkers and managers, since you are able to develop new skills that you can re-use in your full-time job. It will open up new possibilities in your data science career because you gain skills by accomplishing project after project.", "The consequent question that arises now is: \u201cOkay, now I know that I should be working on private projects apart from my full-time job. But which projects should I choose?\u201d The short answer is: choose whatever interests you, which you cannot tackle during your 9\u20135 daily job.", "The more extensive answer is: it depends. First of all, you should not spend your free time on topics that you do not enjoy. Life is too short to do so. In my opinion, the best project is the one with the highest long-term return and the one that you enjoy most.", "So, imagine you are a Data Scientist and the position at your company requires you to develop machine learning models. For that, you get a specific research question and a well-organized data set by your data engineer. This means that you never really tackled the process from using raw data bases and applying feature engineering techniques in order to make the data usable for machine learning procedures. Therefore, an appropriate personal project could be for example to use web scraping techniques to store the resulting data in a database of your choice. Afterwards, you could develop a SQL pipeline in order to transform the tracked web data into data sets that are more comprehensive. Then, you could use these data sets as a basis for feature engineering and feed the extracted features into a machine learning model of your choice.", "After completing the described project you will definitely know more about the data engineering process, which is from my point of view also a very important stage in the data science project roadmap. You can use the gathered knowledge also at your company when you discuss the data engineering process for the next tasks. This yields a high return for the whole company, since the better coordination between data engineering and machine learning development will make the implementation more efficient.", "In other words, you should always aim to tackle all possible tasks of a full-stack data scientist, for which you may not have enough time in your company at the moment but you really wish to understand.", "In the last section, I described which projects you should choose. However there are some red lines in the sense of projects you should definitely not choose. In general, I think that you should not be working on side projects, which you are already working on during your job. Following are two reasons, why I think so:", "First of all, a corporate company is a great opportunity to grow as a data scientist. If you really love exactly what you are doing during your job, you maybe should simply extend your working hours. This will probably make a better impression in comparison to walking out of the office at exactly 5pm, go home and spend the evening with the same things you could have done equally if you stayed an hour longer at the office.", "This is not a call that you should work longer and longer for your company, this is simply the suggestion to choose your side projects wisely. Consider the example that your position requires you to develop and evaluate different neural network parameterizations and you really enjoy to work on it. In my opinion the better choice to work on these topics is to find an even better neural network for the use case at your company instead of developing and solving a different use case with the same set of methods by yourself.", "Working on the same topics in private as you are working on at your company can be very problematic, which brings me to my second point: Do not use internal company\u2019s information for your private projects! Often you are using for private projects open source version management tools as git and even if you do not, I am pretty sure that you are probably not allowed to apply internal developed models of your company in a private way, or even worse use company internal data for your private projects.", "However, I think I made my point clear: side projects will improve your data science skills, since you use your free time enhancing your weaknesses. Choose your side projects wisely and enjoy them.", "We are all working very hard and feel like we do not have enough time for activities, which we enjoy or for people that we love. And data science is not everything. So commit to personal data science projects outside your job only if you truly want to accomplish them. If you do not feel like doing so that is totally fine. I am sure your corporate job will provide you the opportunity to grow anyway. But if you want to have a slight boost and have a great project idea, simply go for it!", "Your home for data science.
