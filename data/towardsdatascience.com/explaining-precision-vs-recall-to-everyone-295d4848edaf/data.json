But first, in order to understand these metrics, you will need to know what False Positives and False Negatives are and the difference between the two. Please see the article below for an explanation of the differences between the two:", "In order to calculate the different evaluation metrics, you will need to know the amount of False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), True Positives (TP), and True Negatives (TN). It would also be helpful to know the difference between them.", "Let\u2019s start with simplest of the four evaluation metrics \u2014 Accuracy. Accuracy is simply the measure of how many observations our model correctly predicted over the total number of observations:", "For example, let\u2019s say we have a machine that classifies if a fruit is an apple or not. In a sample of hundreds of apples and oranges, the accuracy of the machine will be how many apples it classified correctly as apples and how many oranges it classified as not apples divided by the total number of apples and oranges. It is a simple and effective measurement as long as the number of apples and oranges are the same. Otherwise, we may have to use a different evaluation metric.", "Precision is the measure of how many observations our model correctly predicted over the amount of correct and incorrect predictions. Observations here mean the thing we are trying to predict.", "Using our apple and oranges example, precision would measure the number of correctly classified apples divided by the apples correctly labeled as apples and the oranges incorrectly labeled as apples. In other words, precision measures how many of our classified apples were actually oranges.", "Recall is the measure of how many observations our model correctly predicted over the total amount of observations. Here observations also mean the thing we are trying to predict.", "In our apples and oranges example, recall measures the amount apples labeled correctly divided by the total amount of apples present. In other words, recall measures how many apples we might have missed in the entire sample of fruit.", "If we put our focus into one score, we might end up neglecting the other. In order to combat this we can use the F1 Score, which strikes a balance between the Precision and Recall scores. To calculate the F1 Score, you need to know the Precision and Recall scores and input them into the following formula:", "Using our apples and oranges example, F1 score will calculate a balance between Precision and Recall. It will measure the amount of misclassified oranges as apples (False Positives) and the amount of apples not correctly classified as apples (False Negatives).", "When constructing and evaluating a machine learning model, you must be able to determine the most effective evaluation metric to use. The most appropriate metric is entirely dependent on the problem.", "Most of the time you will be dealing with imbalanced datasets. Using our apples and oranges example, in the real world, you will most likely have an imbalanced sample of maybe 1-to-3 apples-to-oranges. In this case, it would not be appropriate to use Accuracy as an evaluation metric because Accuracy would misrepresent the effectiveness of our model.", "If the dataset were truly balanced, then Accuracy would probably be the most appropriate metric to use. However, most of the time this will not be the case.", "Since you will most likely be dealing with imbalanced data, Precision and Recall (also F1 Score) will be your go-to evaluation metrics. Which one to use will again be entirely dependent on the goal of your model.", "Let\u2019s say we were trying to detect if an apple was poison or not. In this case, we would want to reduce the amount of False Negatives because we hope to not miss any poison apples in the batch. Recall would be the best evaluation metric to use here because it measures how many poison apples we might have missed. We are not too concerned with mislabeling an apple as poisonous because we would rather be safe than sorry.", "Moving away from the apples example, and say we develop a machine learning model that determines if a stock will be a good investment or not. If we were to pour our entire net worth into this one stock, we would better hope that our model is right. Precision would be the best metric to use here because it determines the correctness of our model. We can afford to miss a few profitable stock investments here and there (so recall score is not as important), as long as our money is going to an appreciating stock correctly predicted by our model.", "If you want to see real life machine learning model that predicts a stocks investment future that uses select evaluation metrics, then check out the following article:", "Sometimes it would be best to maximize both Precision and Recall scores for a model. When would we want to maximize both scores? If we want our model to be correct/right and not miss any correct predictions. Based on this fact, you may conclude that F1 Score is the score to use above all else. While F1 Score does strike a balance between Precision and Recall, it does not prioritize one over the other. Sometimes it might be best to prioritize one over the other depending on the problem we are facing.", "As you have learned throughout this article, there are several different evaluation metrics to use for your machine learning model. Each metric has their own specific advantages and disadvantages. It is up to you to determine which one to use to evaluate your model.
