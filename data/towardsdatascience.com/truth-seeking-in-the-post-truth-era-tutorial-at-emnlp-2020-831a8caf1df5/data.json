Here are the primary points I learned that I think you\u2019ll also find quite interesting.", "Fake News is a Problem. In modern times, fake news has become a huge issue for many reasons. Not only has the public lost confidence in traditional media, but it also has low levels of critical thinking and news literacy which, combined with a shift in business models by malicious actors who seek financial or political gains, has resulted in fake news becoming a huge problem. In fact, studies have shown that fake news spreads six times faster than real news and can spread in less than ten minutes. Thus, it's important to be able to quickly and accurately identify fake news.", "Information Incorrectness. When classifying the information within these fake news articles, there are three primary types with a range of factualness and malintent.", "AI for Assistance in Fact-Checking. Now that we have a basic understanding of the problem of fake news, how can we tackle it? Of course, there is always the path of manual fact-checking, such as when news groups fact-check presidential candidates during a debate. And completely opposite of this is the path of automatic fact-checking, which would rely on artificial intelligence to automatically verify claims and analyze news articles. While automatic fact-checking is considered by many to be the long-term goal, the problem is that people currently don\u2019t trust machines to fact-check accurately and prefer humans to be the ones doing the fact-checking. Thus, the middle-ground is to use technology to assist human fact-checkers. There are two primary ways of doing this:", "(1) Does the fact contain a verifiable factual claim? If it\u2019s impossible to verify the fact, then there\u2019s no point in attempting to fact-check it.", "(2) Is the fact likely to be false? If there\u2019s only a tiny probability that the claim is false, then time could be better spent fact-checking claims that are more likely to be false.", "(3) Is the fact of interest to the general public? Obviously we shouldn\u2019t be spending time checking trivial claims like a Tweet saying \u201ctoday I called my mom.\u201d", "(4) Does the fact have the potential to be harmful to someone? If the claim is not dangerous, then time could be better spent on checking more-harmful claims.", "Automated Fact-Checking. If, eventually, we decide that an automatic fact-checking AI is acceptable, how can we implement it? Well, there are two ways of automatic fact-checking:", "Concluding Thoughts. Fake news is a challenging problem in our time. It is an extremely important issue, yet it arguably is not getting enough attention by the public. It is, however, exciting to see how the field of AI in general and NLP, in particular, is attempting to help tackle the problem. Hopefully, with enough time and research, we can come up with a way to quickly and accurately identify fake news so that we don\u2019t continue to suffer the growing consequences of being misinformed.", "Your home for data science.
