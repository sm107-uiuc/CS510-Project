I have nothing against Kaggle, but when people say Kaggle, I have done this competition, I kind of roll my eyes, because they\u2019re focusing on sort of 10% of the problem. (\u2026) A lot of these projects go to die, because 90% of the other things weren\u2019t done correctly, including stakeholder alignment.\u201d", "By reading this, you might think that Ian Scott, Chief Science Officer at Omnia AI, from Deloitte Canada, might think that doing Kaggle competitions is of useless. Think again. This is only an excerpt from an interview taken to Ian by Jeremie Harris, for the TDS podcast (minute 14), and it doesn\u2019t illustrate the bigger picture. I will come back to it again further in the article, when discussing about the importance of context and what can happen when getting information out of its context.", "Through this article I try to find an answer to the question \u201c How important domain knowledge really is for data scientist?\u201d, which came to my mind while listening to this interview. And I do so by looking both at the insights provided especially through their discussion and jobs postings for Data Scientists available in the US, in fields such as Health Care, Financial Services, Retail, Real Estate, Government Administration, Market Research, Information Technology etc.", "In the interview, Ian talks about things that are in the data that can be analyzed and provide valuable information, and things that are not captured in the data which, as a result, will not be taken into consideration by the models built. How can data scientists deal with these cases? How can features be designed so that all relevant information and contextual data be included in the model?", "Here is where domain knowledge comes in. And Ian mentions an approach they sometimes use for getting a better understanding of the problem being solved and of the desired outputs: and that is putting both the members of his team and the clients in the same room for several hours so that they can work together on understanding the real problem, understanding the shared output, and for getting the context collectively built.", "The key word here is context. Ian: \u201cData trumps context, trumps algorithm. Algorithm is the third thing I think about, not the first thing. What data do you have, give me the context of the data, the things that are in the data, that are about the data that I don\u2019t see in the data.\u201d (minute 7)", "One way to interpret this could be:", "I remember how, in my first evaluation job, I had to learn fast a lot of domain specific knowledge. Even though I was part of a team with specialists from that field, I needed to know what they were talking about and be able to build an evaluation model that was appropriate to that specific context. So, beyond working on the task, I tried as much as possible to document myself on the respective topic.", "Later on, in another case, when I had to add input for an evaluation of a program in healthcare, I felt that evaluators who had previous experience in that field were ahead of me. Yes, I knew methods of evaluation, but I had no knowledge about the history of the program and its specificity. However, the structure and the dynamic of the team was different, and the input expected from me was rather technical than specific to the subject matter. Within the team, we complemented each other and managed to provide the needed outputs.", "Now, let\u2019s look at some Data Science jobs postings from different fields, as they appear on LinkedIn (on August, the 16th and 17th).", "And we will start with Hospital and Health Care, this being the field where I would most expect for domain knowledge to be required.", "For this topic, I looked at job postings from all levels of experience: internships, entry-level jobs, Associate/ Mid-Senior level and Executive and Director levels.", "At the highest Seniority levels (Executive and Director), there were only five all-time published job postings, from which three included previous experience and knowledge in Healthcare as a must, while one mentioned it as being an advantage for potential job candidates, and another didn\u2019t mention it at all.", "For the Associate/ Mid-Senior levels I looked at the postings from the last 24 hours, so as to get a feel on how much domain knowledge is required. From the 10 relevant job announcements, 6 asked explicitly for previous experience in the Health Care industry, while 2 considered it to be preferable or a plus, and the other two, which were in fact from Health, Wellness and Fitness, did not ask at all for domain related knowledge.", "When it comes to those asking for previous experience, the requirements sound as following: \u201cFamiliarity with a health care environment and EHR data\u201d; \u201cFamiliarity with genomics and medical imaging data\u201d; \u201cA year or more in healthcare, preferably at a healthcare provider or health system\u201d; \u201c2+ years experience working with healthcare data (EHR/EMR healthcare information systems preferred)\u201d, etc.", "Regarding entry-level jobs, the situation is similar to that of senior level jobs. There are postings that ask for previous experience and some that don\u2019t. Example: \u201cMust be knowledgeable of healthcare terminology, concepts and value chain, with intermediate knowledge of one or more key healthcare domains, e.g. client, customer, product, provider, and/or claim.\u201d", "When it comes to internships, things change, as there are no references to previous experience or educational background in the healthcare field. Besides the usual technical skills, some ask for a genuine interest in the industry or in their mission.", "In this case, even though I have applied a filter for jobs in Financial Services, LinkedIn showed results from other sectors too, such as Retail, Staffing and Recruiting, or Information Technology. However, from the postings I have managed to look at, I have noticed that some jobs indeed require things such as: product design, experience in providing business insights, Passion for building data products, particularly in the real estate/financial space; Proven ability to apply findings to business problems to lift revenue and profits; be a Business Acumen \u2014 Leverages business judgment to shape strategy, based on understanding of operational, financial, and organizational requirements and capabilities, etc. In this case, as same as in Retail and Real Estate, some jobs postings ask for previous experience within a business setting, or mention it as being preferable, but there are also jobs that only ask for the necessary technical requirements.", "Here, there are jobs postings of both types: that don\u2019t require subject matter expertise, and some that ask for it. In addition, they might require to be an U.S. citizen and to pass a background check, which is to be expected, as the employers are governmental agencies.", "Sectors that are less likely to ask for specific domain knowledge, as they appear on LinkedIn: Staffing and Recruiting, Information Technology, Internet, Market Research, Marketing & Advertising, Media Production.", "Domain knowledge definitely helps in better making sense of the data and of the problem\u2019s context. In some cases, Data Scientists might need to also have strong subject matter expertise additional to the technical skills, but in other cases, depending also on the industry or on the way in which the organization for which he/ she works is structured, that might not be the same. In cases such as that from OMNIA AI (Deloitte Canada], even though Data Scientists are required to have certain soft skills in addition to technical ones, they work within larger teams, and are able to draw upon the expertise of their team members or even clients. In some cases, as same as in evaluation, teams can be of great use, and what Data Scientists don\u2019t know can be covered with the help of subject matter experts.", "When it comes to Data Science jobs postings some of them do ask for previous experience working in a specific field, but not all of them. There are sectors which require subject matter expertise more strongly (such as Health Care], and some who mostly require the technical skills and expertise (such as Market Research, Marketing & Advertising etc.]. Others, who are somehow in the middle, ask for previous experience in a business setting, or consider it to be preferable.", "Senior level jobs are more likely to ask for domain specific knowledge compared to internships and entry-level jobs, which is to be expected. However, this does not happen in all cases. And this might also be because the companies in certain sectors only now start adding Data Scientists to their teams.", "When preparing to become a Data Scientist also try to identify the field in which you wish to work in, if you haven\u2019t done so already, and look what employers look for in job candidates. Make a list of those requirements, see how you fit them and make a plan on honing the necessary skills. Additionally, try to do projects in the field you targeted and provide solutions that are already relevant to certain potential employers.", "Your home for data science.
