If the between variance is significantly larger than the within variance, the group means are declared to be different. Otherwise, we cannot conclude one way or the other.

This can be done, for instance, with the aggregate() function:", "or with the summarise() and group_by() functions from the {dplyr} package:", "Mean is also the lowest for Adelie and highest for Gentoo. Boxplots and descriptive statistics are, however, not enough to conclude that flippers are significantly different in the 3 populations of penguins.", "As you guessed by now, only the ANOVA can help us to make inference about the population given the sample at hand, and help us to answer the initial research question \u201cAre flippers length different for the 3 species of penguins?\u201d.", "ANOVA in R can be done in several ways, of which two are presented below:", "As you can see from the two outputs above, the test statistic (F = in the first method and F value in the second one) and the p-value (p-value in the first method and Pr(>F) in the second one) are exactly the same for both methods, which means that in case of equal variances, results and conclusions will be unchanged.", "The advantage of the first method is that it is easy to switch from the ANOVA (used when variances are equal) to the Welch test (used when variances are unequal). This can be done by replacing var.equal = TRUE by var.equal = FALSE, as presented below:", "The advantage of the second method, however, is that:", "Given that the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, so we reject the hypothesis that all means are equal.

See more tips and tricks in R if you find this one useful.", "If the null hypothesis is not rejected (p-value \u2265 0.05), it means that we do not reject the hypothesis that all groups are equal. The ANOVA more or less stops here. Other types of analyses can be performed of course, but \u2014 given the data at hand \u2014 we could not prove that at least one group was different so we usually do not go further with the ANOVA.", "On the contrary, if the null hypothesis is rejected (as it is our case since the p-value < 0.05), we proved that at least one group is different. We can decide to stop here if we are only interested to test whether all species are equal in terms of flippers length.", "But most of the time, when we showed thanks to an ANOVA that at least one group is different, we are also interested in knowing which one(s) is(are) different. Results of an ANOVA, however, do NOT tell us which group(s) is(are) different from the others.", "To test this, we need to use other types of test, referred as post-hoc tests (in Latin, \u201cafter this\u201d, so after obtaining statistically significant ANOVA results) or multiple pairwise-comparison tests.4 This family of statistical tests is the topic of the following sections.", "In order to see which group(s) is(are) different from the others, we need to compare groups 2 by 2. In practice, since there are 3 species, we are going to compare species 2 by 2 as follows:", "In theory, we could compare species thanks to 3 Student\u2019s t-tests since we need to compare 2 groups and a t-test is used precisely in that case.", "However, if several t-tests are performed, the issue of multiple testing (also referred as multiplicity) arises. In short, when several statistical tests are performed, some will have p-values less than \u03b1 purely by chance, even if all null hypotheses are in fact true.", "To demonstrate the problem, consider our case where we have 3 hypotheses to test and a desired significance level of 0.05.

For example, with 10 groups we need to make 45 comparisons and the probability of having at least one significant result by chance becomes 1\u2212(1\u22120.05)^45 = 90%. So it is very likely to observe a significant result just by chance when comparing 10 groups, and when we have 14 groups or more we are almost certain (99%) to have a false positive!", "Post-hoc tests take into account that multiple tests are done and deal with the problem by adjusting \u03b1 in some way, so that the probability of observing at least one significant result due to chance remains below our desired significance level.4", "Post-hoc tests are a family of statistical tests so there are several of them. The most often used are the Tukey HSD and Dunnett\u2019s tests:", "Note that variances are assumed to be equal for both tests. They are presented in the next sections.

Notice that the conclusions are the same than above: all species are significantly different in terms of flippers length.", "The results can also be visualized with the plot() function:", "We have seen in this section that as the number of groups increases, the number of comparisons also increases. And as the number of comparisons increases, the post-hoc analysis must lower the individual significance level even further, which leads to lower statistical power (so a difference between group means in the population is less likely to be detected).", "One method to mitigate this and increase the statistical power is by reducing the number of comparisons. This reduction allows the post-hoc procedure to use a larger individual error rate to achieve the desired global error rate. While comparing all possible groups with a Tukey HSD test is a common approach, many studies have a control group and several treatment groups. For these studies, you may need to compare the treatment groups only to the control group, which reduces the number of comparisons.", "Dunnett\u2019s test does precisely this \u2014 it only compares a group taken as reference to all other groups, but it does not compare all groups to each others.", "Now, again for the sake of illustration, consider that the species Adelie is the reference species and we are only interested in comparing the reference species against the other 2 species. In that scenario, we would use the Dunnett\u2019s test.", "In R, the Dunnett\u2019s test is done as follows (the only difference with the code for the Tukey HSD test is in the line linfct = mcp(species = \"Dunnett\")):", "The interpretation is the same as for the Tukey HSD test\u2019s except that in the Dunett\u2019s test we only compare:", "Both p-values (displayed in the last column) are below 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis for both comparisons.

This is the reason that, by default, the reference species is Adelie.", "The reference category can be changed with the relevel() function (or with the {questionr} addin). Considering that we want Gentoo as the reference category instead of Adelie:", "Gentoo now being the first category of the three, it is indeed considered as the reference level.", "In order to perform the Dunnett\u2019s test with the new reference we first need to rerun the ANOVA to take into account the new reference:", "We can then run the Dunett\u2019s test with the new results of the ANOVA:", "From the results above we conclude that Adelie and Chinstrap species are significantly different from Gentoo species in terms of flippers length (p-values < 1e-10).", "Note that even if your study does not have a reference group which you can compare to the other groups, it is still often better to do multiple comparisons determined by some research questions than to do all-pairwise tests. By reducing the number of post-hoc comparisons to what is necessary only, and no more, you maximize the statistical power.6", "For the interested readers, note that you can use other p-values adjustment methods by using the pairwise.t.test() function:", "By default, the Holm method is applied but other methods exist. See ?p.adjust for all available options.", "If you are interested in including results of ANOVA and post-hoc tests on the same plot (directly on the boxplots), here is a piece of code which may be of interest to you (edited by myself based on the code found in this article):", "As you can see on the above plot, boxplots by species are presented together with p-values of the ANOVA and post-hoc tests.", "Besides the fact that it combines a visual representation and results on the same plot, this code also has the advantage that you can perform multiple ANOVA tests at once. See more information in this article.", "In this article, we reviewed the goals and hypotheses of an ANOVA, what are the assumptions which need to be verified before being able to trust the results (namely, independence, normality and homogeneity), we then showed how to do an ANOVA in R and how to interpret the results.", "An article about ANOVA would not be complete without discussing about post-hoc tests, and in particular, the Tukey HSD \u2014 to compare all groups \u2014 and the Dunnett\u2019s test \u2014 to compare a reference group to all other groups.", "Last but not least, we showed how to visualize the data and the results of the ANOVA and post-hoc tests in the same plot.", "As always, if you have a question or a suggestion related to the topic covered in this article, please add it as a comment so other readers can benefit from the discussion.", "Your home for data science.
