At a glance, the former seems to have done a great job describing explicitly every single one of its operations. However, these instructions are utterly redundant and obsolete. They solely add another layer of confusion to the reader. Bad comments are excuses for poorly named variables and inadequate programming skills.", "Here\u2019s what your co-workers will think about while evaluating the above code if you are the one who wrote it", "You don\u2019t want your colleagues to be overwhelmed trying to interpret your intention through your comments. By explaining all little details in your program, you thought you were doing them a favor but what they perceive is the opposite.", "Now, take another good look at the second piece of code. Do you find the code speaks for itself? No explication needed.", "Every programmer can write code for machines to understand, a good programmer writes code that humans can understand. Good codes don\u2019t need comment, and here are five reasons why.", "When writing a program, you should concentrate on algorithms, data structures, performances, and not composing the perfect comments that turn out to be unnecessary.", "Your snippet of code is a flow. It starts from the variable declaration to function definitions, and finally the core execution. Don\u2019t interrupt that flow with comments that don\u2019t bring any other explanation rather than the code itself.", "Good codes have rhythm while mediocre codes have a lot of pauses", "When other programmers read your work, they tend to plug their minds into that flow of yours. Consistently interrupted by redundant comments can create distractions.", "Comments are expected to make a connection between two flows of code, and not cut a single flow into fragments. Good comments compliment your code, while bad ones pull readers away from the main points.", "Before putting any comments, ask yourself whether it would serve any purposes rather than distract people from comprehending your program. Good codes have rhythm while mediocre codes have a lot of pauses.", "The codebase is where people collaborate. It has many versions and each programmer has equal opportunities to contribute their work. You don\u2019t want to leave an impulsive comment in the public source code. It could be forgotten and buried deep into the main components.", "A single bad piece of comment can become indecipherable and puzzling to your co-workers or even your future self.", "Imagine someone left a comment like this one three years ago", "Do you have enough confidence to delete that comment? It has been in production for three years. Your production is a mess already, and this comment will always be there. It is permanent, eternal, and everlasting.", "The comment will root in your source code. The programmer who put it there might not be malicious, he merely forgot what needs to be done later on. There years later, as he has already left the company, no one will ever know what the original motive was.", "Do yourself and others a favor, don\u2019t leave comments like that in your code. It\u2019s clumsy, sloppy, and impractical to fix. In case you aren\u2019t sure how to do yet, don\u2019t push it.", "In the short term, the patch could make to the production in time, but in the long run, it turns the codebase into a private note.", "As surprising as it sounds, your program has two distinct communication purposes: one with machines and another with human beings. Machines understand exactly what you instruct it to, but it\u2019s not the case for human beings. Without face-to-face or direct conversation, misunderstanding could at all times occur.", "You must know your codes\u2019 audience. They are not fifth-grade schoolers. They are your peers, your co-workers, or the one sitting next to you at work. They don\u2019t have to be aware of each tiny reason why you choose to name your variables that way or a two-page story of how you create this program.", "You ought to cut to the chase. All they want to know is how your program works and how to use it. Be direct, clear, and concise. Good communication is no communication needed.", "This was me, after one good hour of coding", "And this is me, after getting rid of writing bad comments", "The human brain is lazy by its nature. It tends to go with the least intimidating way to accomplish tasks.", "The most daunting thing to commence writing your program is to set up the first few lines. Writing a long and detailed comment explaining how the algorithm works might give your brain the signal that you are achieving something. Forming and choosing the correct words in your comments is a waste of time.", "Perfectionism kills productivity. Your first program might come out messy, and that\u2019s totally fine. No one will ever read the first draft of your code.", "You might want to iterate many times to produce the final version. You\u2019re lying to yourself by spending time writing the best comments in the world. You think you are working but in fact, you are procrastinating.", "Commenting is a counter-productivity way to start programming. Draft first, edit later.", "We talked about distractions, sometimes it is even worse. Some comments are more harmful than others.", "Your code reviewers don\u2019t know how to mind-read. They are free to fathom the code, and that could be different from yours.", "When you and your collaborators are not on the same page, the program can take a big turn. It might be used to do things it wasn\u2019t initially designed to.", "When communications are dubious, a single bad comment leads to misconception. The consequence could break the current version, demand a temporary fix, or rewrite the whole logic.", "Nobody understands no one with bad comments. Only the code will shine, and that\u2019s the thing you should focus on.", "My personal picks for the funniest comments that exist in the source code", "You can check out the full list here", "Needless to say, I\u2019ve made my point on avoiding superfluous comments. Strive for succinct, compact, and straight-to-the-point programming. Happy coding!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Engineer by day, writer by night. Write a draft like no one is watching.
