There\u2019s the opportunity to showcase your work to friends, family, and potential employers, the pride in making something, and the freedom to shape a (very small) part of the web to your tastes.", "While Medium is a great option to start blogging because the limited features let you focus on writing, eventually, like me, you\u2019ll want your own website to serve as a central location for your work. Fortunately, we live in a great age for creativity where you can use free tools to build a website in minutes.", "In this post, we\u2019ll see how to use the Jekyll site generator and GitHub Pages to build and publish a simple blog with no coding required. If you want an idea of the end product, you can take a look at my (work in progress) site.", "Jekyll is a simple static site generator. This means it takes plain text files and renders them as a website that can then be served to the web through a web hosting service. One option for this service is GitHub Pages, free \u201cwebsites hosted and easily published through GitHub.\u201d", "With Jekyll + GitHub Pages, the source files for your website live in a GitHub repository that is automatically published to the web. Basically, Jekyll transforms text documents in a repository into a website and then that website is hosted by GitHub. The only thing you have to worry about is writing posts and editing a few of the text files to make things look how you want. As the Jekyll design philosophy states:", "Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.", "You can follow this guide on GitHub to set up a new blank website. However, if you\u2019re looking to make a simple blog as quick as possible, a better option is to fork (a GitHub term meaning copy) the Jekyll Now repository which already has a blogging layout built and ready to be published.", "After forking, go into the repository settings under your account and change the name to username.github.io.", "Within a few minutes, you\u2019ll be able to navigate to username.github.io in your browser and see your new website published on the web! It\u2019s not really yours yet, but you can fix that in a few steps.", "You can edit any of the website files locally by cloning the repository and opening them in your favorite text editor. Then, when you commit and push your changes to GitHub, the website will automatically update. However, instead of local editing, I highly recommend the online Prose editor.", "Prose makes it much easier to see all of your files, quickly make changes, and commit and push them to GitHub as soon as you save. You\u2019ll have to authenticate Prose with GitHub and then you can start improving your blog. For example, to begin personalizing the website, edit the _config.yaml file:", "After hitting save, these changes can be seen online.", "All blog posts in Jekyll are written in Markdown, a lightweight language that was made to be converted to HTML or many other formats. It\u2019s extremely easy to learn, is ubiquitous on the web, and provides plenty of opportunities for customizing your posts beyond what you can do on Medium.", "The posts for your website are located in the _posts/ folder and as you edit and save the files in Prose, you\u2019ll be able to see them appear on your blog. Follow the naming convention: date-title.md and your post will automatically appear correctly named and dated on your site.", "If you already have posts on Medium, you can convert these to Markdown using this Chrome extension or this command line tool. The conversion isn\u2019t perfect, but with a few edits, you\u2019ll be able to quickly export your Medium work to your blog. Here\u2019s an article I wrote about going from existing Medium articles to Markdown that addresses several problems I found.", "The benefit of your own website is you can control every aspect of how things look and add any features you want. Start by digging through the files in the repository and looking at the Jekyll documentation. For example, to change fonts and styling, edit the style.scss file, and to enable functions such as comments on posts, edit the _config.yaml. You can even use a custom domain name by purchasing one through a web domain registrar like Hover and following this guide.", "The nice thing about Jekyll is that if you just want to focus on writing, you can leave the defaults and you\u2019ll have a clean, presentable blog. If you feel like making changes, then you can go as far as you want. For instance, I\u2019ve added a live code editor to my about page to make it more interesting:", "If you\u2019ve been holding off on making a blog because you were concerned about the time or cost, then now is the time to get started. With GitHub Pages and Jekyll, you can have your own blog in five minutes for free!", "As a reminder, the steps are:", "For anyone who already has Medium posts, here\u2019s a guide for moving them to Markdown. If you don\u2019t, then here\u2019s some help for writing about data science projects. Finally, get out there and build a website to call your own!", "As always, I welcome comments and feedback.
