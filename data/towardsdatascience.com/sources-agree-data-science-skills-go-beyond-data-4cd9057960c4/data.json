Data professionals need a wide range of skills, extending well beyond the technical aspects of data manipulation and analysis.", "This week\u2019s episode of the Alter Everything podcast showcases Carlene Jones, data and analytics consultant, and Nynne Haagensen, a data enthusiast who worked with Carlene. Their conversation reinforces that people skills, communication abilities and business savvy are all critical to success in data science and analytics.", "What are all those skills? To explore online conversations around this skill set, I decided to gather and analyze some data, naturally, inspired by this fantastic topic modeling trilogy (part 3 is coming soon!). This seemed like a fun opportunity to apply topic modeling with Alteryx Designer to what folks have discussed out there on the interwebz about the data science skill set. (Topic Modeling is part of the Alteryx Intelligence Suite, which includes some new text mining tools.)", "I built a workflow in Designer that scraped 64 articles from the data science site KDnuggets tagged \u201cskills\u201d and cleaned up the text. I also used Text Pre-processing to quickly prep the remaining text before sending it into the Topic Modeling and Word Cloud tools. The word cloud below gives you a preview of some of the prominent ideas, but topic modeling lets us dig a little deeper.", "I asked the Topic Modeling tool to identify three dominant topics in the text of these articles. You should definitely read all the details on how this process works, but in a nutshell: This is an unsupervised approach, meaning that I\u2019m not specifying what I want the model to find in advance, but rather letting it identify on its own the key ideas in the text of the articles. This tool assumes that each chunk of text I feed it is a mixture of those three different topics, since I asked for three. It figures out how those topics are represented in each chunk based on the probability that certain words occur together. It doesn\u2019t give a name to the topics it finds, though; it needs us to figure out what its groupings of words mean.", "The topic model that results from this analysis is open to interpretation, but here\u2019s what I see. Topic 1 looks to describe the role of the data analyst or data scientist within an organization, with some technical terms mentioned (Python, SQL, Hadoop). However, it also includes concepts like \u201cvalue,\u201d \u201cmarket\u201d and \u201cdemand\u201d that could reflect the business expertise a skilled data professional brings to the organization. Some of the chunks of original text that scored highly for the presence of Topic 1 include:", "Topic 2 has \u201clearning\u201d as its most relevant term and \u201cmachine\u201d in second place, so a quick conclusion would be that Topic 2 reflects the prominence of machine learning skills for data science. However, a closer review suggests that maybe \u201clearning\u201d could also be interpreted in another way. Some of the chunks of text that scored highly for Topic 2 include:", "Some of the other terms included in this topic are \u201cquestion,\u201d \u201cunderstand,\u201d \u201cteam,\u201d \u201capproach\u201d and \u201coffer.\u201d This topic seems to have a theme of ongoing learning and skill development for the data professional.", "Finally, Topic 3 looks like it represents the intersection of technical skills and problem-solving, with terms \u201cproblem,\u201d \u201csolve,\u201d \u201cthink,\u201d \u201cmodel,\u201d and \u201ccode\u201d showing up as highly relevant. \u201cMath\u201d also appears here, as do \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cconcept,\u201d suggesting some of the more specific intellectual skills useful in the data fields.", "Yes, it is a lengthy list of skills indeed! This quick analysis suggests that in discussions of data science skills, there is a recurring emphasis not just on technical skills, but on the capabilities that put data analyses into human and business contexts. The best model or analysis doesn\u2019t mean much without humans empowered to figure out the right problem-solving strategy, the questions to ask, the methods to use and the interpretation of their results.", "Learn more about how Carlene and Nynne view the skills needed for a data-driven company culture and professional success in this week\u2019s Alter Everything episode.", "Originally published on the Alteryx Community.
