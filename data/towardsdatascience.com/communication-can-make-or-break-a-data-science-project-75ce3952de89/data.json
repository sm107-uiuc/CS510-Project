Many skills that you will need to master are soft skills. According to Indeed, soft skills are \u201ca personality trait or habit.\u201d These skills are the ones commonly placed on resumes or written into cover letters. Soft skills include things like problem-solving, effective communication, and adaptability. You can learn and develop these skills through practice. The soft skill I have found most beneficial in data science is the art of communication.", "Communication is a huge part of data science. Whether you are working to understand a business problem or presenting your results from the analysis you did, you will spend a good portion of time learning to communicate to different business levels.", "You hear it repeated over and over, understand your business problem. But I will repeat it anyway. Understanding your business problem upfront can help ease tensions later on. If you are confused about what you are working on, stop. Get clarification on your business problem. Having well-defined communication when working with stakeholders can help make sure you are working on the right issues.", "Where I work, I am a team lead and product owner. When requests come into the team, the first thing I do is sit down with those requesting the work and have a conversation. I do this to make sure I understand the scope of requested work, any dependencies that may exist, and the expected timeline. Developing features and user stories based on others\u2019 requests was not a skill I was great at in the beginning. Gathering information related to the business problem and making sure it is well understood by all parties involved helps kick off a positive engagement. To showcase how this can go wrong, let\u2019s discuss Feature 41.", "When I initially began as a product owner, it was unclear how to take these requests. I had not been in this position before, so it was a learning curve. When starting, I had placed one item in my backlog, Feature 41. Feature 41 in the backlog as an initial idea for a database with a short description of the business problem that would encompass this work. Coming to the start of 2020, a stakeholder had updated Feature 41, and we met to discuss the work scope. In the two meetings I had with him, we went over vaguely what he was looking for, but we did not discuss a timeline for the expected outcome or priority. These discussions were not what they should have been. I knew what the stakeholders wanted, but I did not understand the work\u2019s importance, level of effort, or next steps.", "Due to the miscommunications, Feature 41 led to an unexpected blow out in a meeting. The conversation went from a demo of an initial idea to an argument. The stakeholders couldn\u2019t understand why the work was not a high priority and how their requests fell on deaf ears. Unfortunately, I did not hear most of these requests as they were being sent to a different person, so the work remained in the backlog. It was an unexpected turn of events, and I sat in silence with my colleague, who gave the demo. I waited it out and listened. After 20 minutes, and listening to all parties involved, I cleared the air by stating the intent: we were there to start the project. We did not start this project eight months prior like they had hoped, so we were not showcasing a finished product already. This meeting was to demo the initial work, gather requirements and action items for the next steps. Moving forward, I learned to communicate effectively on the intent of meetings, the state of the work, and how to gather requirements, dependencies, and work plans.", "In my opinion, this miscommunication on Feature 41 was the start of building better relations with the stakeholders. Miscommunication can make or break a project, but you can move on in a positive direction if you handle the issues well. Ensure you understand your business problem and the requirements for that work before jumping into the deep end. Miscommunication is something that can sneak up at any time. Ensuring you have your intent written out clearly and agreed upon by all parties can make this go smoother.", "Moving forward with Feature 41, the work started with requirements gathering. Stakeholders came on board to approve the business problem, and we set off with everyone on the same page. At this point, we began developing the database for Feature 41. As this work began, I needed to communicate to different levels of the business as the work went on. I work with engineers, software developers, data scientists, business colleagues, and more in my job. When communicating with different types of people, you need to understand how to tailor the conversation. Not everyone needs or wants a technical deep dive.", "If I am talking to a software developer about the database, I will get into the work\u2019s code development and architecture. These conversations will be more focused on the actual implementation of the database. Whereas, if I am talking with a business associate, I will discuss high-level progress with them, how the result is coming along to fit their use-case, and any blockers they may assist with. Understanding how to tailor your communications to different levels of business is a valuable skill to have. Knowing what level of conversation to have with each group of people will also help you prepare presentations and work in meetings.", "As you have these conversations and are presenting your work, you want to deliver the right story. Once you know the level your presentation needs to be at, you can tailor your presentation to that audience and walk them through the story behind your work.", "Recently I was asked to present in two different forums, (1) a project meeting and (2) an executive meeting. The project meeting is one held weekly in which other teams on the project present their current work. At the most recent meeting, my group presented our work related to Feature 41. These slides became a high-level overview of the business problem, the user discovery that was completed to gather requirements. We discussed the current state of the work and action items identified for the next steps. This overview consisted of about ten slides and was tailored to the broad audience who would want an update on the work but not a deep technical dive.", "On the opposite end, the meeting with an executive condensed those ten slides down to one. The one slide covered the purpose of the work, the current use-case, and value-add, as well as the expected future state. This presentation had to condense a 30-minute presentation into a 2-minute high-level overview that got the main points across. As you prepare your presentations, understand the audience you are developing your presentation for and the story you want to tell. Tailor that story and explain the business problem, the work you have done to solve that problem, and the proposed or finalized outcome.", "Feature 41 has taught me that communication is a crucial aspect of effectively working on any data science project and can come in many forms.", "Feature 41 has taught me a lot this year about effective communication, and there is still so much more to learn!", "What have you learned about communication in the data science field this year?", "If you would like to read more, check out some of my other articles below!", "Your home for data science.
