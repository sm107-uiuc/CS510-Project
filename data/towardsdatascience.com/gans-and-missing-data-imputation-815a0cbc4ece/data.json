They are widely used for editing or generating images, security purposes, and in many other areas, outperforming most of the Neural Network architectures. They also have some less serious applications such as transforming horses to zebras or rendering cityscapes into GTA style.", "It seems that it was only a matter of time until they would be used for imputing missing data. The idea of using GANs for handling missing data is relatively new and it exists mostly in the research literature. However, it is a very promising approach and we might see ready-to-use GAN models for missing data imputation very soon. In fact, there are few existing implementations on the Github which I will mention at the bottom of the article. In this article, I will explain the most popular GAN architectures for missing data imputation while getting rid of the scientific jargon and explaining it in a more simple, intuitive way \ud83d\ude09 Let\u2019s dive into it!", "Before we look at different GAN architectures which handle missing data, we need to make sure that we get the basics right.", "Missing data is a common problem when working with real datasets. Some of us only work with nearly ideal and well-formatted data available at Kaggle. Unfortunately, it is not how it will look like in real life. Data will be often missing and it can happen in 3 different ways: MCAR (Missing Completely at Random), MAR(Missing At Random) and NMAR (Not Missing At Random). Have a look at this article if you want to learn about it in more detail. Fortunately, there are various methods to handle missing data. To get some insight into existing imputation algorithms (e.g. KNN, MICE, MissForest) and their respective Python packages, I would recommend reading my previous article.", "GANs are a perfect fit for handling missing data. They learn the hidden data distribution very well and the feedback loop between Generator and Discriminator yields in very high accuracy results. If you feel that you need to refresh your memory about GANs, have a look at the short paragraph below which was written by Owen Carey in this amazing article.", "One neural network, called the Generator, generates new data instances, while the other, the Discriminator, evaluates them for authenticity.", "You can think of a GAN as a game of cat and mouse between a counterfeiter (Generator) and a cop (Discriminator). The counterfeiter is learning to create fake money, and the cop is learning to detect the fake money. Both of them are learning and improving. The counterfeiter is constantly learning to create better fakes, and the cop is constantly getting better at detecting them. The end result being that the counterfeiter (Generator) is now trained to create ultra-realistic money!", "GAIN stands for Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets. At the moment of writing, it seems to be the most popular GAN architecture to handle missing data. The idea behind it is straightforward: Generator takes the vector of real data which has some missing values and imputes them accordingly. The imputed data is fed back to the Discriminator whose job is to figure out which data was originally missing. The figure below explains the architecture in more detail.", "There is a Mask matrix which tells the Generator which values are missing or are present. The Random matrix adds randomness to imputed values (so they\u2019re not the same every time). There is also Hint vector which is supplied to the Discriminator to ensure that the Discriminator forces the Generator to learn.", "The accuracy of GAIN imputation was compared to other state-of-the-art imputation algorithms and it was proven that it significantly outperforms them all [1]. That sounds like a good Imputer, huh?", "MisGAN is another GAN framework which handles missing data. It is a bit different architecture than GAIN as it has 2 Generators and 2 Discriminators [2]. The figure below presents the MisGAN architecture.", "The Generator Gx generates complete data and the Generator Gm produces the mask for missing data (it is a binary matrix where \u20181\u2019 stands for non-missing data and \u20180\u2019 stands for missing data). It is then compared in Discriminators Dx and Dm to check whether it can be distinguished from the matrix of real data x and the mask matrix of real missing values m. The important thing to note here is that after the successful training of the MisGAN architecture we can generate complete data and mask for missing values separately. Quite cool, huh?", "There is one tweak to the architecture above which can create a missing data Imputer directly. In this situation, we have the pre-trained Generator Gx which can generate complete data and Generator Gi which acts as an Imputer. It is fed up to a single Discriminator Di and checked whether Gi produces satisfactory results from data with missing values. The figure below shows the architecture in more detail.", "VIGAN approaches the problem of missing data in a different way. To introduce you to the problem, let\u2019s imagine that we have an experiment where a hospital collects neuroimages for a certain sample of patients and brain signals for a completely different sample of patients. This results in an unpaired data which leads to multi-modal (i.e. different ways to express the same thing; image and text describing it is a good example) data analysis. There is no one-to-one mapping of the patient data while using these two datasets. We can\u2019t simply combine them both because patients are unique amongst datasets. It requires different mathematical modeling to tackle this problem which is usually quite a common issue in big data [3]. Often, you can\u2019t even combine datasets from different sources together (so-called multi-view data), because they are simply too large.", "This GAN architecture tackles the problem of missing data in multi-modal or multi-view datasets. The authors claim that their solution is highly scalable and that it is a very first approach to combine the domain mapping with cross-view imputation of missing data [3].", "The idea behind it is more complicated than for GAIN and MisGAN and it would take too long to explain the mathematical concepts behind it. If you feel adventurous, have a look at the paper here.", "The Collaborative GAN handles a bit different type of missing data. It is used for missing image data imputation. The advantages of that architecture over other GAN architectures, according to the authors of the paper, in the image domain are as follows:", "The novelty of the framework is that it \u201cconverts the image imputation problem to a multi-domain images-to-image translation task so that a single generator and discriminator network can successfully estimate the missing data using the remaining clean data set.[4]\u201d", "In my personal opinion, the paper is bit vaguely worded and I found it difficult to fully understand how they implemented their GAN architecture. If you find this idea interesting, have a look at the original paper here.", "After having a quick look-around in Github, I have discovered that there are some existing implementations of these GAN architectures! For your convenience, I\u2019ve listed them below.", "This repository seems to be the most popular for GAIN and it uses Tensorflow. It has >70 stars on the Github, but it hasn\u2019t been updated since March 2019.", "The VIGAN has been implemented in PyTorch but it doesn\u2019t seem to be very popular having ~20 stars. Link to the repo is here.", "Although imputing missing data with GANs is a relatively new concept, it shows very promising results. In the near future, we might see more GAN architectures handling missing data with even higher accuracies.", "I hope you found my article useful.
