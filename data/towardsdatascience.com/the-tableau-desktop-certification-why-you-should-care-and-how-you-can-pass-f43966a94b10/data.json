Its intuitive drag and drop interface makes connecting to data, creating graphs, and sharing dashboards easier than ever before.", "But why should exactly you care about it?", "According to Tableau\u2019s website, in 2017 there were over 300,000 people using Tableau Public (the free version of Tableau available for everyone) to create visualizations and share data online.", "You can create use Tableau to create \u201cstandard\u201d business visualizations, like the sample eCommerce dashboard below.", "You can also bring out your creativity in full force and use Tableau to tell a story. Tableau allows you to bring contextual explanations, easy-to-understand graphs, and visual flair together in one view. One Tableau Public user used it to answer the age-old \u201cDoes pineapple belong on pizza?\u201d question, which you can see below.", "In addition to individuals creating visualization on Tableau Public, companies like Chipotle, JPMorgan Chase, and Lufthansa are just a few of the organizations that use Tableau to facilitate data-driven decision making. Tableau helps companies bring data to the hands of all its staff, allowing teams from operations management to finance to track and analyze data. Your company might actually be using Tableau without you knowing it!", "Tableau offers two main branches of certification: Desktop and Server. The Server certifications are more applicable for System Administrator related roles, where your focus is on installing, deploying, and maintaining Tableau Server. The Desktop certification route, which is the focus of this piece, is what people working as analysts will find useful.", "I would suggest starting with the Desktop Certified Associate. The Specialist certification measures foundational skills, like creating basic charts and formatting them. While this knowledge is important to have, Tableau is intuitive enough so that you can learn most of the material in the Specialist exam simply by using Tableau.", "Furthermore, the Certified Associate exam doesn\u2019t require you to have the Specialist certification as a prerequisite, which means you can skip paying the $100 fee for the Specialist certification and jump straight to the Certified Associate. Each attempt on the Certified Associate exam costs $250, so make sure to prepare thoroughly before you try it out.", "Based on Tableau\u2019s Certification Directory, as of August 2020, there are 4,101 people with active Desktop Certified Associate certifications. This number may be even higher, as some people might have opted out of being shown on the list. Acquiring this certificate is one way to demonstrate that you know more than just the basics of Tableau.", "When you\u2019re up against a hundred other people for a job that needs data skills, the certificate may be enough to at least get you an interview.", "If we take a quick peek at Google Trends, \u201ctableau jobs\u201d and \u201ctableau certification\u201d are search terms that have continued to increase over the last decade.", "Jobs in every business function work with data in some form, and Tableau can help turn that data into actionable business intelligence. That and the growing popularity of \u201cbusiness analyst\u201d and \u201cdata analyst\u201d type jobs may be the reason for the popularity of Tableau and Tableau certification-related search trends. So if you\u2019re looking to distinguish yourself among the crowd of applicants for every opening, learning Tableau may be one way to do so.", "Because I recently passed my Tableau Desktop Certified Associate exam, I wanted to take the time to explain how I prepared and what the exam experience was like. If you\u2019re also interested in taking the exam, I hope by the end of this piece I was able to help!", "The exam is graded as a pass or fail, with 75% needed for a passing mark. For full disclosure, here\u2019s proof of my certification:", "As you can see, I didn\u2019t pass with flying colors. I just passed with regular colors. I was a bit shocked to see that I only got 55% of the \u201cCalculations\u201d questions correct, but I couldn\u2019t see which questions I got wrong because Tableau doesn\u2019t provide per-question feedback on your exam. On the bright side, this high-level feedback does help, as after the exam you know which areas to review and focus on for your next attempt (if you need to re-take the exam) or for the Certified Professional exam.", "If you\u2019ve skimmed the introduction and arrived here, this is where it gets real.", "The official Desktop Certified Associate exam guide (link at the end of this piece) tells you exactly which skills the exam will measure, and the weight of each section on the exam. The exam includes 36 questions, so we can approximate the number of questions for each section below:", "The number of questions per section is just a guideline. The actual percentage allocation on the exam may be slightly different than what\u2019s shown on the table above. One question can mean the difference between a pass and a fail, so don\u2019t skip over any sections just because you think it\u2019s easy at first glance.", "All questions are multiple-choice, where you either have to select one correct option, multiple (if applicable) correct options, or True/False. However, there is another distinction between \u201chands-on\u201d and \u201ctheory\u201d questions that you should be prepared for.", "With hands-on questions, you\u2019ll be given a question to answer based on a provided data source. All data sources are files provided in a folder on the virtual machine (more on this later), so you most likely won\u2019t have to connect to any cloud databases or web data. A simple hands-on question structure might be like this: \u201cBased on the WoahMarket Global Sales data set, what is the sum of sales for Europe in 2019?\u201d To answer this question, you will have to locate the \u201cWoahMarket Global Sales\u201d file, determine if it is Excel or CSV, connect to and open the table in Tableau, and then manipulate the data to get the answer.", "For the theory questions, you won\u2019t technically need to connect to any data sources to answer. These questions test your understanding of Tableau functionality in each of the different skill sections. For example, a sample theory question would be: \u201cHow do dashboard set actions affect the view?\u201d, after which you\u2019re given several options to choose from.", "Now, let\u2019s quickly go over each skill and discuss each area you should review before the exam.", "No data analysis or visualization can start without first connecting to the data. That\u2019s probably why the exam features this section heavily, with 17% of the multiple-choice questions potentially featuring data connections. You\u2019ll need to know a lot more than how to connect Tableau to an Excel file.", "You should know that Tableau can connect to various databases, including Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL. Tableau also has built-in connections to several Amazon services, including Athena and Redshift. You won\u2019t necessarily be asked to connect to these, but they may show up as options in a multiple-choice theory question.", "There are also many different ways to combine tables in preparation for visualizing. You\u2019ll need to know how to differentiate joins, blends, and unions, as well as the scenarios in which you\u2019d use each join.", "Another important feature that you may need to use in the exam is the \u201cData Interpreter\u201d, which is a built-in Tableau feature that can help clean data before loading. If you\u2019re given a file with lots of empty cells, titles, and other strange formattings, simply tick the \u201cUse Data Interpreter\u201d box and Tableau will attempt to detect tables from the file.", "Tableau also allows you to create \u201cextracts\u201d, or saved subsets of data that decrease the size of data you analyze and can potentially improve how quickly your workbook responds. Extracts were updated in version 10.5, and you may get some theory questions regarding the difference between the old extract formats functionality and the new.", "This section is relatively simple, which may be why Tableau weighted it less than the others. To filter data, you\u2019ll typically drag a dimension over to the filter pane and customize it as necessary. To build groups, hierarchies, and sets, all you need to do is right-click on the relevant dimension and select what you want to create.", "While performing these tasks are easy, you still need to understand why and when to perform each of them.", "For the hands-on questions, it doesn\u2019t matter how you choose to get the right answer, as long as you get the right answer.", "If you come across questions that make it seem like you need a calculated field, it may first be worth trying a technique from this section.", "Creating a set in Tableau can answer many different types of questions. When you customize a set, you are allocating data that fit into a category as \u201cin\u201d the set, and the rest of the data that don\u2019t fit as \u201cout\u201d of the set. For example, if you had to identify the top 10 customers by total sales, you could answer this question by creating a set and selecting the \u201cTop\u201d tab and customizing the \u201cBy field\u201d option.", "You could also take this a step further and create a combined set if you needed to compare two types of customers. For example, if you wanted to see only customers who were in the top 10 of total sales and the bottom 10 of the total profit, you can right-click on one of the sets and click \u201cCreate Combined Set\u201d, after which you can choose to get only members that fit in both of the sets.", "This is a good section to review Tableau\u2019s \u201cOrder of Operations\u201d, which layout in which order Tableau implements filters and calculations that you put in the view. For example, when you want one of your dimension filters to be implemented before the rest you would need to set it as a \u201cContext Filter\u201d, as these are implemented before regular dimension filters.", "This section involves how Tableau creates visualizations by understanding the components used to create them.", "The first step is understanding the difference between measures and dimensions. Measures in Tableau represent to be the numerical values in your data sources, whereas dimensions are the qualitative values that you use to categorize and aggregate your data. When you drag a dimension onto the view, Tableau will automatically aggregate the view based on that category.", "Say you initially just had a graph with each sale plotted over time. If you then dragged \u201cRegion\u201d into the view, you would still get sales over time, but there would likely be less individual points on the graph, as all the individual points in each same region would have been added together (i.e. Tableau would change [Sales] to SUM([Sales]).", "You also need to know the difference between discrete and continuous fields. At first glance, you may assume that all measures must be continuous and all dimensions must be discrete. However, this is not the case. Some measures may be discrete (rare), and some dimensions may be continuous (less rare).", "In most cases, measures tend to be continuous, as continuous values form an unbroken whole and go to infinity. For example, the \u201cSales\u201d measure is continuous, because there is technically no upper limit to a company\u2019s sales, and the sales value could be any number. In contrast, discrete values are those that are distinct from one another. For example, different values in the \u201cProduct Category\u201d dimension are discrete, as there are a set number of values that the dimension can take.", "Also, you might initially think that all measures are green and all dimensions are blue. This is not the case, which you can see if you right-click on a measure and select \u201cConvert to dimension\u201d. You\u2019ll see that all discrete fields are blue and all continuous fields are green.", "Tableau also automatically generates some fields that you can use. They are present at the bottom of the list of dimensions and measures, and are italicized so you can quickly identify them. It\u2019s best to just drag these into the view so you understand what they do. You\u2019ll also see that when you select certain chart types, some of these fields will automatically be added to the view. The number of records measure is also an auto-generated field from Tableau. You can think of it as an extra column in the table, with the values in each row being \u201c1\u201d, as it\u2019s meant to serve as a count of all the rows in your data source.", "There is a wide range of charts you can build on Tableau, from histograms to heat maps. If you click the helpful \u201cShow Me\u201d tab on the upper right, Tableau will show you which combination of dimensions and/or measures you need to create each type of chart.", "It\u2019s also important not only to know how to create each type of chart, but also when you might need to use them. Histograms, for example, look similar to bar charts but serve a completely different purpose.", "This is the highest weighted section on the exam, and for good reason. It\u2019s easy enough to drag and drop measures and dimensions into the view to create informative visualizations. But once you get comfortable using calculations, you\u2019ll add a whole new layer of depth to your analyses and unlock Tableau\u2019s full potential.", "Here, it\u2019s very important to distinguish between those calculations with aggregated values and those without. For example, if you\u2019re looking to calculate a profit to sales ratio for a particular region, you may think that you can just create a calculated field with [Profit] / [Sales]. However, if you add this calculation to the view, you won\u2019t get the correct result because Tableau will perform the calculation at for each row, and then add all the individual profit to sales ratios together. What you really want is SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales]), as this calculation will take into account the granularity on your view.", "Tableau explains what values are needed for every calculation when you\u2019re creating a calculated field, so there\u2019s no need to memorize what goes where. However, it is worth the different string, date, arithmetic, and logic calculations that Tableau offers, so at least you\u2019ll know the names of the calculations during the exam. To create a calculated field, click \u201cAnalysis\u201d and then \u201cCreate Calculated Field\u201d. You can also right-click a dimension or measure and then click \u201cCreate Calculated Field\u201d.", "You should also understand how table calculations work, and try out the most common ones like \u201cPercent of Total\u201d, \u201cMoving Average\u201d, and \u201cDifference\u201d. You may get a question that specifically has the type of table calculation you need in it, so all you need to do is select the right one from \u201cQuick Table Calculation\u201d.", "Understanding when and how to create \u201cLevel of Detail\u201d (LOD) calculations is also important, as there may be questions that seem straight forward but actually require these kinds of calculations. LOD calculations allow you to control which level of granularity you want to perform a calculation on, and can use values in calculations that don\u2019t appear on the view.", "Level of Detail expressions (also known as LOD expressions) allow you to compute values at the data source level and the visualization level. There are INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, and FIXED LOD expressions, but in general, FIXED expression can be used in most cases. Exceptions to this can occur when you need the LOD expression to be calculated in a different order relative to the filters you have on your view (see \u201corder of operations\u201d in the first section).", "FIXED LOD expressions let you perform calculations with values that are independent of what\u2019s shown on the view. One useful type of activity you can perform with these expressions are cohort analyses, which let you answer questions like: \u201cHow much profit comes from customers who first ordered in 2011, 2012, 2013, etc.?\u201d Here, you\u2019re creating groups of customers based on their first order date, and to do so you need to use a FIXED LOD expression.", "Ah, maps. They look may look simple, but you can do so much more with them than just color code different regions.", "One important tip to begin with: check to see if the data source provides you with \u201cLatitude\u201d and \u201cLongitude\u201d measures. If so, you\u2019ll want to use these instead of Tableau\u2019s auto-generated \u201cLatitude\u201d and \u201cLongitude\u201d measures, which are italicized and present at the bottom of the data pane. This is because sometimes Tableau cannot generate the coordinates for a custom location in your data set. This is why many data sets with special geographic locations come with their own \u201cLatitude\u201d and \u201cLongitude\u201d measures.", "Tableau also lets you check the distance between different locations with its \u201cRadial selection\u201d tool. However, you\u2019ll need to make sure you have zoomed in close enough so that the tool will show distance. This is because the Earth is not flat, so Tableau can allow show you the \u201cstraight line distance\u201d between two locations up to a certain point.", "You can add more details to the map by selecting different \u201cMap layering\u201d options, which can add items like city labels, streets/highways/routes, state/province borders, and much more. If you need to search for a specific geographic item like a city or a state, you can use Tableau\u2019s map search bar on the top left of the map view.", "The analytics tab may seem intimidating, but as with the rest of its interface, Tableau makes statistics easy to understand and use in your visualizations.", "You can perform most of the analytics related skills by moving from the \u201cData\u201d pane, which is the default, to the \u201cAnalytics\u201d pane. Here, you\u2019ll see options to \u201cSummarize\u201d, \u201cModel\u201d, or \u201cCustom\u201d analytics. For example, under \u201cModel\u201d you could drag \u201cTrend Line\u201d to the view, which would give you a choice of a linear, logarithmic, exponential, polynomial, or power trend line. It\u2019s worth pointing out here that while it\u2019s important to understand how these work, simply knowing what options are available (or checking which are available during the exam) can help you to quickly answer theory-based questions.", "For this section, in addition to being able to create a view with visual analytics items, you should also take a look at each item\u2019s components. For example, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with box plots, take a look at what the difference is between the upper hinge and the upper whisker. Similarly, if you need to add a forecast to the view, remember that you can click \u201cDescribe Forecast\u201d to take a closer look at the model.", "Last but not least is manipulating dashboards!", "Dashboards are combinations of sheets that can be used to show a lot of information on just one page. As with every other section, the best way to understand how dashboards work is to create and interact with some yourself. Tableau\u2019s sample Superstore workbook has a few well-designed dashboards you can take a look at to get started.", "Knowing when and how to use the different types of \u201cDashboard actions\u201d will serve you well. Filter and highlight actions are pretty quick to create and use. When you want to interact directly with a visualization and see dynamic updates based, you have the option to create parameter actions and set actions. These allow you to edit the parameter and set values respectively, which can be useful when you want to customize the data your visualization shows.", "Another important segment is how you can create custom dashboard layouts for different devices. In addition to the default layout, Tableau lets you create layouts specifically for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. You also have the option to auto-generate a layout for mobile devices.", "Those were all the skill sections you\u2019ll need for the exam. I tried to include as much as I could, but obviously I can\u2019t go over every point in the exam guide in one piece. Make sure to review every skill in every section, because they could all potentially come up on the exam.", "Now, let\u2019s go through registering for the exam and what the exam day will look like.", "Visit Tableau\u2019s Desktop Certified Associate page and click \u201cRegister Now\u201d. You\u2019ll be redirected to their exam portal where you\u2019ll be prompted to create an account, select which exam you want to take, and add your payment information. Once that\u2019s done, you can set the date and time you want to take the exam, which must be within six months of your registration date.", "There are a few things to remember on the day of the exam itself:", "The test will take place on a virtual machine, which the proctor will help you connect to during the exam set-up. This is why your internet connection must be stable because if you disconnect from the virtual machine in the middle of the exam, you won\u2019t get any extra time as you attempt to reconnect.", "During the test, you can use the internet!", "This can come in handy for theory questions, but you typically won\u2019t be able to just type the question into Google. You\u2019ll have access to most public sites, as long as they don\u2019t require you to log in. In general, the \u201cTableau Help\u201d and \u201cTableau Community Forum\u201d pages were the ones I found the most useful. I\u2019d suggest browsing through these pages to familiarize yourself with the keywords and layout.", "If you at least know the headlines of each section or sub-topic, you\u2019ll quickly know what to Google during the exam. For example, if you get a question on default dashboard layouts, you should know that Tableau Help has a \u201cCreate Dashboard Layouts for Different Device Types\u201d section under \u201cCreate Dashboards\u201d. You won\u2019t necessarily have to memorize the contents of everything on the page (although it would be great if you had the time for that), but at least you\u2019d know where the information was before the exam.", "Something important to keep in mind is that the test is timed. You have two hours to complete it, so don\u2019t spend too much time trying to search Google for an answer. If you\u2019re really stuck, an alternative to searching online is connecting to any data source on Tableau and testing out whatever the question is asking. For example, if you\u2019re asked whether a measure can be used as a filter and you don\u2019t remember the answer, just open a new sheet, drag a measure to the filter pane, and see what happens.", "To cap this piece off, I thought I\u2019d end with some more general tips.", "As of August 2020, you will take the exam using Tableau version 2020.1. It\u2019s important that you know which version of Tableau the exam is being conducted in, as features can change dramatically across new versions of Tableau. For example, Tableau has vastly simplified connecting to data in version 2020.2 with the introduction of \u201cRelationships\u201d, but this feature is not available in the version of Tableau for the exam. Keep an eye out on the official page for updates.", "Tableau looks (and is) very intuitive, so when you watch tutorial videos, it may seem like you\u2019ll be able to replicate exactly what\u2019s being shown. However, I found often that when I skipped through videos without following along, especially for more complicated topics like blended calculations and level of detail expressions, I couldn\u2019t solve problems after the video ended. It helps to copy exactly what\u2019s going on in a tutorial video, just so you can see the same results on your own screen. After that, you\u2019ll have a model to follow for future questions.", "My final general tip is to spend some time reviewing what you learned in the previous day at the start of the next day. It may seem time-consuming, especially as you learn more skills, but it\u2019s worth it. Odds are you\u2019ll spend anywhere from two weeks to a full month or more studying before the exam, so if you don\u2019t spend time reviewing, you may not remember concepts from the first 10 days right before you take the exam.", "For further studying, take a look at the Tableau Help pages. I know it\u2019s dense, but all the information you need to pass the exam is in plain sight on those pages. Don\u2019t forget to download the full exam guide on the Desktop Certified Associate page.", "Good luck with studying for the exam! I can\u2019t wait to see your names on the Certifiably Tableau Talent page!", "If you want more information on forecasting with Tableau, check out this piece:", "For some non-exam dashboard optimization tips, check out this piece:", "Medium has become a place to store my \u201chow to do tech stuff\u201d type guides.
