With Actions, the events that take place in our GitHub repository like pushes, pull requests, releases, etc. are used as triggers to kick-off the workflows. These workflows are coded in YAML format.", "Workflows are nothing but the steps we follow while bringing an application into production which includes unit testing, integration testing, building artifacts, sanity check, and deploying. In this article, I am going to introduce you to GitHub Actions and show you how to build your workflow to deploy a Machine Learning Application.", "Create a repository on GitHub, if you don\u2019t have an account I recommend you to create one. Every repository on GitHub now supports GitHub Actions features.", "Click on \u201cActions\u201d. If we already have any files in our repository, GitHub will recommend some predefined workflows. Here we will create our workflow. Click on \u201cset up a workflow yourself\u201d.", "As I mentioned earlier, GitHub workflows are coded in YAML format, here we define the jobs, steps, and the pipeline. Before getting started let\u2019s have a glimpse of the attributes we use in the YAML file. Below is a simple template to print \u201cHello, World!!\u201d", "The basic attributes we use in any workflow are:", "After configuring your workflow with the steps and jobs as per your wish, commit the pipeline \u2014 YAML file. The workflow will start running now. Now that we know the terminology of GitHub Actions, let\u2019s start building the workflow for a Machine Learning Application.", "I have developed a machine learning application that will predict the profit of a startup by taking some inputs from the user.", "Firstly, I trained the model with the required dataset, tested it, and validated it. Then I created a Flask server that serves the requests from users. I pushed the project directory to GitHub. The GitHub repository should look something like this:", "I want to create a workflow with the following four stages. You can also define your workflow accordingly.", "To reduce errors and improvise the overall quality of your code, Linting is necessary. If lint tools are used effectively, it helps fasten your development by reducing the costs of finding the errors. In this stage, we are doing unit testing and checking the code style.", "Now we will create the workflow, as shown above, and we will do it step by step.", "In this stage, we need to define the environment (Ubuntu in my case), check out the repository in that environment, and install all the dependencies or requirements required for the model to run. Also, I used Pylint and flake8 for checking the code base against coding style (PEP8), programming errors, and to check cyclomatic complexity.", "Now that we have tested our code against certain coding styles, let\u2019s build a Docker Image. Create a Dockerfile as shown below", "We build a docker image for the application using a Dockerfile. This artifact (docker image) needs to be stored somewhere, where all the different versions of our application are present. This will ensure that you are delivering your software in successive versions continuously. We have various tools to store artifacts few of which are \u2014 JFrog Artifactory, Amazon ECR, DockerHub, Google\u2019s Container Registry.", "Now, I am going to push the docker image to Google\u2019s Container Registry. So we need to set up the GCP environment which requires sensitive information like passwords and API keys. GitHub allows us to store secrets and we can access those secrets as variables.", "To create a secret go to settings and select secrets.", "You will be redirected to the secrets section. Click on \u201cNew secret\u201d. Give the secret a name and add value. Click on \u201cAdd secret\u201d", "I have updated all of the required secrets.", "Once the environment is set up, our job will start to build a docker image and upload it to Google\u2019s container Registry (make sure you enable the API for the Container registry on the Google Cloud Platform).", "After executing the above stages, we will have a docker image at our service stored on the container registry. In this stage, we are going to download the image and run it against various test cases. In the real scenarios, we may use different versions of docker images and we specify the versions we want to release. So we download the image from the registry rather than use an image built from the previous stage.", "Testing is required for the effective performance of software applications or products. Here we can test our Flask server by checking if it is returning 200 status code i.e., a proof of successful run. Also, as we can test and validate our machine learning model, calculate the accuracy and give a threshold level for accuracy and allow the job to continue to deploy the model only if the accuracy is greater than 95% (or any other threshold).", "Once the testing stage is finished with all test cases passed, our next step is to deploy the artifact or docker image. For deploying the docker image, I have used Cloud Run.", "That\u2019s all! Soon after executing this stage, the application will be in production.", "Now we have seen the entire workflow, let\u2019s start creating our action. You can copy the workflow file from here.", "Click on Start commit and give a commit message. Commit the file. Go to the Actions section. You can see that the workflow has started to execute.", "After running all jobs successfully, you will see the following output. We can check the console output for each stage and we can also check the logs for debugging.", "Now if we go to the Container Registry, we can view the artifacts that got pushed.", "Go to Cloud Run under COMPUTE Section on GCP Navigation Menu. A service with the given name is created. The machine learning model is in production. You can access the service through the endpoint now!", "The final application (in my case) looks something like this:", "This workflow will get triggered every time you push the changes to code. This is a basic pipeline. You can build a pipeline with various stages \u2014 Getting Data through API calls, Perform Feature Engineering, Model Training, Building or storing models (artifacts), Testing, and Deploying to production.", "The full code can be found on GitHub here.", "We have seen the process of setting up a workflow that automates the deployment of a Machine Learning Application using GitHub Actions. It enables us to create our actions and combine them to create a workflow for any software application.", "I\u2019ll be happy to hear suggestions if you have any.
