Due to this, it\u2019s now possible to come up with very strategic and meaningful clusters for effective targeting. And identifying the target segments requires a robust segmentation exercise. In this blog, we will be discussing the most popular algorithms for unsupervised clustering algorithms and how to implement them in python.", "In this blog, we will be working with clickstream data from an online store offering clothing for pregnant women. It includes variables like product category, location of the photo on the webpage, country of origin of the IP address and product price in US dollars. It has data from April 2008 to August 2008.", "The first step is to prepare the data for segmentation.

Determining the optimal number of clusters i.e k as well as proper selection of the initial clusters is extremely important for the performance of the model. The number of clusters should always be dependent on the nature of the dataset while poor selection of the initial cluster can lead to the problem of local convergence. Thankfully, we have solutions for both.", "For further details on selecting the optimal number of clusters please refer to this detailed blog. For selection of initial clusters, we can either run multiple iterations of the model with various initializations to pick the most stable one or use the \u201ck-means++\u201d algorithm which has the following steps:", "The algorithm initializes the centroids to be distant from each other leading to more stable results than random initialization.", "K-means then assigns the data points to the closest cluster centroids based on euclidean distance between the point and all centroids.", "The model finally calculates the average of all the points in a cluster and moves the centroid to that average location.", "Step 2 and 3 are repeated until there is no change in the clusters or possibly some other stopping condition is met (like maximum number of iterations).", "For implementing the model in python we need to do specify the number of clusters first. We have used the elbow method, Gap Statistic, Silhouette score, Calinski Harabasz score and Davies Bouldin score. For each of these methods the optimal number of clusters are as follows:", "As seen above, 2 out of 5 methods suggest that we should use 4 clusters. If each model suggests a different number of clusters we can either take an average or median. The codes for finding the optimal number of k can be found here and further details on each method can be found in this blog.", "Once we have the optimal number of clusters, we can fit the model and get the performance of the model using Silhouette score, Calinski Harabasz score and Davies Bouldin score.", "We can also check the relative size and distribution of the clusters using an inter-cluster distance map.", "As seen in the figure above, two clusters are quite large compared to the others and they seem to have decent separation between them. However, if two clusters overlap in the 2D space, it does not imply that they overlap in the original feature space. Further details on the model can be found here. Finally, other variants of K-Means like Mini Batch K-means, K-Medoids will be discussed in a separate blog.", "Agglomerative clustering is a general family of clustering algorithms that build nested clusters by merging data points successively. This hierarchy of clusters can be represented as a tree diagram known as dendrogram. The top of the tree is a single cluster with all data points while the bottom contains individual points. There are multiple options for linking data points in a successive manner:", "The ideal option can be picked by checking which linkage method performs best based on cluster validation metrics (Silhouette score, Calinski Harabasz score and Davies Bouldin score). And similar to K-means, we will have to specify the number of clusters in this model and the dendrogram can help us do that.", "From figure 3, we can see that we can choose either 4 or 8 clusters. We also use the elbow method, Silhouette score and Calinski Harabasz score to find the optimal number of clusters and get the following results:", "We will go ahead with 8 as both the Davies Bouldin score and dendrogram suggest so. If the metrics give us different number of cluster we can either go ahead with the one suggested by the dendrogram (as it is based on this specific model) or take average/median of all the metrics.

There are two key parameters in the model needed to define \u2018density\u2019: minimum number of points required to form a dense region min_samples and distance to define a neighborhood eps. Higher min_samples or lower eps demands greater density to form a cluster.", "Based on these parameters, DBSCAN starts with an arbitrary point x and identifies points that are within neighbourhood of x based on eps and classifies x as one of the following:", "3. Outlier or noise: If x is not a core point and distance from any core sample is at least equal to or greater thaneps , it is considered an outlier or noise.", "For tuning the parameters of the model, we first identify the optimal eps value by finding the distance among a point\u2019s neighbors and plotting the minimum distance. This gives us the elbow curve to find density of the data points and optimal eps value can be found at the inflection point. We use the NearestNeighbours function to get the minimum distance and the KneeLocator function to identify the inflection point.", "As seen above, the optimal value for eps is 1.9335816413107338. We use this value for the parameter going forward and try to find the optimal value of min_samples parameter based on Silhouette score, Calinski Harabasz score and Davies Bouldin score. For each of these methods the optimal number of clusters are as follows:", "The codes for finding the optimal number of min_samples can be found here and further details on each method can be found in this blog. We go ahead with the median suggestion which is 18 by Silhouette score.In case we don\u2019t have time to run a grid search over these metrics, one quick rule of thumb is to set min_samples parameter as twice the number of features.", "Comparing figure 1 and 6, we can see that DBSCAN performs better than K-means on Silhouette score. The model is described in the paper:", "In a separate blog, we will be discussing a more advanced version of DBSCAN called Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering (HDBSCAN).", "A Gaussian mixture model is a distance based probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a linear combination of multivariate Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. Like K-means it takes into account centers of the latent Gaussian distributions but unlike K-means, the covariance structure of the distributions is also taken into account. The algorithm implements the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively find the distribution parameters that maximize a model quality measure called log likelihood. The key steps performed in this model are:", "There are 4 options for calculating covariances in GMM:", "Apart from selecting the covariance type, we need to select the optimal number of clusters in the model as well. We use BIC score, Silhouette score, Calinski Harabasz score and Davies Bouldin score for selecting both parameters using grid search. For each of these methods the optimal number of clusters are as follows:", "The codes for finding the optimal parameter values can be found here and further details on each method can be found in this blog. We chose covariance as \u201cfull\u201d and the number of clusters as 26 based on the BIC score as it is based on this specific model. If we have similar configurations from multiple metrics, we can take average/median/mode of all the metrics. We can now fit the model and check model performance.", "Comparing figure 1 and 7, we can see that K-means outperforms GMM based on all cluster validation metrics. In a separate blog, we will be discussing a more advanced version of GMM called Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture.", "The aim of this blog is to help the readers understand how 4 popular clustering models work as well as their detailed implementation in python. As shown below, each model has its own pros and cons:", "Finally, it is important to understand that these models are just a means to find logical and easily understandable customer/product segments which can be targeted effectively. So in most practical cases, we will end up trying multiple models and creating customer/product profiles from each iteration till we find segments that make the most business sense.Thus, segmentation is both an art and science.", "Do you have any questions or suggestions about this blog?
