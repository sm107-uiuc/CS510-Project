The data error I identify affects quite substantially several of the more fundamental aspects of those key sub-datasets, such as the sample size, the number of recidivists, and the recidivism rate. I estimate that the recidivism rate is biased upward by almost 25%.", "Despite this, interestingly, the non-trivial data processing error I discover has little impact on the most high-profile result reported by ProPublica using the same sub-datasets. Namely, the false positive and false negative rates for African-Americans versus Caucasians.", "COMPAS and similar risk prediction scores are sometimes used to aide various decisions in the judicial system, such as those regarding bail and pretrial detention, sentencing, and probation and parole (Cowgill 2018 and James 2018).", "Based on its analysis, focusing on one set of predictive metrics, ProPublica concluded that the COMPAS recidivism risk score was biased against African-Americans. The company that developed the COMPAS risk scoring system, Northpointe Inc., using the same data but focusing on a different set of predictive metrics, defended the risk scores as unbiased.", "Due to the controversial nature of the topic and results, as well as the public availability of the data, ProPublica\u2019s trailblazing work of investigative journalism fueled intense debate and research in the nascent field of fair machine learning or algorithmic fairness.", "ProPublica\u2019s COMPAS score and recidivism data have become perhaps the most prominent benchmarking data used by researchers to test new or existing algorithmic fairness definitions and procedures. (See Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018 and the additional references I include below; or one of several Medium blog posts)", "While ProPublica\u2019s COMPAS data are used in an increasing number of studies, researchers have generally taken the datasets created by ProPublica as they are and do not appear to have scrutinized them for data processing issues. Instead of testing a novel fairness definition or procedure, I take a closer look at the actual datasets put together by ProPublica", "In particular, I examine the sub-datasets ProPublica built to study recidivism within a two-year window after a defendant\u2019s original arrest in the data. Doing so, I find that ProPublica made a substantial data processing error when it constructed these two-year recidivism datasets.", "As I show below, ProPublica failed to implement a two-year window sample cutoff for recidivists (whereas it did implement such a sample cutoff for non-recidivists)", "As a result, ProPublica incorrectly kept a disproportionate share of recidivists in the two-year datasets. I estimate this biases the two-year general recidivism rate upward by approximately nine percentage points, pushing it from 36% to 45%.", "The two-year recidivism rate ProPublica calculates is therefore about 25% higher than the true two-year recidivism rate in that same data when it is processed correctly.", "In my research paper, I also explore how this data processing error impacts other statistics. Specifically, I look at ProPublica\u2019s confusion matrix analysis of High/Low COMPAS scores vs. two-year recidivism status. I find that the biased two-year datasets also have a substantial effect on the positive predictive value (or precision) and the negative predictive value.", "On the other hand, the biased two-year datasets have relatively little impact on several other key statistics in the confusion matrix analysis, which are less susceptible to changes in the relative share of recidivists versus non-recidivists. In particular, the accuracy, false positive rate, and false negative rate.", "ProPublica\u2019s key finding of a higher false positive rate and lower false negative rate for African-Americans compared to Caucasians, therefore, does not change when one processes the data correctly.\u00b9", "To my knowledge, this is the first endeavor to highlight the data processing error mentioned above. In this blog post, I summarize my research paper.", "(If you would like more information, but not the full-length research paper, see my previous long version of this blog post. I have also created a GitHub repository with the R program I wrote to analyze the data)", "In 2016, a team of journalists from ProPublica obtained a dataset of more than 11 thousand pretrial defendants from Broward County, FL, who had been arrested and assessed with the COMPAS screening system between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014.", "ProPublica then collected data on future arrests through the end of March 2016 to study how well the COMPAS risk score predicted recidivism by these defendants (and published its article in May 2016). (ProPublica\u2019s data and analysis are described here)", "From these data, ProPublica created two sub-datasets specifically to study recidivism within two years of the original offense and COMPAS screening date. I examine, in particular, the two-year recidivism sub-dataset ProPublica built to study the likelihood of general recidivism. (General recidivism includes both violent and non-violent offenses)\u00b2", "To construct the two-year recidivism datasets, ProPublica presumably wanted to keep people observed for at least two years at the end of the time window for which it collected criminal records data in late March 2016.", "We should not have expected, therefore, to see any defendants in the two-year datasets with COMPAS screening (or arrest) dates after April 1, 2014. (That is, people observed for less than two years prior to the end date for the criminal records data that ProPublica collected).", "To check this, I visualize the two-year general recidivism dataset by analyzing the distribution of defendants across COMPAS screening dates (the screening is typically performed the day of, or one day after, the arrest). Doing so, I find that ProPublica made a substantial data processing error when it created this dataset.", "ProPublica failed to implement a two-year window sample cutoff for recidivists (whereas it did implement such a sample cutoff for non-recidivists)", "(In a previous long version of this blog post, I explain the reasoning that may have led ProPublica astray in this way)", "I show this data processing error in the Figure below (the key Figure in my research paper). In this Figure, I do a histogram of the number of cases or arrests by COMPAS screening date (which, again, is typically performed the day of, or one day after, the arrest). To see the data processing error clearly, I do separate COMPAS screen date histograms for recidivists vs. non-recidivists.", "I use 7-day (i.e., week-long) data bins for these histograms. For reference, I draw a red vertical line on April 1, 2014, which is the two-year mark prior to the end of ProPublica\u2019s criminal records data collection window (in late March 2016).", "[Note: This Figure also shows an unrelated, but very visible, drop in COMPAS screenings (or cases) in mid-2013 (for recidivists and non-recidivists alike). This is a separate issue, however, which seems to be present in the original dataset that ProPublica received from Broward County, FL. So this does not appear to be a data processing error by ProPublica, and I do not address this issue]", "The data processing error regarding recidivists depicted above leads to artificially high recidivism rates in the two-year dataset. This is due to all the extra recidivists with COMPAS screen dates post-April 1, 2014. ProPublica should have dropped these extra recidivists from the two-year dataset, but it did not. (In my long blog post and paper, I calculate these extra recidivists constitute approximately 30 percent of the total recidivists in ProPublica\u2019s two-year general recidivism dataset)", "As a result, in the two-year general recidivism dataset created by ProPublica, the two-year recidivism rate is 45%. However, when I drop the extra recidivists, I estimate instead that the two-year recidivism rate is only 36%. Thus, the two-year recidivism rate in ProPublica\u2019s dataset is biased upward by approximately nine percentage points or 25%.", "In my research paper, I also explore how this data processing error impacts other statistics. Specifically, I look at ProPublica\u2019s confusion matrix (or truth table) analysis of COMPAS score vs. two-year recidivism status. For such an analysis, ProPublica turned the COMPAS score into a binary classifier, of Low vs. High scores. (In my paper I do the same)", "In addition to the prevalence of recidivism (i.e., the recidivism rate), the biased two-year dataset used by ProPublica also affects the positive predictive value (PPV) (or precision) and the negative predictive value (NPV). If ProPublica had correctly processed the two-year data, with the resulting lower prevalence of recidivism, not surprisingly, the PPV would be lower and the NPV higher.", "On the other hand, the biased two-year dataset has relatively little impact on several other key statistics in the confusion matrix analysis, which are less susceptible to changes in the relative share of recidivists versus non-recidivists. In particular, the accuracy, the false positive rate (FPR), and the false negative rate (FNR). Or one minus these rates, i.e., specificity and sensitivity. (I explain why this is the case in the long version of this blog post and my research paper)", "ProPublica\u2019s finding of a higher false positive rate and lower false negative rate for African-Americans compared to Caucasians was the key finding that garnered the most attention. This key finding by ProPublica, therefore, does not change when one processes the data correctly.\u00b9", "Ultimately, the practical importance of the data processing error I identify here may be limited. I am not suggesting, for example, that Northpointe made a mistake when developing the COMPAS recidivism risk score itself (although the data used for that, and the actual model, are proprietary and not publicly available).", "Moreover, most of the fair machine learning research appears to target the FPR, the FNR, or the accuracy, which are not impacted by the data processing error.", "Finally, note that many potential measurement issues may affect the estimated two-year recidivism rate in ProPublica\u2019s COMPAS data (as I mention in my paper). Some of these could be putting downward pressure on the estimate, perhaps offsetting to some degree the upward bias I identify here.", "This last point, however, does not invalidate the emphasis on the data processing issue I identify and the ensuing data correction I call for. My focus is on the internal validity of the data processing. I am not claiming that after this correction, the data will not have any remaining issues, nor necessarily that it will have external validity, which is beyond the scope of my analysis.", "In any case, nobody appears to have previously visualized the COMPAS screening dates for the two-year recidivism dataset, as I do above. (If they have, it has not been widely disseminated) Thus, the data processing error I identify here has generally persisted and propagated for more than three years.", "My blog posts and research paper attempt to put the focus back on, and highlight the potential pitfalls in, the data processing stage.", "This blog post is a short version of my previous Towards Data Science post. A full-length version of my paper is available on arXiv. (I also created a GitHub repository with the R program I wrote to do my analysis)", "I am a staff economist at the Federal Trade Commission.
