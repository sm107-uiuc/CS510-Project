The main strategy is to separate the skater effect, the intrinsic ability of each skater, from the event effect, the influence of an event on a skater\u2019s performance, so that a more accurate ranking could be built.", "To this goal, several models were used across the previous parts of the project:", "Part 1: additive and multiplicative models, which can be formulated as simple linear models that try to approximate all season scores. The regression coefficients of the linear model include a latent score for each skater, and skaters are then ranked from these latent scores (from highest to lowest).", "Part 2: hybrid model, which is a cross between the additive and the multiplicative model in part 1. There is no closed-form solution to learn the latent scores, but they can be learned incrementally using gradient descent. The latent score of each skater can again be used to rank them.", "Part 3: multi-factor model, which is just an extension of the hybrid model. Instead of a single latent score for each skater (and event), each skater will have multiple latent scores across different factors, which can again be learned using gradient descent.", "Part 4: logistic regression model, which is used to combine the latent scores across factors in part 3. The predictors of the model are the score differences in each factor, and the response of the model are the status of each ordered pair of skaters in the world championship. In other words, the championship ranking itself is directly used to learn how to combine the latent scores from the multi-factor model, and these combined scores are then used to rank the skaters.", "Part 5: sequential multi-factor model, which is a modified version of the multi-factor model in part 3: instead of learning the scores of all latent factors at once, we learn them one at a time. As it turns out, this is nothing but training a single-factor model as outlined in part 2, then another single-factor model on the negative residuals after the first factor is learned, and so on.", "The resulting multi-factor latent scores are then combined using logistic regression, same as in part 4. In the end, the sequential multi-factor model was found to predict skaters\u2019 ranking better than the original multi-factor model in part 3.", "The predicted ranking from each method is evaluated using the ranking metric of Kendall\u2019s tau, which measures how much the predicted ranking correlates to the actual world championship ranking. For each of the 10 seasons chosen in the training set, we calculate the difference in Kendall\u2019s tau between each ranking model and the baseline model of season averages i.e. ranking skaters simply by their average season scores.", "Furthermore, for each method, we tried different strategies to improve on their predicted rankings, such as L2-penalization or early stopping. These strategies aim to prevent the models from overfitting to the season scores \u2014 and for the logistic regression model, to the world championship ranking \u2014 so that they can rank skaters better for future seasons.", "The average difference in Kendall\u2019s tau (over 10 seasons) for each method compared to the baseline model is documented below. Note that the logistic regression model uses the world championship directly to learn how to combine the latent factors. Therefore, it should not be evaluated on the same seasons that it were trained on, but rather to new seasons. As a result, two-fold cross-validation was used: the model is trained on 5 seasons, and evaluated on the other 5 seasons.", "From the above table, we see that:", "Therefore, the two main objective for the last part of the project are to:", "First, let\u2019s try two different approaches to combine the rankings from all methods that we have thus far developed: an unsupervised approach using Borda\u2019s count, and a supervised approach using logistic regression.", "Since each method predicts a different ranking of the skaters, we can think of each method as casting a different ranked vote to all the skaters (say, skater B > skater A > skater C for 3 skaters A, B, and C). Viewed under this lens, there are many ways to combine these ranked votes into a final ranking of the skaters. They all fall under the umbrella of ranked voting methods, which are used in many national and state elections.", "One common ranked voting method is the Borda count, which was first discovered all the way back in 1435! This is not too surprising, however, given how remarkably simple it is. The example below for a toy example of 5 skaters will demonstrate how it works:", "From the toy example above, it can be seen that:", "Coding the Borda count model is fairly simple:", "The axis=0 argument means the sort is performed across rows/skaters. Below is a diagram that highlights how the argsort method works to calculate the rank point for a skater who is ranked first by the season average model (FERNANDEZ, rank score of 4) compared to a skater who is ranked last by the same model (TANAKA, rank score of 0).", "Before we examine the result of the Borda count model, let\u2019s look at another method to combine the existing ranking, but this time using the world championship ranking to directly guide such combination.", "For our toy example, let\u2019s say the world championship ranking was HANYU > FERNANDEZ > TANAKA > GE > MAJOROV. Therefore, we can generate 10 ordered pairs from this ranking; for each pair, we calculate 5 predictors of score differences, one for each previous model, between the two skaters of that pair. Note that since the world championship ranking was used directly to generate the ordered pairs and calculate their corresponding predictors, this is a supervised machine learning task.", "The logistic regression model for the above problem is exactly the same as that in part 4, and is re-iterated below:", "Using gradient descent, the linear coefficients for each of the 5 previous models can be learned incrementally until the log-likelihood of the model has been maximized. Once these coefficients have been learned, they can be used to combined the different model scores into a single score that the skaters can be ranked by:", "Since the world championship ranking was used directly to train the logistic regression model above, we again use two-fold validation to objectively evaluate it: we train the model on 5 randomly chosen seasons, and evaluate it on the remaining 5 seasons. For consistency, the two folds chosen for this part are identical to the two folds chosen in part 4.", "Since gradient descent for the logistic regression in this part is exactly the same as that in part 4, I won\u2019t elaborate on it again. However, similar to that part, we can stop the gradient descent algorithm prematurely.", "By doing so, the model does not fit the world championship ranking as well as it should for the 5 seasons that it is trained on (training fold). However, its predicted ranking might be better for the 5 new seasons that it is applied on (validation fold). We then check at which iteration does the logistic regression model has the highest average improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau (over the baseline model) for all 10 seasons in the validation set.", "For male skaters, the average improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau over baseline for the train and validation sets are plotted for the first 2000 iterations of gradient descent:", "For the familiar exemple of male skaters in the 2017 seasons, we display the normalized scores for each of the 5 previous models, then the Borda scores, and finally the combined scores of the logistic regression model described above (stopped at 650 iterations of gradient descent).", "From the accompanying heatmap of predicted ranking across all 7 models, we see that:", "To visualize the relationship between the predicted rankings, we can plot them side by side for the 2017 season (bottom panel in below graph), along with the difference in Kendall\u2019s tau to baseline model for each of the 7 ranking models we have developed (top panel):", "From the above graph, we see that:", "The mediocre performance of Borda count and logistic regression model makes complete sense. This is because they themselves are just combinations of the 5 previous rankings, which are extremely similar from one another. Therefore, if a skater was ranked low by the previous rankings, there\u2019s no way for his rank to rise in the Borda count or the logistic regression model.", "In contrast, we see in the above graph that skaters can make surprising jumps and drops in rankings in the world championship. This implies that the mediocre result of the ranking models are largely due to the unpredictable nature of the world championship itself.", "Moreover, there are seasons where the large majority of predicted rankings out-perform the baseline model of season average, while they consistently under-perform in other seasons. In other words, just because most ranking models perform well in one season does not mean that there is nothing funky going on in the next season.", "This high season-to-season variability is why even though most models provide a marginal improvement to the baseline model on average, these improvements are so variable from year to year that they end up not at all statistically significant. This can be seen from the 95% confidence interval in Kendall\u2019s tau improvement crossing the horizontal line at zero for all ranking models.", "For female skaters, the logistic regression model has the highest improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau for the validation set at 92 iterations (see graph above). The performance of both unsupervised approach (Borda count) and supervised approach (logistic regression) to combine the previous rankings of female skaters are summarized in the below table:", "From both the graph and table above, we see that the logistic regression model (stopped at 92 iterations) provide quite optimistic results, with an average improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau of 0.01 over the baseline model. Furthermore, this improvement is almost statistically significant, as its 95% confidence interval almost goes above the horizontal line at zero.", "However, note that we have already used the world championship ranking for all 10 seasons in the training set when optimizing the ranking models \u2014 for example, when choosing the ideal iterations to stop the multi-factor model or the logistic regression models. Therefore, the results posted above have likely involved some degree of overfit to the training set, and are likely too optimistic.", "As a result, we end the project by benchmarking all 7 ranking models on the test set, which comprises of 5 seasons that we have not thus far analyzed. The benchmark result on this test set will provide a more objective evaluation of our models.", "Before we evaluate the 7 ranking models on the 5 seasons in test set, we re-train them using all 10 season in the training sets. We also stop the relevant models at the ideal iterations chosen by 2-fold cross validation. We also choose the latest season of 2019 to show how the different predicted rankings look like for a season in the test set.", "For the graph above, we can see that:", "The above result is summarized in the table below. Note that most models have lower performance in the test set as compared to the training set, which confirms our early suspicion that the performances on the training set were too optimistic.", "The picture for female skaters is not much better: most models under-perform the baseline model of season averages for the 2019 season, as evidenced by their relatively lower number of concordant pairs (out of 231 ordered pairs). On average, they also offers no significant improvement in Kendall\u2019s tau on the baseline model, except possibly the hybrid model, as their 95% confidence intervals all cross the horizontal line at zero. These results are summarized in the table below:", "If there\u2019s one thing you should take away from reading my project, it is: predicting sports is hard! This is clearly evident in the high variability in performance from season to season for all models developed in this project. Even the one with the most potential \u2014 the multi-factor model coupled with logistic regression \u2014 still cannot overcome this variability, even though we train it directly using the world championship ranking.", "As a result, future improvements to the models include:", "Lastly, this project has taught me so much in terms of framing a novel problem \u2014 ranking figure skaters \u2014 in terms of tasks that most data scientists are familiar with: linear regression, matrix factorization, logistic regression, and even something as simple as the Borda count. The rush from the many \u201caha!\u201d moments I encounter during the project is indescribable!", "In this part of the project, we combine the rankings from the 5 previous models using both unsupervised (Borda count) and supervised approach (logistic regression). These are two of the many approaches under the umbrella of rank aggregation, which is encountered in fields as old as voting theory, and as new as information retrieval \u2014 think Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm. A comprehensive overview of rank aggregation approaches can be found in this article.", "Lastly, thank you for reading through the 6 long parts of write-up for my project. I hope you learn some useful techniques to help with your sport prediction problems, or simply gain some insights on how common data science techniques can be applied to a unique problem such as this one.
