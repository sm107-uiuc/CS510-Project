You should read the first part first.", "We\u2019re talking about a way to compare the bag of words across the categories without building machine learning models and to do feature engineering.", "So, far we have looked at:", "After looking at the results we definitely got some confidence in the approach but still, it is not complete. By this, I mean to use this technique to reduce the features we have to gauge the impact in the model\u2019s performance with and without them being part of the training dataset. This is something we are going to look into, in this part.", "Now, we will compare the coefficients of significant & insignificant words.", "The coefficients of LR are in the range (-INF, +INF), where -INF coefficients mean that such features have an inverse relationship with the target/dependent variable. The coefficients away from 0 indicate more important the features are, which 0 means not important at all. So, we will take the absolute of the coefficients and then normalize them to make them comparable.", "Above is a plot of some of the Significant and Insignificant features and as can be observed more significant features (blue) have values closer to 1 as compared to insignificant ones. Again, these are only a few features and maybe a little biased, so, below is the histogram of the coefficients of both significant and insignificant features to get more clarity.", "In the above chart the density of insignificant features is high on the left side \u2014 indicating there are more features from the insignificant set having very low coefficient, where the low coefficient value indicates the less importance in predicting/classifying the target value.", "So, this concludes that indeed from the model itself these features are getting low coefficients. Now, all is left is to check the impact on the model performance, which we will be looking below.", "Previously, our training accuracy was 0.824, and the test accuracy of 0.778. So, the accuracy of the training dataset has decreased by about 1%. But, there is a similar ~1% improvement in the accuracy of test data. Also, let\u2019s look at the classification report.", "Previously, we had an f1-score of 0.81 for Target-0 and the same was 0.73 for the Target-1. Here, we can clearly observe an improvement of 0.01 in f1-score for both the target classes.", "So, our final conclusions about this methodology are:", "The working code for the analysis is hosted on Kaggle and can be referred to using the link \u2014 https://www.kaggle.com/pikkupr/a-new-way-to-bow-analysis-and-feature-engg", "Hope you find this analysis helpful and please share your story if you end up implementing this in any of your analysis.", "I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions, so, do leave comments.", "Your home for data science.
