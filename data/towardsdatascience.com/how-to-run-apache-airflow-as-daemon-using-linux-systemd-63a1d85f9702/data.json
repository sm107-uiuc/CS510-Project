Data Engineering, Data Pipelining, Data Transformation, Data Science, Linux related."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Since Airflow has become a top-level Apache Project from the incubator, it is becoming more and more popular as a workflow scheduling manager with concise Web UI.", "In a typical use case, Airflow needs two components that must be constantly running, webserver and scheduler. The former is the Web UI that is used to manage and monitor the workflows, and the latter is responsible for triggering the workflows at pre-defined timestamp correctly.", "However, it is not a good idea to run these two components using the provided commands in Linux, such as follows:", "To solve these problems, we need to run Apache Airflow as Daemon. Apache Airflow GitHub repo has already provided the daemon services definitions that support systemd and upstart. We will use the former in this article.", "The official documentation only gives a very brief explanation without a tutorial that can be followed. It would be relatively difficult for some Data Engineers or Data Scientists who do not have too much Linux experience. This article will demonstrate how to run Airflow as a daemon step by step. From installation to up and running.", "There were already some tutorials on Medium regarding how to install Airflow, such as this one if you are on Ubuntu:", "However, it seems that there is no such tutorial yet for Red Hat-based Linux such as CentOS, and the name of the dependencies and the way of installing them might be slightly different from Debian-based Linux.", "Firstly, it is highly recommended to create a particular user for Airflow", "Also, your Linux may or may not bind with some dependencies that are required by Airflow. Typically, I found that it is quite common to have the following three missings.", "Please note that the names of the libraries are not the same in Ubuntu and CentOS. For example, the Python Dev package is python-dev in apt-get for Ubuntu, whereas in yum for CentOS, it is called python-devel. If you are using Python3, make sure you install python3-devel. Also, the MySQL Dev is called libmysqldev in apt-get but mysql-devel in yum.", "Then, let\u2019s install Airflow and extra packages if necessary, such as:", "Before we can configure our systemd service for Airflow, we need to do some preparations. The first step will be downloading the service definition files from Airflow GitHub Repo.", "Let\u2019s create a temporary folder for the download files.", "Then, download the files to this temporary folder.", "In the GitHub repo, there is a brief explanation as follows:", "The systemd files in this directory are tested on RedHat based systems. Copy (or link) them to /usr/lib/systemd/systemand copy the airflow.conf to /etc/tmpfiles.d/ or /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/. Copying airflow.conf ensures /run/airflow iscreated with the right owner and permissions (0755 airflow airflow)", "You can then start the different servers by using systemctl start <service>. Enabling services can be done by issuing systemctl enable <service>.", "By default the environment configuration points to /etc/sysconfig/airflow . You can copy the \u201cairflow\u201d file in thisdirectory and adjust it to your liking.", "With some minor changes they probably work on other systemd systems.", "Well, I guess for most of those who are not from a Linux background, the above documentation might be very vague and misleading. So, I drew this diagram to show which file should be put on which path.", "According to the path indicated in the diagram, let\u2019s copy the files into the correct location.", "We also need to create some directories that the daemon requires. Firstly, it needs a dedicated directory to store runtime information such as the pid. Let\u2019s create the directory under the /run directory, and change the permission.", "Please note that the permission is set to 0755 because practically we may have other multiple users to develop DAGs (workflows) in Airflow. With 0755 permission, it ensures that all the other users have their secondary group as airflow will have enough permissions.", "Another directory we need to create is the Airflow home directory, which includes:", "Usually, if there is no export AIRFLOW_HOME=..., these will be automatically generated in the current user\u2019s home directory, such as /home/airflow/airflow/. This is fine if you are testing Airflow or developing some DAGs. However, it is not recommended and also not convenient in production, because other users will not easily access airflow user\u2019s the home directory.", "In my case, I would like to put the Airflow home directory under /opt, so let\u2019s create it.", "Again, change the permission to allow all users in the airflow group can not only read but also write to the directory because they need to modify the DAGs.", "Everything is prepared. We need to initialise the home directory of Airflow. It is important to export the home directory to the AIRFLOW_HOME environment variable. Otherwise, the home directory will be automatically generated in the user\u2019s home folder as above-mentioned.", "Now, all the service files, configuration files and necessary directories are ready. We need to configure the daemon to make sure everything is pointing at the correct paths before the daemon can run properly.", "First of all, let\u2019s double-check the path of airflow binary file because it needs to be specified in the service definition later on.", "In my case, it is /usr/local/bin/airflow. Please record down yours, which is likely to be the same, but just in case to pay attention to it. Don\u2019t directly copy mine.", "Then, let\u2019s modify the definition of airflow-webserver.", "Change the ExecStart value as follows.", "Similarly, let\u2019s change it in airflow-scheduler, too.", "Please note that the pid needs to be written into the directory we have just created /run/airflow.", "Then, we need to modify the system config of Airflow. Otherwise, the services will not know where is the Airflow home directory.", "The two configurations below need to be modified as follows, based on what we have just prepared.", "As the last step of the configuration of the services, we need to enable these services before we can run them.", "With root permission (root user or sudo), we can", "In this article, how to install Airflow on the CentOS system was introduced. Then, I\u2019ve argued that there are drawbacks if we simply run Airflow at the command line, so we need to solve it by running it as a daemon.", "We first need to download the service definition files from the Apache Airflow GitHub repo, then put them into the correct system directories. We also need to create some folders because the daemon will need them to run correctly.", "Finally, we need to configure the service definition files to make sure the daemon can find resources at the correct locations. After that, we can run Apache Airflow as a daemon, so that it will collect the services running logs appropriated, as well as automatically restart the services if anything goes wrong.", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
