Here\u2019s what you can expect from this article:", "Tools, libraries and platforms for Machine Learning have seen amazing progress over the last 10 years, and perhaps surprisingly, almost entirely driven by open source tools and open standards. In business strategy terms, the first half of the Machine Learning value chain is highly modularized (see picture below). There is no Apple or Starbucks here \u2014 no vertically integrated players who fuse several steps together as part of a proprietary solution.", "This modularization means that in each step of the ML value chain (from data to libraries to deployment), it\u2019s pretty much possible to freely choose components from the previous step. Yes, some libraries are for Python, and some work best in Spark, but it\u2019s largely possible to mix and match ML libraries, pipelines, tools and platforms as needed for the problem at hand.", "As far as proprietary platforms go (whether it\u2019s from Amazon, IBM, Google or Microsoft), they tend to package up a variety of languages (e.g. Python, R), tools (e.g. notebooks, IDEs) and libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow) available as open-source, and support those as part of the platform.", "Crucially, these vendor platforms aim to extend into model deployment, model monitoring and model serving, typically running on Kubernetes and exposing ML model as REST endpoints. This part of the chain is sometimes referred to as \u201cML Ops\u201d, analogous to what DevOps provides for software development and IT teams.", "As a result of this, most data scientists, ML engineers and ML Ops platforms consider their mission accomplished when the REST endpoint is made available.", "However, this causes problems to occur at the subsequent step, when Business and IT want to consume these deployed ML models, to make them part of business operations.", "To satisfy these needs, quite a bit of transparency is needed about the ML models available, their purpose and status. The current approach used (open REST-based APIs) is too technical and not carrying sufficient meta-data about the ML models to satisfy the needs of the business consumers.", "What is required here is actually closer integration between the ML Serving and ML Consumption steps, i.e. ensuring that the Business Automation platform has visibility into the ML Serving platform, being able to discover and introspect the available models. You can think of this as analogous to partner collaboration in a Supply Chain, where a supplier provides visibility into inventory to a buyer.", "Alternatively, the Business Automation platform can take over the task of ML Serving, hosting the ML models operationally. In this model, the consumption of ML models is essentially done by importing models, rather than referencing and invoking them through REST endpoints. While this might be technically feasible, it has implications on who governs ML models, potentially moving management of ML artifacts away from ML engineers.", "One way or another, the gap between ML- and Automation platforms will need to be bridged. The current situation is a major blocker for wide-spread adoption of Machine Learning.", "What do we take away from this, and what actions do consider short-term?", "Finally, if you\u2019re a software developer or -vendor in the Machine Learning and Business Automation space, there might be an opportunity here to differentiate. Consider Clayton M. Christensen\u2019s Law of Conservation of Attractive Profits (see his book The Innovator\u2019s Solution):", "\u201cWhen attractive profits disappear at one stage in the value chain because a product becomes commoditized, the opportunity to earn attractive profits with proprietary products usually emerges at an adjacent stage\u201d", "Since the Machine Learning market is so fragmented and modularized (close to commoditized), attractive profits might be offered to those who closely integrate ML Serving and ML Consumption, proving a simple experience for business users to leverage Machine Learning.", "Note: in you enjoyed this article, you also want to check out this companion piece \u2014 \u201cSolving Machine Learning\u2019s \u2018Last Mile Problem\u2019 for Operational Decisions\u201d.", "Greger works for IBM and is based in France.
