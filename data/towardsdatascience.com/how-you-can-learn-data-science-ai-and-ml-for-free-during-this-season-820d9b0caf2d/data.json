Choosing to be a data scientist, artificial intelligence, or machine learning engineer practically means you are signing up for a life-long learning journey. A lot of people are doing very amazing things with data science, AI and ML but they all started from somewhere. The beginning stages of learning to become a data scientist, AI, or ML engineer are the toughest since it is at this stage that you meet new things you never knew. Consequently, you\u2019ll just come across advanced methods of doing things and if you have a good understanding of the basics, you would easily excel at the advanced stuff. Every cloud has a silver lining, even though we are in very tough times at the moment, one thing we can be happy about is that we can have lots of learning materials and resources for free. Learning to become a data scientist, AI, or ML engineer is naturally very expensive and as we have it for free now, we have to put in maximum effort to utilize all the good things we can get for as long as it lasts. In this story, I am going to share with you some of the many resources and materials you can access freely if you want to learn to be a data scientist, AI, or ML engineer.", "As a student developer, having a GitHub account is very essential.
