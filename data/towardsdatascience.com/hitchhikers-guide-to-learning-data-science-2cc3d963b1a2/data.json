Billions are being invested to hire talented Data Scientists who can build a state of the art deduction machines putting zettabytes of data to use. The revolution can now be witnessed as our lives are changing with increasing reliance on major sectors like retail, entertainment, sports, health care, finance, and language. Data is a very promising driver of all these major sectors if used right which reasons the increasing demand for Data Scientists.", "After discussing the challenges/questions related to learning Data Science with thousands of students and professionals around the world, I am starting this channel to address all those challenges and help each of you define your own path from data to nirvana.", "Here\u2019s a very famous but slightly misleading Venn Diagram that explains data science to be a mix of Mathematics, hacking skills, and substantive expertise.", "Your end goal as a DS is to provide the executives with the guiding light to make more informed decisions and create as much impact as possible by solving real-data problems.", "2. For many problems, data needs to be hunted from different sources and beaten down to a shape that is easier to work with. Writing complex SQL queries to extract data, manipulating CSVs and text files using python or R scripts, understanding vectorized operations and coding algorithms; these make you a good data hacker.", "3. All machine learning algorithms are based on mathematics and statistics. Hacking skills with enough Math and Stats knowledge will make you a good machine learning practitioner but not a data scientist. Science talks about answering motivational questions that lead to discovery.", "Hence, a Data Scientist must focus on 3 major subjects, Domain knowledge, underlying mathematical and statistical principles and data programming/hacking skills.", "Data Science is a vast learning space and there are various designations and departments a data scientist works in at an organisation. For example, Google hires its data scientists for Engineering, Customer Solutions, Operations, Google Maps, and others. And each of them need not be good in all the 3 domains that we talked about. This is where there is a gap between what we talk about data science is and what is actually required in the industry.", "Here is the data science skills pyramid to understand data science at a more granular level. You need to cover at least 3-4 levels of knowledge in order to get hired by a company not necessarily as a data scientist but as an analyst. Then as you reach towards the top of the pyramid, you\u2019re called Research Scientist, Data Scientist Core who are assisted by Machine Learning Engineers.", "Note: The point is there are a bunch of job descriptions that you can aim at from the data science domain.", "A python-based data science course/program/book requires you to have some familiarity with python programming and mathematical aptitude. I\u2019ll cover basic python programming and concepts that will turn out to be handy while manipulating data.", "So, all you need to master data science is the disposition to learn, an inquisitive mind, and a well-defined and guided path.", "I believe there are 4 major branches of data science curriculum that contribute to building a rockstar data scientist. Here\u2019s the list in order:-", "Once you get a path to follow, the next important question that pops up is what are your learning goals, for instance, one of my mentees has spent 20 years of their life in finance and now they want to learn Data Analysis as it would help her grow in her position and also be able to look out for other opportunities. You may be one of the following:", "Now, depending upon which category you are, you\u2019ll have to figure out your strengths and your weaknesses. For example, a software engineer's strength lies in programming but not necessarily in mathematical modeling, a statistician might find herself struggling with python or R.", "Once you\u2019ve figured out the major areas of focus from your weaknesses for yourself, then you\u2019ll simply need to devote more time to the branch(from the curriculum) you\u2019re weak in while working on your strengths as well.", "Your learning goal will give you the direction but to be able to keep moving is where people back down by excusing themselves.", "Q: Motivation is the key issue here.", "A well thought out study plan can help you meet your goals. But what is a good study plan? A regime that encourages your brain to learn more. Building/working on a real-world problem gives your mind context and clarity which in turn keeps you interested to uncover the hidden patterns along with clearly defined next steps that keep you protected from getting lost.", "Ans: Keep your learning process project/problem driven. Work on real-world problems of different complexities and move your way up as you learn new concepts and techniques.", "Q: What kind of projects should one do?", "Ans: If you\u2019re not someone who wants to stay in their domain of expertise, you should work on a mix of projects picked up from different industries namely, healthcare, finance, ecommerce, bioinformatics, travel and tourism, manufacturing, etc.", "Q: How much time does it take to learn data science?", "Ans: It depends individually but on an average 3\u20134 months to cover all the topics along with their implementation in 6\u20138 projects given that you\u2019re investing 2 hours daily.", "Q: What are some good resources to learn data science?", "2. Use the official documentation of libraries like Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Keras, and Tensorflow.", "3. For mathematics or statistics, you can use the book: https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf", "4. For projects, start practicing on Kaggle.Note: I\u2019ll write another article on resources.", "The only problem with the entire plan is that there are many topics to cover and a lot many places to look for. So, here comes my attempt to provide you the best of all resources in one place, my YouTube channel called:", "With this channel, I am planning to roll out a couple of series on the aforementioned hierarchy of the data science requirements. Here is why you should be subscribing to the channel:", "Subscribe to my YouTube Channel, first video releasing on 23rd March:", "You can connect with me on LinkedIn, Twitter or Instagram(where I talk about health and wellness.)", "Note: During these dark times, self-isolation has made some room for self-improvement which we can utilize to develop new skills, hobbies, and help our future-self who learns from Pandemics like COVID-19.", "Your home for data science.
