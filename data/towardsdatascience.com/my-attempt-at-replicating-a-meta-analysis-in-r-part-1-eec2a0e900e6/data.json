For example, I might want to know, without trawling through hundreds of studies, whether how effective a specific type of psychotherapy is for a particular psychiatric condition. Meta-analyses are great for providing a summary of this information. I then figured, well, how can we do these analyses in R and render a fancy looking forest plot.", "I\u2019ve chosen the forest plot below from a recent meta-analysis published by Blanck et al. (2018). Interestingly, they examined the effect of stand-alone mindfulness exercises (SAMs) on depressive and anxiety symptoms rather than a therapeutic modality incorporating mindfulness. There\u2019s been a substantial amount of interest in mindfulness-based interventions in the treatment of psychopathology and in generally for supporting positive well-being. Just simply google mindfulness research decades for images and you\u2019ll find some notable charts showing significant growth in scientific studies published on mindfulness.", "Nonetheless, here\u2019s the published forest plot from that study, respectively, measuring effect on anxiety and depressive symptoms. The forest plot is a nice way to summarise estimated results from multiple independent studies. In this example, we can see that standalone mindfulness exercises have a significant effect on anxiety and depressive symptoms when compared to controls.", "Not being a statistician, by trade, compels me to figure out the basics of any statistical technique. Basics first right?", "So, a meta-analysis is a statistical method for combining the results of a specified outcome from multiple scientific studies. The aim is to estimate the overall effect within a particular area of research. Essentially, the quantitative results from a meta-analysis is used to summarise a body of research (Egger & Smith, 1997). For example, there may be multiple independent studies undertaken on the effectiveness of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for depression. A meta-analysis could be completed to provide a quantitative review to consolidate the outcomes of CBT. The studies could be summarised by the outcome measures used.", "I\u2019m going to use the meta-analysis published by Blanck et al. (2018) to practice how to replicate a meta-analysis\u00a0in\u00a0R. Plus, it was an interesting review on mindfulness-based exercises. Here\u2019s the list of included studies that were used in the meta-analysis on anxiety symptoms (all studies are listed in the reference list):", "It\u2019s tedious but I went through all 14 studies included for the summary on anxiety symptoms and recorded the necessary statistics (e.g. mean pretest and posttest scores, group sample sizes, standard deviations) in Excel. Here\u2019s the data set from Excel that contains both all 14 studies with the Hedge\u2019s g statistic reported from Blanck et al. (2018) with the studies\u2019 reported treatment group and control group mean scores and standard deviations.", "Great. So we have the data stored and ready for further analysis but now we need to use those statistics to calculate the effect size. Luckily, Blanck et al. (2018) have provided the equation in their paper on how they estimate Cohen\u2019s d and Hedge\u2019s h. Makes my life a lot easier!", "We could use a standard function to calculate the effect size, for example, esc_mean_gain() from the esc package. I might compare the differences in the estimates later on using a user-defined function and a package provided function.", "Time to create a function for both the Cohen\u2019s d equation and Hedge\u2019s g equations in Blanck et al. (2018). Both of these equations are used to estimate the controlled pre/post effect size. First off, I\u2019m going to define a function that will take those parameters of the equation and calculate an Cohen\u2019s d. Also, I\u2019m going to define a separate function that will convert Cohen\u2019s d to Hedge\u2019s g. Respectively, we\u2019ll call the function cohen_d_calc() and convert_d_g(). For reference, here is the equation for calculating the pre/post controlled effect size (Blanck et al., 2018):", "where \u03941 refers to the difference between the pre- and post-treatment mean score/value and \u03942 refers to the difference between the post- and post-control mean score/value. S1 and S2 refers, respectively, to the standard deviations of the treatment and control post scores. n1 and n2 refers to the sample size of, respectively, the treatment and control groups for complete pre/post observations.", "There are slight variations of the above equation reported in Morris (2008) (see equations [8\u201310]) and Lakens (2013) (see equation [1]). The mathematical interpretation of these equations is far beyond my knowledge so I\u2019m going to stay clear of that.", "The equation for converting Cohen\u2019s d into Hedge\u2019s g is described below:", "where d is the estimated pre/post controlled effect size according to Cohen\u2019s d and df refers to the degrees of freedom. Let\u2019s now put this into functions in R so that we can estimate the effect sizes accordingly for each study later on.", "We have these equations in the form of functions but does it actually work? Let\u2019s test it out on the first study reported in the forest plot for anxiety symptoms, i.e. Call et al. (2014).", "Okay, this is looking promising as the Hedge\u2019s g value I\u2019ve calculated is the same as the one published by Call et al. (2014). The real test will be to apply this function to the remaining studies.", "The above code isn\u2019t exactly clean but I really wanted to see if I could start off a meta-analysis especially with no experience in previously conducting one. In Part 2 of this post, I\u2019ll describe how I managed to replicate the published forest plot in Blanck et al.
