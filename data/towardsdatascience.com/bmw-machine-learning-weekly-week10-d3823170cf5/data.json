Trackers implanted in the cows\u2019 bodies use low-energy Bluetooth to ping a nearby base station and transfer information about the cows\u2019 chewing frequency, temperature, and general rambling around the farm. For now, they are just going about their normal lives, unintentionally providing data to train an artificial neural network. The hope is that in the near future, this AI will help farmers figure out quickly and easily how well cows and other livestock are eating, whether they are getting sick or about to give birth \u2014 things that are typically done today just by watching and waiting but are difficult to spot when you have got hundreds or thousands of animals to keep an eye on. Livestock Labs claims that the implanted EmbediVet is less annoying to the cow than a wearable and, potentially, a more powerful way to collect useful data and spot bovine behavior patterns over time. Livestock Labs CEO Tim Cannon never set out to make what is, in essence, an embedded Fitbit for cows. What he really wanted was to use the same technology to reengineer himself, and anyone else who wanted to do likewise.", "AI startup Gamalon developed a clever new way for chatbots and virtual assistants to converse with us. Taking the approach to have AI embrace uncertainty and ambiguity, Gamalon may paradoxically help make future virtual assistants less confused. Their approach lets a computer hold a more meaningful and coherent conversation by providing a way to deal with the multiple meanings that an utterance might convey. If a person says or types something ambiguous, the system makes a judgement about what was most likely meant. Whereas today\u2019s virtual assistants and chatbots typically follow simple rules in order to respond to questions, Gamalon\u2019s approach adds a probabilistic technique to statistical ML, synthesizing programs that handle probabilities automatically. In practice, this means the system can deal with uncertainty by making its best guess about what someone means. The approach lets a machine learn from a smaller amount of data and reduces the rate of errors. Another ML advancement concerning chatbots is the research from Cornell University, Google Jigsaw, and Wikimedia, who developed a software that is helping computers to spot arguments online before they happen.", "DeepMind, a UK company owned by Alphabet, created a neural network that mimics the grid cells found in human brains that help us know where we are. Researchers at DeepMind set out to train an artificial neural network to mimic path integration, a method animals use to calculate their movement through a space. The team found that the neural network developed something similar to the \u201cgrid cells\u201d found in a biological brain. These cells, arranged in a triangular grid, seem to provide a way for an animal to position itself in physical space. They then used the trained network to navigate through unfamiliar mazes by adding reinforcement learning to their approach. They found that the newly trained network could navigate far more effectively than any previous AI system, and that it explored its space more like a real animal.", "BMW in the news: Business Insider reported that BMW, GM, Renault, and Ford have struck an agreement to form the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI), a consortium that will explore the use of blockchain technologies in the automotive and mobility industries. Blockchain is a mathematical structure for storing data in a way that is nearly impossible to fake. It can be used for all kinds of valuable data. Apparently MOBI aims to craft common standards and application programming interfaces (APIs) in addition to exploring blockchain use cases. Though the companies did not specify any use cases they planned to explore, there are several possibilities they could pursue. Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger, and early returns suggest that it is well suited for transferring money and information securely between two or more parties, which is a relatively common practice in the industry today.", "Your home for data science.
