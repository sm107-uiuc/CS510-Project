Fortunately, there are a number of ways, including Jupyter Notebook extensions, to improve this invaluable tool.", "Run the following in a command prompt:", "Start up a Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the new Nbextensions tab:", "Enable the extensions you want and enjoy the productivity benefits.", "(If you don\u2019t see a tab, open a notebook and click Edit > nbextensions config)", "The enabled extensions can be seen in the toolbar in a notebook:", "If that isn\u2019t satisfying enough for you, below are some details about Jupyter notebook extensions. I\u2019ve also included my top 5 to get you started.", "Jupyter Notebook extensions are simple add-ons that extend the basic functionality of the notebook environment. Written in JavaScript, they do things like autoformat your code or send a browser notification when a cell has completed. Extensions currently only work in Jupyter Notebooks (not Jupyter Lab).", "Why use these extensions? Jupyter Notebooks are great tools for teaching, learning, prototyping, exploring, and trying out new methods (or even in production at Netflix). However, vanilla notebooks are limited in features which can make working in them frustrating. While Jupyter Notebook extensions don\u2019t completely solve the problem, they do add a few benefits that will make your work easier.", "Following are the 5 Jupyter Notebook extensions I use most often:", "Once you start getting dozens of cells in one Jupyter Notebook, it can be difficult to keep track of them all. The Table of Contents solves that problem by adding a linked TOC that can be positioned anywhere on the page:", "You can also use the extension to add a linked table of contents at the top of the notebook. This even shows which cell is selected and which is running:", "We should all write pep8 compliant code, but sometimes you get caught up in an analysis and it\u2019s hard to stick to best practices. When you\u2019re done writing that amazing plot, this extension allows you to simply click the gavel and automatically format your messy code.", "Like the best add-ons, this one accomplishes a time-consuming and tedious task with a simple click, enabling you to focus on thinking through problems.", "The variable inspector shows the names of all variables you\u2019ve created in the notebook, along with their type, size, shape, and value.", "This tool is invaluable for data scientists migrating from RStudio or if you don\u2019t want to have to keep printing df.shape or can\u2019t recall the type of x.", "I often find myself trying to figure out how long a cell took to run or when I last ran a notebook that has been open for days. ExecuteTime takes care of both of those by showing when a cell finished and how long it took.", "There are better methods for timing (such as the %%timeit cell magic) but this is easy to implement and covers all cells in the notebook.", "Although some of us like to see the hard work that goes into an analysis, some people just like to see the results. The Hide input all extension allows you to instantly hide all the code in the notebook while keeping outputs.", "The next time someone says they just want to see the results, you have a single click solution. (Although you should always examine the code).", "These are just the extensions I find myself using the most often and you\u2019re not limited to five. Check out the whole list by installing the extensions and opening a notebook (the notebook shown here is on GitHub)! (If you are up for it, you can even write your own extension. Documentation is pretty scarce, but here\u2019s the basic structure.)", "Install the Jupyter Notebook extensions, spend some time figuring out which ones are useful to you, and improve your productivity. While none of these are life-changing, they all add just enough benefit to be worthwhile, cumulatively saving you hours of valuable development time.", "Although you\u2019ll probably want to put some time into learning an IDE if you are writing production code (I\u2019m liking VS Code), Jupyter Notebooks are still an integral part of a data science workflow. If you are going to be using this environment, you might as well get the most from your tools.", "As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.
