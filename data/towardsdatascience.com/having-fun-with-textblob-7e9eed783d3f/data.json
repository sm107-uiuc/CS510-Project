Later when we need it, we load a parquet object from the file path, returning a pandas Data Frame.", "The following process gives us two data tables, user and review.", "We merge user table and review table, use suffix to deal with the same column names, and remove zero stars.", "Good to know that most of the reviews star ratings are pretty high, and not many terrible reviews.

Apparently, some polarity does not agree with its associate rating. Why is that?", "After digging a bit more, it turns out, TextBlob goes along finding words and phrases it can assign polarity and subjectivity to, and it averages them all together for longer text, such as our Yelp reviews.", "Want to learn how TextBlob calculates polarity and subjectivity, this article from Aaron Schumacher has given a simple yet clear explanation.", "I enjoyed learning and playing with TextBlob. I realized that TextBlob can be used to accomplish many other NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, classification, translation, and more, and we will get our hands dirty on them later.", "Jupyter notebook can be found on Github.
