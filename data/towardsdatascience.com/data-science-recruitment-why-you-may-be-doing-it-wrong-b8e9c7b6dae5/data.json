Since then, I have had the pleasure of sitting in the other chair, interviewing about 20 candidates for a data-science (DS) position.", "As a recruiter, I can't stress how important it is to use the right tools when interviewing candidates. Some examples come to mind, you shouldn't ask nitty-gritty statistical questions when your primary focus is machine-learning (ML), deep-learning (DL) or vice versa, you shouldn\u2019t ask your candidates to \u2018program\u2019 on a piece of paper when you expect them to work in a notebook or an IDE and you shouldn't ask a potential manager to do probability riddles when you are interviewing for a managing position.", "What I\u2019m trying to communicate is that one size doesn't fit all! People come from different academic backgrounds and experiences. It's important to be prepared for a wide range of profiles. Otherwise, by using bad tools you will overlook really good candidates. The following are common mistakes that several of my colleagues and I have personally experienced.", "I didn\u2019t believe that the following practices are still happening, there is little excuse to use the wrong tools during an interview process, especially when it doesn\u2019t contribute to what you are trying to achieve.", "Being fixed on a single trait and missing out on a whole range of others is something to look out for when you are starting a new recruiting process.

However, these worked well for me and may provide a baseline for when you are recruiting new scientists or practitioners.", "After carefully going over their CV or Resume and finding topics for conversation, we\u2019ll do the following:", "Hopefully, I have helped you focus your efforts on the right choices for your next recruitment.
