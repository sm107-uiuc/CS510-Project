Your friends talk about the latest \u2018interactive dashboards\u2019 they produce for their colleagues, but it sounds like a lot of work, and would probably just confuse your clients anyway.", "This article is not a tutorial to teach you anything in-depth about building dashboards. It takes you through building and deploying the simplest possible dashboard based on a Jupyter notebook, but only to expose you to the concept. By the end of the article, you\u2019ll know what your dashboard friends are talking about and you\u2019ll be in a better position to decide if interactive dashboards are something you want to pursue further.", "I\u2019ll talk through the choices for hosting dashboards, and also give an overview of the popular dashboarding frameworks.", "Business Intelligence tools have long been used to create charts based on internal company data. Think Google Analytics reports, maybe used by a marketing department to understand the effectiveness of their campaigns and direct their future efforts.", "These dashboards are ingrained into monolithic BI software suites, usually put together using a drag-and-drop interface.", "As a data scientist or quantitative developer, you analyze a different set of data in Jupyter, and you don\u2019t have any similar tools to build dashboards around your data. It sounds like you\u2019d need to build an entire web app including front-end Javascript to introduce something like that.", "Over the last few years, some great open source frameworks have appeared. They allow you to easily turn your Python (or R etc) analyses into interactive web apps without having to think about the front-end at all. Your language of choice is all you need to instruct the framework to take care of the user interface for you.", "These frameworks will introduce widgets (sliders, checkboxes, drop-downs etc) for the end-user to input parameters, and they may also provide interactive graph or table functionality \u2014 being able to zoom into your charts, or select data ranges that update the graphics in related chart components.", "I\u2019ll talk a bit more about the available frameworks later, but first I\u2019ll describe the kind of dataviz scenarios that already have you thinking that there must be a better way.", "When you\u2019re working on a Jupyter notebook, it makes sense for you to update parameters yourself while you\u2019re trying things out.", "Here\u2019s your first attempt at a graph:", "In the second cell, you\u2019ve manually entered t=1.0. You copy the graph into an email, and then your client comes back and asks what would happen if you change t to 2.0.", "So you change the cell and run again.", "That\u2019s no big deal a couple of times, and is very easy if the client is in the room with you. But at some point, it might make sense to take a step back and see if you can automate this process. We\u2019re assuming that you\u2019re not going to ask your non-technical client to shift+enter through the notebook themselves of course.", "I promised this wouldn\u2019t be an in-depth tutorial of a visualization framework, so I\u2019ll pick the easiest possible way to turn our notebook into something interactive.", "In the first instance, we\u2019ll add a widget to the notebook itself, so you get to slide a slider in Jupyter (just instead of updating the t parameter in the code cell).", "That\u2019s still not user-friendly enough for our non-technical client though, who won\u2019t want to see the code cells. So the next step will be to run the notebook in something called the \u2018voila\u2019 server instead of in the Jupyter server. It\u2019s very similar to the Jupyter server, but instead of letting the user shift+enter through the code cells, it hides the code cells and just runs everything from top to bottom \u2014 showing only the output components, including our slider widget.", "Jupyter has an important extension package called ipywidgets. You might need to install that first (run !pip install ipywidgets in a Jupyter cell, then restart and reload the notebook).", "Then all we need to do is refactor our graph-drawing code cell into a function, and apply the \u2018interact\u2019 decorator:", "The \u2018interact\u2019 function automatically detects that our function has a float argument (t) and provides a slider automatically. You can slide the slider and immediately see the different graphs based on the new input of t.", "Great! Next, we\u2019ll make this fully user-friendly.", "Install the Voila python package withpip install voila or similar for Conda. You\u2019ll need to restart your Jupyter server to pick this up. When you reload the notebook page, you\u2019ll now have a Voila button in the toolbar:", "Click that and you\u2019ll jump to a new page showing the Voila preview:", "As promised, the code cells are hidden, so all we\u2019re left with is the interactive component. Add a few markdown cells as an introduction \u2014 and maybe change the default Voila template \u2014 then you have a fully functioning web app!", "The Voila preview that we\u2019ve seen so far is a useful extension to jump straight into our new dashboard, but it\u2019s piggy-backing on the Jupyter server, and anyone who has access to the Voila preview would be able to change the URL and get back to the notebook view.", "So to run our notebook safely, we can use the voila server directly, where previously we used the Jupyter server.", "Where you ran jupyter notebook to run Jupyter before, stop that with Ctrl+C, and instead run voila ./Dashboard.ipynb (or provide the correct path to your notebook file).", "This time you can see our dashboard is at the root (and only) URL of this voila-only server:", "Exciting! You can already imagine your clients and colleagues believing you\u2019ve turned into a full-stack web developer overnight. So how do you share your web app with your non-technical audience?", "Unfortunately, this is where you may face a hurdle. To be clear, there is nothing particularly complicated technically about hosting Voila (or similar) dashboards. But one way or another you (or someone close to you) will have to maintain or buy some form of hosting service.", "In some services there are free options for dashboards that can be public, or for low-usage tiers.", "If your organization is already running a JupyterHub (or wants to) then my own ContainDS Dashboards project will allow you to automatically host your dashboards within your JupyterHub, available securely to authenticated users.", "In general, there are two important aspects to consider:", "Let\u2019s assume we are still using Voila to run our dashboard \u2014 but most of the advice about hosting applies to any of the open source frameworks.", "You can of course just run the voila server on any VM or physical server you happen to have.", "This could be on cloud services such as AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, or Azure. Generally, the big cloud providers will require you to configure your own server, and certainly by the time you\u2019ve added HTTPS certificates you\u2019ll need to run your dashboard server behind a standard web server like nginx or apache \u2014 i.e. web traffic reaches nginx and then reverse proxies to the voila server.", "Heroku and Google App Engine make things a bit easier as everything is configuration-based, and HTTPS is generally a default.", "However, authentication is a huge problem. How do you ensure that only your intended users can access the dashboard? Your web server can be configured with a password, and maybe even a list of allowed username/passwords, but this is cumbersome to update.", "Again, none of this is technically difficult, but it requires details that you might want your IT department to manage in the longer term, especially for anything sensitive.", "Also in the \u2018do it yourself\u2019 category is just running the voila server on your own computer, as you did for your own trials, and open up a \u2018tunnel\u2019 for your user. Again, authentication is missing, and you\u2019ll need to keep your laptop open! For a quick share of non-sensitive data this could still be useful \u2014 see the ngrok section of the Voila docs.", "Where it\u2019s OK for your dashboard to be public, there is a free service called MyBinder.org that will launch a Jupyter notebook (plus access to Voila via its own URL) based on the contents of a Git repo. This requires you to update the Git repo of course, and takes a while for the environment to build the first time it starts after a new commit. You can send your client a direct link that will start things up and then jump straight to the Voila URL \u2014 but the Jupyter server will also be running at a different URL if they know how to enter it, just as when we were trying out the Voila preview earlier. MyBinder is essentially a public and open deployment of the open source JupyterHub project (a website that provides Jupyter notebook environments to multiple users).", "Especially if your organization is already running its own JupyterHub, my own ContainDS Dashboards extension fits in neatly. Since a JupyterHub is already running (for regular Jupyter notebook servers), no extra infrastructure is required at all. JupyterHub has highly configurable authentication modules, so for example you can require login through your corporate email single sign-on.", "ContainDS Dashboards adds an extra \u2018Dashboards\u2019 menu to JupyterHub. You simply specify the path to your notebook or script and select which framework you are using (e.g. \u2018voila\u2019, \u2018streamlit\u2019, etc as discussed later). Straight away, any user authenticated into your JupyterHub can access your dashboard.", "If your organization is not currently running a JupyterHub then it\u2019s easy enough to start one, and it is popular enough that help is available for a range of different installation scenarios.", "The easiest way to deploy a dashboard, without any infrastructure of your own, is through a managed service. These are generally tied to particular frameworks.", "If you\u2019re using the R Shiny framework for your dashboards (described later), then the shinyapps.io cloud service is an easy choice for a one-off deployment. Once you\u2019ve configured an access token in your R environment, you only have to run deployApp() to automatically upload your app.", "On the free and basic plans, dashboards are public. For Standard plans and above ($99 per month or higher), authentication is included. On the shinyapps.io site you can enter email addresses to invite to your app. They can login with GitHub or Google single sign-on or just set up a shinyapps account based on that email address.", "A similar service exists for the Plotly Dash framework (R or Python). Dash Enterprise allows you to connect a Git repo so commits are automatically deployed to this cloud service. They have a wider range of authentication methods, again including basic email login.", "Streamlit (a Python framework) is also working on a Teams product.", "Most of these managed services are \u2018tribal\u2019 \u2014 only catering for the framework they\u2019ve been built around. But they definitely take care of the hosting and authentication!", "A new service called Datapane attempts to be framework agnostic, although requires you to add some extra deployment Python code directly to your script. Published reports appear within Datapane\u2019s own-style web interface, and generally the end-user needs to understand that they have to run the report. They don\u2019t appear to launch straight into it as they do for Voila. It\u2019s worth a look for regular sharing within teams.", "Another component of my own ContainDS suite is the Desktop product. This is a desktop app that both you and your client can install locally. You can then export your entire Jupyter environment as a single flat file to send to your client who can import it and see it running through Voila as intended.", "This is useful for very sensitive situations, or where you don\u2019t want to involve servers at all. However, both parties need to be running Docker or VirtualBox, so there is some overhead to get started\u2026", "The principle is that this is much more reliable than trying to get your client to install Conda and Python environments!", "You might have noticed that the \u2018Sharing Your Dashboard\u2019 section wasn\u2019t entirely conclusive. Deployment is still a painful problem \u2014 again, not technically insurmountable, but it always needs infrastructure in place.", "Sorry if this destroyed your original excitement about building your own dashboards! But I think it\u2019s important to tell you the truth\u2026", "If you still believe that dashboards could transform your data story-telling abilities, here is a brief overview of some popular open source dashboarding frameworks.", "I think they can be roughly broken down by: language(s) supported; visualization features; and ease-of-use versus UI control.", "Streamlit is an interesting new framework based on simple Python declarative scripting. It\u2019s easy to create great-looking web apps using widgets (e.g. sliders and dropdowns) in a Python script that makes intuitive sense to the developer without having to worry about \u2018events\u2019 \u2014 how the code should react when something is clicked.", "Whereas other frameworks may require you to think through the user flow yourself and connect up events, Streamlit by default takes care of this logic for you. As long as you\u2019ve declared UI components, when the user interacts with it, Streamlit will take care of re-running the appropriate parts of your script.", "This simplistic paradigm comes back to make some things more complicated of course \u2014 such as having to add caching decorators if too much of your code is being run too often.", "Streamlit scripts must be run through the streamlit run command.", "Plotly Dash is a \u2018full-stack\u2019 framework whereby you can use Python, R, or Julia to control not only the back-end data processing side of things, but also the front-end UI. Compared to Streamlit, you more often have to think through the way the user interface flow will work, connecting events. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, and ultimately gives you more control earlier on.", "Similarly, you have more options for how you can work a Plotly Dash app as a sub-app into a larger application. The underlying server mechanism is more clearly exposed.", "Bokeh grew out of Anaconda Inc (the virtual environment company) and is supported by the NumFOCUS non-profit which also supports Jupyter and many other scientific computing packages such as NumPy.", "It is a Python framework, and its strength is in really detailed control of interactive graphs.", "As a direct comparison, most people say they find Plotly Dash easier to get started and ultimately provides a similar level of control. But Bokeh can dive a bit deeper into more complex visualizations.", "There is a highly extensive range of open source components that sit on top of Bokeh.", "Panel is sometimes seen as a separate visualization framework, but originally at least, it extended Bokeh. It provides a more flexible widget system, not just focusing on graphics. And it has a design goal of being able to run almost identically in a Jupyter notebook as it can as a standalone app.", "Panel allows you to easily incorporate other open-source visualization components into your app. It is itself part of the wider HoloViz effort to simplify data visualization in Python.", "The kind of thing that sets Panel and HoloViz apart is the ability to connect multiple graphs together, so that interacting with one (e.g. selecting a range of points) updates the other graphs in a corresponding way.", "There are academic fields that have specialized ecosystems built around HoloViews, e.g. Geographic; and toolsets for dealing with visualizations of large datasets.", "My feeling is that if you have an unusual or detailed type of visualization, it is more likely to be possible to achieve with the Bokeh / HoloViz stack than other frameworks.", "If you\u2019re an enthusiast of the R language you\u2019ll already know about the Shiny framework for interactive apps\u2026 and if you\u2019re firmly a Pythonista you\u2019re not about to switch now!", "Shiny user interfaces can be built entirely using R, or can be written directly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for more flexibility.", "If you\u2019re only building a dashboard, and R is perfect for your analysis, Shiny should be perfect for your UI too. But it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that if your code is going to develop into a larger web app in the future, you may end up missing the database and general software engineering power brought by a more general-purpose language like Python.", "Shiny is part of a powerful suite of data scientists\u2019 tools brought to you by RStudio.", "Note that Voila of course supports R notebooks. If you have a simple Jupyter notebook written in R then Voila may be the quickest way to make it interactive.", "We already demonstrated Voil\u00e0 earlier. Its strength is being \u2018Jupyter native\u2019. Any languages supported by Jupyter can work with Voil\u00e0 too. The interactive widgets provided natively are basic, but this is an easy way to go from notebook to web app.", "You don\u2019t need to be limited to Jupyter\u2019s widgets either. It is entirely possible to build a notebook using Panel components, and this can be deployed through Voil\u00e0 (as well as Bokeh/Panel directly).", "To understand how ipywidgets works, here is an excellent tutorial.", "Maybe your clients only ever wanted a PDF anyway. It doesn\u2019t always make sense to turn your analysis into an interactive dashboard, but hopefully I\u2019ve given you some ideas to help you recognize when the back-and-forth email exchanges with your customers could move up a level.", "The fun part, for a data scientist or analyst, is undoubtedly in using the frameworks to build a satisfying user interface. I hope the overview of the open source frameworks will help you find a suitable framework to try out.", "Hosting and authentication is often a sticking point, though. I\u2019ve given you an overview of the challenges there to save you investing time in learning a dashboarding framework only to realize that you don\u2019t have the resources or mandate to get your dashboard into the hands of your clients or colleagues.", "Entrepreneur building tools for data scientists: containds.com"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
