Every investor\u2019s appetite for risk is unique, the objective of this article is to inform (not advice) on your investment strategy.", "\u201cHuman nature hasn\u2019t changed a lot in 25,000 years. Something will come out of left field, and the market will go down, or the market will go up. Volatility will occur and markets will continue to have these ups and downs \u2014 I think that\u2019s a great opportunity, if people can understand what they own\u201d.", "\u2014 Peter Lynch on making a 600% return on investment in Taco Bell within 6 years.", "The tech bubble is popping, the markets have started to decline and I can confidently say that it is not in the way anyone thought they would. After fearing that astronomical startup valuations would bring down the startup economy, a global pandemic is threatening to do that instead. Layoffs are accelerating, stock prices are plummeting and there is uncertainty within the general population. These are desperate times for the economy, however, it is during such times where the opportunity lies. The question is, what are you going to do about it?", "My background is in Engineering, and even though I may be good with numbers it took me a course in Finance Analytics to appreciate how fundamental and important financial literacy is. As I thought of investing in the market, primarily in ETFs (because essentially I wanted to mimic the market and grow my investment along with it), news about COVID-19 broke out. Everyone suddenly started staying at home streaming, searching for thermometers, masks and toilet paper.", "Upon doing my research, talking to fellow investors and binging on YouTube videos, I realized that this might perhaps be an opportunity that does not come too often. While the news is flooded with predictions on what stocks to watch out for, and the reasoning may be valid, as a beginner investor it is impossible to try and predict what will happen in the short term. Therefore, I decided to focus on long term value investing. Logically I narrowed my focus to the companies in the S&P. (This stock market index measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.) The rationale behind investing in such companies is because they are unlikely to go anywhere. They are fundamental to the economy and the government would ideally bail them out if the situation arose.", "For my analysis, I used the following Wikipedia page* to gather all the stock names and its symbols.", "*Note: 502 company names were collected from the Wikipedia page", "The first thing that I analyzed was how many industries made up the S&P portfolio index and their respective representation.", "Using Yahoo Fiance\u2019s API, the corresponding ticker symbols were used to ingest the daily stock prices from the 1st of December, 2019 to the current date. There wasn\u2019t any specific reason to choose the specified date, the idea was to capture enough historical data to understand what was happening before the crash. January and early February 2020 was one of the best phases for the stock market. When analysing returns, I wanted to make sure I try my best to capture market volatility.", "The Adjusted Closing price of each stock was used to calculate the daily returns for that stock. This price accurately reflects the stock value after dividends and is considered to be the true price of the stock. A financial return, simply put is the money made or lost on an investment over a specific time period.", "Key things to note about returns:", "Upon calculating the returns for each day, I decided to check the frequency on days which recorded the lowest returns for stocks.", "It is not surprising that March 2020 has the most number of drops. Half of the companies experienced their lowest return on 16th March 2020. Out of curiosity, I decided to find out the news headlines from on the day.", "This exercise was a good way to check the calculations and the output of the analysis. The data helped reinforce that COVID-19 did affect almost all of the underlying assets in the S&P index.", "The main driver of this analysis was to identify the latent opportunity in the Bear market. As an investor, I wanted the information to steer me in the right direction. The data should be able to provide answers to questions such as,", "The Adjusted Close daily prices were analysed for each stock. Instead of looking at the change from the highest to the lowest price, I decided to look at the difference between the 3rd Quartile value of the stock to its lowest value. By calculating it in this way, the estimated discount is more conservative.", "In the corresponding box plot of Adjusted Close prices, the 3rd Quartile value of Google\u2019s stock price is $ 1447.07 and it falls to a minimum of $ 1056.52", "By applying the formula mentioned above, Google is currently trading at a discount of 26.9%", "A similar exercise was carried out for the rest of the stocks and their discounted prices were calculated.", "As seen from the Figure above, the Energy sector on average has the highest discounted stocks of about 66% whereas Consumer Staples stocks have only gone down by 28% in comparison. This information aligns with the behaviour in the current market.", "Given below are the top 3 discounted stocks from each sector. They highlight which companies withing their respective industry are trading currently at massive discounts.", "With every opportunity, there is some level of risk involved with it. One of the biggest challenges in finance is to be able to accurately quantify this risk. For this article, volatility within the returns of each stock was used as a measure of risk.", "The standard deviation for the returns in Amazon (ticker: AMZN) is 0.0252 which means that the daily change in Amazon stock price will vary by 2.5%", "The standard deviation for the returns in Boeing Airlines (ticker: BA) is 0.0696 which means that the daily change in its stock price will vary by approximately 7 %", "From the graphs above it can be seen that the variability in Amazon is lower than that of Boeing, implying that Amazon is a less risker investment option.", "Similar to the trend in discounts, it can be seen that at-risk industries such as Energy and Consumer Discretionary have high volatility whereas the volatility in Consumer Staples and Health Care is lower. The Energy sector on average has a variation of 6.38% and Consumer Staples, on the other hand, has an average variation of 3.36%", "It is interesting to note that there is a high correlation between discounts and risk. The sectors at a massive discount (i.e. Energy) is also having a higher risk. The objective of this analysis is to look at these highly discounted stocks and pick the ones with lower risk.", "From the figure above, it can be seen that giants such as Amazon, Verizon and Charter Communications make up the stocks which are the most stable. This further reinforces the understanding of the market, that such businesses have a solid business model and a strong legacy to keep driving through this volatile period.", "As I approach towards the end of the article, given below are a few key learnings I have picked up as a part of the research and I would like to summarize them for your benefit.", "Note: The complete list of companies along with their discount, risk and current price is provided in an excel sheet for your own reference here.", "My area of expertise and background is in the Information Technology and Communication Services industry. So I decided to limit my focus on these sectors. From the analysis above, I intuitively know that both these sectors are not heavily discounted and therefore comparatively less volatile.", "From the table above, it can be seen that Communication Services on average are discounted higher and less volatile than Information Technology. I decided to give equal weights to discount and risk when trying to identify stocks that provide a great opportunity to invest in at this current time. Using the desired weights, I came up with a score to rank these stocks by and given below is the output of this custom scoring.", "The figure shows the opportunity vs the risk of each of the potential stocks from both the sectors. The size of the bubble is the relative share price of the stock. Based on the scoring metric, these were the top 5 stocks in each sector. I have personally been following a few of the companies already, but now I would consider the others too during my next investment decision.", "Thank you for reading until the end.
