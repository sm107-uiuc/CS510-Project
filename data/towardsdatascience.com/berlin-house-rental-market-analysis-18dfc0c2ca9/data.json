However, perhaps due to that popularity and other macro-economic shifts, those days became a thing of the past.", "Ask anyone living in Berlin at the moment and they will tell you how difficult it is to get a house rental contract, not only due to the scarcity of offers and plenty of demand for apartments, but also due to the soaring prices, even despite state regulation efforts.", "With the above setting the tone and having found myself in the situation of looking for a new place to live, I decided to use a data-driven approach to help me with my search and give me the confidence of making good decisions based on data. Thus, in this post I\u2019ll describe some of my findings in this process.", "For a period of a few months I collected some data on the market from the website immobilienscout24 for certain areas of Berlin \u2014 some areas were not included as I was not looking to live there. With the data I collected, I was interested in answering several questions to help me in my search, but the main ones were:", "I\u2019ll try to answer these questions in this post, so read on!", "I wanted to see where my budget allowed me to live in and therefore knowing the average asking price for a given area was the first step.", "It\u2019s important to clarify what warm price means: In Germany house prices are usually split in cold and warm prices, which correspond to the price before and after heating costs, as well as upkeep, garbage collection and other maintenance costs. Therefore, the rental cost we\u2019re most interested in is the warm price.", "The bar plot below shows in descending order the most expensive areas in Berlin from this dataset. We can see that somewhat expectedly, the most expensive areas are Mitte, Tiergarten, Friedrichshain, Prenzlauer Berg and Kreuzberg, which are typically more emblematic parts of the city and thus more sought after. On the other end, we have Wedding, Sch\u00f6neberg, Lichtenberg and Treptow, which can be considered somewhat outside the city center and therefore less expensive as expected.", "What is the most popular time to publish a new listing?", "As the market is very competitive and listings disappear very quickly, I was interested in knowing what was the most popular time for new listings to appear, so that I could be more ready to respond fast.", "On the plot below we can see the distribution of times listings were posted on. It was observed that the most popular times to post new listings were in the morning, with a peak just before lunch time (12:00\u201313:00).", "Am I paying a fair price?", "Perhaps the most interesting question of all, I wanted to know if a listing was asking a fair price, so that I could have a base for my decision to apply for an apartment or, even more importantly, to take an offer.", "To accomplish this I built a Linear Regression model to predict the final (warm) price, using as features whether an apartment has a balcony, garden or built-in kitchen, if it is new or recently renovated, if the offer is from a private individual or real estate agency, the total living area, the number of rooms or the district where it is located, among other variables.", "The results are shown below, where the relative strength of the indicators is plotted (both positive and negative) in descending order.", "It can be concluded that the strongest indicators are if an apartment is located in Wedding or Sch\u00f6neberg, which affect negatively the price. Somewhat unsurprisingly, an apartment having a built-in kitchen or garden is strongly correlated with higher prices, but perhaps more surprisingly, the number of rooms has a negative coefficient, meaning that the larger the number of rooms, the lower the final price.", "Even though the coefficient for living space is relatively low compared to the others, one has to take into account that this is a continuous variable with a much higher variation than the boolean variables (which vary between 0 and 1). Therefore, for every unit increase in living area (1 m2), the price is expected to increase around 6 EUR.", "With this model, I became more confident in my decisions and was able to gauge if the asking price of an apartment was fair or not.", "What makes some listings more attractive than others?", "As a bonus, I was also interested in knowing what characteristics of a listing are more important to know if a listing will be attractive or not. For that I used the time a listing stays online as a metric, with the lower the online time the higher the attractiveness and interest.", "To achieve this I ran a Linear Regression model to predict the time a listing stays online, using as features the same ones used in the previous linear model, plus the warm price and the normalised difference between warm and cold prices. The results of the model are shown in the plot below.", "In this case, if a coefficient is positive, then it is associated with more time online, and vice versa. It can be concluded for example that if a listing is a new build (or has been renovated), has more rooms or larger living space, has a balcony or built-in kitchen, or is located in the neighbourhoods Sch\u00f6neberg, Tiergarten, Mitte, Treptow or Kreuzberg, then it stays less time online (receives more interest and goes to someone more quickly). On the other hand, a listing stays longer online if the price difference or warm price is higher, or if it is located in the perhaps less attractive neighbourhoods of Lichtenberg, Wedding or Neuk\u00f6lln. Somewhat surprisingly, a listing having a garden is associated with more time online.", "In this article, we looked into some insights given by analysing a dataset consisting of apartments published online for rent in Berlin. More specifically, we:", "Hope this can help you in your future search for an apartment in Berlin! To see the analysis in more detail check out the Github repo.", "Your home for data science.
