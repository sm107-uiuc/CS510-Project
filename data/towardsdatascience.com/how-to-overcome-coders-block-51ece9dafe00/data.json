Have you ever been staring at your blank screen for hours, unable to jot anything down? Welcome to the club.", "You\u2019re pouring over your computer science assignment as I enter the room. Your desk is covered in scripts and term sheets. Your computer screen is a big black void except for the little white pointer that is blinking in the upper left corner. The whole room seems to be screaming out your desperation.", "\u2018No \u2014 this assignment from my computer science class is driving me nuts. It\u2019s due tomorrow and I haven\u2019t even coded a single line!\u2019", "\u2018How long have you been working on it now?\u2019", "\u2018Okay, time to take a break. Do you want a cup of tea?\u2019", "\u2018You can get back to your assignment after that.\u2019", "You follow me downstairs and I flip the kettle on. Once our tea is poured, we go back up to your room.", "\u2018It\u2019s just \u2014 I understand nothing. I\u2019m sitting there, thinking and thinking, and I just can\u2019t do it.\u2019", "\u2018What\u2019s the problem? Do you understand what you\u2019re expected to do?\u2019", "\u2018In principle, yes. But I don\u2019t have a clue how to tell the computer what it\u2019s supposed to do. How do I even begin with this?\u2019", "\u2018It\u2019s like writer\u2019s block. Sometimes when you write, you\u2019ll be sitting in front of a blank sheet of paper for hours, unable to jot down a single word. At some point, you get scared of the piece of paper because you\u2019ve looked at it for so long.", "\u2018And the same happens with coder\u2019s block. You stare at your console, unable to do anything, until the console scares you.\u2019", "A complex piece of code is made of lots of simple subroutines", "\u2018Let\u2019s take it step by step. We\u2019ll begin by writing a Hello-World-program.\u2019", "\u2018But that\u2019s easy, we did that five weeks ago!\u2019", "\u2018That\u2019s exactly the reason why we\u2019re doing it again. It\u2019s simple, so you won\u2019t get blocked.\u2019", "You open a new text file.", "\u2018Do I have to include some package before printing the Hello-World-message?\u2019", "\u2018You sure do. What kind of object is the Hello-World-message?\u2019", "\u2018A string? Ah, wait! I need to include the string package\u2026 Okay, got it.\u2019", "\u2018Alright, now type the message and execute.\u2019", "\u2018Great! In your assignment you also have to print something on the screen. How about writing that part first?\u2019", "\u2018We\u2019ll do it step by step. What do you need to print?\u2019", "\u2018The values of some variables. But I haven\u2019t calculated them yet. So how can I print them?\u2019", "\u2018You can put in dummy values for now. Just make sure you leave a comment to mark the dummies. This way we\u2019ll remember to replace them by the real value later on.\u2019", "\u2018Let\u2019s check! Execute the program, please.", "\u2018Whoops, the output isn\u2019t as we\u2019d expected. Let\u2019s fix the bugs.\u2019", "\u2018But I can\u2019t see anything wrong in the code!\u2019", "\u2018You did a little typo over there\u2026\u2019", "\u2018Oh damnit! Okay, now it\u2019s working correctly.\u2019", "\u2018Awesome! Now what else do we need to do?\u2019", "\u2018Calculate the value of the variables.\u2019", "Half an hour later, the program is up and running.", "Never forget to do test runs and debug", "\u2018Wow, thank you! You saved my life.\u2019", "\u2018Well, basically you wrote the code all by yourself. I just gave you some guidance. You can delete the Hello-World-program, by the way.\u2019", "\u2018Oh, sure, I forgot about that part. But seriously \u2014 I was sitting there for hours. Then you come in and it\u2019s solved in a few minutes. You\u2019re a genius!\u2019", "\u2018Well, spending hours over a problem is often not the way to go.", "\u2018When I started coding, I was often too shy to ask people for help because I thought I\u2019d seem stupid. So I\u2019d be sitting in front of my screen for hours, unable to solve the problem, getting more and more anxious about it.", "\u2018When I finally went and asked for help, the issue usually turned out to be a little typo or another minor mistake.\u2019", "\u2018So that taught you to ask for help when you\u2019re stuck?\u2019", "\u2018Yes, you should always ask for help. And don\u2019t wait for hours before asking. Try to figure out the problem in a reasonable time. And if that time has passed without a lot of progress, ask.\u2019", "\u2018In my case, I\u2019d figured out the problem but I couldn\u2019t tell the computer what to do.\u2019", "\u2018In that case, do something stupid. Nothing completely senseless, but something very simple \u2014 like a Hello-World-program. You know how to make a computer do things. But a certain level of complexity can be quite intimidating at the start.", "\u2018You can use this simple code to build your program up. Start with the easiest part, then move on to the harder ones.\u2019", "\u2018So the next time I don\u2019t know how to start, I\u2019ll do something really simple \u2014 even if it seems unrelated to the task at hand. And then do the simplest parts of my task first.\u2019", "\u2018Exactly. And if you\u2019ve thought about the problem for hours before writing any code, take a break! Get a cup of tea or coffee, or go for a quick walk. After all, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to be productive after hours of coder\u2019s block.\u2019", "\u2018Oh man, I think I need to put all that on a poster. Thank you so much!\u2019", "\u2018You\u2019re welcome! Let me know if you have problems with your next assignment.\u2019", "Your home for data science.
