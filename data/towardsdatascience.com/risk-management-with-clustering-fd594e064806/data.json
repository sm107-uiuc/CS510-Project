You can find out more here]", "Every portfolio manager is evaluated on their Sharpe ratio which measures the associated risk of their return on investment and is given by the following formula:", "The Sharpe ratio has often been criticised because it assumes that volatility is bad and because of its dimensionless ratio it can sometimes be difficult to interpret.", "In this article, we are going to see how investing in \u201cgood\u201d Sharpe ratios might be a lot riskier than expected. To do this, we will uncover hidden structure using K-Means Clustering.", "We are going to analyse the quarterly US holdings of ~50 institutional investors who have more than $100M in total assets under management. This data is public as they need to file 13F Forms detailing their holdings, to the SEC every quarter. I used Sentieo\u2019s platform to download the data.", "The form details the nature and value of their investments as well as their respective percentage of their portfolio. For the purpose of simplicity, we are only going to consider their total assets under managements and the percentage sizes of their investments. We are also going to extract the following features which can act as a proxy of their investment style:", "We chose these features to see if there was a relationship between the size of the fund and their allocation strategy. An allocation strategy can also be used as a proxy of their aggressiveness.", "If a manager places all their eggs in one basket they will be taking more risks than someone who uses multiple baskets. However, the Sharpe ratio will not pick up on the diversification risk if all the eggs are of a good quality.", "After downloading and preparing the data for the 3rd quarter of 2018, I uploaded it to AuDaS. AuDaS is developed by Mind Foundry and allows anyone to easily learn about Machine Learning and build models in minutes.", "Once the data is uploaded, AuDaS scans it for anomalies and triggers advice to the user. In this case it has identified that the Name column has no predictive value and that we can drop it.", "The managers in the dataset are a combination of pension, proprietary, fundamental and quant funds. The histogram view also allows us to see how the funds distribute across the features.", "We are now going to ask AuDaS to identify clusters in our basket of fund managers and as a result it has automatically excluded the name column.", "The associated model and performance results are given bellow and we can see that AuDaS has identified 4 fairly clear clusters.", "To understand the properties of these clusters we can go back to the histogram view to see how the classes distribute across the other features.", "These funds\u2019 top 5 holdings occupy between 10 and 20% of their total assets and as a result are considered fairly diversified. An example fund in this class is Polar Capital which offers fundamentally driven investment products that deliver differentiated risk adjusted returns over the long term.", "These funds\u2019 top 5 holdings occupy less than 10% of their total assets which means they are very diversified. This also highlights that larger funds seem to be more risk averse. Intuitively this can be explained by the fact that they have more to lose and as a result need to place their eggs in more baskets. Examples in this class include AQR Capital Management, Prudential and Millennium Management.", "These funds\u2019 top 5 holdings occupy at least 20% of their portfolio and in some cases up to 50%. These funds have to be a bit more tactical to generate returns from their investments because of their size. Examples in this class are Lansdowne Partners, Odey Asset Management and Egerton Capital who are known to make big bets. Lansdowne\u2019s Glencore bet backfired in 2017 and cost them $100M. Odey bet against the UK government\u2019s debt equivalent to 147.4 percent of the fund\u2019s net asset value in June 2018.", "These funds are even more aggressive than the previous class as the majority\u2019s top 5 holdings occupy at least 40% of the portfolio. Examples in this class are Wolverine Trading and Jump Trading which are both proprietary funds. This means that they are trading their own capital (as opposed to investor capital) which gives them more freedom and control over how they invest. As a result, they can be as aggressive as they wish.", "In this brief study we were able to extract some clear structure within our basket of investment managers who could have potentially been hiding behind similar Sharpe ratios. This structure highlighted the aggressiveness of the funds depending on their size, type and nature.", "Moreover, we only considered some basic features and there are many potential extensions to this study:", "If you are interested in finding out how our Quant and Fundamental Hedge Fund customers use AuDaS for their Risk analysis and Investment Management please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me by email or LinkedIn.
