If you have a set of objects that are related to each other, then you can represent them using a graph.", "In this article, I will be briefly explaining 10 basic graph algorithms that become very useful for analysis and their applications.", "A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are connected to each other by the same edge.", "Some basic definitions related to graphs are given below. You can refer to Figure 1 for examples.", "Traversing or searching is one of the fundamental operations which can be performed on graphs. In breadth-first search (BFS), we start at a particular vertex and explore all of its neighbours at the present depth before moving on to the vertices in the next level. Unlike trees, graphs can contain cycles (a path where the first and last vertices are the same). Hence, we have to keep track of the visited vertices. When implementing BFS, we use a queue data structure.", "Figure 2 denotes the animation of a BFS traversal of an example graph. Note how vertices are discovered (yellow) and get visited (red).", "In depth-first search (DFS) we start from a particular vertex and explore as far as possible along each branch before retracing back (backtracking). In DFS also we have to keep track of the visited vertices. When implementing DFS, we use a stack data structure to support backtracking.", "Figure 3 denotes the animation of a DFS traversal of the same example graph used in Figure 2. Note how it traverses to the depths and backtracks.", "The shortest path from one vertex to another vertex is a path in the graph such that the sum of the weights of the edges that should be travelled is minimum.", "Figure 4 shows an animation where the shortest path is determined from vertex 1 to vertex 6 in a graph.", "A cycle is a path in a graph where the first and last vertices are the same. If we start from one vertex, travel along a path and end up at the starting vertex, then this path is a cycle. Cycle detection is the process of detecting these cycles. Figure 5 shows an animation of traversing a cycle.", "A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a graph that connects all the vertices with the minimum sum of edge weights and consists of no cycles.", "Figure 6 is an animation showing the process of obtaining a minimum spanning tree.", "A graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex in the graph is reachable from every other vertex.", "Figure 7 shows an example graph with three strongly connected components with vertices coloured in red, green and yellow.", "Topological sorting of a graph is a linear ordering of its vertices so that for each directed edge (u, v) in the ordering, vertex u comes before v.", "Figure 8 shows an example of a topological ordering of vertices (1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8). You can see that vertex 5 should come after vertices 2 and 3. Similarly, vertex 6 should come after vertices 4 and 5.", "Graph colouring assigns colours to elements of a graph while ensuring certain conditions. Vertex colouring is the most commonly used graph colouring technique. In vertex colouring, we try to colour the vertices of a graph using k colours and any two adjacent vertices should not have the same colour. Other colouring techniques include edge colouring and face colouring.", "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colours needed to colour the graph.", "Figure 9 shows the vertex colouring of an example graph using 4 colours.", "We can model a graph as a flow network with edge weights as flow capacities. In the maximum flow problem, we have to find a flow path that can obtain the maximum possible flow rate.", "Figure 10 shows an animated example of determining the maximum flow of a network and determining the final flow value.", "A matching in a graph is a set of edges that does not have common vertices (i.e., no two edges share a common vertex). A matching is called a maximum matching if it contains the largest possible number of edges matching as many vertices as possible.", "Figure 11 shows an animation of obtaining the complete matching of a bipartite graph with two sets of vertices denoted in orange and blue.", "I hope you found this article useful as a simple and summarised introduction to graph algorithms.
