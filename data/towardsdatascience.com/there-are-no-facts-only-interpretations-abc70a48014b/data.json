That may seem odd: data, with its apparent precision, structure, and clarity, may seem the very definition of objective certainty, but that\u2019s an illusion. The reality is that data is always a subjective and imperfect expression of how the people who collected it view the world.", "The Coronavirus outbreak has proved an excellent case in point. On the one hand it\u2019s an extremely transparent crisis. Case and death counts are published daily, with open-source data sets for anyone to analyze and model to their heart\u2019s content. And yet, despite this, getting good answers to even basic questions is exceedingly tough.", "What I\u2019ll do in this post is outline some of the questions I use when thinking about data, and then apply them to an open-source Coronavirus dataset to see how they affect our ability to answer a couple of common questions: how dangerous is the virus, and how well are governments managing the crisis?", "When collecting data, a host of decisions have to be made about what to collect, what to miss out, and how to interpret various circumstances. Understanding why data was collected is crucial in helping you understand the decisions that resulted in the data in front of you and should govern then the way you think about that data. A data set that built by someone who\u2019s trying to sell you something should be thought of differently to one built by a more neutral party. A data set that feeds a crucial process or piece of infrastructure is different from one that has been sat on a server for a year or two without anyone looking at it.", "Also, without knowing the why, you\u2019ll always be asking yourself \u201cwait, why did they do that?!\u201d as you uncover various gremlins and oddities in the data.", "There\u2019s no such thing as a truly \u201ccomplete\u201d dataset, as the process of data creation necessarily involves deciding not to collect information on certain entities or attributes of those entities. There are always more things one could measure, so thinking through what you\u2019re not seeing in the data, as well as what you are seeing is crucial.", "Often, you\u2019ll be dealing with sampled data, as collecting data on an entire population is either unfeasible or too expensive. In those cases, it\u2019s crucial to understand how and why the data is sampled in the way that it is, as well as the consistency of the sampling approach that was chosen. Often, the sampling approach chosen for use A makes it invalid for uses B, C and D, as we\u2019ll see later on when considering Coronavirus mortality.", "Data accuracy can be influenced by anything from test accuracy, the stability of the system generating the data, or the knowledge and motivation of manual data collectors. Do bear in mind that there\u2019s no guarantee that just because data is all in the same table, it\u2019s all equally accurate; some may be well maintained and precise, and others a hot mess.", "Sometimes, the people collecting the data are knowledgeable, careful, well-resourced, and have plenty of time to do their work well. Other times that\u2019s\u2026. not so much the case. Similarly, where there are strong incentives to see certain outcomes it will be hard for many to completely resist the urge to nudge the data in that direction. Then there\u2019s always good old fashioned fraud\u2026", "None of the above points are necessarily consistent over time, location or data collectors. New leaders or stakeholders of the data collection teams may mean changes in data collection policy. Evolving technology or broader context may alter the approach or scale of the data collection. It can also be just as simple as a bug that\u2019s found 6 months in where the fix can\u2019t be back-dated.", "The Our World in Data site has a lot of excellent charts that are sourced daily from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. There are other sites, but they all have similar sources: a collection of reported cases and deaths by country.", "In this case the data is primarily collected by health authorities of each country to inform the relevant national government of how the virus is spreading, and the strain that\u2019s placing on their health services.", "This means that the data tends to focus on cases that impact the health system, and is more tailored to the needs of each national government with less of a view to global consistency. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t efforts to align practices, but the needs of the national government will come first.", "As has been well recorded, test availability is limited in many countries so the data is far from representative. As a side note, this point is crucial when identifying where countries are in the infection curve: have they hit peak or just maxed out their testing capability?", "Tests are usually not carried out at random. Rather only cases presenting symptoms (and sometimes only very severe symptoms) get tested. This makes any inference about mortality pretty suspect.", "Similarly on death counts, different countries are counting different things as Coronavirus deaths. Some have only been counting in-hospital deaths, others including care-home and other non-hospital deaths which can have a very large impact on totals.", "No test for a virus is completely accurate, and Coronavirus tests have false positive and negative rates like any other. There are a number of tests available and some appear to be much less accurate than others, so again we need to be careful in making comparisons between populations tested using different tests.", "Also note the date grain in this data is by date of report, which can give an odd weekday/weekend cycle as not all sources report on weekends (no the virus is not taking a break on weekends).", "The pandemic is a large, frightening, global crisis where often already stretched health infrastructures are adapting to huge problems quickly. Errors are to be expected.", "Some countries may not be entirely transparent in their reporting practices either. Accusations of downplaying the numbers have been leveled at China and Russia for example.", "Data collection is not consistent by country (or state): different testing strategies, different tests, and different ways of measuring deaths all mean that we\u2019re usually not comparing apples to apples. That\u2019s not to say that metrics are never comparable between countries that have made an effort to keep their metrics aligned, but we should assume that\u2019s not the case until shown otherwise.", "We also expect metrics within a country to change over time, as more (and better) tests become available and governments adapt their metrics to better reflect their understanding of the crisis (e.g. including care home deaths in the totals reported).", "In summary, this is a pretty sketchy set of data and we\u2019ll need to be very careful in drawing conclusions from it. Let\u2019s look at a couple of questions to see the impact this has on our ability to draw conclusions.", "Before we dive in, it\u2019s worth noting that the infection & mortality rate of the virus are not the same as your personal risk from the pandemic. If you\u2019re lucky enough to avoid the virus but then get into a car accident where the ambulance that normally takes 5 minutes to arrive takes 50 minutes you may well become a victim of the pandemic, if not the virus. These \u201ccollateral\u201d deaths are not trivial, with early analyses indicating they may double or more the reported toll in many countries (though some of that will be unreported viral deaths as mentioned above).", "Also, this question implicitly assumes there\u2019s one strain of the virus with one mortality rate, when there may be multiple strains with varying mortality rates.", "Still, let\u2019s focus on the mortality of the virus itself. Taking a quick look at the World in Data report for the 21st of April, we see 169,859 deaths and 2.43m cases;this gives us a 7.0% mortality rate.", "As we already noted, though, things aren\u2019t that simple. Both case and death counts are being heavily skewed by how governments are administering tests, which tests they\u2019re using, and how they\u2019re recording deaths. Untangling the impact of these distortions for the global dataset will be extremely tricky, if not impossible.", "Of course, we will answer this question in time and studies are already underway (with, thankfully, much lower mortality than 7%). My point is more that, even with a great deal of daily-updated global data at our fingertips, we\u2019re still getting answers that are likely an order of magnitude off. Instead, for this particular question we need to craft a bespoke data-set, one with randomized sampling and consistent tracking.", "Let\u2019s try another question and see if we fare any better.", "As mentioned above the focus is generally on deaths directly from Coronavirus, so if some anti-virus measures are inadvertently causing deaths elsewhere it\u2019ll be some time before we know it. Let\u2019s put that concern to one side for now, however, and again focus on virus mortality. Also, there\u2019s some debate on whether we should be comparing absolute numbers or deaths/cases per million. Given that I\u2019m interested in comparing Switzerland (population 9m) to the US (population 328m) I\u2019ll look on a per-capita basis:", "Spain is clearly having a tough time, as has been widely reported. The UK, France, and Italy have virtually identical curves. The US hasn\u2019t quite hit the gradient of Spain, Italy or the UK yet. Switzerland looks like Germany but worse, and South Korea remains the positive outlier.", "So what can we conclude about the differing strategies and competencies between these countries? Well apart from telling everyone to be more like South Korea (be well-prepared, far in advance) it\u2019s hard to make confident judgments about the effectiveness of their measures, and there\u2019s no obvious pattern between lock down \u2018strength\u2019 and death count. As mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t know how different data collection practices are exacerbating or hiding differences between these countries.", "Also, to properly answer this question we need a great deal of additional data on how much factors like population density, virus variants, demographics, smoking prevalence, climate and so on are shaping spread and mortality, versus those factors that are attributable to government policy, such as testing, face masks, lock-down, and social distancing. Only once we\u2019ve controlled for these factors will we be able to point to specific decisions and policies and see what kind of impact they really had.", "The point here is not to let incompetent governments off the hook; some governments definitely seem asleep at the wheel. Rather, the point is that despite the wealth of data at our fingertips, we find ourselves needing more context and different data to properly answer this question.", "We\u2019re increasingly blessed with huge amounts of data to play with, and cool tools to use in doing so. Whilst that\u2019s a great thing, it definitely makes it easier to fall into the worst habit of analysis and data science: jumping into data we don\u2019t really understand and quickly making a bunch of cool charts & metrics to show everyone.", "Though not particularly sexy, spending the hours (yes, hours) to really understand the data you\u2019re working with, and how it relates to the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, is the difference between great analysis and, well, shiny-looking garbage. You\u2019ll be surprised how often you find the data you started working with isn\u2019t actually what you need at all.", "The question set outlined in this piece is, I hope, helpful in going through that process. Undoubtedly, they\u2019re not exhaustive, and you may have your own you like to use. The bottom line is this: treat data not as objective truth, but more like a reflection of what whoever created it thought was important and feasible to log at the time. Put another way, analytics and data science are like cooking, you can make almost anything bubble away in a pot, but if you haven\u2019t chosen the ingredients properly you may not want to eat the result.", "Your home for data science.
