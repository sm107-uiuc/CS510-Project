Say, for example, you are invited to Shark Tank (you lucky duck) to pitch your new restaurant idea and this question comes up, what they want to know is \u2014 what are your plans to make this idea a functional idea? So this is how you should interpret it:", "These are some of the questions you should be thinking when Kevin throws that question at you.", "Using an analogy similar to Shark Tank, when an interviewer asks you of your plans on scaling an ML model, what they want to know is:", "How good are you at giving some serious considerations to your ML model when it goes into production on a large scale?", "And mind you, this is super important from the tech firm\u2019s standpoint! That\u2019s because writing Python code for a prediction model on a Jupyter Notebook is one thing, but deploying them for practical everyday usage is a different ballgame altogether. Let\u2019s see how...", "There are a few areas that one can focus on. These are somewhat related to the three main stages involved in the model building process, namely - the collection of training data, fitting a model, and making predictions.", "As the famous adage goes: Your model is only as good as the underlying data on which it is trained, and it usually is. Thus, retraining your model is absolutely necessary when underlying assumptions about the data change. For instance, a recruitment model trained on data from the 80s would not have seen many women in senior management roles, and as such, this model is now obsolete in the 21st century (at best) and would be biased against recommending women for senior positions (at worst).", "It is inevitable that as your business grows you would come in possession of a lot more data than you began with. With so much data, you might want to consider parallel computing or batch processing (say using SGD optimization) and parallelize processes like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning in order to achieve a significant boost in performance and make efficient use of your computational resources. In short, look for a distributed version of algorithms!", "It is also prudent to use checkpoints while retraining serialized/pickled models. This will save you a lot of time in re-training a model (built initially with say, 1 million rows), as you do not have to rebuild it from scratch just because you received an additional 10k rows. The system can just catch up from where you left it last time.", "Fun fact: H2o supports checkpoint creation for several models including GBM, DRF, XGBoost, and Deep Learning.", "There are several options when it comes to picking a framework (for instance SkLearn, Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, H2o, Theano) for your ML and Deep Learning solution and it is important that you make a choice that will serve you well in the long run. The choice can be based on several factors.", "For instance, what is the level of abstraction you desire? Do you want to write fewer lines of code (for training, optimizing, and evaluating) or are you okay with writing C code with CUDA extensions just so you have more control over coding implementation? You can also compare the frameworks based on how good their community support is, how easily does it allow third-party integrations, and whether or not it can support Distributed ML (i.e. does it allow parallelization of computations).", "At the end of the day, it is a personal choice and boils down to the novelty of the solution you aim to create.", "Fun fact: Algorithms in scikit-learn, even though quite popular and easy to implement, are not distributed but you can still take advantage of distributed computation for certain ML tasks using Spark and Databricks.", "While we are on the subject of Distributed ML, it is imperative that we put some careful thought process in choosing the right processors (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) for our ML needs. This is especially important if you are dealing with deep learning since it involves some heavy-duty matrix multiplications.", "It is only reasonable to find that with the passage of time, new predictors come to light, which were previously ignored or considered unimportant. (For instance, very recently it was discovered that blood group type can be a useful indicator of your immunity levels against Coronavirus). When that happens, make sure that the addition of these features is not leading towards overfitting the model and that you are able to witness an improvement on your validation sets as well.", "Even better, implement regularization techniques (for instance, Lasso or Ridge for Regression models or Dropouts and Batch Normalization for Neural Nets) to be extra sure that your coefficients don\u2019t take extreme values and that the model isn\u2019t too complex.", "At this point, I would also pause and think whether the 0.0001% improvement in accuracy (from the addition of these new features) is something I care about. That\u2019s because accuracy isn't the only thing that matters after a certain stage and it\u2019s important to know when to stop training your model. The accuracy improvements must justify increased maintenance and training costs.", "As your model becomes (or is predicted to become) more and more popular, i.e. the number of prediction requests keep pouring in, it is time to think about whether your model is churning out predictions fast enough. That is, beware of slow models like SVM, KNN, or NN (neural nets), especially without GPU support.", "Finally, how you deploy your model in the real-world, out for everyone to make use of it, can also vary depending on several factors such as batch vs real-time prediction, model portability, and at times, privacy \u2014 I am sure a data scientist working in defense security would not be too thrilled about sharing his terrorist detection code, (along with the weights matrix) on Kaggle.", "So, you can choose to integrate your model as part of existing software, create containers for deploying models, or use orchestration tools like Kubernets that help manage containers and clusters.", "Fun fact: Check out this and this awesome articles to learn two unique ways of deploying models.", "Next time you are asked a question related to model scaling, I hope you have some interesting points to discuss with your interviewer. This is by far not an exhaustive list and there might be other essential points related to scalability. As always, I am curious to know if you can think of some of them.", "This is Part 1 of the Interview Question series that I recently started. In Part 2, we will be talking about how to explain your ML project to the interviewer in a structured manner. Stay tuned...", "Your home for data science.
