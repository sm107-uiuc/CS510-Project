While it is enough for swing operations and certain intraday strategies/methodologies, additional Level I and Level II data can improve both execution and exit decisions, especially in intraday operations.", "I am using this information for my discretionary trading and the results are being promising. I have also started working on the complexities of handling and parsing the data (which is between one and two orders of magnitude more complex than the regular OHLC candles). I do this with the quantitative horizon in mind.", "This made me have a better and properly structured understanding of the different real time data feed specifications, information that I share in this post.", "I briefly explain what is the meaning of the different levels of real-time data available from the different exchanges and market data vendors, including a quick analysis on what are they useful for and some examples of their consumption, both by standard trading platforms and in custom quantitative software. Both levels I and II are analysed and an introduction on level III is also included.", "Level I increases the available information for the operator providing the latest Bid and Ask quotes and executed tick trades. This is normally known in the industry as \u201ctop of book\u201d \u2014 for the latest bid/ask quotes \u2014 and \u201cthe tape\u201d or the \u201ctime & sales\u201d \u2014 for executed orders \u2014 . These two feeds combined can provide an insight into the short-term bullish or bearish pressure and constitute the basic building blocks to build up volume profile and order flow information.", "The insight can be gained because the price needs to fill the ask side of the order book in order to initiate a bullish trend, and alternatively, it needs to fill the bid side of the order book in order to initiate a bearish trend. When there is a clear trend or pressure on one of the sides of the order book it could be read as a situation where supply is overflowing demand or the opposite.", "While some authors call this pressure \u201cbuying volume\u201d or \u201cselling volume\u201d, I prefer to avoid such terminology because for every buyer there is a seller, and there is no such thing as more buyers than sellers, so there is no such thing as \u201cbuying volume\u201d. Those terms are misleading for the newcomers because more people than you might think do not fully understand how orders are actually filled in regulated markets, and by using those terms they keep thinking that the volume can be split into purchases and sales, which can not. What those authors want to state by means of those \u201cbuying/selling volume\u201d terms is that the filled orders are pressing against the supply or against the demand and that one side might be winning the short-term battle before a loss of equilibrium takes place and another initiation price movement takes place. What is actually different is the number of people \u201cwilling to sell\u201d and the number of people \u201cwilling to buy\u201d. In that case both figures are clearly differentiated because the orders are not filled and a strong asymmetric distribution could mean that the price could turn around or that at least there is a strong resistance or support at a certain price level (this information of non-filled orders is part of Level II data feed). It is important to understand these concepts as they are the key knowledge that can be extracted from Level I (and Level II) data.", "As a final note on Level I data, I enumerate the potential use cases:", "Level II enriches Level I with data including also a certain level of depth in the order book. This means that you count with the information about the pending orders submitted but not filled yet. The information is updated in real-time and can help to spot high liquidity areas which might be interpreted as short-term support or resistance price levels.", "Level II increases a lot the parsing requirements when compared with Level I as instead of dealing with just one tick price level a certain range of ticks (called depth of book) needs to be updated and parsed in real-time.", "The naming and scope of these terms change a bit depending on the source, but normally they are referred to as described here. Anyway, the important point is to understand the underlying concepts.", "This information allows to identify large trades (likely institutional ones) and as mentioned have an estimation on the short-term bearish/bullish pressure. How much this information can add up to your win/loss ratio is questionable. My hunch is that it can be between 10% and 20% when properly mastered, but I lack actual figures \u2014 they are difficult to quantify\u2014. The assertion comes from my observation of actual traders improvement when they have successfully incorporated order flow to their existing methodologies.", "I also believe that this is only valid for really short-term momentum and that this information needs to be supported by other operational criteria. The information as a stand-alone source is more likely to appear as noise than as valuable data. Again, this comes from my very limited experience as a discretionary trader and not from any quantitative analysis study. I am sure that there are operators making money exclusively with this information, as in trading what I have consistently learnt is that there are specialised players for every single piece of information/technique and that absolute statements \u2014 this works, this does not work \u2014 are usually wrong.", "Level III includes all raw information directly from the exchange, so it contains every single piece of information about a given exchange. Handling this data feed implies dealing with really high throughput and a direct connection with the exchange. Certain exchanges -such as Frankfurt- reserves this connection to institutional investors only as part of their approval process, others -such as Chicago- does not impose any restriction as long as you have the money (German vs. American mentality, I presume). In any case, the associated costs, capital and infrastructure required to exploit Level III data make it useless unless you are an institutional HFT player or are working in connection with one.", "The protocols used are proprietary and usually shared among different exchanges. Main ones are GLOBEX (used by CME) and T7 (used by EUREX). The protocols used are MDP3.0 and EMDI/EOBI/RDI/ETI respectively (being the latest ones the interfaces of T7 rather than the actual protocols). All exchange APIs/protocols usually leverage on the FIX protocol, which is the global standard for high-end real-time financial data.", "Those systems are additionally sold to other smaller exchanges across the world which do not have a solid business case to build their own electronic trading infrastructure. Other smaller exchanges use their own electronic trading systems, and while they are not compatible among them all of them usually share the same principles and FIX as the underlying protocol. Those systems and protocols are useful only in the context of institutional infrastructure, smaller players can successfully operate at a much lower cost by accessing an aggregation data service which will provide an easier to consume API access.", "As mentioned before, while some people describe the depth of book as a valuable tool for intraday and scalping operatives, the presence of algorithms constantly submitting and removing orders often makes this information misleading if not utterly deceiving. Again, it is important to understand that a proper context and additional trading operational criteria are essential if this information is going to be incorporated in our trading strategies.", "For the small discretionary operator, the information which is more likely useful is the one corresponding to time & sales \u2014 i.e. executed trades \u2014 , as those ones are confirmed trades and imply that someone is actually committing money at a given price.", "While still possible to be part of an algorithm\u2019s deception strategy to create liquidity by trapping other players, an executed order is likely to be less deceiving than a pending one. Stating \u201cI am buying 100 CME ES contracts at this price\u201d is quite different from actually buying them (such contract volume have a notional value of around 15M$ at the time of writing this article). Still this is not a norm; largest operators count with unlimited capital and their rotation areas need to use wide price ranges to accommodate all their buying/selling needs.", "In terms of holding time, the more short-term you go, the higher impact information latency and fees have on the operative and hence the more reserved the field is for the specialised trading industry. Retail and small operators need to deploy strategies that decouple adequately profit/loss and risk from latency and brokerage/market fees.", "This interpretation of the value of level II data needs to be taken with a great degree of caution. We can not forget that more than 80% of all market transactions come from algorithms \u2014 it is probably even higher \u2014 .", "Make no mistake: those algorithms are designed by the most powerful, resourceful, skilled, properly funded, smart and experienced teams in the world.", "They count with unlimited capital to operate and they are designed to deceive other players. They label orders identifying likely sources (human operator, slow algorithm, collocated HFT) and operate accordingly, they correlate different markets and exchanges in real time to leverage on divergences across markets (futures, cash, options, OTC, dark pools). They also operate with timing advantages over the rest of participants in the market thanks to collocation, FPGA-based custom hardware usage, and sometimes even blatant advantages -call them loopholes- provided by the exchange itself to large players.", "Basically, they outperform you in every aspect, and it is important to never forget this so all your operational procedures use a guerilla approach to focus on edges that a regular army can not adequately fight.", "On top of that, the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence will likely continue to increase the relevance of algorithms at a much faster pace. I even have certain doubts that manual operation would be possible at all in the future.", "While the current technology allow small operators to do things that were reserved to large institutional firms in the past, the same technology pushes forward institutional firms and market makers to levels of knowledge and power never seen before. Current markets are already a bloodbath and it can only get worse.", "The hope for the small operator is that being so limited in capital it is possible to allocate and deallocate capital in a few hundreds of milliseconds without any impact on the market, so it is possible to join an institutional movement for a very short run and still make a good profit.", "Liquidity is never an issue, except in abnormal market conditions such as news, Trump\u2019s tweets and other unexpected events \u2014 this only applies to retails and most of the general public, as there is no such thing as unexpected event; somewhere, someone always already knows and is adequately positioned before the event takes place \u2014 .", "In those events, slippage might duplicate or triplicate your losses for a failed trade but they are part of the game and any seasoned trader can successfully avoid most of them. For the really unexpected ones, they will be considered just outliers in the overall P&L and the risk management higher protective layers will avoid any serious impact in our operations \u2014 yes, you need more risk management layers than a mere stop loss \u2014 .", "By limiting the operations to just the right timing a small player can leverage on this available liquidity to represent an insignificant reward/annoyance for market makers during some of their movements. I am not saying this is easy (because it is not) but it is definitively possible when the right timings and contexts exploited. The point here is that Level I and Level II data contribute to that goal, especially for intraday operations.", "In terms of quantitative data analysis tick data is a different beast, especially when depth of book information needs to be incorporated. I estimate that between one and two orders of magnitude in terms of data processing effort are required to move from minute OHLC bars to tick data.", "The reason is that with OHLC candles the amount of information per time unit has always a predefined size constraint. Even moving into one second candles (a common choice when order flow is not used but shorter term strategies need to be analysed) increases the processing needs but does not change anything when compared with one minute bars. With tick data not only the amount of data is much larger but it is also irregular in data size per time unit. This additional complexity imposes further limits in the way data is processed as a more complex storing and processing backend is required.", "Storing depth of book data imposes even more challenging performance needs as the number of changes among the order book per second can be quite large, especially during peaks of volatility. For these environments, custom developments are almost a hard requirement.", "In this post, a concise review of Level I and II market data feeds has been conducted. Level III has been also briefly introduced.", "Without covering any actual strategies an overview of how Level I and Level II data can contribute to discretionary intraday trading has been discussed. And some comments on the challenges that dealing with this level of detail in data feeds have been presented.", "Overall, the inclusion of at least Level I and Order Flow data in our trading procedures can significantly increase our win-loss ratio hence reducing both risks and drawdown. The additional information can also contribute to reducing the stress associated with intraday trading, as more clear entry and exit points can be identified.", "Your home for data science.
