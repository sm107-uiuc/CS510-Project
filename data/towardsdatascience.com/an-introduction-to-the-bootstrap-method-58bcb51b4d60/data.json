The first time I applied the bootstrap method was in an A/B test project. At that time I was like using an powerful magic to form a sampling distribution just from only one sample data. No formula needed for my statistical inference. Not only that, in fact, it is widely applied in other statistical inference such as confidence interval, regression model, even the field of machine learning. That\u2019s lead me go through some studies about bootstrap to supplement the statistical inference knowledge with more practical other than my theory mathematical statistics classes.", "This article is mainly focus on introducing the core concepts of Bootstrap than its application. But some embed codes will be used as a concept illustrating. We will do a introduction of Bootstrap resampling method, then illustrate the motivation of Bootstrap when it was introduced by Bradley Efron(1979), and illustrate the general idea about bootstrap.", "The ideas behind bootstrap, in fact, are containing so many statistic topics that needs to be concerned. However, it is a good chance to recap some statistic inference concepts! The related statistic concept covers:", "Having some basic knowledge above would help for gaining basic ideas behind bootstrap. Some ideas may cover with advance statistic, but I will use a simple way and not very formal mathematics expressions to illustrate basic idea as simple as I can. Links at the end of the article will be provided if you want to learn more about these concepts.", "The basic idea of bootstrap is make inference about a estimate(such as sample mean) for a population parameter \u03b8 (such as population mean) on sample data. It is a resampling method by independently sampling with replacement from an existing sample data with same sample size n, and performing inference among these resampled data.", "Generally, bootstrap involves the following steps:", "We can see we generate new data points by re-sampling from an existing sample, and make inference just based on these new data points.", "How and why does bootstrap work?", "In this article, I will divide this big question into three parts:", "The core idea of bootstrap technique is for making certain kinds of statistical inference with the help of modern computer power. When Efron introduced the method, it was particularly motivated by evaluating of the accuracy of an estimator in the field of statistic inference. Usually, estimated standard error are an first step toward thinking critically about the accuracy statistical estimates.", "Now, to illustrate how bootstrap works and how an estimator\u2019s standard error plays an important role, let\u2019s start with a simple case.", "Imagine that you want to summarize how many times a day do students pick up their smartphone in your lab with totally 100 students. It's hard to summarize the number of pickups in whole lab like a census way. Instead, you make a online survey which also provided the pickup-counting APP. In the next few days, you receive 30 students responses with their number of pickups in a given day. You calculated the mean of these 30 pickups and got an estimate for pickups is 228.06 times.", "In statistic field, the process above is called a point estimate. What we would like to know is the true number of pickups in whole lab. We don\u2019t have census data, what we can do is just evaluate the population parameter through an estimator based on an observed sample, and then get an estimate as the evaluation of average smartphone usage in the lab.", "One key question is \u2014 How accurate is this estimate result?", "Because of the sampling variability, it is virtually never that X\u0304 = \u03bc occurs. Hence, besides reporting the value of a point estimate, some indication about the precision should be given. The common measure of accuracy is the standard error of the estimate.", "The standard error of an estimator is it\u2019s standard deviation. It tells us how far your sample estimate deviates from the actual parameter. If the standard error itself involves unknown parameters, we used the estimated standard error by replacing the unknown parameters with an estimate of the parameters.", "Let\u2019s take an example. In our case, our estimator is sample mean, and for sample mean(and nearly only one!), we have an simple formula to easily obtain it\u2019s standard error.", "However, the standard deviation of population \u03c3 is always unknown in real world, so the most common measurement is the estimated standard error, which use the sample standard deviation S as a estimated standard deviation of the population:", "Now we have got our estimated standard error. How can the standard error be used in the statistic inference? Let\u2019s use a simple example to illustrate.", "Roughly speaking, if a estimator has a normal distribution or a approximately a normal distributed, then we expect that our estimate to be less than one standard error away from its expectation about 68% of the time, and less than two standard errors away about 95% of the time.", "In our case, recall that the sample we collected is 30 response sample, which is sufficiently large in thumb rule, the Central Limit Theorem tells us the sampling distribution of X\u0304 is closely approximated to a normal distribution. Combining the estimated standard error that, we can get:", "We have made our statistic inference. However, how this inference was going well is under some rigorous assumptions.", "Let\u2019s recall what assumption or classical theorem we may have used so far:", "However, in our real world, sometimes it\u2019s hard to meet assumptions or theorem like above:", "This is why the bootstrap comes in to address these kind of problems. When these assumptions are violated, or when no formula exists for estimating standard errors , bootstrap is the powerful choice.", "To illustrate the main concepts, following explanation will evolve some mathematics definition and denotation, which are kind of informal in order to provide more intuition and understanding.", "Assume we want to estimate the standard error of our statistic to make an inference about population parameter, such as for constructing the corresponding confidence interval (just like what we have done before!). And:", "Let X1, X2, \u2026 , Xn be a random sample from a population P with distribution function F. And let M= g(X1, X2, \u2026, Xn), be our statistic for parameter of interest, meaning that the statistics a function of sample data X1, X2, \u2026, Xn. What we want to know is the variance of M, denoted as Var(M).", "It leads us need to approximate the EST_Var(M). How? Before answer this , let\u2019s introduce an common practical way is simulation, assume we know P.", "Let\u2019s talk about the idea of simulation. It\u2019s useful for obtaining information about a statistic\u2019s sampling distribution with the aid of computers. But it has an important assumption \u2014 Assume we know the population P.", "Now let X1, X2, \u2026 , Xn be a random sample from a population and assume M= g(X1, X2, \u2026, Xn) is the statistic of interest, we could approximate mean and variance of statistic M by simulation as follows:", "Why does this simulation works? Since by a classical theorem, the Law of Large Numbers:", "And by Law of Large Numbers and several theorem related to Convergence in Probability:", "With the aid of computer, we can make B as large as we like to approximate to the sampling distribution of statistic M.", "Following is the example Python codes for simulation in the previous phone-picks case. I use B=100000, and the simulated mean and standard error for sample mean is very close to the theoretical results in the last two cells. Feel free to check out.", "We have learned the idea of simulation. Now, can we approximate the EST_Var(M) by simulation? Unfortunately, to do the simulation above, we need to know the information about population P. The truth is that we don\u2019t know anything about the P. For addressing this issue, one of most important component in bootstrap Method is adopted:", "Using Empirical distribution function to approximate the distribution function of population, and applying Plug-in Principle to get an estimate for Var(M) \u2014 the Plug-in estimator.", "The idea of Empirical distribution function (EDF) is building an distribution function (CDF) from an existing data set. The EDF usually approximates the CDF quite well, especially for large sample size. In fact, it is a common, useful method for estimating a CDF of a random variable in pratical.", "The EDF is a discrete distribution that gives equal weight to each data point (i.e., it assigns probability 1/ n to each of the original n observations), and form a cumulative distribution function that is a step function that jumps up by 1/n at each of the n data points.", "Bootstrap use the EDF as an estimator for CDF of population. However, we know the EDF is a type of cumulative distribution function(CDF). To apply the EDF as an estimator for our statistic M, we need to make the form of M as a function of CDF type, even the parameter of interest as well to have the some base line. To do this, a common way is the concept called Statistical Functional. Roughly speaking, a statistical functional is any function of a distribution function. Let\u2019s take an example:", "Suppose we are interested in parameters of population. In statistic field , there is always a situation where parameters of interest is a function of the distribution function, these are called statistical functionals. Following list that population mean E(X) is a statistical functional:", "From above we can see the mean of population E(X) can also be expressed as a form of CDF of population F \u2014 this is a statistical functional. Of course, this expression can be applied to any function other than mean, such as variance.", "Statistical functional can be viewed as quantity describing the features of the population. The mean, variance, median, quantiles of F are features of population. Thus, using statistical functional, we have a more rigorous way to define the concepts of population parameters. Therefore, we can say, our statistic M can be : M=g(F), with the population CDF F.", "We have made our statistic is M= g(X1, X2, \u2026, Xn)=g(F) be a statistical functional form. However, we don\u2019t know F. So we have to \u201cplug-in\u201d a estimator for F, \u201cinto\u201d our M=g(F), in order to make this M can be evaluate.", "It is called plug-in principle. Generally speaking, the plug-in principle is a method of estimation of statistical functionals from a population distribution by evaluating the same functionals, but with the empirical distribution which is based on the sample. This estimation is called a plug-in estimate for the population parameter of interest. For example, a median of a population distribution can be approximated by the median of the empirical distribution of a sample. The empirical distribution here, is form just by the sample because we don\u2019t know population. Put it simply:", "Let\u2019s take an mean example as follows, we can see g(.) for mean is \u2014 averaging all data points, and it is also applied for sample mean. F_hat here, is form by sample as an estimator of F. We say the sample mean is a plug-in estimator of the population mean.(A more clear result will be provided soon.)", "So, what is the F_hat? Remember bootstrap use Empirical distribution function(EDF) as an estimator of CDF of population? In fact, EDF is also a common estimator that be widely used in plug-in principle for F_hat.", "Let\u2019s take a look what does our estimator M= g(X1, X2, \u2026, Xn)=g(F) will look like if we plug-in with EDF into it.", "We know EDF is a discrete distribution that with probability mass function PMF assigns probability 1/ n to each of the n observations, so according this, M_hat becomes:", "According this, for our mean example, we can find the plug-in estimator for mean \u03bc is just the sample mean:", "Hence, we through Plug-in Principle, to make an estimate for M=g(F), say M_hat=g(F_hat). And remember that, what we want to find out is Var(M), and we approximate Var(M) by Var(M_hat). But in general case, there is no precise formula for Var(M_hat) other than sample mean! It leads us to apply a simulation.", "It\u2019s nearly the last step! Let\u2019s refresh the whole process with the Plug-in Principle concept.", "Our goal is to estimate the variance of our estimator M, which is Var(M). The Bootstrap principle is as follows:", "Recall that to do the original version of simulation, we need to draw a sample data from population, obtain a statistic M=g(F) from it, and replicate the procedure B times, then get variance of these B statistic to approximate the true variance of statistic.", "Therefore, to do simulation in step 4, we need to:", "What\u2019s the simulation? In fact, it is the bootstrap sampling process that we mentioned in the beginning of this article!", "Two questions here(I promise these are last two!):", "We know EDF builds an CDF from existing sample data X1, \u2026, Xn, and by definition it puts mass 1/n at each sample data point. Therefore, drawing an random sample from an EDF, can be seen as drawing n observations, with replacement, from our existing sample data X1, \u2026, Xn. So that\u2019s why the bootstrap sample is sampled with replacement as shown before.", "The variance of plug-in estimator M_hat=g(F_hat) is what the bootstrap simulation want to simulate. At the beginning of simulation, we draw observations with replacement from our existing sample data X1, \u2026, Xn. Let\u2019s denote these re-sampled data X1* , \u2026, Xn*. Now, let\u2019s compare bootstrap simulation with our original simulation version again .", "Would you feel familiar with processes above? In fact, it\u2019s the same process with bootstrap sampling method we have mentioned before!", "Finally, let\u2019s check out how does our simulation will work. What we will get the approximation from this bootstrap simulation is for Var(M_hat), but what we really concern is whether Var(M_hat) can approximate to Var(M). So two question here:", "To answer this ,let\u2019s use a diagram to illustrate the both types simulation error:", "Generally, the smoothness conditions on some functionals is difficult to verify. Fortunately, most common statistical functions like mean, variance or moments satisfy the required continuity conditions. It provides that bootstrapping works. And of course, make the original sample size not too small as we can.", "Below is my Bootstrap sample code for pickup case, fell free to check out.", "Let\u2019s recap the main ideas of bootstrap with following diagram!", "So far I know it\u2019s not easy with tons of statistical concepts. But understanding basic concepts behind a method can make us in a right direction when apply it. After all, Bootstrap has been applied to a much wider level of practical cases, it is more constructive to learn start from the basic part. Thanks for reading so far and hope this article helps!
