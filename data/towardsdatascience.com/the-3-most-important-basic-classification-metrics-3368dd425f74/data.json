If you don\u2019t, definitely check out my previous article here. It should help to lift the fog. \u2601\ufe0f", "In this article, we\u2019ll dig into the three most important basic classification metrics that every data scientist and statistician are expected to know. \ud83d\ude80", "I call the three metrics we\u2019ll explore basic metrics because each one consists of a single quadrant of the confusion matrix divided by that quadrant PLUS one other quadrant.", "We\u2019re focussing on binary classification cases \u2014 when there are two possible outcomes.", "The most common basic metric is often called recall or sensitivity. Its more descriptive name is the true positive rate (TPR). I\u2019ll refer to it as recall.", "Recall is important to know when you really want to correctly predict the cases in the true class. For example, if you have a test for a dangerous form of cancer, you really want that test to do a good job detecting all of the cases where someone actually has the cancer. So you really care about recall.", "The recall is calculated by dividing the true positives by the true positives PLUS the false negatives:", "In other words, out of all the actual true cases, what percentage did your model predict correctly?", "Here are the results from our model\u2019s predictions of whether a website visitor would purchase a shirt at Jeff\u2019s Awesome Hawaiian Shirt store. \ud83c\udf3a\ud83d\udc55", "Using our example confusion matrix, what is the recall?", "The model correctly predicted four out of five sales. That sounds pretty good! \ud83d\ude00 We could compare our model\u2019s recall to another model\u2019s recall to help us choose which model we want to use for our predictions.", "The best possible recall is 1 and the worst possible is 0. The scikit-learn function name is recall_score.", "For cases where recall is really important, there\u2019s something else we can do to correctly predict more of the true cases: we can change our decision threshold.", "By default, the decision threshold for a scikit-learn classification model is set to .5. This means that if the model thinks there is a 50% or greater chance of an observation being a member of the positive class, then that observation is predicted to be a member of the positive class.", "If we care a lot about the recall, we could lower our decision threshold to try to catch more of the actual positive cases. For example, maybe you want the model to predict true for every observation with a probability of 30% or higher.", "There isn\u2019t a quick way to do this right now in scikit-learn. This Stack Overflow answer explains how you can achieve the result with a custom predict method. (modified 2020\u201305\u201306 0 hat tip to Kevin Markham)", "This change would likely turn some false negatives into true positives. Yeah! \ud83c\udf89 However, the model would turn some true negatives into false positives, too. Boo! \ud83d\ude22", "After all, you could get a perfect 100% recall by predicting that every observation was positive. But that\u2019s not usually a good plan.", "When the cost of false positives is high you want to pay attention to them. You need a metric that will capture how well your model discriminates between true positives and false positives. You need to pay attention to precision.", "Precision is the ratio of how many of the positive predictions were correct relative to all the positive predictions. It answers the question", "What percentage of the positive predictions were correct?", "I remember precision by focussing on the alliteration with the letter p.", "Precision is all the True Positives divided by all the Predicted Positives.", "Here\u2019s the Hawaiian Shirt sale confusion matrix again:", "The scikit-learn metric is precision_score. The syntax is similar to recall\u2019s.", "Precision is often discussed in terms of its relationship to recall. In fact, there\u2019s a plot_precision_recall_curve function in scikit-learn that we can use to visualize the tradeoff between precision and recall.", "Here\u2019s the result of plotting the precision recall curve on a logistic regression model with some of the Titanic dataset:", "AP stands for average precision, this is the area under the precision-recall curve. Higher is better and the max possible is 1.", "The code to make the plot is:", "The plot shows what the precision and recall would be at different decision thresholds. Notice that the recall goes up as the precision goes down. \ud83d\udcc9", "If we set our decision threshold lower, we\u2019ll move to the right along the curve. More observations will be classified as the positive class, and we will hopefully catch more of the true positive cases. Recall will go up. \ud83d\ude00", "However, we will have more false positives, too. This will make the denominator for precision larger. The result will be lower precision. \u2639\ufe0f", "How many false positives we are willing to tolerate depends on how large the cost of a false positive is relative to the cost of a true positive. It\u2019s a balancing act!", "Sometimes we care about how well our model is predicting the actual negatives. Let\u2019s look at a metric for that situation.", "Specificity also goes by the name true negative rate (TNR). It answers the question:", "How well did my model catch the negative cases?", "Notice that specificity is only concerned with the actual negative cases.", "Here\u2019s the Hawaiian shirt sale confusion matrix again.", "Specificity can range from 0 to 1, so 50% is not super great. \ud83d\ude41 The model didn\u2019t do a good job correctly predicting when someone would NOT make a purchase.", "Specificity is a nice metric when it\u2019s important to correctly predicting the actual negatives. For example, if the treatment for a disease is dangerous, you want a high specificity. \ud83d\udc4d", "Specificity is commonly discussed in tandem with sensitivity. Remember that sensitivity goes by the names recall and true positive rate, too.", "Scikit-learn does not have a built-in function named specificity. You can create the four outcome variables from the confusion matrix and compute the specificity like this:", "Alternatively, you can use recall_score and pass pos_label=0 if your negative class is zero. \ud83d\ude09", "Specificity is the final basic classification metric you need in your tool belt. \ud83d\udd27", "You\u2019ve learned about recall, precision, and specificity. Remember that recall is also referred to as sensitivity or the true positive rate. Specificity is also called the true negative rate.", "With accuracy, recall, precision, and specificity under your belt, you\u2019ll have the basic classification terms you need to know!", "I hope you found this introduction to basic classification metrics to be helpful. If you did, please share it on your favorite social media so other folks can find it, too. \ud83d\ude00", "In the final article in this series we\u2019ll explore the three most important composite metrics.
