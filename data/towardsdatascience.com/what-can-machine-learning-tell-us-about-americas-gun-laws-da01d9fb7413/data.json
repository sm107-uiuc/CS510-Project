With each new incident comes renewed calls to strengthen gun control laws, expand federal background checks, and get rid of assault rifles. Though the opposing faction promptly dismisses each appeal by citing 2nd Amendment rights, other discussions of practicality often emerge. Specifically, the efficacy of such laws is often called into question.", "How do we know which laws work and which ones don\u2019t? Are there any laws that can be implemented without infringing on individual rights and liberties? Here, we will use the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to see if we can find an answer to those questions.", "We don\u2019t want to make any assumptions, so we\u2019ll start by answering some of the most fundamental questions. To answer this question, we turn to Gifford\u2019s Law Center: a non-profit organization whose mission is to reduce gun violence. They provide annual rankings of state gun laws, assigning each state a traditional letter grade. If gun laws are effective, we would expect to see firearm mortality rates fall as grades rise. Using 2017 data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), we can plot the relationship across states.", "So, stronger laws mean firearm mortality rates decrease, and we can call it a day, right?! If only it were that simple. We have only one year of data, and we don\u2019t know how Giffords calculates the grade. What\u2019s more, we don\u2019t know what happens to overall mortality rates? Included in firearm mortality are suicide and homicide rates. How do we know people aren\u2019t merely substituting one method for another? Let\u2019s look at a broader time block (2014\u20132017) using overall suicide and homicide rates as our target.", "Though strong gun laws do seem to reduce rates of both homicide and suicide, there is a lot of noise in the data. What\u2019s more, the relationship is much more distinct for suicide rates than homicide rates. Indeed, the data suggests a grade improvement from F to A could result in a near 50% reduction in the suicide rate.", "What\u2019s going on with homicide rates? The relationship may be statistically significant, but the r-squared score indicates that the strength of laws only explains 6.7% of the variance in homicide rates. But are gun laws truly that ineffectual at reducing homicide rates, or is something else happening?", "Some posit that weak laws in neighboring states might undermine strong laws in another. Let\u2019s explore that possibility.", "By calculating the average grade for each state\u2019s neighbors, we can measure the impact on gun laws in the state of interest. To start, we\u2019ll use a handy code block described by Ritvik Kharkar in this post, which uses the Shapely library to identify each state\u2019s neighbors. Find a slightly modified version of this code below.", "From here, it is merely a matter of getting the grade for each neighbor and calculating the mean to get an average GPA for all neighbors. States without neighbors (Alaska and Hawaii) use the home state\u2019s grade.", "As before, we will plot neighbor state GPA\u2019s against homicide rates in the target state and see what we get.", "Interestingly, neighbor state laws appear to have a more substantial impact on homicide rates than the laws of the home state. For suicide rates, the relationship is weaker than before. Also worth noting is that variation in homicide rates is lower when gun laws are strong. The implication is that strong laws are capable of curbing other factors that would typically drive rates upward.", "Still, the r-squared value of 16.1% is much weaker than we would like to see. Let\u2019s take a deep dive into the laws themselves to see if we can get some concrete, actionable intelligence.", "Rather than rely on an arbitrary grading system that cannot be independently analyzed, the ideal solution would be to analyze changes in state law over time. The process of gathering data, categorizing features, and cataloging the results would require immense amounts of time, expertise, and resources. Fortunately, another gun control advocacy group, Everytown Research, has this information documented since 1991.", "Analyzed across 85 dimensions, the group frames each feature as a binary or categorical question. For example, \u201cDoes state law generally prohibit all people convicted of felonies from having firearms?\u201d One great thing about questions structured in this way is that they leave little room for subjectivity in the responses.", "Each element falls into one of eight categories:", "Rather than represent yes and no responses as 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, answers were ranked such that higher numerical responses represent stricter laws. Though such an approach requires extra work up-front, the interpretability of results is vastly improved.", "Mean responses were also calculated for neighboring states and incorporated into the dataset. After additional cleaning to reduce noise in the data, 134 dimensions for primary and neighboring states remained.", "Starting with backward elimination in a multi-linear regression, we exclude features that fail to achieve a p-value below 0.05 \u00f7 the number of remaining elements. In addition, it was later discovered that some features applied to a minimal selection of states and years, resulting in them being over-represented in the final results. Therefore, excluded were questions wherein 85% of the responses were in one extreme (i.e., 85% of responses are \u201cno\u201d).", "The top 20 features are listed below with their respective counts of states that give at least a partial \u201cyes\u201d response. For example, if a state replied, \u201cYes, but only for handguns,\u201d it is treated as a partial \u201cyes\u201d response in the chart.", "Keep in mind that some of these questions carry more weight when applied to neighboring states, while others refer to laws in the home state. Before we start trying to interpret these results and identify underlying themes, we need to test their significance. Given a set of answers to these questions from a random selection of states and years, we should be able to predict the respective homicide rates to a high degree of precision.", "The following regression model architectures were trained using an 80% subset of the data with 5-fold cross-validation and SciKit Learn\u2019s GridsearchCV.", "With models trained, each attempted to predict homicide rates for the remaining 20% of data, with varying levels of success. In the end, an XGBoost Regressor was found to be the top-performing model, achieving an explained variance score of 91.23%. In the chart below, the red dots represent actual homicide rates for a random subset of states and years. The blue line represents predictions made by the model based on answers to the 20 questions.", "So, our model can predict homicide rates with high accuracy, but it does not tell us anything about the potential reduction in said rates. To answer that question, consider two fictitious states: one responds yes to all items, and the other responds no to all. What is the difference in predicted homicide rates? States that answer yes to all questions are likely to realize an average 52.41% lower homicide rate than states that respond no.", "By measuring the changes in predicted homicide rates when making adjustments to individual responses, we can identify the features that have the greatest impact. The most significant features are listed below in order of significance, with affirmative response counts for 2019.", "A few clear themes emerge regarding concealed carry, police discretion, and domestic violence. It seems that when police are empowered to disarm individuals whom they deem to be a threat to public safety, homicide rates fall. And when laws prevent individuals with domestic violence restraining orders from having firearms, homicide rates also fall.", "Perhaps most surprising is that fewer than half of the states prohibit fugitives from having firearms. Notice that this topic is most relevant to neighboring states as opposed to the home state, providing further evidence of the impact of neighbor state laws.", "Another study published by the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in March 2019 corroborated this finding. The school used an entirely different methodology and dataset, tracing the purchase of firearms used in homicides. According to senior author Mark J. Seamon, MD, FACS, an associate professor of Traumatology, Surgical Critical Care, and Emergency Surgery at Penn Medicine:", "Strict state firearm legislation may be driving some to more lax neighboring states to retrieve guns, which in turn increases the number of guns and homicides back in the home state, despite its more restrictive laws.", "A key finding in the study was that \u201c65 percent of the guns recovered in the most restrictive states originated from other states.\u201d", "So, what do we do with this information? We\u2019ll come to that a bit later. For now, we are going to shift gears and perform a different analysis, this time examining the impact of laws on mass shootings instead of overall homicide rates.", "A database of mass shootings from 1982\u20132019 can be found here. The same approach of tracking gun laws with homicide rates was applied, this time using classification models instead of regressors. Unfortunately, initial results, in this instance, were quite dismal: no model was able to predict mass shootings with any level of accuracy greater than random chance. Does this mean that gun laws have no impact on mass shootings? Not necessarily, as the relative infrequency of mass shootings can make such correlations harder to detect. So, let\u2019s try another approach.", "Rather than look at all state laws, let\u2019s have a look at a single, national law: the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, otherwise known as the Assault Weapons Ban (AWB). At the time of enactment in September 1994, the US Department of Justice defined assault weapons as \u201csemiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that [are] designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use.\u201d The ban was in place until September 2004. So, how effective was it?", "By way of simple hypothesis testing, we can determine if the number of incidents and fatalities were significantly lower when the ban was in place. Below, we can visualize the differences in mean and variance for total fatalities, number of incidents, and fatalities per incident in any given year. The blue line represents results when the ban was not in effect, and the red represents results when the ban was in effect.", "According to these results, incidents occurred with 86% less frequency, total fatalities were 173% lower, and fatalities per incident were 50% lower when the federal ban was in place. We can be confident of these results at the 90% level for number of incidents and total fatalities, and 95% confident when looking at fatalities per incident. However, there is one significant caveat to consider. Have a look at how these results change over time. The time-period between the gray, dashed lines represents the period where the ban was in place.", "As we can see, there is a glaring data imbalance, with most incidents and fatalities occurring in the years after the ban expired. When data after 2004 is left out of the comparison, all signs of significance disappear. If two separate time-periods exist where a ban was not in place, and they each exhibit vastly different results, it is hard to conclude that the ban itself functions as the explanatory variable. In other words, we do not have any clear evidence that the AWB had a meaningful impact on total fatalities or the number of incidents.", "However, such an imbalance does not exist when considering the number of fatalities per incident, which was found to be the most significant factor at the 95% confidence level. This tells us is that, while the AWB wasn\u2019t necessarily effective at reducing the frequency of mass shootings, it did seem to reduce the number of fatalities that result from them.", "Consider a scenario where guns are no longer accessible by the civilian population: would-be mass shooters might resort to other means. Would other methods result in more or fewer fatalities? We can pull data from the Global Terrorism Database and compare the results with the data we already have. In one group, we examine mortality rates for incidents involving firearms. In the other, we consider weapon types that most would acknowledge as viable alternatives to firearms.", "The mean number of fatalities per incident without a firearm from 1982\u20132017 was 2.36 (excluding the 9/11 attacks). The average number of fatalities per incident when a firearm was the weapon of choice over the same period was 8.37. The difference represents 255% disparity that was found to be significant at the 99% confidence level. Though firearm restrictions may not be effective as preventing attacks, the evidence suggests that such restrictions may be able to improve the survivability of attacks.", "When it comes to overall homicide rates, placing gun restrictions on fugitives and those with domestic violence restraining orders is the most definitive action a state can take. Empowering law enforcement to remove guns at their discretion, however, is likely to be met with significant amounts of resistance on both sides of the aisle. As an alternative, immediate family members might be empowered to petition a court for such removals when they identify red flags of their own.", "Otherwise known as \u201cextreme risk protection orders\u201d or \u201cred flag laws,\u201d such an approach could potentially yield similar results without yielding too much power to enforcement agencies. In 2015, only two states had such laws in place, but that number has since grown to 17. Because the laws are so new, it will be a few years before their effectiveness can be measured. Furthermore, the criteria used by courts to make decisions on such petitions still needs to be established.", "There is hope that such laws might be able to curb the frequency of mass shootings, but as of today, there are no laws that have a clear impact in this regard. Though assault weapon bans do have a definite effect on fatalities per incident, the loftier goal would be to reduce the frequency of such episodes in the first place.", "Still, there remains a plethora of options for states to strengthen their gun laws in meaningful, non-controversial ways. Closing such gaps in state law across the country has the potential to reduce homicide rates significantly. Here are just a few examples of low-hanging fruit:", "It is worth noting that, in some of these cases, federal laws already exist. However, as per the 1997 US Supreme Court Case Printz v. United States, the federal government cannot compel states to enforce federal law. Unless states have analogous laws, the federal government has no practical means of reliable enforcement.", "Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the rate of homicides and suicides, not to disarm law-abiding citizens. Making a concerted effort across the country to enact real common-sense laws and enforce federal laws already on the books is the best way to make progress.", "This analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, which can be found on Github, complete with data sources and methodology.", "Your home for data science.
