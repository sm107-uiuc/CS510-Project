I vaguely remember sitting across the hall from my dad, and being given a list of career options to choose from.", "Around an hour later (and him telling me that pursuing a degree in journalism was a terrible idea), we settled on a career path.", "At that time, I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into. I was the least technical person I knew, with absolutely no idea of anything computer related.", "A few days later, I enrolled into my university\u2019s computer science program, and chose to major in data science.", "Time passed by pretty quickly, as I breezed through college with absolutely no end goal in mind. \u201cAll I have to do is study textbook material and get good grades every semester,\u201d I thought. \u201cThen I can get a good job.\u201d", "My wake-up call happened when I realized I had absolutely zero skills required to enter the job market.", "It was a conversation with my lecturer, who was teaching the first programming class I had ever taken in my life. Her expectations were high, even more so for me \u2014 a person who had never even installed an IDE in my life.", "For someone who was teaching the subject to an absolute newbie, her patience was pretty thin. While I was struggling to get a bunch of code to run, she said words that stuck with me to this day:", "\u201cSome people just can\u2019t do it.\u201d", "As a student who was always at the top of my class, and the best at everything I did, my lecturer\u2019s words hit like a ton of bricks.", "Her words implied that I wasn\u2019t cut out for programming, and that this wasn\u2019t the right field for me. It was the first time in my life anyone had said anything like that to me. Her words were a huge blow to my self-esteem.", "This really made me want to prove her wrong, because deep down I knew that it was possible for me to learn if I really wanted to.", "I also realized that not knowing how to code (and only having theoretical CS knowledge) wasn\u2019t going to be of much use when trying to find a job in the future.", "This meant that I had to learn, and I had to learn fast.", "I decided that if I was going to learn on my own, I would have to carve my own syllabus, and start studying from scratch.", "I started out with learning Python, and spent around 7\u20138 hours a day coding on sites like LeetCode and HackerRank.", "I had university online courses simultaneously, and skipped class completely when self-studying. I would attend the classes on my phone, and then learn my own material.", "The time I spent coding really helped improve my skills, and along with that my self-confidence.", "I also did multiple online courses to get a foundational knowledge in data science and analytics, and spent at least 4 hours a day studying math and theoretical material.", "The piece of advice \u201cmake your own data science projects,\u201d is all over the Internet. That\u2019s exactly what I did after gaining foundational knowledge in the field.", "I have always been a creator at heart.", "In fact, I believe that at their core, everyone is a creator.", "How many new ideas have you come up with in your lifetime? Easily over a thousand?", "Now how many of those ideas have you actually brought to life?", "I\u2019m guessing that number is a lot smaller.", "After finishing online courses, I had already worked on multiple small projects. I also had the programming background required to start my own projects.", "I came up with new project ideas and data to analyze. I brought these ideas to life through my Jupyter Notebook.", "This was something that took me days to do. Creating projects based on a single idea is no easy task. Sometimes, I would get stuck halfway through and realize that it wasn\u2019t possible for the project to be completed.", "Regardless of the outcome though, I always created.", "As someone with a passion for storytelling and journalism, I put my thoughts together. I put pen to paper and wrote stories around my projects, and published them on the Internet.", "Everything started with an idea. Every story I\u2019ve written, and every project I\u2019ve worked on.", "I would write like nobody was reading, and create like nobody was watching.", "Every time newcomers in the industry approach me, its usually about getting started on projects.", "The question I get most often: \u201cHow do I start?\u201d", "Bring those ideas that you have to life.", "Maybe its a terrible idea. Maybe the outcome will be terrible, and you have to start from scratch all over again.", "Every single time you create something that doesn\u2019t work out the way you wanted it to, you learn. And repeat. And learn again.", "Learning is not a linear process, so do not expect it to be. Every time you make a mistake, you will grow from it.", "In fact, you will learn so much more from mistakes and failures than successful projects.", "What if nobody sees my work?", "When I started creating projects, telling stories, and writing, I started with exactly zero views.", "Nobody looked at my website, or read my blog posts, or saw my Github repository.", "I continued to do what I enjoyed, simply because I had a passion for it.", "The rewards of your hard work will come, but you will need to wait. Do things simply because you love to, and not because you want to reap the benefits.", "As of now, I am simultaneously studying and working in the field of data science.", "I wake up everyday excited about learning new things, coming up with ideas, and creating new projects.", "It has been an incredible journey so far \u2014 one which started because I decided to overcome fears and create like nobody was looking.", "The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul \u2014 Elder Uchtdorf", "Your home for data science.
