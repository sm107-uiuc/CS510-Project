This should make sense, as I really have not been under the functional umbrella anywhere near as long as the object-oriented umbrella. Regardless of the features I miss, I still love the functional programming paradigm, and with it the one true love of my life,", "If you haven\u2019t already heard of Julia, firstly,", "and secondly, Julia is a multi-paradigm statistical programming language. Julia combines the simplicity of a scripting language like Python with the speed and versatility of a compiled language like C or Lisp. Julia falls into the functional paradigm, although it has support for all sorts of generics, and the language itself is incredibly mutable, making it versatile. Despite Julia\u2019s versatility, I would still say that it is definitely geared towards statistical programmers. I infer this because Julia cannot be compiled into an executable, is in fact functional, and typical Julia users are scientists of one field or another.", "Typically whenever a language is titled \u201c multi-paradigm,\u201d it just means that there are generic programming concepts that might not be typically associated with that particular paradigm, but can still fit into it one way or another. In this particular case, however, the situation is entirely different, as", "I am basically writing classes in Julia.", "Be fore I explain how I did it, or the benefits to doing things this way, the reason why I wanted to do something like this should be explained first. For those that are unfamiliar, I am a maintainer of a machine-learning library for Julia called Lathe. Lathe is an inclusive package meant to fill Julia\u2019s void of Sklearn-like machine-learning, as well as implement some super cool neuron chains, and transformers as well. The primary objective of Lathe is to be the fastest and easiest solution at this high of a level inside of a great language that many people with an interest in machine-learning are taking note of. And for the module so far, this is certainly the case, and it is only getting better.", "Something I hate about programming is how many packages can be convoluted. With Lathe, there is a universal prediction method, which uses Julia\u2019s awesome dispatch to direct incoming usage. The advantage to this are speed, and more importantly:", "When explicitly imported, Lathe\u2019s functions can be extended and manipulated, bringing the potential for extensions to an all time high. Any end user can import certain methods from Lathe and use the Lathe predict method to predict their answers, or even modify a Lathe function if they desire. Lathe is modular, pieces are able to be added and taken away. On top of that, Lathe comes with an ever-expanding statistics and pre-processing library, and can be a one-stop-shop for all of your ML needs while only requiring two dependencies:", "Given Julia\u2019s speed and efficiency, Lathe is able to out-perform alternatives like Sklearn eight times over while calculating every value in a single function, including weights and variables. This is great because it means that with Lathe you can skip the fitting, and predict in one line, like in this example:", "It is pretty cool, but not without its problems. Every single time the predict method is called, the weights need to be calculated again. This not only sacrifices the accuracy of the model on a per-load basis, but can also be intensive, especially when a Lathe model needs to be deployed into a Genie web-app, like in this tutorial:", "So my goal in this was just that: preserving the one-line predictions that Lathe is known for, while simultaneously finding a way to make calculations whenever a model is constructed. This was additionally challenging in trying to think of a great way to implement the new neural networks i\u2019m working on into Lathe. Having a neural network retrain itself every time that it is predicted with is definitely not optimal. The much neglected object-oriented side of my brain immediately screamed", "But of course, Julia is a functional programming language, so there are no classes, nor are there initialization functions that we can run whenever we make a type\u2026", "While scouring the internet and flipping over to my trusty Jupyter Notebook trying to find a solution, I came across an interesting thread on Julia discourse. The thread was about functions inside of structs, which is a cool feature that you can in fact use in Julia with the right syntax. It might not have done much for me, but it did get me thinking\u2026 What if I took that exact concept, and turned it around by creating a type inside of a function and used the beginning of the function as the initialization function? Here is what I jumped into my notebook to test:", "The idea is that if this worked, we would get a type in the return that holds the data \u201c Age.\u201d That\u2019s not very special, but what is special is the addition of the property of the constructed type addAge, which is in fact a method. So essentially, the Python equivalent of this would be:", "To test this, I first constructed myself:", "And then tried to print back my age:", "So next, I tested the function:", "So now it was working! As usual, my first instinct was to attempt to apply the same concept to simple linear regression. I copied and pasted both the type and the prediction function from Lathe, and removed any and all type assertions, to this result:", "First off, I had to modify the prediction function to cut off the for loop at the end, and only do the calculations prior to return a type that holds the data for both a and b from the simple linear regression formula.", "Apparently, it was at this point that me, a twenty year old man, decided to call this a super struct. Not sure where the name came from, but I like it! Fortunately, this was quite an easy modification, with only one line removed, and one line added. This is great, because it means that changing every function in Lathe won\u2019t take until i\u2019m too old to type on a keyboard. Next up, rather than making the prediction function I decided to go ahead and try to construct the type.", "And now is where there is a problem.", "This very non-traditional approach makes a function that is capable of holding both methods and data, not a struct (yeah, that\u2019s how much of a loophole this is.) I\u2019ll touch on why this is a problem, and a pretty big one that can be nullified but would require a big change to Lathe, but only after we get a prediction out of this thing!", "After finally having a \u201c Type\u201d holding the values we need to plug into the slope\u2019s formula, I did a quick sanity check and checked the values of a and b really quick:", "Which returned a number, as expected, so I went ahead and proceeded with a prediction function:", "Then made up some data that I could track with simple ratios in order to make it easily visible as to whether or not the model is working properly.", "Looking at the data, the output of an accurate prediction should be [20, 30, 40], and sure enough\u2026", "Needless to say, avoiding retraining on every model call should be high on the priority list. I thought it might be great to instead write a separate fit function that is purely optional, but that would require more types, and dispatch for all of the types, and would definitely make the whole system needlessly complicated. Additionally, using this method will actually save a lot of memory from data that didn\u2019t necessarily need to be duplicated into these new types (because we are just using the weights, or in this example a and b.)", "This method would destroy Lathe\u2019s use of Julia\u2019s dispatch. In order to use the dispatch, we need to know the type of struct that is being passed through a method. Given that this is not a struct, and is assigned a random name (at least as far as I can tell,) it would be completely impossible to use Julia\u2019s dispatch with this method. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, though, because this could make it possible to have the predict method be a property of the function, and in turn we would be able to do Model.predict(parameters).", "So with this new-found thought in mind, I decided to return and modify the function to include the prediction method:", "Good gravy, that gets me excited!", "You really do learn something new everyday, and experimentation is half the fun in the programming world. I would love to get some feedback on which you would prefer to use, the dispatch with an optional fit, or the hacky object-oriented version? I\u2019m very surprised and excited that Julia was able to do this to fit my needs, and I hope that this development is a steep advantage over the previous way if it is in fact the future of Lathe!"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url": "https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F533c1d764628&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderCollection&source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Open in app"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fhow-im-using-functional-oop-for-machine-learning-533c1d764628&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign up"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fhow-im-using-functional-oop-for-machine-learning-533c1d764628&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign In"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/?source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnew-story&source=---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_sidenav-----------", "anchor_text": "Write"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/search?source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fhow-im-using-functional-oop-for-machine-learning-533c1d764628&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign up"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fhow-im-using-functional-oop-for-machine-learning-533c1d764628&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign In"}, {"url": "https://emmettgb.medium.com/?source=post_page-----533c1d764628--------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/?source=post_page-----533c1d764628--------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://emmettgb.medium.com/?source=post_page-----533c1d764628--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Emma Boudreau"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fuser%2Fea170050148c&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fhow-im-using-functional-oop-for-machine-learning-533c1d764628&user=Emma+Boudreau&userId=ea170050148c&source=post_page-ea170050148c----533c1d764628---------------------post_header-----------", "anchor_text": "Follow"}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/?source=post_page-----533c1d764628--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Towards Data Science"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Ftowards-data-science%2F533c1d764628&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fhow-im-using-functional-oop-for-machine-learning-533c1d764628&user=Emma+Boudreau&userId=ea170050148c&source=-----533c1d764628---------------------clap_footer-----------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F533c1d764628&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fhow-im-using-functional-oop-for-machine-learning-533c1d764628&source=-----533c1d764628---------------------bookmark_footer-----------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "http://lathe.ai/", "anchor_text": "LatheLathe uses a faster methodology with easy methods.
