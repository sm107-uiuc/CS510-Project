So why is your marketing team using a\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Not all customers are created equal. \u2014 Me (and many other people, too)", "You would never speak to your parents the way you speak to your partner, nor would you speak to your children the way you speak to your manager. So why is your marketing team using a one-size-fits-all language in your marketing materials?", "Leveraging machine learning and AI with the massive amounts of consumer history, web traffic, and product reviews can have a measurable impact on marketing campaigns. By harnessing the power of statistical and analytical tools, customers can be partitioned into segments based on three simple behavioral traits, influencing the language used in multichannel marketing campaigns and resulting in higher CTR and conversion rates.", "As a customer, you don\u2019t want to be seen as just a means to an end. You want to be part of a community. As a retailer, it\u2019s your job to get to know your customers and speak to what you know about them. Don\u2019t be passive, learn their pain points, get to know their purchase habits, and build trust. Revenue will follow.", "Generally, there are four ways to segment your consumer base:", "Google\u2019s BigQuery API allows you to make SQL-like queries on your Google Analytics data. If you have Ecommerce Tracking through your Google Analytics account, you have access to your customer\u2019s behavioral data. The study in question was performed on the Google Merchandise Store\u2019s data from August 2016 to August 2017. Over 740,000 unique people visited the merch store during that time period, resulting in 11,500 purchases totalling over $200,000 dollars.", "In order to supplement the web data we have from the Google Merchandise Store, we\u2019ll engineer a few features in order to \u2018score\u2019 each customer based on the RFM model. This technique takes the recency (R) of the last purchase, the frequency (F) or count of all purchases minus one, and the monetary value (M) defined by the average order amount.", "In order to segment your data, you\u2019ll need to start with three columns: unique customer IDs, dates of transaction, and transaction amount. I used this function to process the Google Merch Store data into a format that we can model from \u2014", "Once we run our dataframe through this function, we\u2019re left with the following information:", "It\u2019s important to note that you may also have visitors to your site who do not make purchases, but this segmentation method is focused on customers who have already converted. Another study can \u2014 and should \u2014 be done on the behaviors of those who do not purchase so you can improve the conversion power of your website.", "Now that our data is ready to cluster, we\u2019ll test a few cluster levels and compare the sum of squared errors in an elbow plot to identify the best level to cluster each feature individually.", "It looks as if Frequency begins to level at five clusters, Recency at four or five, and Revenue at four or five. Depending on your business model, you may have reasons to choose a lower or higher amount of clusters. After a few iterations, I\u2019ve decided on five Frequency, four Recency, and five Revenue.", "From here, we\u2019ll need some helper functions to order clusters from worst to best and assign each datapoint with the corresponding cluster.", "We\u2019ll determine and overall score by adding up each cluster\u2019s score and determine segment stratification from there.", "Depending on your business model, you may already have certain cutoffs for segments. Here, I\u2019ve broken them down to three groups. Inactive, infrequent, low spenders are low value, mid value is higher than average revenue with average \u2014 more than average recency and average to more than average frequency, and high value customers fall into the upper echelons of at least two features.", "And now to visualize each cluster to see how well we did:", "Look at those beautifully defined clusters!", "From this plot, we can see there are customers that have not spent a lot of money but frequently stop by the site and have made purchases recently that also fall into the high value category. Scores seem to be pulled down by either very infrequent purchases or made their last purchase far in the past.", "From here, you can pass the information on to your marketing team, or if you ARE the marketing team, use this information to move forward with crafting language for email marketing campaigns or ads that target each customer\u2019s specific purchase behavior. You\u2019ve sewn the seeds, now see how your revenue grows!", "Your home for data science.
