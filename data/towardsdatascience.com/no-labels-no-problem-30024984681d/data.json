Whilst this new industry is creating thousands of jobs, workers can be underpaid and exploited.", "The market for data labelling passed $500 million in 2018 and it will reach $1.2 billion by 2023. It accounts for 80 percent of the time spent building A.I. technology.", "A.I. Is Learning From Humans. Many Humans. New York Times", "The ability, therefore, to automate the process for creating data labels is highly desirable from a cost, time and even ethical standpoint.", "In this post, we will explore how this can be achieved through a worked example in Python using the excellent Snorkel library.", "Snorkel is a really innovative concept; create a series of \u2018messy\u2019 label functions and combine these in an intelligent way to build labels for a data set. These labels can then be used to train a machine learning model in exactly the same way as in a standard machine learning workflow. Whilst it is outside the scope of this post it is worth noting that the library also helps to facilitate the process of augmenting training sets and also monitoring key areas of a dataset to ensure a model is trained to handle these effectively.", "Snorkel itself has been around since 2016 but has continued to evolve. It is now used by many of the big names in the industry (Google, IBM, Intel). Version 0.9 in 2019 brought with it a more sophisticated way of building a label model, as well as a suite of well documented tutorials covering all of the key areas of the software. Even if you have come across it before, with these updates it is worth a second look.", "Before we get started with a worked example, it is worth considering when you should use this library over a traditional (manual) approach of creating labels. If the answer to all of the below is \u2018Yes\u2019 then it would be worth considering Snorkel:", "The process for using Snorkel is a simple one:", "This process is iterative and you will find yourself evaluating the results and re-thinking and refining the label functions to improve the output.", "Let's take a real life problem to show how Snorkel can be used a machine learning pipeline.", "We will be trying to split out \u2018frameworks\u2019 from \u2018contracts\u2019 in an open source commercial dataset (from Contracts Finder, a UK transparency system which logs all Government contracts above \u00a310k).", "A framework can be thought of as a \u2018parent agreement\u2019. It is a way of settling the \u2018Ts and Cs\u2019 with one or more suppliers which then allow for contracts to be agreed without having to go through the paperwork all over again.", "The issue is, because there is a parent-child relationship between frameworks and contracts, this can lead to double counting when analysing the data. It is therefore important to be able to split out frameworks from contracts.", "The data in this example consists of a contract title, description and value. The below shows an example of what we have to work with:", "We have a placeholder column called \u2018framework\u2019 which we will be using to add our labels. The naming convention we will use is:", "We will start by creating a series of label functions. These can essentially be any standard Python function and can be as simple (or as complex) as you need them to be.", "We will start with a simple keyword search on the data set. This example searches for the phrase:", "\u201cuse by uk public sector bodies\u201d", "as this is only likely to occur in the descriptions of frameworks. Snorkel makes this really simple, all you have to do is wrap a standard Python function with the decorator @labeling_function():", "Great we have just created our first label function! We now build up a number of other functions which will help separate frameworks from contracts.", "Tips on creating effective labelling functions", "After working with the library, the following guidelines should be helpful in designing effective label functions:", "Once you have built one or more labelling functions, you need to apply these to create a set of data points. This can be achieved using the PandasLFApplier which allows you to build these data points directly from a Pandas dataframe.", "Note that in this example we have a train and \u2018dev\u2019 set of data. The dev set is a small data set of manually labelled items (our \u2018Gold\u2019 labels). This makes things easier to quickly get a rough sense of how label functions are performing (the alternative to eyeballing the results produced).", "Once you have applied your label functions, Snorkel provides easy access to label performance by using LFAnalysis", "As we have a dev set of information with labels this will provide us with the below information:", "The meaning of each of these is below (straight from the Snorkel documentation):", "Once we are happy with our label functions, we can bring these together in a probabilistic model. This is Snorkel\u2019s \u2018magic source\u2019 which combines the outputs of each of the functions and either returns the probability of a data point having a particular label, or the labels themselves.", "Depending on the coverage of our label functions we will need to filter out some of our training data before using the labels to train a machine learning model. The reason is that some data points will not have been picked up by any of our label functions. We want to remove these items as they will add noise to the training data. Snorkel has an inbuilt function which makes this easy:", "You now have a training set of data with labels without having to perform any manual labelling on the dataset.", "You can use these as a starting point for a supervised machine learning task.", "As highlighted earlier, the documentation on the Snorkel is excellent and there are a number of in-depth tutorials which go into greater depth of the features available within the library:", "Your home for data science.
