If you are wondering what the heck is Machine Learning (ML), how is Data Analysis related to ML, and why do we hear about Python every time you came across ML/Data Analysis? worry no more you are about to find your answers now.", "Once you complete reading this article you will have some basic understanding of what is Machine Learning, why is Python so popular to perform Data Analysis for ML models and you will be able to confidently join a conversation at your workplace on ML. This article can be your first step in the journey to learn these technologies. So, let\u2019s not delay anymore and jump right into the topics.", "Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence(AI), where you train a model to think and work like a human by extracting patterns from the data provided. If an ML program is fed with 99 rows of data, your algorithm will be able to predict the 100th row without explicitly programmed by a human. Machine learning is broadly classified into three techniques that are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning. In this article, we would be working on the Supervised Learning use-case where you can learn more about it. There are many great articles on medium.com that talk out ML but I found an article, which lays out a complete overview of Machine learning in simple terminology that might be helpful to you to understand more about ML.", "What is Data Analysis?In Layman\u2019s term, Data Analysis is nothing but understanding your Data. Before the era of the internet, data was very much limited as the sources were minimal. But, now pretty much everything is a source of data from the smartphone in your hand to your search history. So, now we not only have zillions of data but also varieties of it such as structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Let us take an example of a simple excel sheet with 100 columns and over 50k records as your data source. To get some useful output from the data, you need to start understanding it first. So, you might follow these steps to analyze the data.", "That\u2019s it! You have done the basic steps of cleansing and analyzing the data source. Of-course, data won\u2019t be a simple excel sheet when you are working for an organization. Data can be in any format or any type: it can be a CSV file, log dump files, transactional files, databases, etc. Analyzing them with human effort only will be a challenging and tedious task. So, we take the help of various programming languages available like Python, R, Java, SQL, Scala, etc. also many tools like IBM SPSS, Power BI, Matlab. Now, this leads us to our next topic in the article why we use Python for Data Analysis and why it is the best language for a Data Scientist or enthusiast to learn.", "Why is Python so popular for Machine Learning?", "To your surprise Python is in existence since the \u201990s. But it has become popular these days because of its open-source community. Python has more advantages over many programming languages like:", "Libraries are nothing but a collection of functions or methods which you can use them in your code to perform certain actions by just importing and calling them when required instead of writing it all from scratch. Python has powerful libraries for Machine Learning like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scrapy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Plotly, etc..", "Now don\u2019t get confused or overwhelmed by all those libraries and their names. Ideally, you won\u2019t be using all of them to perform Data Analysis and generate ML models. But to have good knowledge about some of them is desirable for a data scientist that makes his job much easier. You will get a better understanding of these libraries when you utilize them for a use-case so, enough of talking about libraries. Let\u2019s jump into some action by trying to solve a use-case using Data Analysis techniques with the help of Python and building a predictive machine learning model.", "As I mentioned earlier there are tons of resources available on the Internet to learn ML, Data Analysis, and Python. By utilizing some of these resources we will dig through an Adult Salary Dataset available in UCI Machine Learning Repo or Kaggle.", "I have incorporated my work on this dataset in my Kaggle Notebook that can be found here. This notebook has appropriate comments on each line of code for better understanding and also I would be using code snippets from the notebook to elaborate more in this article.", "Problem statement: You have been provided with an Excel dataset that has 15 columns and 48842 rows. Our task is to analyze the dataset and predict whether the income of an adult will exceed 50k per year or not by developing a supervised machine learning model.", "Ok, let\u2019s start by importing some of the required libraries/modules. As I mentioned earlier in this article, libraries are nothing but tons of lines of code that are already written, all you need to do is to utilize them when needed. Comments over each of the imports will explain the purpose.", "The next step is to load the dataset.", "Now, if you follow closely this one line of code above may have intrigued you. This one line of code explains a lot about Python\u2019s simple and natural language syntax. As we want to read/load a CSV, we just use the read_csv() function provided by the Pandas library which we already imported and aliased it as pd. So, now all we need to do is to call the appropriate function from the library i.e. pd.read_csv(). This shows us how powerful the Python libraries are that can load a CSV file in a single line.", "Let\u2019s start analyzing the excel provided. We need to know the number of columns, rows, null objects, etc. So, let\u2019s open the excel sheet and start counting the columns, get the row count, go through each row to find out any special characters or null values in it, find out the data type of each column provided. Sounds tedious and cumbersome right? don\u2019t worry, Python and its libraries are here to help, let\u2019s find out how.", "see how easy it is, again just a line of code where we call the appropriate function .info() provided by pandas. We get all of the information which we are looking like data type, count of null, row count, etc.", "we see that some column names have special characters in them. It would be better for us to remove them as they may cause issues for our data analysis. We can do this easily using Pandas .rename() function as shown below", "Taking a glance at the data provided, we can see that there are some special characters in the data like \u2018?\u2019. So, let\u2019s get the count of special characters present in the data.", "Having special characters in the data is not advisable because this may lead to incorrect data analysis and prediction models. So, we need to get rid of them. To achieve that we can leverage the libraries as shown below.", "First, replace all the \u2018?\u2019 with NaN(NaN is used as a placeholder for missing data in pandas), to do that, use python\u2019s string replace() function with NumPy\u2019s(imported as np earlier) nan.", "Second, Use the .dropna() function to drop the rows with missing values. dropna() can drop either columns or rows, by default, it will delete rows if the axis keyword is not mentioned. how=\u2019any\u2019 will remove the rows if any missing values are present in them. You can learn more about dropna() at this w3resource link.", "Machine Learning model requires input data in numerical notations to extract patterns from it and make predictions. But, not all the data provided in our source dataset is numerical. Some of the data provided are Categorical data like WorkClass, Education, Marital-Status, Occupation, Relationship, etc. we need to convert these into numerical notations.", "Here data is nothing but a feature that our model uses as an input. So, we perform Feature Engineering on our data to create meaningful numerical data out of the source dataset.", "We are provided with 15 features(columns), our end goal is to predict the income feature which makes income as our Dependent Variable. If any of the remaining 14 features are affecting the target feature, then those features are known as Independent Variables.", "To maintain the brevity of the article and to avoid irrelevant data for our model, we will avoid the less unique or noisy features from our input data. This helps us to refine our features to identify the independent variables. But, this might not apply to all datasets, it depends on what kind of data you are dealing with and how important is the feature.", "Here we ran a for loop over all the columns using the .value_counts() function of Pandas which gets us the count of unique values. We can see that some of the data provided are unique like the \u2018workclass\u2019 attribute which has only 7 distinct values and some columns have a lot of distinct values like fnlgwt attribute which has around 2000+ values.", "So, let\u2019s drop the attributes that have noisy data.", "Pandas .drop() function is used to remove specified columns or rows. axis=1 represents that we are intending to drop the column itself, inplace=True is to mention that we are replacing the original dataframe i.e df with the cleaned dataset after dropping the columns.", "Now, we are left with 8 features which are Categorical data. As we discussed earlier we need to convert this data into numerical notations that our ML model can understand. There are many different ways to achieve this data conversion as elaborated here. The simple and basic way of replacing the categorical data with numerics i.e. using Pandas .map() function.", "Let\u2019s start with our target attribute which is the income column. We see that the income column has two Unique values that are \u2018<=50K\u2019 and \u2018>50K\u2019. We can easily map these string characters to numerical data using .map() function as shown below.", "we can see that now our income attribute has numerical data. Pandas .map() function has replaced every \u2018<=50K\u2019 with 0 value and \u2018>50K\u2019 with 1 and .astype(int) is to mention that replaced value should be of type int.", "Using the map function, we can convert all the other categorical data in the dataset to numerical data.", "The final numerical output of our dataset will be:", "So, here we are finally at our all numerical notations dataset. which can be now fed into any ML predictive modeling algorithm. Before we try to do that we should visualize the data and look for any correlations we can derive between the variables of our dataset.", "Here we would try to find out a relation between each column of the final numerical dataset and the target attribute income. This can be achieved by creating a Bar graph between income and each of the other columns.", "We are plotting a Bar graph using the pandas .plot() function to visualize the relationship between education and income attributes. We achieve it by grouping the values of education using pandas .groupby() function against the mean of income attribute using .mean(). In the same way, we can plot the Bar graphs for all the other independent attributes against income as we see below.", "By these visualizations, we can deduce some correlations between our independent attributes and dependent attribute:", "We can see that all of our numerical attributes have some influence on our target variable income. So, we should create an ML model by feeding all of our numerical data as input to it.", "There are around 60+ predictive modeling algorithms that are available to choose from. We must have a good understanding of our data and the desired solution we are looking for, to narrow down our model selection. Here our goal is to predict the income which can either be 0 or 1 ( less than 50K or greater than 50K) and we want to identify a relation between our output (income) and remaining independent features ( education, workclass, gender, etc. ). This scenario is a classic example of Classification (classify whether income is <50K or more ).", "We are provided with 48K rows of the labeled dataset tagged with the output column \u201cincome\u201d to train our model. Whenever the dataset is labeled and output feature is known, we opt for the Supervised Learning Machine Learning technique. So, our use-case is a Supervised Learning plus Classification problem. Based on these criteria we can narrow down our choice of models to a few:", "Logistic Regression is one of the easiest and most commonly used supervised Machine learning algorithms for categorical classification. The basic fundamental concepts of Logistic Regression are easy to understand and can be used as a baseline algorithm for any binary (0 or 1) classification problem. For this use-case, we are going to choose Logistic Regression as our classification model as it would be a good start for any beginner to start with a simple yet popular algorithm.", "Logistic Regression is a Statistical predicting model that can predict either a \u2018Yes\u2019(1) or \u2018No\u2019(0). It is based on a Logit or Sigmoid function which ranges between 0 and 1. Now don\u2019t get scared by hearing a Mathematical function. Let me explain it to you in simple terms.", "If we observe here, the sigmoid function is an \u2018S\u2019 shaped curve that extends between values 0 and 1 which is plotted based on the output of the function when it is fed with a set of data. We can see the sigmoid function equation is 1 divided by 1 plus e raised to -z where is e is a mathematical constant called Euler\u2019s Number.", "So, the output of the equation should be something between 0 and 1. if the value of z goes to positive infinity value the predicted value will be 1 or if it goes to negative infinity it goes to 0. If you feed the sigmoid function with the numerical data we have we will get a value which is either less than 0.5 i.e classified as 0 or more than 0.5 which is classified as 1.", "Alright! this is all the Math behind the logistic regression, it is really up to you to learn and understand it, as Python\u2019s scikit library will solve all of these math problems for you with a single function call. But, for a good Data Scientist knowing all the mathematical background is a must.", "Now let\u2019s see how we can leverage Scikit python libraries to solve our classification problem.", "Here we are dividing our data into a dependent feature that is income as df_y and independent features that are relationship, race, occupation, gender, marital, workclass as df_x.", "We start by calling the function LogisticRegression() from the scikit library and assigning it to a variable reg. Then we split our data into a test set and train set using train_test_split() which helps to better train the model and test its performance. test_size=0.33 creates a test data set with 33% of the data we have and the remaining 77% percent will be our training set to train our model. This split function returns us a pair of the train set (x_train,y_train) and a pair of the test set (x_test,y_test).", "Then we train our model using .fit() function providing it with our train sets and get the output predictions using .predict() function by feeding test sets.", "Now let\u2019s verify how our model is working.", "we provided test data to our model to predict based on the assumptions we made earlier using data visualization. As we assumed that a person\u2019s income will be more than 50K if the relationship status is either 1 or 4, education is 7 or 10, the race is 1 or 3, occupation is 5 or 7, gender is male i.e 0, marital status is 2 or 6 and workclass is 0 or 2. So, our has correctly predicted that a person with these features will surely be able to earn more than 50K and returned a prediction value of 1.", "we can evaluate our model using various model evaluation metrics such as accuracy provided by the sklearn library of python.", "we achieved an accuracy value of 76% which is good for any machine learning prediction model particularly for a classification regression problem.", "Finally! we successfully created a classification Machine Learning prediction model using Python and its powerful libraries which predicts whether a given adult\u2019s income will be >50K or not.", "I hope you spend 15 mins of quality time reading this article and gained some knowledge of what is Data Analysis, how to build Machine learning models, and how python helps us to build those models.
