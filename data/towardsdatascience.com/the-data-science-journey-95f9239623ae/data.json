Platforms like Medium have made getting started with blogging easier than ever.", "Note: More details on how to begin blogging is beyond the scope of this post but if you\u2019d like to learn more then I\u2019d recommend viewing Ayodeji Awosika\u2019s Youtube Channel .", "When I first learnt to drive, it took me some time to get used to the car (mainly clutch control) but once I was comfortable enough I took my test and passed. Now, I only drive my car when I need to go somewhere\u2026", "In the same way, when you\u2019ve had a feel around the various aspects of Data Science and have become somewhat comfortable (i.e. data cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization and modelling) we take a test, which may mean being hired or winning a competition etc. When we pass, the idea is to now use your skills to take you to various destinations.", "In this post, I will share how I planned my journey in Data Science.", "Note: This assumes you\u2019ve had some exposure to Data Science", "Success is relative, hence you ought to define what success means and looks like to you or someone else will!", "Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.", "Prior to starting my Data Science Blog, I was reading many articles surrounding the topics such as how people made $2000+ per month from blogging or how they went viral in 4 months, and how to get 5000+ followers in x amount of days/weeks/months \u2014 I don\u2019t read these post anymore!", "I am not saying that those things aren\u2019t a cute way to tickle one\u2019s own ego, but as I\u2019ve grown as a writer, I\u2019ve realised that these are only by-products of real success, nonetheless I adopted these things to be my gauge for success.", "When you take the success of others to be your measurement gauge for success then you are setting yourself up to be miserable.", "Although the initial intention was to retain what I\u2019ve been learning, when I saw what others were able to do on Medium, I instantly wanted a taste. I wanted to get 10,000 followers in 4 months, then I switched my goal to making $2000 per month, then I wanted to land more job offers. But WHY? I had no reason for any of these things.", "Had it not been for my previous company furloughing me when Covid-19 put the world on pause, I\u2019d probably of stopped blogging altogether.", "I used the example of a blog because now the blog works in cohesion with where I want to go as a Data Scientist.
