Their career thrill is to prove that the previously-impossible is possible.

Perhaps they\u2019ll turn those blueprints into a device that does the job, but expect it to be held together by hope and sticky tape\u2026 slam the door and it falls apart.

The team that does this part of the work huddles together to nerd out on design thinking, reliability, and efficiency. They do user studies to ensure that they build tools you actually fall in love with. Unfortunately, you don\u2019t see a lot of them entering a space until some poor suckers have suffered through demonstrating that the unfriendly version has a market. In the infancy of the microwave, there weren\u2019t any idiot-proof versions mass produced and sold in household goods stores. AI has been in that kind of infancy for a long time, but now that its proving useful, the toolmakers are stepping up!
