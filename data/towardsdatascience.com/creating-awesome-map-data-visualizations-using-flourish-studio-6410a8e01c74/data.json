We generate a lot of geospatial data in the form of weather data, google maps, GPS coordinates and geotagged social media posts to name a few and it is becoming an integral part of our lives and business. A McKinsey study suggests that the acceleration of location-based sensor proliferation, which is enabling the Internet of Things, may have an economic impact of more than $11 trillion per year by 2025. Visualizing map data makes the insights clearer and more intuitive and gets the attention of the audience. But many people find spatial analysis and visualizations very difficult to perform compared to statistical analysis. In this blog, we will discuss how to create interactive map data visualizations using Flourish, an open source data visualization and storytelling platform.", "There is a lot of dedicated software available for geospatial analysis and visualizations. QGIS and CARTO are some of the widely used geospatial analytics software for high end analytics on geospatial data. Statistical software like R and Python also has many dedicated packages for geospatial analysis. But when you want to do some quick analysis of geospatial data and create interactive visualizations, these tools are not so user-friendly. Apart from the codes that you have to write, making the visualization interactive for online publication is a bit tricky.", "Flourish comes with six pre-loaded templates for making interactive map visualizations. You can upload your data on the existing geographical map templates or upload your own geographic boundary file. The six map visualization templates are as follows:", "We will look at how to create three different types of map visualizations based on the nature of the geospatial data.", "How to create animated visualization focusing on different geographical regions?", "Suppose you have national level data for different countries and want to tell a data story focusing on specific geographies that have performed well and geographies that have not, then you can use projection map template for World that already exists in Flourish. When you open the World template and click the \u2018Data\u2019 tab, you can understand in what format the data should be just by looking at the dummy data already available. Once you upload your data in the required format, you can click the \u2018Preview\u2019 data tab and change the visualization settings available on the right side of the page.", "Flourish comes with this amazing option to create a data story using the visualizations you create. There is \u2018Create a story\u2019 link in the top right corner of the visualization page which lets us tell your data story with a slides template just like PowerPoint presentation. Once you create your story you can publish it in Flourish server and embed the story in any online resource. Here is the visualization I created to show the most popular football clubs of each continent based on their social media following.", "Currently, Flourish doesn\u2019t have an option to create gifs or videos from the visualizations created. You can create a video or gif by using one of the screen to gif softwares available. Giphy Capture for Macs and ScreenToGif for Windows are popular softwares used. The gif or video can be created by following these steps:", "\u00b7 Open the visualization that you have published", "\u00b7 Adjust the screen of the size of the screen to fit the visualization", "\u00b7 Record a video or gif screenshot of the relevant part of the screen, clicking between slides and zooming in relevant parts of the map", "\u00b7 Save the recording as gif or video as desired", "Compared to gif, video is a better quality output but the file size will be larger and there might be issues in uploading.", "How to create Connections Globe map?", "We face situations where we want to visualize movement of people and goods across different geographies \u2014 be it visualizing migration of people across countries or visualizing the migratory pattern of birds. Most statistical software doesn\u2019t have the functions to analyse mobility data visually. Flourish has this Connections globe template that lets you visualize mobility seamlessly. Having the geographical coordinates of the source and destination is sufficient to create the connections globe map. This visualization is highly interactive and you can rotate and zoom in the globe as required. You have lots of design and display options available to customize the map.", "Here I have created a connections globe map to visualize the top 15 countries to which Indian nationals migrate based on the number of Non-Resident Indians living in these countries.", "How to create a simple bubble map visualizations?", "It is very easy to create choropleth maps and bubble maps using the Projection map template of Flourish. Flourish has its own in-built template for certain geographies like World, US (states), US (counties), India (state), UK, Spain, Brazil etc. Here is the bubble map I created showing Indian states based on their GDP per capita values.", "What to do when required geographic boundary file is not available?", "Flourish has limited geographic files where you can just upload your data to visualize. If you can\u2019t find the map for your country, you have the option to upload your own geographic boundary file. There are many online resources from where you can download geographic shape files of different countries. GADM is one of the popular resource that provides maps and spatial data for all countries and their sub-divisions. You can download these geographic shape files free of charge.", "Flourish is a user friendly data visualization platform to create powerful and interactive data stories. It is a perfect medium to create different types of map data visualizations with minimum effort. Explore Flourish to understand what other types of data visualizations can be done.", "Your home for data science.
