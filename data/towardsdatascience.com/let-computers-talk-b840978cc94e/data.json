Language is the most fundamental block of civilization, which is a requirement for thinking and communicating. Humans created computers and armed them with language to facilitate problem-solving. How does it exactly happen? The procedure is straightforward: Humans think, talk to computers and give them orders via algorithms, and then computers can do some work and talk to themselves to solve the problems (Fig. 1). Language is the basis of this procedure and provides a way for human-computer and computer-computer communication.", "Language is a tool for communication and conveying information through messages. The building block of a language is the alphabet, which is a set of symbols. Having an alphabet, we can create words \u2014 atomic references to simple concepts \u2014 by putting symbols together\u00b9. A valid sentence \u2014 a reference to more complex concepts \u2014 can be considered as a sequence of words with the right grammar (Sentence is called string in the theory of automata and message in communication). Language is the set of all grammatically correct sentences. Hence, we can define language L as a triple (A, W, G) where A is the alphabet, W is the set of words, and G is the underlying grammar which specifies the validity of a sentence. Let\u2019s see examples of different languages.", "As you can see, different languages have different use cases; for example, written language is not proper for blind people, and they may use Braille code. Another aspect is the hardness of creating (coding) and understanding (decoding) messages. For example, cave paintings are simple to create and understand, while in order to use written language, you should go to school first. However, written language is more powerful than cave paintings because you can not say \u201cplease wait!\u201d just by painting.", "How can humans and computers solve problems together? First, we need to know what exactly computers can do. Physically they are made of electricity and wires, and roughly speaking, they can only sense the existence of electric current (exist or not). Due to this binary nature, they can work with binary sequences: take binary inputs in their gates and process them. In this way, we can provide them instructions and implement some basic operations by digital circuits: read from and write to memory (registers, RAM or disk), add, shift, and so on. Hence, we can collect all gates\u2019 inputs, sort them in a predefined format (grammar), and build a language with the {0,1} alphabet. This language is called machine code. For example, an R-type MIPS instruction has the following format: 6 bits opcode comes first, then we have three 5 bits register names (totally 15 bits), then 5 bits shift code, and at the end 6 bits function code, which makes it a sequence of total 32 symbols.", "Machine code is the language computers understand, although we can not use it directly, because it\u2019s hard to use. We use another language named assembly language which is a handbook for computers written in English. For example \u201cadd $s1, $s2, $s3\u201d means adding the content of registers s1 and s2 and putting the result in register s3, in MIPS assembly. Now the question is, how we can translate assembly language to machine code?", "Suppose L1 is assembly language and L2 is machine code. In order to translate L1 to L2 (encoding), we can simply map W1 (add, shift, $s1, \u2026) to W2 (binary sequences) by assigning some predefined codewords (e.g. \u2018add\u2019 maps to 000000) and put these codewords together with the correct grammar, which is easily done by the assembler. Hence, having machine code and assembly language, we can talk to computers. But can you translate your thoughts into assembly language? The answer is no. A higher-level programming language, more similar to human language, is needed. Programming languages such as Java and Python, together with their compilers and interpreters, are designed for this purpose. Hence, a hierarchy of languages builds our interaction with computers.", "Now, we have solved our problems, and it\u2019s time for communication! Suppose Alicia wants to talk to Bobby via the network between their computers. But using computer networks, we can only transfer bits, which is the alphabet of computer language. Therefore the solution is to first translate our language to some bits (encode), then transfer those bits, and finally translate them back (decode). So we should design a language with a binary alphabet and specify how to translate our language to that. Morse code is a nice case to investigate now.", "Suppose L1 is the English language, and we want to establish L2 (Morse code) by setting A2, W2, and G2. We can simply set A2={dot, dash}, which is a binary alphabet. But unlike assembly language, the English language has many words, and we can not simply build a one to one mapping between W1 and W2. The solution of Morse code is to first map each symbol in A1 to a codeword (e.g. \u201cA\u201d \u2192 \u201cdot-dash\u201d) and then concatenate them to reach the word representations (e.g. \u201cAS\u201d \u2192 \u201cdot-dash dot-dot-dot\u201d) in W2. G2 is also not that hard, and almost any sequence of codewords is valid in L2. In this way, we can translate our language to Morse code and communicate via computers.", "What is the cost of communication? Consider this question: why do we not assign \u201cA\u201d to \u201cdash-dash-dot-dash\u201d instead of \u201cQ\u201d in Morse code? Because A is much more common than Q, and using \u201cdot-dash\u201d will lead to messages with a much shorter length. So we can define the cost of communication as the length of transmitting messages (#symbols) and define the optimal coding: the one which leads to shorter messages on average. This is the answer preferred by information theory.", "Information theory studies the underlying limitations of communications and tries to find the minimum number of bits required to code a message, based on the assumption that a source of information is generating a sequence of words (a stochastic process) with known probability distribution\u00b2. Assuming we have k words with discrete probability distribution p on them and an i.i.d. source, Shannon showed that for the optimal codeword assignment, a message with N words would be encoded to at least N*H(p) bits, where H(p) is the Shannon entropy of p which is a measure of uncertainty: H(p)=\u03a3pi*log(1/pi). In fact, in the optimal codeword assignment, we try to assign shorter codewords to more probable outcomes, and if the probability of seeing word wi is pi, we try to assign it to a codeword with non-integer length of log(1/pi) (e.g. via Huffman coding) and when N goes to infinity, the problem of codes with non-integer length fades out.", "What class of problems can be solved via computers? With what cost? These questions are known under the names of decidability and complexity and find their answers in the field of theory of automata\u00b3. For a yes/no problem\u2074, we can put the representation of all positive instances in a set, and build a language. So we should decide whether a representation is a member of this language or not. Making this decision by the machine may be possible or impossible, and the difficulty of the problem lies here.", "Some languages like the ones generated by regular expressions (regular languages) and context free grammars (context free languages) are easy to decide by finite automata and push-down automata, respectively. But some languages may have a more complex hidden structure (grammar) and may be harder to decide or recognize, even by a Turing machine. For example, the set of all valid C++ codes is decidable because it is a context free language, and C++ compilers can decide it. However, the set of multivariate polynomials with an integral root is not decidable; it means that there is no guaranteed algorithm to approve whether a multivariate polynomial has an integral root or not.", "Even if a language is decidable, the time complexity of deciding it is an important problem. Time complexity is measured by the maximum number of operations needed to reach the answer of an input with length n (e.g. it can be n\u00b2). Usually, we need solutions with polynomial time complexity, and exponential solutions are not applicable. The problems which have polynomial deciders build the class of P, while the problems with polynomial verifiers build the class of NP. These concepts are discussed in the field of complexity.", "Your home for data science.
