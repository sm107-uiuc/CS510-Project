We could\u2019ve thought that we can make predictions and train the model in the same way as with \u201cnormal\u201d data. Surprisingly, machine learning tasks are defined much differently on graphs and we can categorize it into 4 types: node classification, link prediction, learning over the whole graph, and community detection. In this article, we look closer at how they\u2019re defined and understand why they\u2019re so much different from standard machine learning tasks.", "Let\u2019s imagine that we have a network of friendships between animals . The animal can be either a dog, a cat, or a duck and we can describe it with additional features such as weight, height, and colour. A connection between two specific animals means that they like each other. Our goal, given this friendship network and features, will be to predict the missing types of the animal. This prediction task is known as the node classification.", "Let\u2019s formalize the notation. Mathematically, we can define this animal friendship network as G = (V, \u0395), where V is a node (animal), and E is edge (friendship connection). Also, each node has a respective feature vector xi (weight, height, and colour), where i means that the vector belongs to the node Vi. The goal of the node classification task is to predict label yi given the node Vi and its neighbours.", "Now, how can we use machine learning models to predict these animal types? Most of the machine learning models are based on the fact that data points are independent from each other (i.i.d assumption). Here this assumption fails because the node labels (animal type) might be dependent on other neighbouring nodes [1]. For example, it is more probable that the node closer to the cluster of cats is also a cat. Similar nodes are typically closer together which is known as homophily.", "Because the data independence doesn\u2019t work in this case anymore, we can\u2019t classify this classification task as supervised learning. It is often referred by researchers as semi-supervised learning because we can use information from neighbouring nodes to predict a certain node [1].", "The objective of the link prediction is to decide whether there is a connection between two nodes. In our previous example with animal friendships graph, it is just a prediction of whether the neighbouring animals are friends.", "Similarly to the node classification, we can also leverage neighbourhood information to predict the link between two nodes. A popular group of approaches for link predictions is called heuristic methods [2]. They compute certain scores from the graph itself and convert it into likelihood of the link between two nodes. Heuristic methods can be divided by the maximum number of neighbourhood hops that have to occur [2]. For example, Common Neighbours is a first-order heuristics as it requires only the direct neighbourhood of the node to compute the score (and not neighbours of the neighbours). In the image below, we can see the 1st neighbourhood of nodes V1 and V3.", "Frog V1 and V3 have 2 friends (neighbouring nodes) in common: V6 and V2. With this simple score, the Common Neighbours algorithm decides whether there is a link between two nodes or not.", "Of course, there are more complex approaches, for example, the Resource Allocation (2nd order heuristics) which uses information from 2nd-order hops [2]. In the case of the node V5, RA would use for its algorithm V4 and V6 from the 1st neighbourhood and V1 and V3 from the 2nd neighbourhood. Other approaches can use even higher order heuristics to generate graph features for link prediction.", "Similarly to the node classification, the link prediction is also known as semi-supervised learning as we use neighbourhood information to predict the link between two nodes.", "Let\u2019s change the example. Consider, that we have now a molecular data and our task is to predict if the given molecule is toxic. The illustration below shows how this classification task can be designed using graph neural networks.", "We can consider each molecule as a separate graph where an atom is a node and link between atoms is an edge. This is an example of the classification task over the whole graph. The difference here is that we are given multiple instances of different graphs and train our model on them [1]. We learn over the whole graph instead of predicting specific components within a single graph such as a node or an edge.", "What is compelling about the learning task over multiple instances of graphs, is that datapoints are considered to be i.i.d. It means that this learning task on graphs is very similar, if not the same, to classification, regression, and clustering tasks that are used in standard machine learning problems. Those are great news for us because we can reuse methods from standard machine learning algorithms such as RandomForest, SVMs, or XGBoost.", "Shortly speaking, a community detection for graphs can be considered as a clustering task of nodes within a single graph. Let\u2019s have a look at an example below that shows a network of scientist that co-authored at least one paper together.", "Here, the task of community detection would be to identify these clusters of scientists working in different fields. Although it seems to be intuitive, clusters of communities are rather vaguely defined and differ in size and shapes amongst different datasets [4]. The communities can also overlap making it even harder to differentiate between them.", "Intuitively, we can suspect that nodes inside the communities will have more connections to neighbouring edges. There will be also nodes that have fewer edges and connect different communities. Those are the theoretical foundations that most of the community detection algorithms are based on. There are many different types of community detection algorithms but the most popular are methods based on spectral clustering, statistical inference, optimization, and dynamics [6].", "We\u2019ve seen that there are 4 major types of machine learning tasks on graphs: node classification, link prediction, learning over the whole graph, and community detection. Most of these tasks are very different from normal supervised/unsupervised learning. This is because graphs are interconnected with each other and data independence assumption fails. Researchers refer to it as semi-supervised learning.", "I am an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Amsterdam.
