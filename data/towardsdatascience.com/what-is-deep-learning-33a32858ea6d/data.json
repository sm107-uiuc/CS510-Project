It will answer two basic questions that come up a lot when people hear me talk enthusiastically about Artificial Intelligence. Why is Deep Learning \u201cdeep\u201d and how is it related to the human brain?", "In my opinion, a lot of the information you can find on the internet these days about this topic is either very mathematical, very technical, or just completely wrong. The basic idea behind Deep Learning is actually pretty simple and intuitive! Are you curious?", "I promise you, without diving too deep, you\u2019ll be able to understand this. Let\u2019s answer these questions!", "Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning. Given a certain input, we predict an output based on the statistics we derive from data. Sounds vague, maybe, but it will become clear soon with an example.", "As the amount of data increases, predicting an outcome becomes increasingly more difficult. The difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning is the ability to detect multiple patterns. It involves layers, hence it becomes \u201cdeep\u201d.", "Let\u2019s explain that using a simple task. We need to predict if an animal inside a picture is a cat or a dog.", "In traditional Machine Learning, this is a simple problem with an input (a picture) and output layer (cat or dog). Because it has a direct mapping from input to output, it basically predicts a function that separates all cats and dogs. Historically, Machine Learning did this very well by extracting characteristics (feature engineering) like the length of the cat, hair, color, etc. Instead of using the raw image, we used these features to predict the cat or dog. You can imagine, this is quite a task.", "Deep Learning provided us with a way to do things differently. They introduced the concept of adding layers! By pushing the raw data through multiple layers, every layer extracts features. The first layer extracts some low-level patterns, while later layers extract more and more high-level features.", "The image below sketches how this could look like, while in practice it is not always possible to give a nice visual representation of the learning process.", "By exposure to training data, modern deep learning neural networks sometimes have well beyond 10, 100, or even more layers \u2014 all learned automatically! The results are astonishing, blowing away years of traditional Machine Learning research on difficult problems!", "Let\u2019s be clear from the start. We have not re-created the human brain. Deep Learning models are not models of the brain.", "There is no evidence that the brain implements any learning mechanism used in modern deep-learning models \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Chollet", "Terms like \u201cNeural Network\u201d, \u201cNeuron\u201d and others are references to neurobiology. It has indeed been a source of inspiration, but nothing more than that.", "You have to understand that it makes sense that a computer outperforms the human brain in certain tasks, especially where a lot of possibilities need to be calculated.", "It\u2019s easy for us to explain that a smarter person is more likely to win from a dumb person in a game of chess. Well, guess what. If a computer learns every path to victory, he\u2019s likely to be the better person. Deep learning tries to remember every path to victory, allowing it to compete and even beat world-class players in games like chess and go.", "View the field as a mathematical framework that allows us to learn representations and insights from data. It is a very promising area because it offers a lot of opportunities for automation, based on historical data, which could not be done before by using an algorithm.", "This article explained why it\u2019s worth having a look at Deep Learning and move away from traditional Machine Learning methods, especially when you\u2019re dealing with a lot of data.", "This article also puts an end to the myth that we are modeling the human brain. While it\u2019s certainly possible to build interesting applications that outperform humans in certain tasks, it won\u2019t be possible to build better, robot-like, humans anytime soon.", "Your home for data science.
