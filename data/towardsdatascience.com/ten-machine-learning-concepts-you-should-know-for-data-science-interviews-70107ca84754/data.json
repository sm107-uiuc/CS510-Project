That being said, there are only a handful of core ideas that the majority of companies test for. The reason for this is that these ten concepts serve as the base for more intricate ideas and concepts.", "In this article, I\u2019m going to cover what I think are the ten most fundamental machine learning concepts that you should learn and understand.", "With that said, here we go!", "You\u2019re probably wondering why I even bothered to put this in because it\u2019s so fundamental. However, I think that it\u2019s important that you truly understand the difference between the two and are able to communicate the differences:", "Supervised learning involves learning on a labeled dataset where the target variable is known.", "Unsupervised learning is used to draw inferences and find patterns from input data without references to labeled outcomes \u2014 there\u2019s no target variable.", "Now that you know the distinction between the two, you should know whether a machine learning model is supervised or unsupervised, and you should also know whether a given scenario requires a supervised learning algorithm or an unsupervised learning algorithm.", "For example, if I wanted to predict whether a customer buys milk given that they already bought cereal, would that require a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm?", "In order to understand the bias-variance tradeoff, you need to know what bias and variance are.", "Bias is the error due to the model\u2019s assumptions that are made to simplify it. For example, using simple linear regression to model the exponential growth of a virus would result in a high bias.", "Variance refers to the amount that the predicted value would change if different training data was used. In other words, models that place a higher emphasis on the training data will have a higher variance.", "Now the bias-variance tradeoff essentially states that there is an inverse relationship between the amount of bias and variance in a given machine learning model. This means as you decrease the bias of a model, the variance increases, and vice verse. However, there is an optimal point in which a specific amount of bias and variance results in a minimal amount of total error (see below).", "The most common types of regularization methods are called L1 and L2. Both L1 and L2 regularization are methods used to reduce the overfitting of training data.", "L2 Regularization, also called ridge regression, minimizes the sum of the squared residuals plus lambda times the slope squared. This additional term is called the Ridge Regression Penalty. This increases the bias of the model, making the fit worse on the training data, but also decreases the variance.", "If you take the ridge regression penalty and replace it with the absolute value of the slope, then you get Lasso regression or L1 regularization.", "L2 is less robust but has a stable solution and always one solution. L1 is more robust but has an unstable solution and can possibly have multiple solutions.", "Cross-validation is essentially a technique used to assess how well a model performs on a new independent dataset.", "The simplest example of cross-validation is when you split your data into three groups: training data, validation data, and testing data, where you use the training data to build the model, the validation data to tune the hyperparameters, and the testing data to evaluate your final model.", "Which leads to the next point \u2014 evaluation metrics for machine learning models.", "There are several metrics that you can choose from to evaluate your machine learning model, and which one you choose ultimately depends on the type of problem and the objective of the model.", "If you are evaluating a regression model, important metrics include the following:", "Metrics for classification models include the following:", "Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset. This is important mainly in the case when you want to reduce variance in your model (overfitting).", "One of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques is called Principal Component Analysis or PCA. In its simplest sense, PCA involves project higher dimensional data (eg. 3 dimensions) to a smaller space (eg. 2 dimensions). This results in a lower dimension of data, (2 dimensions instead of 3 dimensions) while keeping all original variables in the model.", "PCA is commonly used for compression purposes, to reduce required memory and to speed up the algorithm, as well as for visualization purposes, making it easier to summarize data.", "Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a more usable state. In an interview, you may be asked to list some of the steps that you take when wrangling a dataset.", "Some of the most common steps in data wrangling include:", "The Bootstrap Sampling Method is a very simple concept and is a building block for some of the more advanced machine learning algorithms like AdaBoost and XGBoost.", "Technically speaking, the bootstrap sampling method is a resampling method that uses random sampling with replacement.", "Don\u2019t worry if that sounds confusing, let me explain it with a diagram:", "Suppose you have an initial sample with 3 observations. Using the bootstrap sampling method, you\u2019ll create a new sample with 3 observations as well. Each observation has an equal chance of being chosen (1/3). In this case, the second observation was chosen randomly and will be the first observation in our new sample.", "After choosing another observation at random, you chose the green observation.", "Lastly, the yellow observation is chosen again at random. Remember that bootstrap sampling using random sampling with replacement. This means that it is very much possible for an already chosen observation to be chosen again.", "And this is the essence of bootstrap sampling!", "While deep learning isn\u2019t required in every data science job, it is certainly increasing in demand. And so, it would probably be a good idea to have a fundamental understanding of what neural networks are and how they work.", "At its roots, a Neural Network is essentially a network of mathematical equations. It takes one or more input variables, and by going through a network of equations, results in one or more output variables.", "In a neural network, there\u2019s an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer consists of one or more feature variables (or input variables or independent variables) denoted as x1, x2, \u2026, xn. The hidden layer consists of one or more hidden nodes or hidden units. A node is simply one of the circles in the diagram above. Similarly, the output variable consists of one or more output units.", "Like I said at the beginning, a neural network is nothing more than a network of equations. Each node in a neural network is composed of two functions, a linear function and an activation function. This is where things can get a little confusing, but for now, think of the linear function as some line of best fit. Also, think of the activation function like a light switch, which results in a number between 1 or 0.", "Some of the best machine learning algorithms incorporate these terms, and so, it\u2019s essential that you understand what ensemble learning, bagging, and boosting are.", "Ensemble learning is a method where multiple learning algorithms are used in conjunction. The purpose of doing so is that it allows you to achieve higher predictive performance than if you were to use an individual algorithm by itself.", "Bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregating, is the process in which multiple models of the same learning algorithm are trained with bootstrapped samples of the original dataset. Then, like the random forest example above, a vote is taken on all of the models\u2019 outputs.", "Boosting is a variation of bagging where each individual model is built sequentially, iterating over the previous one. Specifically, any data points that are falsely classified by the previous model is emphasized in the following model. This is done to improve the overall accuracy of the model. Here\u2019s a diagram to make more sense of the process:", "Once the first model is built, the falsely classified/predicted points are taken in addition to the second bootstrapped sample to train the second model. Then, the ensemble model (models 1 and 2) are used against the test dataset and the process continues.", "And that\u2019s all! I hope that this helps you in your interview prep and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. Hopefully, this provides a good guideline as to what machine learning concepts you should know for a data science interview.", "Not sure what to read next? I\u2019ve picked another article for you:", "Your home for data science.
