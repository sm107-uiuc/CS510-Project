This builds on my earlier project using \u201cclassic\u201d machine learning models and a simple bag-of-words approach to detect state troll tweets.", "I\u2019ll also compare the results from the fine tuned Distilbert model with those from a Logistic Regression and an XGBoost model, to see if a transformer model can indeed perform better in a practical use case.", "Spoiler alert: The fine tuned transformer model performed significantly better than the Log-Reg and XGBoost models (which weren\u2019t slouches either, to be sure), and held up much better when exposed to state troll tweets from a third country. Jump ahead to Section 4 for the results.", "First things first: How did I ascertain whose tweets are deemed the work of state influence campaigns? In this case, the ground truth is established by Twitter\u2019s election integrity team.", "The state troll tweets used in this project are those which have been identified by Twitter and progressively released to the public since 2018. I chose six sets of state troll tweets from Twitter \u2014 three each from China and Russia \u2014 which I cleaned up, combined and downsampled to 50,000 rows.", "I created an equivalent set of 50,000 rows of real tweets by using Tweepy to scrape 175 accounts, which comprise a mixture of verified users and those which I\u2019ve personally checked for authenticity. The resulting combined dataset of 100,000 rows of state troll-plus-real tweets was further split into the usual train-test-validation sets in the standard proportion of 70:20:10 respectively.", "Full details are in my notebooks, and I won\u2019t repeat them here for brevity\u2019s sake. The full repo is available here. Fine tuning was done on a Colab Pro account, and took about five-and-a-half hours.", "The fine tuned Distilbert model is too big for Github, but I\u2019ve uploaded a copy to Dropbox for those who just want to experiment with the model. The six raw CSV files containing state troll tweets have to be downloaded from Twitter if you wish to create a larger training set.", "It ought to be pointed out that key assumptions in the data cleaning and preparation process will affect the outcomes. The assumptions are necessary to keep the scope of this project practical, but if you disagree with them, feel agree to slice a different version of the data based on your own preferred cleaning rules.", "My main data cleaning rules for this project:", "I also kept the eventual combined dataset to 100,000 rows for practical reasons. My initial attempts to fine tune Distilbert with a 600,000 rows dataset resulted in repeated crashes of the Colab notebook and/or showed extremely long and impractical run times. A more ambitious version of this project just won\u2019t be practical without access to more compute/hardware.", "For this project, I picked the distilbert-base-uncased model (smaller and more manageable) and used Hugging Face\u2019s trainer for the task. I abandoned attempts to do a hyperparameters search after several trials which ran on for too long, and hope to return to this topic at a future date (check out the discussion here).", "The steps involved are fairly straightforward, as outlined in notebook2.0 of my repo. The code is mostly based on the excellent examples and documentation on Hugging Face here and here.", "The immediate results of the fine tuning certainly look impressive:", "I ran a quick test against the validation set \u2014 10,000 rows kept aside and which the model has not seen at all \u2014 and the excellent classification metrics barely budged:", "For a more thorough comparison and analysis, I trained two separate Logistic Regression and XGB classifier models using the same dataset used to fine tune the Distilbert model. Let\u2019s see how they do in the same tests.", "The pickled Log-Reg and XGB models are available in my repo\u2019s \u201cpkl\u201d folder. My notebooks detailing their optimisation process are available here and here. I won\u2019t go into the details here, except to highlight that both models scored above 0.8 during training and grid search. While clearly lower than the fine tuned Distilbert model\u2019s score, I think these two models did well enough to provide for an adequate comparison.", "The chart below shows the detailed breakdown, via confusion matrices, of how all three models performed against the validation set (10,000 rows comprising 5,061 state troll tweets and 4,939 real tweets).", "At a glance, it\u2019s clear that the fine tuned Distilbert model (on far left) is the strongest performer, and accurately picked out more state troll and real tweets than the Log-Reg or XGB models. More significantly, the number of false positives and false negatives for the Distilbert model is about half that produced by the log-reg and XGB models.", "So while the three models\u2019 performance metrics might seem close, the gap in their classification capabilities become very stark when seen via confusion matrices that give us a better sense of how they performed in classifying thousands of tweets.", "All three models were trained on a 50\u201350 split of real tweets and state troll tweets from China and Russia. In reality, we don\u2019t know the actual proportion of real-versus-troll tweets on Twitter. More importantly, state troll tweets can come from any country and changes in tone, language and topics could significantly affect the classifier\u2019s ability to separate real tweets from those originating from state-backed campaigns.", "Which of the three models would hold up better if exposed to state troll tweets from a third country? To find out, I ran a new dataset \u2014 comprising 1,000 troll tweets from Iran and 993 real tweets from American users \u2014 through the three models. This new dataset was created from an earlier project I did on the same subject.", "As expected, all three classifiers saw their performance drop significantly when exposed to Iranian state troll tweets which they\u2019ve not seen before.", "But the fine tuned Distilbert model still held up decently, in my view. Not only did it correctly pick out more troll and real tweets compared to the Log-Reg or XGB model, the number of false negatives (troll tweets that the model thought were real tweets) was not excessively large.", "This is particularly problematic with the Log-Reg model, which classified half (501 out of 1,000) of the troll tweets as real tweets when they were in fact the work of state-backed operators. The XGB model is slightly better in this area, but not by far, with the number of false negatives (468) significantly higher than the number of false positives.", "This was a particularly pronounced problem with the models I trained in my earlier project, meaning classifiers trained on one particular state actor\u2019s troll tweets were quite good at spotting new, unseen tweets from said state actor. But once troll tweets from another state operator is injected into the mix, the classifier\u2019s performance falters significantly.", "The fine tuned Distilbert model doesn\u2019t overcome this problem completely, but holds up well enough to hold out hopes for a model that can \u201cgeneralise\u201d better. If you have enough computing resources to train a transformer model on a bigger dataset comprising state troll tweets from all the countries identified by Twitter to date, it stands to reason that said model might do better in the sort of tests we\u2019ve tried in this post.", "Unfortunately that\u2019s a hypothesis I\u2019ll have to test another time.", "Detection of state influence campaigns on Twitter involves more than just the examination of the tweet text, of course. State trolls often leave bigger tell-tale signs like the (coordinated) dates of account creation, or timing of their tweets. The increasing use of photos and memes also make the detection process trickier.", "But spotting trends and hidden structures in their tweet text will continue to be one major area of focus. And it would appear that a fine tuned transformer model can perform significantly better in this task compared to the more popular or traditional classifiers out there.", "There are trade-offs, of course, in terms of resources and time. The hardware needed to fine tune a transformer model on, say, a million rows of tweets, is not readily available to most users, to say nothing of whether that\u2019s the most efficient way to tackle the task.", "I tried deploying the fine tuned Distilbert model as part of a simple web app but quickly found out that free hosting accounts don\u2019t have enough disk space for pytorch installation on top of hosting the model.", "But I\u2019ve uploaded the necessary files to the repo for anyone who wants to try it out on their local machine. Just make sure to download the fine tuned model from Dropbox and move it to the \u201capp\u201d folder.", "As always, if you spot mistakes in this or any of my earlier posts, ping me at:", "Your home for data science.
