Additionally, a report from the US Bureau of Labour Statistics suggested that the rise of Data Science needs is forecast to create roughly 11.5 million job openings by 2026. Now that the world is undergoing panic and uncertain times, it is worthwhile to check the soundness of these prognostications amid shrinking economies and market mayhem?", "Data Scientists today are akin to Wall Street's quants\u2019 of the 1980s and 1990s.", "I always like to refer to LinkedIn when it comes to talent acquisition, for the platform witnessed recently a burgeoning traffic from both job seekers and recruiters. Bear in mind that LinkedIn was among the first businesses to incorporate Data Science into their practices. Now, let us speak data, according to LinkedIn, there was a fall in Data Science job postings from 27 March onward. A period that marks the crisis reaching the corporate level.", "Data Science job postings have seen a decrease in other platforms such as indeed as well, as shown in the chart below.", "Having said that, a survey of a partnership between Burtch Works, a recruitment agency of Big Data and Data Science talents, and the International Institute of Analytics showed how companies had dealt with the crisis from March to April, a month\u2019s timeframe. At first glance, we can see that the impact of COVID-19 on staffing and hiring has more than doubled in just one month, suggesting long term ramifications should the U.S lockdown restrictions remain unrelaxed.", "The good news is that most of the impacted organizations deployed salary cuts policies. although layoffs, furloughs, hiring freeze, and reduced hours are still choices for impacted bodies, odds are that Data Scientists can still at least enjoy their analytics positions, which is the best-case scenario compared to other alternatives.", "Furthermore, it is of great importance to shed some light on the effect of the current crisis on college graduates. Burtch Works again managed to reach out to U.S university professors and students about to embark on a Data Science career. Unfortunately, the figures were quite shocking.", "We can see that COVID-19 has, terribly, eroded Data Science positions and job offerings for fresh graduates. The vast majority of the students reported being affected by impacts ranging from start dates delays to job offers rescinded, leaving a paltry 10% of students not impacted yet.", "Linda Burtch, Expert in Quantitative Recruiting at Burtch Works reached out to Michael Rappa, Director of Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University, a world-class program, and he was able to share some of the program's data on COVID-19 effects on his graduates.", "The most striking figure in the data is that job offers per student shrank from 2.5 to 2.1 per student in 2019 and 2020, respectively.", "Again, Cappa was able to share the impact of the crisis on the entry-level job opening on LinkedIn from 2018 to 2020. As we can see Data Scientist average job openings dropped to less than 1,000 job offers, which is quite a threat to fresh Data Scientists. We must as well be cognizant that the trend is subject to even more declines should the actual situation remain.", "While coronavirus was a disaster to the majority of the industries, some IT businesses, which can work remotely, such as Netflix, Steam (Gaming Business), and Zoom, are having their profits skyrocketing as people are becoming more and more reliant on their services. For example, according to Analytics Insights Data Scientists at Zoom Boast of an average salary of 111,000 USD per annum. This is a silver lining for Data Scientists and I believe the best practice should Data Scientists invest in during these unprecedented times is to hone their skills to be ready for the slightest wave of job openings.", "Your home for data science.
