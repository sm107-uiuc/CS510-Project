Often there isn\u2019t time to wait for enough data to come in to make a rational prediction of potential outcomes. Sometimes we just have to start something. In these cases there are some non-scientific tools to help us make reasonable predictions that are at least better than nothing.", "In about 550 BC, Croesus the king of Lydia, made an offering to the Oracle of Delphi that reinforced his legendary reputation for wealth. There were ingots that would form a pedestal for a quarter-tonne golden statue, two giant urns, one gold, one silver urn, and various other precious items: a five foot high golden statue of the cook who had saved him from poisoning, and his wife\u2019s jewellery and girdles. It is unrecorded what his wife thought about it.", "In return, he asked the Oracle to predict what would happen if he should attack Persia. He was told that if he did so a mighty empire would fall. Interpreting this as a sign that he would conquer \u2014 he\u2019d spent all that money after all \u2014 he invaded. The Oracle was duly proved right. A mighty empire did fall. Unfortunately for Croesus it was his own [1].", "It turns out that predicting the future is a tricky thing.", "I think we can safely say that Croesus didn\u2019t get his money back. The risk for us data scientists is that we act like the Oracle. People pay us to tell them what\u2019s going to happen, but then, when push comes to shove, we often respond with \u201cdegrees of belief\u201d and abstruse lectures about probabilities. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I personally love a discussion about the interpretation of a probability, but I wonder if we sound to outsiders like the priests at Delphi.", "\u201cThank you for the paycheck, here\u2019s some mystically ambiguous woo-woo, hope it makes you feel good. Now run along and do what you were going to do anyway\u201d", "This is unsustainable, and could easily lead to people giving up on data science altogether.", "The other day, I watched a close colleague tell a client that data scientists didn\u2019t make predictions. Since I\u2019ve seen him call many a .predict() method, I couldn\u2019t really understand what he meant.", "Afterwards, his argument was that when a client hears the word prediction, they think that we\u2019re making definitive statements about the way the world is going to be. He prefers the word forecast, because people understand that weather forecasts aren\u2019t ever going to be 100% accurate.", "Now he may well be right about clients\u2019 perceptions (he usually is). However, for me, this is a distinction without a difference. I think, mostly, data scientists do, in fact, use a bunch of scientific tools to make predictions. Sometimes, e.g. in a time series problem, this is obvious: tomorrow sell these shares because we think their value will go down over time. Other times it\u2019s less obvious: e.g. in a classification problem. You might not be predicting the future, per se, but the problem has you predicting what human judges would label the examples you\u2019re classifying.", "There are a few exceptions to this \u2014 e.g. some type of GANs might not count. But by and large, I\u2019d argue that most of us are making predictions about events that are going to happen, or that have already happened but haven\u2019t yet been observed by us.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with this. We should embrace it. It\u2019s what scientists do.", "The cartoon explanation of the scientific method is that scientists build a model and then go out and seek evidence that disproves it. Gradually, as more evidence is gathered and the model isn\u2019t shown to be wrong, the model gets accepted as a scientific truth [2]. This is roughly how data scientists claim to behave: they look at some data, build a model that captures what\u2019s going on, then launch that model live. As more data comes in, the model is proven.", "Unfortunately, in many real world cases, our predictions just aren\u2019t very good! For example, even knowing that a potential customer has previously got halfway through a purchase process \u2014 which seems like it should be a massive indicator of intent \u2014 only provides a marginal improvement in predicting who will click on an ad. And if I could predict which shares would go down tomorrow, I\u2019d be writing this blog from a yacht in the Mediterranean, not a flat in a London suburb.", "Our techniques are such that we count doing a little bit better than random chance as a win. And if we can also do a tiny bit better than the competition, we\u2019re in business. We\u2019re using the scientific method as best we can but are running into limitations in the methods and technology.", "Now, there\u2019s a kind of data scientist who argues that we should stop when the science stops. In this argument, the scientific method is the pinnacle of human achievement when it comes to saying anything about the future. When we can\u2019t use it to say anything meaningful, it means we can\u2019t really know anything. And whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent [3].", "As someone trained as a scientist, I have some sympathy for this line of thought. However the world just doesn\u2019t work that way! If your company is moving at science speed, i.e. slowly and deliberatively, moving forward only when enough evidence has accumulated, you will surely be out-competed by companies that are moving faster.", "But, our data scientist might argue, these companies are proceeding by guesswork! They\u2019ll surely fail eventually. Well this might be true, but there are two counter arguments to this. One is that it\u2019s a very big world and eventually can be a very long time. With a hundred competitors, some of them will guess right just by chance. And they\u2019re moving so much quicker than you that you\u2019ve been out-competed before you can gather the data that proves whether the guess is right.", "However there\u2019s another more interesting reason. I\u2019d argue that guesswork isn\u2019t necessarily random. It is possible to guess and do better than chance, and there exist rational, but essentially non-scientific tools, that help us do it.", "The trade-off then is to wait until the data is in and proceed with some degree of certainty, or to use non-scientific tools to make an educated guess. In many cases, I\u2019d argue that organisations should take the latter approach.", "So far I\u2019ve argued that as scientists, we are asked to predict the future but are basically unable to do it. There are two responses to this. One is to throw your hands up and say, \u201cI\u2019m a scientist, here\u2019s where I stop\u201d and watch while you\u2019re out-competed. The other is to leave science behind and try and make sense of a complex world using other tools.", "So what are these tools? Well here are some, borrowed from the field of Future Studies [4]. To an audience of data scientists they might seem alien. What we\u2019re setting out to do is imagine a range of semi-plausible futures and then assign them probabilities. Here I mean probability in the gambler\u2019s sense of \u201cdegree of belief\u201d. Happily, this turns out to also be the Bayesian sense of probability. If you\u2019re skeptical, remember there\u2019s more to human endeavour than science. Hamlet is in some sense true, even though it\u2019s not \u201cliterally true\u201d.", "Tool 1: Sci-fi envisioning. Here, you just sit back and make semi-plausible stuff up, almost without constraint. The idea is to let your mind go. Space elevators? Why not! Undersea colonies? Sure! Perhaps something darker? Total population surveillance by private companies. That\u2019s sci-fi, right?", "The use for this tool is not to produce realistic ideas. It\u2019s to let go of the constraints provided by our data driven training and just let the imagination rip. If, like me, you reached Iain M. Banks via Clarke and Asimov, you can channel those future visions to make the whole process less \u2026 odd.", "Tool 2: Horizon scanning. The future is already here \u2014 It\u2019s just not very evenly distributed [5]. The history of innovation is full of examples of ideas spreading out of niches and taking over the world. Those guys in Canada, still studying neural-nets as late as 2010? That was going nowhere, right up until it was going everywhere. So what else is out there? A.I. in China probably counts as mainstream, but what about nano-materials in Japan? What data science innovations are taking place in Bangalore? Or urban design innovations in Lagos? And this isn\u2019t limited to technology. Think of the cultural dynamism of Central African musicians, rapping in Franglish [6].", "The point is that the future might well exist somewhere already. A prediction that involves an existing innovation spreading is more plausible than one that occurs ab initio.", "Tool 3: Trends. OK, just making stuff up is only going to get us so far. We have to look at data to connect an imagined future with our existing present. You might have all these mad ideas, but can we tell if any of them, in any way, are realistic? Well one way to do this is to pick some relevant trends in the data and extrapolate them. Remember that space elevator? Well how quickly are improvements in the tensile strength of nano-materials coming?", "This often gets described as the scientific part of Future Studies. For a data scientist it probably doesn\u2019t count as Science. But at least the process of looking at trends in the data should feel familiar. It\u2019s just that picking the data is an art. You can\u2019t construct a factor model of everything, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can do nothing. Remember we\u2019re talking about degrees of belief here.", "Tool 4: Scenario testing. To anyone that\u2019s worked in finance this should be familiar. It\u2019s the kind of stress-testing that the people who manage risk do all the time (or at least since 2008/9). In their case, they limit their investigation to the effect of events on financial portfolios, e.g. what could happen to stock prices, if say, the US withdraws from the WTO, or to commodities prices if terrorism blocks the Malacca straits? Similarly, we can think about the effects big events would have on our predictions, e.g. what effect would a war in the South China Sea have on a prediction that Japan will build the first space elevator? The point is that no single big-effect event is very likely, but something will happen eventually. By investigating a bunch of events, hopefully you can detect common themes that would effect your prediction in a similar manner.", "Synthesis. You\u2019ll probably bounce around refining your prediction using each of these tools in turn. By the end, you\u2019ll have imagined a bunch of futures, investigated a bunch of innovations around the world and attempted to disprove them with trends and hypothesised scenarios. However when the music stops, you have to stop dancing. Remember we\u2019re not doing science here. You have to come down and use your judgement to decide. If you prefer you can think of it as having a prior belief in what\u2019s going to happen that you\u2019ve updated with weak evidence. The trouble is, you don\u2019t know how weak that evidence is, so Maths isn\u2019t going to help you.", "As a final word, I need to mention how this fits in with the work of Philip Tetlock and his work on the Good Judgement Project [7]. This is a competition that measures how good people are at predicting the future. He\u2019s identified a subgroup of super-forecasters that are better at predicting the future than their contemporaries. He goes on to identify character traits that make them good: basically be smart and open minded, hang out with other smart and open minded people, work hard, develop an intuition about what probability means, and account for your biases [8].", "This is all good stuff, but doesn\u2019t give an account of what to do if you are faced with having to make a prediction. Work hard? Sure, but at what? However I was relieved to read that when super-forecasters describe how they make their predictions, they give two of the methods detailed above [9].", "So in conclusion, I\u2019m arguing that data scientists can\u2019t just ignore the prediction problem, since that\u2019s what people are paying us for. However we need to face the fact that the tools we have to make predictions aren\u2019t very good. Sometimes \u201cnot very good\u201d is good enough. However in circumstances where it isn\u2019t, and where we need to think about a longer term future, there exist other non-scientific tools for us to use.", "What do you think? Should data scientists leave predictions alone? Let me know in the comments!", "[2] This is of course a simplification of Karl Popper, see here for a discussion. Popper himself also had a concept of \u201cCorroboration\u201d of a model which was jumped on by statisticians associated with Likelihood methods. Of course there\u2019s Kuhn too, so you see why mine is the cartoon version.", "[3] Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 7, Ludwig Wittgenstein", "[4] These tools are taken from my notes on a lecture by Professor Peter Madden at the Future Cities Catapult. Any mistakes are mine!", "[5] Quote by William Gibson, exact place, as ever, disputed.", "[7] References to the Good Judgement Project can be found here.", "[8] Identifying and cultivating superforecasters as a method of improving probabilistic predictions.
