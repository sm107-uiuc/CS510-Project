It is easy to get an historical data set, plot data points and find a correlation between two variables. However, correlation does not imply causation :", "To tackle these issues, researchers design experimental studies. As opposed to observational studies that consist in studying historical data, experimental studies consist in setting up creating our own data by repeating an experiment with a controlled variation : only one variable changes between the experiments, and that\u2019s the variable we want to study the influence on a target variable. If the target value changes consistently when the variable changes, then there is causation.", "Now, let\u2019s say we want to prove the efficiency of a new drug to cure a specific disease. The typical set-up will consists in dividing patients affected with the disease in 2 groups, give the drug to one group only, and compare the number of cured patients in each group.\u00a0But in order to avoid any bias that may influence the results, we will add extra steps\u00a0:", "This configuration defines a double-blind random study.", "For the sake of simplicity, our 2 groups are considered to be of the same size n but the analysis is very similar with groups of different sizes.", "Now we can formulate two hypothesis :", "Under the null hypothesis, theoretical results would look like that :", "We will now perform the chi-squared test. This widely-used test checks for statistical link (dependence) between two variables. Here, our two binary variables are\u00a0:", "The chi-squared statistics is the sum, for every cell of the table, of the squared differences between observed cell value and cell value under null hypothesis, divided by the value under null hypothesis :", "The last thing to do is to compare that value to a reference table to accept or reject the null hypothesis. In our example, we have 1 degree of freedom\u00a0: the number of values less 1 of one variable times the number of values less 1 of the other one is 1.", "Let\u2019s take the following example and compute the chi-square value. At first, we may think the drug is effective :", "If we want a confidence of 95% (this is often the case in medicine), since our chi-squared value is 4.8 and 4.8>3.84, we can reject the null hypothesis and consider the drug has an effect compared to the placebo.", "That\u2019s it ! Do not forget to look for the type of effect (positive or negative).", "Note : for the chi-square test to be effective, it is recommended to have E\u22655 for every cell of our table under null hypothesis.", "Sometimes, the target variable is not binary, but a continuous numerical variable : number of days to cure, glucose level, blood pressure\u2026 In this case, it is irrelevant to build a result table. We will use a different approach.", "First, we will register the value of the target variable for every patient in each group. Plotting the value distribution for each group is a first clue to evaluate if the drug has an impact on the target variable (here, the number of days for the patient to cure).", "A rigorous way to compare the 2 groups would be to compare the expected value of their distributions. However, we do only know the sample mean of the patients we studied. So we are going to estimate the expected value of the two distributions using a property of Student\u2019s t-distributions (a prerequisite is obviously to check whether the distributions are normal). This property defines a confidence interval for the expected value of a distribution, based on a sample mean :", "\u03b1 is the confidence level. n is the sample size (number of patients). t is the Student factor. We can find its value in the reference table :", "For example, let\u2019s say we have 2 groups of 100 persons (n=100), we want a confidence of 95%, and we study the example B as seen before :", "The confidence intervals for expected value do not overlap, so the distributions are not the same : we can consider the drug is effective on the number of days to cure, compared to the placebo.", "The double-blind random study is one of the most trusted way of proving a drug is effective, but its usage goes way beyond medicine research. For example, you may know the A/B tests that are often used in advertising, UX design or even machine learning : the philosophy is the same. This kind of study can be used anytime we want to know if a variable has an impact on another one. At Wavestone Consulting, we used a similar approach to evaluate the impact of tank characteristics on alcohol evaporation for one of our clients.", "However, when performing double-blind studies is possible (and that is not always the case \u2014 how do you provide placebos for surgical interventions?), a major disadvantage arises : if the tested drug is effective, it means the \u201cplacebo\u201d group did not benefit from it and certainly regret it. Is it ethical to administrate placebos to patients suffering from incurable diseases ? Maybe one day, some of the new approaches intending to solve this regret issue in the context of A/B testing, for example the reinforcement-learning-based Netflix artwork personalization system, will benefit to medicine research.", "Your home for data science.
