The spring atmosphere was in the air. The sun was painting a beautiful tableau. My friends found a growing flower in the middle of the grass, the first of its kind, to be seen this year.", "Our first reaction was to take a picture of the flower and share it on social media. I began to be curious about the motivation behind our actions. We did not touch the flower, we did not observe, neither smell it. Few seconds after noticing the presence of the flower, our first reaction was to share an image of it.", "At that particular moment, I realized how memory-less I felt. I have taken thousands of pictures in my life.", "How often have you lived your life by recording it, digitizing it, and eventually sharing it?", "It felt strange how memory-less we have all become. We capture moments of our day in videos, photos, or audios. We also turn our thoughts into words, emoticons, or drawings which we handle down to our phones, wearable devices, cars, and computers.", "We trust digital storage with our memories, which we rarely access later on. I asked my friends, if they sometimes went back to watch those pictures and tried to revive the moments connected to it. My friends took a moment to think and recognized that they rarely browsed past photos. There is no time to look at the past, we are often too busy with recording the present.When a crisis occurs, it leaves us with memories of certain moments. People are very emotionally connected and you can smell the smoke out of specific events. The moment breaks through the noise.", "Everybody is going to remember where they were during the COVID19 crisis.", "As we navigate our new normal amid corona-virus, social distance accelerates the digitization of our memories on a large scale. When this realm ends up and nobody currently knows when this happens, our public space is going to be much emptier than it once was. However, as social beings, we need to connect to survive.", "Most of us are probably sitting at home right now. Working from home has largely become a new modus operandi. Children are getting their school education online. Parents are having their lunch at home.", "What we see are the massive changes on the internet. Content creation is skyrocketing. The interaction rate with content is also catapulting. People are dying to see new movies and play new games. The entertainment and gaming industries are pivoting.", "Amateurs and pro gamers are uploading millions of videos they recorded when playing. Conference tools like Zoom are spreading because they connect people remotely. I am using these tools every day to meet colleagues, friends, and family spread around the world.", "The consequence is, according to John Sculley, former CEO of Apple and Pepsi, and Co-Founder of Zeta, that the most significant change in technology which is about to occur is the explosion in data. We already know that amount of data is doubling every 2 years. Data is not only created by humans. Machines have already learned to capture moments of our lives without our intervention.", "Thanks to COVID19, more machines will digitize the world for other machines even more. This is the era of sensors, the internet of things.", "We will soon find sensors in everything. Sony has just announced the world\u2019s first image sensor with integrated AI, allowing it to perform computer vision tasks without any additional hardware. It is estimated, there will soon be trillion sensors in the world.", "We are entering a decade of much more connectiveness, much more data.", "For example, a driverless car with L2 autonomy can generate approximately 25Gb of data in an hour. If we have millions of cars driving around at the same time, it would be impossible to handle the data flow.", "None of our wireless networks were prepared for a bandwidth utilization we all are already experiencing. My friends and I are all timing-out.", "With the tourism industry being disrupted, virtual traveling emerges. People are designing virtual reality experience with hologram transmission also for sports entertainment.", "COVID19 pandemic revolutionizes healthcare. The next step from telemedicine is the inclusion of IoT devices to perform digital diagnostics remotely.", "All this will generate a large amount of data.", "According to John Sculley, if you look beyond COVID19, during the late 90s, there was a significant investment into what was called dark fibers. Hundred of billions of dollars went into building cell towers and fiber optic cable networks. At that time, I was a student. I remember very well how this investment led to the rapid growth of the Wide World Web, followed by the Dot-com phenomenon that created our first jobs.", "That investment also created the transition from 2G to 3G networks with support for the transmission of photos and videos. When Steve Jobs introduced his iPhone in 2007, there would not have been much success without that investment in the dark fibers back in the late 90s, according to John Sculley.", "Today, with the help of COVID19, the world becomes much more digital by data being transmitted through the fringes of the internet faster, thanks to 5G. This is the fifth generation technology standard for cellular networks giving faster download speed up to 10 Gbps.", "Our smartphones and the sensors around us will all have access to the internet highway. The actual last mile with a slow WiFi or cable connection will disappear.", "COVID19 brings the world online. 5G opens the highway for people and sensors to feed The Machine.", "Data is being captured from billions of people with trillions of marketing signals per week, according to David A. Steinberg, Zeta Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO. It is quite an amazing number, I would say.", "We will see massive amounts of data. Our memories, behaviors, intentions, and dreams are feeding machine learning algorithms. Today, Machine Intelligence can sort out massive amounts of data and find connections hidden to us.", "According to Shoshana Zuboff, Machine Intelligence refers to the complex highly specialized computational systems that train on the forest of data rather than the individual trees. She pictures Machine Intelligence by driving attention to its objective, rather than its technology. Machine Intelligence enables operations that convert raw material (our data) into highly profitable algorithmic products. One of them is targeted advertising.", "The key to the success of the few most valued online advertising firms is personalization.", "That\u2019s how Machine Intelligence can break through the noise, through millions of messages a day. It is all wrapped around data and the ability to capture data about almost anything. What these advertising companies are trying to do is to get people close to a transaction as possible and understand what their intent is before their competitor or the people themselves.", "The coronavirus crisis is a world-changing event. The future is not what it used to be. The new power resides in action. Sensors also become actuators.", "The more we rely on Machine Intelligence, the more we look at it for guidance. Once bitten, the apple becomes irresistible.", "The virtual assistant can subtly encourage choices that accrue to the designer, not to the individual. It is possible to imagine machine intelligence being used to modify people\u2019s behaviors at scale and predict the behavioral future.", "Thanks to COVID19 we are turning the oldest and most intricate analog system on Earth into a digital form: our mind.", "Will we know when we choose whether the choice is ours?", "Back to the flower that we found in the middle of the grass in the park, enlighten by spring sunlight. My friends and I spent the rest of the time staring at its beauty. I was wondering how this kind of analog memory, we have just collected about the flower, would make sense in an increasingly digitized world.", "Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.", "Your home for data science.
