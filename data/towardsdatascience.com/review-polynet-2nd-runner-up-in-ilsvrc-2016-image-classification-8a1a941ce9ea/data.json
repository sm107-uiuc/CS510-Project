A building block called PolyInception module is introduced. A Very Deep PolyNet is composed based on the module. Compared to Inception-ResNet-v2, PolyNet reduces the Top-5 validation error on single crops from 4.9% to 4.25%, and that on multi-crops from 3.7% to 3.45%.", "As a result, PolyNet (with the team name CU-DeepLink) obtains 2nd Runner Up in ILSVRC 2016 classification task as below. And it is published as 2017 CVPR paper. (Sik-Ho Tsang @ Medium)", "This relative improvement is about 14%, which is not trivial!!!", "With the success of ResNet and GoogLeNet (Inception-v1), Inception-ResNet-v2 (IR-v2) was introduced to combine both:", "As shown above, there is a skip connection. also there are several parallel convolution path, which is originated by GoogLeNet. And multiple Inception-A, Inception-B and Inception-C are cascaded at different levels. And finally, Inception-ResNet-v2 (IR-v2) obtains a high classification accuracy.", "And the Inception module can be formulated as an abstract residual unit, which shown as below:", "The output become x + F(x), which is similar to residual block.", "To increase the accuracy, a polynomial composition is added, by simply add a second-order term:", "With the second-order term, it is formed as a PolyInception Module.", "Different Types of PolyInception Module are suggested:", "There are so many choices in our hands now. But which combinations are the best? Authors tried a lot of combinations to find the best one.", "Inception-ResNet-v2 (IR-v2) is denoted as IR 5\u201310\u20135 meaning that it has 5 Inception-A modules (IR-A) at stage A, 10 Inception-B modules (IR-B) at stage B, and 5 Inception-C modules (IR-C) at stage C.", "To speed up the experiment, a scaled down version of IR 3\u20136\u20133, is used as baseline.

And those 12 Inception-B are the focusing point since it got the largest improvement in the previous study. And only one type of mixed PolyInception (mixed B) is tested, i.e. (3-way > mpoly-3 > poly-3) \u00d7 4.", "Mixed B has the lowest Top-5 error.", "Some modifications are made to fit GPU memory, reducing cost while maintaining depth.", "Initialization by Insertion: To speed up the convergence, as shown above, second order Inception module is removed first, and interleaved modules are trained first. Thus, a smaller network is trained at the beginning.", "Stochastic Depth: By randomly dropping some parts of the network, overfitting can be reduced. It can be treated as a special case of dropout which drops all neurons of one path.", "With ensembling using multi-model and multi-scale input image, PolyNet at last got 3.04% Top-5 error rate and got 2nd Runner-Up on ILSVRC 2016 classification task.", "As image classification has only one objective, that is to recognize the single object within the image, a good model used in image classification usually become the backbone of the network for object detection, and semantic segmentation, etc. Therefore, it is worth to study the models for image classification.
