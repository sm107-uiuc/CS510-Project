Maharashtra contributes about 15 \u2018% to the GDP of the country making it the single largest contributor to the economy, while state capital Mumbai holds the status of the financial capital of the country. In addition, Pune is also known as the \u2018Oxford of the East\u2019 due to the presence of numerous educational institutes like IUCAA, NCRA, IISER etc. Henceforth, anything that happens in Maharashtra has economic ramifications at the national level.", "This article will cover how to make a choropleth map of the Maharashtra\u2019s 2019 assembly elections using publicly available data. The shape file for the assembly constituencies, in general, is an extremely scarce resource on the internet.", "At first the required packages are imported as shown below:", "The \u2018set_style\u2019 is an optional command that sets a white grid for the upcoming plots.", "The \u2018read_file\u2019 imports the shape files for the assembly constituencies in India as a DataFrame, and \u2018map_df[\u2018ST_NAME\u2019]==\u2019MAHARASHTRA\u2019 filters constituencies belonging to Maharashtra. The subsequent lines retain only the required features such as the constituency name (AC_NAME) and shape file (geometry).", "It is seen from above that there are 288 assembly constituency names (AC_NAME) and 302 shape files (geometry). The data from election commission of India shows there are 288 assembly constituencies. Let us explore more to address this discrepancy.", "The plot of the shape file seems to be normal. Let us check if there are any null type values.", "A null type object in python is represented with a None keyword. Here, the isnull() command turns the DataFrame map_df into a True or False table, where True is the place holder for None keywords and vice-versa. The sum() command totals the True or False values with a value of one and zero, respectively. Hence, there are fourteen missing values in constituency names, and likewise zero missing values in shape file.", "This can be visualized as a heat map from the Seaborn library:", "The odd straight lines in AC_NAME column represents the missing values. These values can be removed with the pandas\u2019s dropna() as shown below.", "After removing the null type values, the index is reset to account for the removed values, and sets the constituency name as the new index \u2014 this is achieved by the drop=True option. While the inplace=True option retains these changes in the map_df DataFrame.", "The data has to be cleaned to match the names of constituencies from the election commission. One can see that there are (ST) and (SC) appended to the names to show the constituencies reserved for ST and SC.", "The apply command sends one word at a time to the text_process() function. Here, each word is stripped of the leading and trailing white spaces, converted into lower case, and split into more words with separator as whitespace via names.strip().lower().split(). An example word Arjuni Morgaon(SC) will look like [\u2018arjuni\u2019, \u2018morgaon(sc)\u2019] after the first line of code. The word (sc) is still retained in this word because it is not separated with a whitespace from morgaon. The join() command on this word will result in arjuni morgaon(sc). Finally, the replace(\u201c(sc)\u201d,\u201d \u201d) will give the fully cleaned name arjuni morgaon.", "The data for the successful parties in respective constituencies can be downloaded from the election commission page in xlsx format.", "The read_excel command from pandas directly imports the excel sheet data as a DataFrame, and the names option sets the new names for the columns.", "The above result shows there are no null values in any of the six columns.", "The countplot command plots the number of constituencies won by each party, whereas the value_count() gives the exact numbers:", "Clearly, the top 4 parties have won in far more constituencies than the rest. Now, let\u2019s segregate only the parties that won in more than 20 constituencies. This is to focus on the parties that performed well.", "The first line gives a pandas\u2019 series with party name as the index and the column as True or False values, where True represents values greater than 20, and False otherwise. The second line gives the parties names with only True values via index command. The third line converts the parties names into a numpy array. This array is used in the following apply command, which filters all the parties with wins greater than 20. The final line just plots the number of constituencies won by each party with classification among the Sex of the candidate. Among the absolute numbers the BJP seems to be representing more women among candidates that won. Let\u2019s take a deeper look into this.", "The above lines show that there is only 8% of women representation among all the successful candidates including all the parties. Breaking it down for a party-wise representation:", "This shows 11 % representation by women in BJP\u2019s successful candidates. Similarly, calculating it for the all parties one can plot the following:", "The above plot depicts the party-wise representation by women in terms of percentage among the successful candidates. It can be seen that BJP and Congress have almost equal women representation. In addition, both parties surpass the average women representation of 8 %. The third and fourth place is occupied by NCP and SHS with below average representations.", "This is a simpler form of data cleaning compared to the map data. Here, all the names converted to lower, and starting and trailing white spaces are removed. The join command joins the map DataFrame and this DataFrame, where the names of the constituencies match!", "The subplot() creates a figure and axis instance which can be used to set the attributes of the plot. This is an object oriented way of programming, in contrast, plt.plot() is a functional way of programming. Here axis instance, ax, is used to set the title of the plot, and remove plot axes. The merged.plot() plots the choropleth map with respect to the parties. This is a Pandas\u2019 specific way of plotting, where a more general command looks like DataFrame_Name.plot(). It uses matplotlib as a backend, hence, works very well in conjunction with matplotlib specific commands such as subplot(). The cmap option sets the colour scheme of the plot. Furthermore, the get_legend() creates a legend instance which is used along with set_bbox_to_anchor() for more accurate placement of the legend.", "The white patches in choropleth map represent missing constituencies. These are the assembly constituencies whose names were none and was removed from the map_df DataFrame. One can experiment with a few more cmap colour options as shown here. However, one must see that there are too many parties to identify all of them with just colours. In the future, we shall explore more on improving both comprehension and aesthetic of this plot!", "The full notebook can be referred to here.", "Your home for data science.
