No matter the size or application of the building you\u2019re building, you will need to obtain and analyze data. Most often, this data you need is stored in a DBMS (database management system).", "To interact and communicate with the DBMS, you need to use its language or a language that it understands. The language used to interact with DBMSs is SQL (Structured Query Language).", "In recent years, another term surfaced in the field of databases, which is NoSQL databases. If you\u2019re just starting with data science, you might have heard of both SQL and NoSQL databases.", "But, what is the difference and when to use each of them?", "Let\u2019s start for the absolute beginning. Why do we have two approaches to interact with databases?", "Simple, SQL, and NoSQL interact with different types of databases. SQL is the approach used to interact with relational databases, while NoSQL is used to interact with non-rational databases.", "The data is stored in different tables in relational databases, each containing multiple records (rows). These tables are connected to each other using one or more relations.", "Keys define the relation between the tables. A key is the table field (column) that contains unique values for each record. If a field is defined as a primary key of a table, this field can be included in multiple tables and can be used to access different tables simultaneously. Once a primary key is used two connect its table to another, it will be known in the other table as a foreign key.", "For example, the image below shows a part of an airline's database. We have two tables, pilots table, and flights table. These two tables are connected used as the primary key in the pilots' table \u201cPilotId.\u201d I can use the pilots' Id to access the information about the pilot for the pilots' table and the flights this pilot is handling from the pilots' table.", "So, in the pilots' table, PoilotId is the primary key, while it is a foreign key in the flights table. PilotId is used here to form a relation between the two tables.", "Unlike relational databases, non-relational database \u2014 NoSQL databases \u2014 does not store data in tables and records. Instead, in these types of databases, the data storage structure is designed and optimized for specific requirements.", "Instead of the SQL, which is used by relational databases, NoSQL databases use Object-relational-mapping (ORM) to facilitate communication with its data.", "The four popular types of NoSQL databases, column-oriented, document-oriented, key-value pairs, and graph databases. These types can be used individually or combined. The choice will depend on your application and the type of data you need to store.", "As the name suggests, in a column-oriented database, the data is stored and organized as columns. This type of database is beneficial if you need to store sparse data. Sparse data is more normalized towards a column-oriented data organizing approach.", "In a document-oriented database, the structure of the data sorted doesn\u2019t need to be rigid. It is rather a collection of fields and data values together in the structure of a document. These document-oriented databases are often stored as JSON strings and can be encoded using YAML, XML, or as a plain text to protect the data.", "A benefit of using a document-oriented database is, you don\u2019t need to have all your documents using the same structure. That gives the developer the freedom to sort different data types within the same database. In Python, MongoDB is an example of document-oriented databases.", "If you\u2019re familiar with Python, you can think of a key-value database as a Python dictionary. Every data object in the database will be stored as a pair of key and value.", "When your data is highly interconnected, you will need to use a database that allows you to implement this efficiently. Graph databases are considered the most complex of NoSQL databases. However, it\u2019s very versatile, which makes it a great fit for many applications.", "So, how can we choose between SQL and NoSQL databases?", "There are 4 aspects you need to consider in order to answer this question: flexibility, scalability, consistency, and available technology.", "As a rule of thumb, SQL is a better choice if you\u2019re dealing with an RDBMS (relational database management system), you want to analyze the data's behavior or want to build custom dashboards. Also, SQL often allows for faster data storage and recovery and works better with complex queries.", "On the other side, we have NoSQL databases, which are the better choice if you want to expand upon RDBMS's standard structure, or you need to create a flexible schema. NoSQL databases are also better when the data you\u2019re storing, and logging is coming from distributed sources, or you just need to store it temporarily.", "In the end, I can\u2019t say that SQL is absolutely better than NoSQL or the way around. Each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, and your choice will be made based on your data, your application, and what makes the development process easier for you.", "SQL databases are older and hence more studied and more established fixed schema design and structure. NoSQL databases are easily scalable, flexible, and relatively simple to use due to their flexible schema.", "So, what is your data requirements? Is your data well-structured? Are you dealing with a large amount of data?", "Always listen to your data, and you will make the correct choice.", "Your home for data science.
