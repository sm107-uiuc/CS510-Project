Implying that mathy folk can behave irrationally is akin to kicking a hornet\u2019s nest.", "I owe those comments a response, so let me address the main flavors here:", "Comment: You can\u2019t call it irrational and leave it at that! Response: I absolutely agree. I\u2019m not leaving it at that. Rest assured that this is just one post in a very long series. Being cooped up at home made me daydream about the 5 years of my life devoted to experimental/behavioral economics and neuroeconomics (those lush grad school lawns!) and inspired me to dust off those topics. This article is not trying to stuff all 5 years into a single post \u2014 plenty of others to follow!", "Comment: Calling my choice \u201cirrational\u201d isn\u2019t nice. I\u2019m offended.Response: The word \u201cirrational\u201d is not intended as a slur here\u2026 there\u2019s a formal definition of rationality in economics and the A&D choice deviates from it. In fact, you\u2019ll be relieved to know that \u201cirrational\u201d is not the same thing as \u201csuboptimal\u201d \u2014 irrationality is sometimes more optimal than rationality. If this idea gets your blood pumping, you might just fall in love with the field of experimental/behavioral economics! That\u2019s pretty much what the entire field is about and it offers you decades of tasty research to chew on. Also, this article demonstrates just one of many ways you could be irrational. There are so many more!", "Comment: You forgot risk aversion and expected utility theory.Response: No, those are impossible to forget. But you\u2019re right that I probably should have written about them before putting out this article. Mea culpa. Stay tuned, I\u2019ve got half of it in draft already. While you\u2019re Googling angrily in the meantime, be careful to avoid the rookie mistake of confusing risk with ambiguity. Risk aversion does not explain ambiguity aversion, but you\u2019ll have to be patient with me while I polish up the article explaining why that\u2019s true.", "Comment: People choose A&D to hedge their bets.Response: No, please check the game rules again. An early typo made it sound like you get two shots at $100 (you only get one!) but that was fixed before the bulk of the poll votes came in. We still see A&D as the favorite choice. (In a setting that allows two shots, you were smart to notice hedging opportunities, but hedging is not enough to explain the results. There\u2019s still the problem of B&C\u2019s unpopularity, since B&C offers hedging opportunities too. If the behavior were only about hedging, why the disparity?)", "Comment: It\u2019s a two-player game, so the Nash equilibrium\u2026Response: Nope, it\u2019s a one-player game. You\u2019re not playing against me since I\u2019m not trying to win or keep the $100 for myself, I\u2019m trying to run a little gameshow in my imaginary living room. But fear not, we can game theory up a storm together on future topics.", "Comment: You\u2019re trying to trick me.Response: Aw, I would never. I\u2019m nice. \u2764", "Comment: No, seriously, you\u2019re trying to trick me.Response: You do bring up a pretty relevant methodology point.", "In experimental economics, it\u2019s very important that the experimenter never tricks the participant. If we say the bucket has 3 colors of golf balls in it, that\u2019s what it has in it. If we say those ball colors are determined at the beginning of the game, we won\u2019t do a sleight of hand switcheroo on you. We also don\u2019t keep any money we \u201csave\u201d if you don\u2019t win, so we\u2019re not playing against you.", "We\u2019re not trying to induce aberrant behavior, we\u2019re trying to reveal existing behavior. So it goes against our best interest to trick anyone into doing something other than what they\u2019d do in similar situations in the wild. (That the participant might be surprised in hindsight by what they chose is another matter.)", "In the lab, we go to great lengths to explain (verbally and on the consent form) that what the participant sees is what the participant gets. What they choose is up to them. The payoffs are real and there\u2019s no trickery. Since experimental economics is the tradition I was trained in, I\u2019m not trying to trick you either. But I\u2019m not surprised that you\u2019re assuming I am.", "Our tradition struggles with participants whose trust has been polluted by other fields where trickery is part of the fun. (I\u2019m not pointing any fingers, nope, not at all, I wouldn\u2019t dare to accuse any, ahem, social psychology labs of lying to participants.) In the end, experimental economics labs end up bleeding a lot of budget to repair that broken trust (for example by doing practice rounds followed by real cash put in the participant\u2019s hand if they win).", "Comment: [Insert comment about variance reduction here.]Response: Er, no, variance is not defined without a distribution. You\u2019ll have to go Bayesian to proceed with this train of thought, which brings me to\u2026", "Comment: [Insert Bayesian comment here.]Response: Bayesian buddies, are you struggling to clamber over our language barrier here? To map the things behavioral economists are calling risk vs uncertainty onto your lingo:Objective risk involves probability calculations with \u201cobjective\u201d priors. If the word \u201cobjective\u201d enrages the epistemological nitpickers among you, replace it with the word \u201cspoonfed.\u201d These are priors either dictated to you by someone (the decision-maker in charge, the professor assigning your homework, tradition, etc.) or perhaps they\u2019re priors everyone would generally agree on (e.g. treating coins as fair and moving along without bickering).Subjective risk involves probability calculations with priors you have to choose.Ambiguity involves feeling like you\u2019re powerless to come up with priors/assumptions in the first place. The cordon separating ambiguity from subjective risk for a given situation varies from person to person. In the article, the \u201ceconomist\u201d character never faces ambiguity aversion in the Ellsberg setting because they\u2019re trained to think* in a way that leapfrogs ambiguity and goes straight to subjective risk. That\u2019s not because they\u2019re immune to ambiguity aversion but rather because they don\u2019t see the Ellsberg setting as ambiguous.", "*Economists are taught to apply the Principle of Indifference. If we\u2019re blessed with professors who make us practice, many of us learn to do it near-instinctively. Thanks Jacob Tan for writing up an explanation of what that is so that I don\u2019t have to.", "Perhaps you\u2019d find it useful to think of the phenomenon of ambiguity aversion in terms of a sort of distress the decision-maker feels when forced to come up with a prior. I\u2019m not talking about the distress of picking parameters to plug into a conjugate prior, I\u2019m talking about coming up with assumptions covering the entire setup. Students double-majoring in Bayesian statistics and behavioral economics could probably squeeze a thesis out of attempts to quantify subcategories of ambiguity through the difficulty of prior elicitation\u2026", "Comment: It\u2019s just a thought experiment; people wouldn\u2019t choose A&D if there were real money involved.Response: Great instinct, but no. My undergrad advisor and favorite prof was John List. Lovely guy in every way, but a tyrant on one topic: unrealistic experimental setup. Which makes sense, since he\u2019s the fellow who pioneered the use of field experiments in economics. John\u2019s voice still lives in my head, \u201cIf it\u2019s a thought experiment, it doesn\u2019t count, take it to the lab. But you\u2019re not done yet! If it\u2019s a lab experiment, it doesn\u2019t count, take it to the field (the real world). Always study choice behavior with real rewards in realistic settings.\u201d Thanks to field experimenters like John, most of the pillars of modern decision theory \u2014 including this one \u2014 have been fully replicated in the real world with real money. (Before you ask, yes, it did occur to them to vary the reward amounts.)", "Thanks for reading!
