We\u2019re all guilty without acknowledging it. Recall the many iPhones (or Android phones) we either sell or stash away in our drawers just because we want to get our hands on the latest one. What for? A battery that lasts an hour longer and a camera that has a marginally higher resolution.", "It\u2019s the countless number of Hello Kitties or Pok\u00e9mon figurines we spend hours queuing up for, just because they\u2019re \u2018limited edition\u2019. It\u2019s that favorite piece of apparel that we own in different colors, just because we can. It\u2019s the shelves and wardrobes full of clothes and shoes that we tell ourselves we desperately need \u2013 beach wear, informal wear, formal wear, home wear, sleep wear, party wear, etc \u2013 but we actually don\u2019t.", "To many of us who are guilty, this phenomenon of consumerism and materialism is justified. What we don\u2019t realize however, is how much Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fueling this phenomenon.", "And it will only be exacerbated by AI in 2020.", "Let\u2019s be honest \u2014 AI is already fueling consumerism. The best part? We don\u2019t even realize how suckered we are into the whole \u2018consumerism\u2019 phenomenon. If we do, climate change and this whole push for a \u2018greener\u2019 lifestyle won\u2019t even exist.", "But this is not what this article is about. So even though the stuff we consume generates about 60 percent of global greenhouse gases [1], we\u2019re going to take a moment to ignore this sad truth and examine how AI will fuel more consumerism.", "How often do you click on a sponsored advertisement on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube or any other website? How often do you spot an advertisement on your news feed when you haven\u2019t even searched Google for it but only vaguely remember mentioning it to someone, and feeling completely freaked out?", "Answer: Not sure, but definitely more and more frequently", "Relax, people aren\u2019t spying on you. These algorithms are just getting better. With more and more data about you, these recommendation systems are able to fine-tune their weights of various parameters to obtain an almost perfect replica (model) of you (or so that\u2019s what it seems).", "These recommendation systems are perfect examples of perpetuating consumerism. They encourage you to get things you might want or need earlier than you usually would, simply by appearing in front of your eyes (visual stimulation).", "Sure, some might argue that it\u2019s another form of marketing. And it certainly is. But the whole idea of ad-targeting can be so scary when we think about sagas like Brexit, the Trump presidential election and of course the whole Cambridge Analytica hoo-ha that led to what we now know as Data Protection policies and even regulations.", "Heck, it even makes me worried to give my email away for free WiFi because I wouldn\u2019t want people to know where I am and selling that information away. The paranoia is real.", "Recommendation systems are everywhere \u2014 e-commerce websites, social media, subscription based services (Netflix, Spotify, Medium, etc) and more. Consumerism is no longer just about material goods. It also includes content like music, movies, books and any written articles.", "The better these algorithms get (i.e. more data), the more consumerism perpetuates.", "Jeff Bezos is brilliant. Investors love his company because of how much shareholder value he has brought, not to mention the conglomerate-like business model Amazon has. Competitors hate him because they struggle to keep up due to the lack of economies of scale and lack resources to scale vertically.", "Of course, this isn\u2019t just about Amazon. It\u2019s about the whole e-commerce industry and the push toward brick-and-mortar liberalization, just like how Thanos snapped his fingers after gathering the Infinity Stones and made half the population disappear. As inconceivable as it seems, we\u2019re surely getting there slowly. I believe that the experience of entering a brick-and-mortar store will soon shift from a purely transactional basis to an experiential one.", "Recently, Amazon announced free same-day and one-day delivery to its customers in the U.S.. Its increase ($9.6 billion) in spending not only involves shipping and receiving, but also distribution and reverse logistics (returns & repairs) over land, sea and air. The goal: So you never need to shop anywhere else.", "Alibaba has followed suit, spending $16 billion on a courier venture, in an attempt to build out its own delivery platform [2]. It\u2019s also in response to JD.com\u2019s first move into the e-commerce market offering same-day delivery in China.", "Like Scott so brilliantly mentioned in his article (link below), this has huge implications on companies like DHL, FedEx and UPS [3]. It now makes more sense for these companies to be acquired by companies like Amazon or Walmart lest being completely ousted if they are unable to match the same-day delivery service provided. They definitely might be able to, but at a higher cost. Either way, something drastic has to happen.", "Where does AI come into play?", "If you haven\u2019t already seen Alibaba\u2019s warehouse on YouTube [4], you should. Robots run most of the operations in the warehouse and I\u2019d imagine most warehouses looking like that in the future.", "It\u2019s essentially a haven for computer science geeks. The warehouse resembles a Pac-Man board, with Pac-Man (robots) having to navigate through the maze (rows of items) to obtain food (pick-up item) and avoid ghosts (other robots). What we have is a combination of a routing problem (traveling salesmen problem) and also a scheduling problem. With AI, these problems become easier. The use of deep Q-learning (reinforcement learning agents) and computer vision makes typical computer science problems much more solvable.", "My bet is that e-commerce companies will all shift toward this gold standard of an automated warehouse. If they don\u2019t, they lose competitiveness and Amazon\u2019s goal will be achieved.", "Increased consumerism is a mere consequence of such breakneck delivery speeds.", "If returns are as convenient as having a courier arrive at your doorstep the next day (not to mention parcel drop-off points being so prevalent), who would go out anymore when you can try things from the comfort of your home?", "This section does not relate directly to how AI fuels consumerism, but is something I would like to bring up due to a shift in business model in a cloud-based era.", "I\u2019m pretty sure in 2020, no one will dispute that technology companies are driving and will continue to drive the global economy. Companies that spring up are based on an asset-lite model whereas companies that already exist for a long time are also abandoning ship and moving toward an asset-lite model. Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Alibaba will reap all these profits, not to mention the great margins on these cloud services.", "Spotify allows streaming of music. YouTube allows streaming of video content. Netflix allows streaming of movies and television series. Gaming is moving towards cloud, where expensive gaming hardware would no longer be necessary to run games at a high frame rate. Gone were the days where CDs were used for music, DVDs were used for movies and gaming rigs were used for hardcore gaming. All you need now is good internet to fuel consumption.", "While we look forward to a rewarding year ahead, let\u2019s take a moment to appreciate how much AI has improved our lives. While we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s also observe a moment of silence to commemorate the environment\u2019s sacrifice for us so that we can enjoy same-day delivery.", "R.I.P. koalas and other animals in Australia [5].", "Your home for data science.
