Many times have we seen projects fail that ultimately started for the wrong reasons So:", "Why are we making an autonomous sailboat?", "Short answer: It provides a fantastic environment to learn how to apply machine learning.", "It\u2019s not because people are tired of steering sailboats themselves or we want to win the America\u2019s cup with our new hypersmart steering system. No, this challenge has certain ingredients that make it excellent for learning:", "In our course, we are taking a different approach than most other AI courses. We do not start with the basic concepts and build it up until we can solve the puzzle. We will take a different route and aim for the grand prize immediately. By constantly keeping the main objective (creating an autonomous sailboat) in mind, you will remain more engaged and motivated along the way.", "Let\u2019s refine our goal a little bit. Creating an autonomous sailboat sounds reasonable but is not really SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound), is it?", "We can define our goal as follows:", "Create an autopilot (steering mechanism) for a sailboat that will allow it to participate in a sailboat race in a competitive manner.", "Still it seems like a pretty big nut to crack. It usually helps to split up a problem into smaller problems that we can solve individually. Something like this might help:", "Goal 1: Finding the optimal course to steer, accounting for the wind direction and speed", "Goal 2: Making the boat steer this optimal course", "Goal 3: Apply race tactics so we can choose actions that maximise our chance of winning", "Wow, goal 1 seems to be a lot more practical now. We can ask really concrete questions like: What is the optimal course for a sailboat given the wind direction and speed?", "I\u2019m glad you asked\u2026 Let\u2019s dive right in!", "Before we can do something with machine learning, we first need to learn a thing or two about sailing. This \u2018domain knowledge\u2019 is essential for the success of a machine learning project. Next to having the wrong motivations, lack of domain knowledge is the second reason why many machine learning projects fail. Either we solve the problem wrong, or we solve the wrong problem.", "Consider the scenario in figure 1. Assume we need to go to the Mark on top and the wind is coming directly from above. As you might know: we cannot sail directly into the wind (see this video for some background information on this). But if the the wind comes from the side, we\u2019ll never hit the mark. So there is an optimum between these two extremes. Finding this optimum is our goal.", "The relationship between wind angle, wind speed and boat speed is typically displayed by sailors in polar diagrams. Figure 2 shows an example of such a diagram.", "The thick black line expresses the boat speed at certain wind angles (relative to the boat) and speeds. Different curves are plotted for wind speeds of 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20 knots. Boat speed is usually measured in knots where 1 knot \u2248 1,85kph. Now it becomes very easy to read the boat speed for say: 10 knots of wind at 110 degrees wind angle (the answer is about 7 knots). More importantly, this diagram helps us to find the optimal VMG (see video: Velocity Made Good).", "Easy right? We don\u2019t need machine learning for that. Except that we don\u2019t have those polar diagrams available for every boat. Usually the boat designer provides some theoretical polars but professional teams need to create their own for maximal performance.", "Now we can reframe the first objective to something even more concrete:", "Predict the boat speed for a certain direction, given the wind speed and direction.", "With such a model, we can easily predict the course with maximum VMG. Now let\u2019s go on and see how we can use machine learning to achieve this!", "In the course we will use examples other than our autonomous sailboat. When we introduce new concepts we will link them to our objectives using an insert like this:", "So, what is machine learning? Lets first define learning itself. The Google web definition tells us:", "Learning: the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught", "This applies to computers, as well as humans. Later we will see that indeed: humans and computers learn in a very similar way.", "In machines the acquired knowledge resides in what\u2019s called a model. The model learns during the training phase and will be used later to perform its final task in the application. Making predictions for example.", "Model: the system\u2019s view of the world, contains what the system has learned", "Following the learning definition above there are three broad categories of machine learning:", "Currently this is the most common form of machine learning. We know what the result must be and we \u2018teach\u2019 the machine to come closer by providing good and bad examples of the data.", "More specific: we want our model to be able to translate a given input (often named X) to a certain output (often named y). We train the model by feeding it examples of outputs with corresponding inputs. This is called the training set.", "Another way to define it is by writing it as a mathematical formula:", "Here f is the function (the model) that translates the input into the output.", "This is technically a form of supervised learning, except that the teacher is not a human. The system learns from its environment by trial and error.", "The model still has inputs and outputs but we do not have a training set with examples. Instead, we have something called a reward function that the model tries to maximise.", "Even without a teacher, a machine can learn to find structure in the data it receives. For example: \u2018clustering\u2019 and \u2018dimensionality reduction\u2019. See below for an example of dimensionality reduction. The system finds examples of photos that look similar.", "OBJECTIVE \u2014 Finding the optimal course", "QuestionWhat machine learning type would be most appropriate for our goal?", "AnswerWe have a labeled dataset available, so we can use supervised learning.", "Within supervised learning there are two main types of problems that we can solve. The type depends on the desired output.", "Imagine that you want to determine if a certain image contains a dog or a cat. This would be an example of classification.", "Classification: the goal is to predict a class or category", "Another example: Let\u2019s say we want to predict the amount of smog in Beijing given the weather prediction and the season. This would be a regression problem.", "Regression: the goal is to predict a real number", "OBJECTIVE \u2014 Finding the optimal course", "QuestionWould our goal be a classification or a regression type problem?", "AnswerClearly a regression problem since we want to predict boat speed which is a real number.", "Now, we take a look at the input data for a machine learning system. The model needs to know the properties of the thing we want to learn about. These properties or attributes are called features.", "Let\u2019s use fruit as an example: the weight and color of the fruit are both features.", "The model can use these features to make a prediction about the kind of fruit we are observing. This would be classification.", "Trying to predict the diameter based on the weight and color is a regression problem.", "OBJECTIVE \u2014 Finding the optimal course", "QuestionWhat would be the features of the model for our goal?", "Ok, but how do we go from the features to the prediction? First we have to train our model.", "Let\u2019s stay with our fruit example. We want to determine the type of fruit based on weight and color. First we need to convert the color to a number. We pick the light wavelength in nm. Green becomes 520nm and orange 600nm. We plot both numbers in a graph.", "The goal of training is to find a line that separates the kiwis and oranges. The line starts out completely at random. With each training step the model tries to move the line a little bit more in the right direction. After some time, more and more fruit will end up at the correct side of the line.", "After 5 steps, we are satisfied with the results. The training stops and we can now make predictions with our brand new trained model.", "This follows the same basic principle. Now we are going to predict the price per orange, based on the weight. The goal is to draw a line that closely matches the examples we used for training.", "After training the model gives us an estimated price per orange for a given weight.", "So how can we use a machine learning model to predict the boat speed for a certain direction, given the wind speed and direction? Before we can start training we need data!", "Suppose you have logged the wind speed, wind direction and boat speed every time your team went sailing last year. You encountered a lot of different weather (and waves) conditions. After cleaning this data you end up with a big table with numbers. A random sample from this data frame is shown in figure 9.", "In this case boat_speed is our target variable. Our input features are wind_speed and angle_of_attack.", "In our course we use the data gathered on the boat to train a machine learning model. Participants will use these predictions to make their own polar diagram of the boat. As mentioned earlier this will play an important role in making the boat autonomous and competitive in a race.", "Then we test the models on the water by hooking them up with the sailboat. We also hold a virtual race with all participants to find out which model works best!", "In this blog post you\u2019ve discovered our approach to subgoal 1 of the autonomous sailing challenge \u2014 finding the optimal course, and learned a few key concepts of machine learning.", "So what happened to subgoal 2 and 3? Subgoal 1 was already a lot to cover in one blog post so stay tuned for future posts covering the other part of the challenge.", "That\u2019s it, we hope you were inspired by machine learning, sail racing or preferably both!
