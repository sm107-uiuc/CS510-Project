You need to pay the price and put in the work for months or years to see the first fruits. It\u2019s not an easy road but a very satisfying one. So I\u2019ll focus on skills you should start honing and what you need in order to succeed.", "I need to say that first: data science requires you to learn statistics and linear algebra. And it\u2019s better if you do that before you start going into machine learning algorithms and do more advanced material. Without statistics you\u2019d be often at a loss why certain methods don\u2019t work, you won\u2019t be able to interpret results properly and correct them in a good direction.", "You\u2019ll be working twice as hard and long for something which is not necessary.", "The other technical skill you need is coding in Python. You need to feel at ease with Python as you\u2019ll often need to prototype your solutions to a given problem. If you can do that quickly, you can then start iterating and arriving at a better solution. If that part slows you down and you need to think each time how to put your solution into working code, then you end up forgetting about the problem you\u2019re trying to solve by losing yourself in unimportant technical details.", "Don\u2019t go this way \u2014 it\u2019s better to spend a couple of months polishing your statistics and Python skills than later having to return to the same material over and over when you\u2019ll need to solve a data science problem.", "Finally, if you\u2019re accustomed to Python and statistics you should start polishing your problem solving skills. This is a never-ending story. After all Data Science is about problem solving. You need to be able to", "The best way to practice problem solving is\u2026 by problem solving. This is a practical skill. You can start coding and implementing algorithms to small problems, go on Kaggle and find a dataset/problem for yourself. It\u2019s all about finding new problems and trying to solve them.", "Problem solving is a mindset which becomes a skill with enough practice.", "From a non-technical standpoint, there are two main skills you need to develop as a data scientist.", "First of all, you\u2019ll need to visualize your results. That can be", "or many other things. The important thing is whatever form you choose it needs to be clear what you\u2019re presenting \u2014 both to you and to others. Visualizing your results helps greatly in understanding data and a problem you\u2019re trying to solve at a time. Especially if you\u2019re confronting a new, large dataset and you have no idea what to expect.", "Then visualization can help immensely in showing others why your results matter and how to use them, whether you present them to other developers, data scientists or business people. Visual data is easy to grasp, because you don\u2019t have to imagine numbers \u2014 you see them straight away.", "Secondly, communicating in a clear, honest way is very important. If you can deliver a short talk about your results, presenting them on a graph at the same time, you\u2019ll do a great job which will allow others to interact with you, learn and respond. Of course, you don\u2019t need to have any public speaking skills, I\u2019m talking about small teams of a couple of people you\u2019ll be presenting the results to, but it\u2019s really important that you can make a coherent story out of your data. This will be helpful both in large corporations, small startups and if you\u2019re a freelance data scientist. People understand through seeing more than through reading or hearing.", "Summing up, the most essential data science skills you should have as a Data Scientist are", "If you master those, you\u2019ll become an amazing data scientist.", "More than that, Data Science will become the best career path you might have chosen.", "If you want to read more about becoming a Data Scientist, have a look at my other articles:", "Your home for data science.
