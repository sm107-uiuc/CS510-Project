Traditional systems repurpose classifiers to perform detection. Basically, to detect any object, the system takes a classifier for that object and then classifies its presence at various locations in the image. Other systems generate potential bounding boxes in an image using region proposal methods and then run a classifier on these potential boxes. This results in a slightly efficient method. After classification, post-processing is used to refine the bounding boxes, eliminate duplicate detection, etc. Due to these complexities, the system becomes slow and hard to optimize because each component has to be trained separately.", "The base model can process images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO can process images at 155 frames per second while achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM (Deformable Parts Models) and R-CNN.", "YOLO reframes object detection as a single regression problem instead of a classification problem. This system only looks at the image once to detect what objects are present and where they are, hence the name YOLO.", "The system divides the image into an S x S grid. Each of these grid cells predicts B bounding boxes and confidence scores for these boxes. The confidence score indicates how sure the model is that the box contains an object and also how accurate it thinks the box is that predicts. The confidence score can be calculated using the formula:", "IoU: Intersection over Union between the predicted box and the ground truth.", "If no object exists in a cell, its confidence score should be zero.", "Each bounding box consists of five predictions: x, y, w, h, and confidence where,", "(x,y): Coordinates representing the center of the box. These coordinates are calculated with respect to the bounds of the grid cells.", "w: Width of the bounding box.", "h: Height of the bounding box.", "Each grid cell also predicts C conditional class probabilities Pr(Classi|Object). It only predicts one set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the number of boxes B. During testing, these conditional class probabilities are multiplied by individual box confidence predictions which give class-specific confidence scores for each box. These scores show both the probability of that class and how well the box fits the object.", "The final predictions are encoded as an S x S x (B*5 + C) tensor.", "IoU is used to evaluate the object detection algorithm. It is the overlap between the ground truth and the predicted bounding box, i.e it calculates how similar the predicted box is with respect to the ground truth.", "Usually, the threshold for IoU is kept as greater than 0.5. Although many researchers apply a much more stringent threshold like 0.6 or 0.7. If a bounding box has an IoU less than the specified threshold, that bounding box is not taken into consideration.", "The algorithm may find multiple detections of the same object. Non-max suppression is a technique by which the algorithm detects the object only once. Consider an example where the algorithm detected three bounding boxes for the same object. The boxes with respective probabilities are shown in the image below.", "The probabilities of the boxes are 0.7, 0.9, and 0.6 respectively. To remove the duplicates, we are first going to select the box with the highest probability and output that as a prediction. Then eliminate any bounding box with IoU > 0.5 (or any threshold value) with the predicted output. The result will be:", "The base model has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. It uses 1 x 1 reduction layers followed by a 3 x 3 convolutional layer. Fast YOLO uses a neural network with 9 convolutional layers and fewer filters in those layers. The complete network is shown in the figure.", "This was a brief explanation of the research paper as well as details obtained from various other sources. I hope I made this concept easier for you to understand.", "Although if you really want to check your understanding, the best way is to implement the algorithm. In the next section, we will do exactly that. Many details cannot be explained via text and can only be understood while implementing it.", "Thank you for reading.
