The version jumped from 0.25 to 1.0 there aren\u2019t any drastic changes as some pandas users expect. The version increase merely echoes the maturity of the data processing library.", "While there aren\u2019t many groundbreaking changes, there are a few that you should know about.", "Here are a few links that might interest you:", "Some of the links above are affiliate links and if you go through them to make a purchase I\u2019ll earn a commission. Keep in mind that I link courses because of their quality and not because of the commission I receive from your purchases.", "To Step Up Your Pandas Game, read:", "Rolling window functions are very useful when working with time-series data (eg. calculation of moving average). The previous version of pandas required that we pass the window size parameter, eg. calculate moving average on 3 periods. With pandas 1.0 we can bypass this requirement as we show in the example below.", "Let\u2019s calculate the moving average of values until the current number is not greater than 10. First, we create a DataFrame with 3 values greater or equal than 10.", "Window function should expand until a value greater or equal to 10 is not reached.", "For dynamic size window functions, we need to implement a custom indexer, which inherits from pandas BaseIndexer class. BaseIndexer class has a get_window_bounds function, which calculates the start and end for each window.", "We put the indexer class in the rolling function and we calculate the mean for each window. We can also observe the start and the end indices of each window.", "Pandas uses Cython as a default execution engine with rolling apply. In pandas 1.0, we can specify Numba as an execution engine and get a decent speedup.", "There are a few things to note:", "Let\u2019s create a DataFrame with 1 million values.", "some_function calculates the sum of values and adds 5.", "Let\u2019s measure execution time with the Cython execution engine.", "Cython needed 4.03 seconds to calculate the function. Is Numba faster? Let\u2019s try it.", "We see that Numba is 8 times faster with this toy example.", "pandas 1.0 introduces a new experimental pd.NA value to represent scalar missing values.", "I know what you are thinking \u2014 yet another null value? There are nan, None and NaT already!", "The goal of pd.NA is to provide consistency across data types. It is currently used by the Int64, boolean and the new string data type", "Let\u2019s create a Series of integers with None.", "What surprises me is that the NA == NA produces NA while np.nan == np.nan produces False.", "pandas 1.0 has finally a dedicated (experimental) string type. Before 1.0, strings were stored as objects, so we couldn\u2019t be sure if the series contains just strings or it is mixed with other data types as I demonstrate below.", "Storing strings as objects become a problem, when we unintentionally mix them with integers or floats \u2014 data type stays object.", "To test the new string dtype we need to set dtype=\u2019string\u2019.", "New string data type returns an exception with integers or floats in the series. Great improvement!", "When we sort a DataFrame by a certain column, the index also gets sorted. Sometimes we don\u2019t want that. In pandas 1.0, sort_values function takes ignore index, which does as the name of the argument suggests.", "These were the 5 most interesting pandas features based on my opinion. In the long term, new NA for missing values could bring a lot of clarity to pandas. Eg. how functions handle missing values, do they skip them or not.", "There is also a change in deprecation policy:", "The new deprecation policy makes this question: \u201cshould I update pandas?\u201d easier to answer. It also seems that we can expect more frequent major releases in the future.
