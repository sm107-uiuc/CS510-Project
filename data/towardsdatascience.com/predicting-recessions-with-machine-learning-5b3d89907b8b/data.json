In \u201cA Tales of Two Cities\u201d , Charles Dickens describes the dichotomous juxtaposition of the literal and the metaphorical during the era of the French revolution. Although not as extreme, we can draw parallels from its passage to the current environment; as we\u2019ve seen stock markets soar to all time highs and yields to all time lows, the economic fundamentals of the global economy have remained stubbornly repressed.", "It is a well known fact that in response to The Great Recession (GFC) central banks around the world synchronously provided liquidity to markets in hopes of reigniting growth and inflation. However, almost in true Dickensian fashion, this has done little to spur wage growth and consumption. Instead, lower rates served only to buoy assets to unprecedented valuations, much to the benefit of asset owners but to the chagrin of the common person. In short, the rich have become richer.", "This dislocation between the underlying drivers of the economy and pricing reveals a deep and perverse dynamic binding monetary policy and market expectation. The market has come to anticipate continued central bank easing, in fact, even require it in order to persist on the same upwards trajectory unabated. Any information that has challenged this consensus has caused sharp negative knee jerk reactions. Notably two weeks ago, the Fed cut rates for the first time in a decade, this in theory was exactly what was needed to maintain positive performance, however the magnitude of the cut (smaller than initially expected) and Chairman Powell\u2019s post meeting comments, were not conducive to a sustained asset inflation narrative. As such, risk taking behavior was punished.", "Even more recent was the occurrence of the yield curve inversion phenomena. The widely scrutinized spread between the yield on the two year and ten year US treasury bonds has been seen to turn negative in the lead up to the last 7 US recessions, causing many market commentators and practitioners to closely monitor this data point as a leading indicator. Many have noted that the historical lag between inversion and recession can range from months to nearly two years. As data minded observers, this lays the perfect foundation for our inquiry; given the market\u2019s incessant and disproportionate focus on this metric, can we implement machine learning to predict US recessions by using only the spread between the 10 year and 2 year US treasury bonds?", "A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth(GDP), as such we can obtain the dates that fit this description from the St Louis Federal Research Economic Database here. This time series takes binary form, with 1 denoting a recession period and 0 other wise.", "Next we obtain the yield curve spread data from the same database here. This is calculated as the month end 10 year treasury yield minus the 2 year treasury yield.", "Our machine learning tool of choice is logistic regression, a favorite among economists and data scientists alike. We use this particular algorithm for 3 reasons:", "Two adjustments need to be made in order to proceed, both due to the quarterly reporting frequency of US GDP data:", "With the help of the Generalized Linear Model (glm) function and the Caret package in R, we split the the time series into 70% training set and 30% test set. We fit a logit model on the training set and validate against the test, the results were as follows:", "Prediction accuracy is fantastic! 87% ! Yield curve inversions must be a great predictor of recessions! But wait, something\u2019s not right here, let us take a closer look at the evaluation metrics. Whilst accuracy is high, prevalence, sensitivity and detection rate are all alarmingly low. An inspection of the confusion matrix may provide some additional insight.", "We can immediately see that the model is very good at predicting true negatives (130 correct predictions), and frankly not much else. This illustrates an important affliction of this particular dataset. While there are hundreds of instances of non-inversions/non recessions there are far fewer instances of inversion/recession. This is in fact a very imbalanced data set, if we were to predict every instance in the test set as non-recessionary we\u2019d still get 85% accuracy. If we look at the balanced accuracy rate in the evaluation metrics which adjusts for imbalance we see that the model is little better than flipping a coin (58%). This seems to be contradictory to what commentary and news will lead us to believe, so then, what does yield curve inversion really tell us?", "While there is information in the term structure of the yield curve about economic growth prospects ,as supported by a large body of academic literature and theory (see FRB article here and Ang, Piazzesi and Wei, 2003), we should not engineer false precision by viewing one data point in isolation. The economy exists as a series of moving parts which constantly interact with each other and therefore needs to be viewed as a whole. Of equal pertinence to future outlook is the inflation regime and direction of monetary policy. Using only curve inversions as a predictor of recessions is a prime example of cherry picking data to fit pre-constructed narratives that is symptomatic of the Street. This type of behavioral bias is not without precedent, Nobel Prize winners Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky conjectured that when faced with uncertainty humans resort to heuristics/rules of thumb to aid our decision making. While we are all only human, we still have the distinct ability to employ quantitative tools like machine learning to serve as objective validations of unproven claims, when given the opportunity we should exercise this right. Although no code is provided, I\u2019m happy to discuss the methodology with R code in full in another post if there is interest.", "Ang, A., Piazzesi, M. and Wei, M. (2003).
