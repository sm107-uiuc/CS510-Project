Take-1 \ud83c\udfac, I tried to decode the rocket science behind the working of The Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) ML algorithm, and after going through it\u2019s algorithmic insights, you too must have realized that it\u2019s quite a painless algorithm. In this blog post, we will walk-through it\u2019s complete step by step pythonic implementation ( using basic python only) and it will be quite evident that how easy it is to code NB from scratch and that NB is not that Na\u00efve at classifying !", "Since I always wanted to decipher ML for absolute beginners and as it is said that if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably didn't understand it, so yeah this blog post too is especially intended for ML beginners.", "As I just mentioned above, a complete walk-through of NB pythonic implementation", "Milestone # 1: Data Preprocessing Function", "Milestone # 2: Implementation of NaiveBayes Class \u2014 Defining Functions for Training & Testing", "Milestone # 3: Training NB Model on Training Dataset", "Milestone # 4: Testing Using Trained NB Model", "Milestone # 5: Proving that the Code for NaiveBayes Class is Absolutely Generic!", "Before we begin writing code for Naive Bayes in python, I assume you are familiar with:", "Let\u2019s Begin the with the Pythonic Implementation !", "Let\u2019s begin with a few imports that we would need while implementing Naive Bayes", "The Bonus Part : We will be writing a a fully generic code for the NB Classifier! No matter how many classes come into the training dataset and whatever text dataset is given \u2014 it will still be able to train a fully working model.", "The code for NaiveBayes is just a little extensive \u2014 but we just to need to spend a maximum of 10\u201315 minutes to grasp it! After that, you will have a sound grip over all crucial concepts.", "There are in total four functions defined in the NaiveBayes Class:", "And the code is divided into two major functions i.e train & test functions. Once you understand the statements defined inside these two functions, you will surely get to know what the code is actually doing and in what order the other two functions are being called.", "The other two functions are defined to supplement these two major functions", "You can view the above code in this Jupyter Notebook too", "It is much much more easier to organize and reuse the code if we define a class of NB rather than use the traditional structured programming approach. That\u2019s the reason of defining a NB class and all it\u2019s relevant functions inside it.", "We don\u2019t just want to write code, rather we want to write beautiful, neat & clean, handy, and reusable code . Yes that\u2019s right - we want to possess all the traits that a good data scientist could possibly have !", "And guess what? Whenever we will be dealing with a text classification problem that we intend to solve using NB, we will simply instantiate its object and by using the same programming interface, we will be able to train a NB classifier. Plus, as its the general principle of Object Oriented Programming that we only define functions relevant to a class inside that class, so all functions that are not relevant to NB class will be defined separately", "Milestone # 2 Achieved \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d", "And yes that\u2019s it !Just a matter of four functions and we are all set to go for training our NB Model on any text dataset and with any number of class labels!", "If you are curious to know what the training data actually looks like \u2026.. It\u2019s a newsgroups dataset consisting of newsgroups posts on 20 topics . It has 20 classes, but for the time being, we will train our NB model on just four categories \u2014 [\u2018alt.atheism\u2019, \u2018comp.graphics\u2019, \u2018sci.med\u2019, \u2018soc.religion.christian\u2019] but the code works perfectly well for training against all 20 categories as well.", "You might be wondering why the column of \u201cTraining Labels\u201d is in numeric form rather than their original string textual form. It\u2019s just that every string label has been mapped to it\u2019s unique numeric Integer form. Even if this is unclear to you at the moment, just consider that a dataset has been provided and it has it\u2019s labels in numeric form. Simple !", "So before we start training a NB Model, let\u2019s load this dataset\u2026We will load a dataset from sklearn ( python\u2019s ML Framework)\u2014 but we still coded NB from scratch!", "So now that we have trained our NB Model \u2014 let\u2019s move to testing!Loading the test set\u2026..", "Testing on above loaded test examples using our trained NB Model\u2026.", "Wow! Pretty Good Accuracy of ~ 93% \u270c\ufe0f See now you realize NB is not that Na\u00efve !", "As I mentioned in the beginning that the code we have written is generic, so let\u2019s use the same code on a different dataset and with different class labels to prove it\u2019s \u201cgenericity\u201d !", "The other text dataset consists of movie reviews and their sentiments & looks something like below:", "Notice See how the same NaiveBayes code works like a charm on different datasets and yet with same programming interface !", "So that\u2019s all for this blog post and now you know it all!", "Until that Stay Tuned \ud83d\udcfb \ud83d\udcfb \ud83d\udcfb", "If you have any thoughts, comments, or questions, feel free to comment below or connect \ud83d\udcde with me on LinkedIn", "Your home for data science.
