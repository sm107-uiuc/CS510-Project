We will also discuss the main limitations. To better understand how and HCMS works behind the scene,s I will explain how I design and build RawCMS, an Aspnet.Core Headless CMS with Oauth2, extension plugin system, and business logic support. This solution is available on GitHub and released on Docker Hub as a demo.", "A traditional CMS combines content and rendering part, meanwhile, a headless CMS is focused only on the content. This may seem a limitation because barely speaking you lose something. The purpose of HCMS is to decouple logic from content making easy change management and decomposing complex application in many components, each one with his single responsibility.", "Going in this direction HCMS is something that can replace what you are calling backend and save a lot of useful work creating CRUD statements.", "HCMS born to create a multi-component application where you can quickly change presentation logic and design, and this is a big improvement when you are working on modern websites or application and you need to restyle\\change UI once at a year because of business requirement.", "Many vendors sell their product and label it at \u201cHCMS\u201d just because it is decoupled (and because it sounds cool and may drive to a sell improvement..). In my point of view, I\u2019m strictly related to the original integralist definition: headless cms means an API first, non-monolithic CMS, completely decoupled from the interface or other components.", "Why use a headless CMS? I could simply say that in some scenarios it can be useful to decouple systems, make easier frontend replacement and speed up the development phase, but I feel obliged to explain better using a bullet list.", "HCMS are quite young compared to traditional CMS so, even if a lot of product borns in last years, most of the products are not so mature to completely replace a traditional API backend. In this paragraph, I would share my experience with the limitations I found. Capabilities may vary a lot based on the specific product and if it is an on-prem or saas solution.", "Actually, there is mainly two kinds of CMS headless limitation:", "HCMS requires to employ multiple teams to benefits from work parallelization. Moreover, as the HCMS doesn\u2019t have any rendering all presentation logic is demanded to the client. This is good for decoupling, but in all cases, you have only one consumer decoupling advantages is not so relevant and you introduce more complexity and latency over the data fetch process. Another problem is about business logic. Where to implement? If you want to do not implement into HCMS you have to put it into the presentation layer and with multiple consumers you will duplicate it, falling in problems you have when logic is in more than one place. Otherwise trying to put it into HMS you will discover that most cloud solution\\products are not so flexible. This introduces the next topic, what are all the HCMS limitations?", "Testing the most important HCMS solution I fall in many difficult and the following is the list of the most common limitations. Take into account that this depends on the product, someone may have or not but generally speaking most are quite common.", "Headless CMS is a great opportunity but there we have to understand what is the best scenario to employ it to optimize cost\\benefit ratio. The matter is that using regular HCMS, the customization is quite limited so in case you are not in the right scenario it will be hard to blend the HCMS to achieve the business requirement. Moreover, using it just like a bare data storage make it meaningless things.", "When using an HCMS is convenient:", "When do not use an HCMS:", "HCMS are great because they decouple by design presentation layer from the backend, and that\u2019s a good driver. HCMS is a great opportunity but, nowadays, its hard to employ in the real project except where there are very simple business logic and well-defined behavior. It would be great to overcome these limits and employ as a \u201cgeneral-purpose backend\u201d, where you spend time only to teach the system about data schema, relation and tune only what is non-standard. The matter is that this is, generally speaking, hard to implement (thrust who try to do it).", "Here you can find the full article on Headless CMS and on git-hub the source code of my implementation.", "Found this article useful?
