Our 5 year old on the other hand, couldn\u2019t care less about doing any physical activity, unless it gets him closer to his (my\u2026) iPad.", "Normally, This issue is partially remedied simply by being a kid, which involves a fair amount of running, climbing, falling\u2026 and recently cycling! But unfortunately, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can\u2019t really do any of that.", "So, I turned his bicycles into a keyboard.", "Now, he can play his favourite computer games and exercise at the same time! In this short article, I\u2019ll walk you through the process of building your very own keyboard bike.", "The first step is turning the bicycle into indoor training bikes by getting the rear wheel to spin freely without touching the ground, and allow the handlebars to turn freely as well. If your kid is propelled forward, you should NOT proceed to the following steps.", "There are many ways of getting the bike to remain in place while spinning the pedals. Hanging the bicycle from the ceiling, digging a hole in the floor beneath the wheel and many more. I personally used the training wheels to support the rear, but this is your place to get creative, and more importantly, be responsible. I am deliberately avoiding getting into too much detail about my implementation of this part (you can get a pretty good idea from the various pictures and gifs in this article\u2026) as it is your responsibility to make sure that the bicycle are secure and safe to use.", "After securing the bike so that it can be pedalled in place, we will connect sensors to capture the rotation of the rear wheel, position of the handle bars and some buttons for extra control (these can be easily programmed later to map any keyboard key). Data from all sensors will be captured and transformed by an Arduino that will function as a keyboard and send keystrokes to a computer running a (most likely racing) game.", "We must use a board that can function as a USB keyboard. I used Arduino Leonardo.", "I used 3 types of sensors:1. A1302 Hall Effect Sensor \u2014 This sensor changes its output voltage when in the proximity of a magnetic field. We will use it to transform the rotation of the rear wheel to a forward key press.2. 10K ohm linear potentiometer \u2014 Used to transform the handlebar orientation to left/right keys.3. Microswitch \u2014 used as extra controllers. I highly recommend using this type of switches (limit switch) and not going for some fancy buttons. these switches are very responsive, whereas buttons can sometimes be challenging for a kid to press.", "By placing magnets on the rear wheel, and positioning the sensor close (as close as possible without touching the wheel), we can sense the wheel\u2019s rotation as the magnets pass by the sensor. I used two magnets equally spaced (that is ~180 degrees apart).", "A tip for attaching the magnets -", "You could probably find a more elegant solution, but the one I used here is to wrap the magnets in plastic wrap and twist the ends, like a candy wrap (I am referring to the white blobs seen spinning with the wheel in the gif above). Then use the loose ends to tie the magnets to the wheel\u2019s spokes, and secure with hot glue.", "In order to get the sensor (this is referring to the red vertical rod in the gif, the sensor itself is located at its end) as close to the wheel as possible I mounted it to a flexible wire (I used some heavy duty electrical wire but any wire that will flex and keep its position will do).", "The potentiometer needs to be connected to the pivot point of the handlebars. There should be a socket for an allen wrench at that point. I used a fitting driver bit and connected it to the potentiometer. Originally, my plan was to solder both parts together, but driver bits have low (none) solder-ability. I ended up taking a short piece of straw (seen in the gif below in violet) sticking the potentiometer and driver bit from both sides, and injecting it with hot glue, to keep everything together. It\u2019s solid as a rock.", "As for securing the potentiometer to the bike frame, you will again need to get creative. my solution (which can be seen in the trailer gif and in the image at the end of the article showing all components detached from the bike) was based on making a plexiglass \u201carm\u201d to hold the potentiometer in place, and may not work for your child\u2019s bike. The idea is simple, the potentiometer needs to spin with the handlebars. Simple as it is, the implementation can be quite challenging\u2026", "I placed one of the switches behind the (redundant) front wheel brake lever, and the other one behind the not redundant back wheel brake lever, and disconnected this brake, so that the switches are pressed by pressing the brakes, which feels very natural.", "Again, I\u2019m not taking any responsibility here. if you feel the supports you made in part 1 are not strong enough and are worried about obstructing and/or disconnecting brakes, you can, and should place the buttons somewhere else. No right or wrong, as long as it\u2019s comfortable and safe. I limited myself to two buttons but you can obviously go as high as the board allows.", "After completing keyboard-bike version 1.0, I set up to improve it by making sure I can easily disconnect all components and reassemble them again as quickly as possible, this required some tweaking, that could have been avoided if I had thought of this at the get go. It took me nearly 2 hours to upgrade to keyboard-bike version 2.0, but it now takes less than a minute to assemble/disassemble.", "Another point to keep in mind is what\u2019s the best place to secure the board. I thoughtlessly put it on the side my son gets on and off the bike. In retrospect, I should have chosen the other side\u2026", "As explained in the hardware section, the keyboard bike setup is composed of 3 types of sensors: Hall effect sensor, potentiometer, and buttons. I\u2019ll explain the code for each component separately.", "The hall effect sensor is \u201cactivated\u201d when the wheel spins and the magnets pass by the sensor, inducing a change in output voltage. For this part, I switched on the key (forward key in my case) whenever there was an absolute change in voltage above a certain threshold (hall_effect_threshold). I then keep it on and start counting back for a certain amount of time (drive_decay_const). This allows tuning the amount of motion you get from each \"spike\". Increase the value of drive_decay_const to get more movement.", "Here we\u2019re basically trying to convert an \u201canalog\u201d motion of turning the handlebars into a \u201cbinary\u201d left or right clicks. A continuous press is way too dramatic if you just want to make small adjustments, so the amount of turn needs to be represented as \u201cclick amount\u201d. I\u2019m doing this by activating and deactivating turning movement at a set interval (interval), so that turning the handlebars beyond a certain threshold, will start pressing intermittently. In addition, I add a delay while the button is activated, that grows with the amount of turn. So for higher angle turns, the button will be pressed for a longer duration (that is, each click will be longer) resulting in a more aggressive turn. Also, notice that I'm initialising pot_center at setup. this is helpful for cases where the potentiometer gets disconnected from the socket. Instead of having to relocate the center, you can just reset the board, and the center will be reset.", "Nothing special here. Just replace the activated key to suit your needs. The code here is for playing SuperTuxKart which is a great racing game for kids, but the bike could obviously be adjusted for many other games. We also use it to play Minecraft, which works great.", "To conclude, I hope I did a good job of explaining how to get the keyboard bike built. If you chose to build one, and find that I have not, don\u2019t hesitate to post a comment or send me a message.", "Your home for data science.
