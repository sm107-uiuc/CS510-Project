It has been the biggest TV show of the last decade by any number of metrics, not least in terms of its budget, which, according to Variety, ran to an astonishing $15m per episode for the show\u2019s final season.", "This wasn\u2019t to be season 8\u2019s only eyebrow-raising feature, however. Despite a promising opening couple of episodes, the exceptional writing with which Game of Thrones had become synonymous began to slip. And not just a little bit. By the show\u2019s climax, plot holes were gaping wide open. Inch-thick plot-armour took all the tension out of TV\u2019s biggest ever battle sequence. Intricately constructed character arcs melted away like so many Iron Thrones torched by dragonflame. The rap sheet goes on.", "Fans were decidedly unimpressed with it all. A petition to remake the final season \u201cwith competent writers\u201d has 1.7m signatures and counting. Of course, the showrunners were faced with a nigh-on impossible task. Given the high quality of the preceding seasons and the weight of expectation this had generated, it\u2019s hard to imagine a finale that wasn\u2019t going to leave at least some people disappointed.", "But the worst in TV history? Well, this is a data science blog, so to answer that, it\u2019s high time we got some numbers involved\u2026", "The dataset we\u2019ll use for this analysis is, unsurprisingly, taken from IMDb. In particular, we will use a couple of datasets of TV series statistics, directly available for download from IMDb here, and another dataset of episode-specific statistics. This second dataset requires a spot of web scraping to generate (episode-specific data is not readily available from IMDb \u2014 more on that later).", "Having joined together the required datasets from IMDb, and loaded it into a Pandas dataframe, we see that we have 951,196(!) rows, each representing a unique \u2018title\u2019, with the following columns:", "We can use these columns to filter the titles:", "Incredibly, applying these filters takes us from over 951,000 titles, to just 305. These are the 305 shows that will form the basis for the following analysis.", "As previously mentioned, to get the ratings for the individual episodes, we need to scrape directly from IMDb.com.", "This is where those \u2018tconst\u2019 identifiers come in handy \u2014 IMDb uses exactly these strings in the URLs for each title. For example, Game of Thrones has a \u2018tconst\u2019 of tt0944947. The IMDb webpage for series 1 therefore takes the following form:", "With this in mind, we can use a function that iterates through the different seasons of a show, and stores the ratings for each individual episode. By passing a list of \u2018tconst\u2019 codes through this function, we can create a database of episode ratings for a given list of shows (in our case, the 305 titles that we identified above).", "Armed with this new data, we can start our analysis.", "Let\u2019s take our dataset for a test drive by first looking at something very simple. In our database of \u2018finished\u2019 TV shows, which ones have the highest overall series rating?", "Even if its ending did sour things, Game of Thrones still enjoys a healthy series rating of 9.4, surrounded by the kind of shows you\u2019d expect to see at the top of such a ranking (Breaking Bad, The Wire, and The Sopranos), as well as some you may not have even heard of (Leyla and Mecnun is a Turkish dramady currently available on Netflix, whilst Avatar, Death Note, and Fullmetal Alchemist are all Japanese anim\u00e9).", "Let\u2019s go deeper on the top five series and track the individual episode ratings of each show\u2019s run.", "The first thing that jumps out, as we might expect, is the precipitous fall in ratings at the end of Game of Thrones. We should also note that this drop was not inevitable \u2014 there are plenty of examples of high quality shows not fluffing their lines at the very last. Indeed, the other shows here pretty much hit their respective peaks during their final episodes (with The Sopranos\u2019 slight downtick perhaps caused by its infamous \u2018cut to black\u2019 ending).", "The other less obvious thing that presents itself here is the relationship between the overall series rating (as defined in the original dataset) and the average of the episode ratings. We would expect these to be very similar, if not identical, though this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. For example, The Wire\u2019s episode ratings, though consistently high, still average out at a whole point less than its overall series rating (8.25 vs 9.30, respectively).", "Indeed if we compare these two measures for the whole dataset, we see that the correlation between series ratings and average episode ratings is actually quite weak.", "Weirdly, we see that six out of the seven shows with the biggest discrepancies between overall series and episode ratings are animations, and five of these are Japanese Anim\u00e9 (Naruto, Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, and two helpings of Dragon Ball Z).", "Looking at the episode trackers of the shows with the largest discrepancies, we see high standard deviations (and in the case of Batman and Dragon Ball Z, rather inconsistent quality on an episode by episode basis).", "We can conjecture that there\u2019s a certain \u2018nostalgia factor\u2019 at play here \u2014 people might have fond \u2018overall\u2019 memories of a show that aired more than a decade ago, which would result in high ratings for the series as a whole.", "However, time might have erased memories of dud episodes, which then get lower individual episode ratings (we can assume that people rating on an episode-by-episode basis are more likely to have watched them recently with a more objective eye).", "The data does bear this out to an extent. There is a negative correlation between a show\u2019s end year, and the discrepancy between its overall series rating and average episode ratings.", "So, given we\u2019ve seen inconsistent series with high variance in episode ratings, which shows manage to keep up a consistent quality throughout their entire runs? We can answer this question by plotting a show\u2019s episode ratings\u2019 mean against its standard deviation.", "Let\u2019s get back to the business of series finales.", "One very crude way of answering the title question \u2014 \u2018Does Game of Thrones have the worst finale in TV history?\u2019 \u2014 is to simply isolate the last episode of each series, and order them from top to bottom by their rating. Let\u2019s look at the extreme ends of this list:", "We shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Breaking Bad at the top of the tree, though with the exception of Avatar, the other top titles are new to this blog. Let\u2019s look at these other shows hitting finale ratings of 9.8 in more detail.", "As for the other end of the scale, we see that Game of Thrones doesn\u2019t (quite) hold the accolade for worst last episode \u2014 that dubious honour goes to Netflix\u2019s adaptation of House of Cards.", "Now, we\u2019re going to see House of Cards cropping up on a couple of these \u2018worst of\u2019 lists, so let\u2019s deal with that particular elephant-in-the-room straight away. That House of Cards trailed off towards the end of its run is unquestionable. The one-star reviews for its final episode are as numerous as they are scathing. However, the show did have to deal with the career implosion of its lead actor and executive producer for its last season \u2014 something that Game of Thrones\u2019 showrunners, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (or \u2018D&D\u2019 in the parlance), didn\u2019t have to suffer.", "That aside, how else could we judge the quality of a show\u2019s ending? Looking at the last episode alone seems a little narrow. One could also argue that it\u2019s not fair to compare series of different lengths in this way. For a show with 12 episodes the last episode represents 8% of its total run, but for a show with 150 episodes, the last episode represents less than 1%.", "Besides, much of the criticism of Game of Thrones\u2019 ending was due to the quality of its first 95% \u2014 we ought to look at a shows\u2019 ending in the context of the rest of its run.", "Let\u2019s therefore look at the mean rating of episodes in the last 5% of a show\u2019s run (to get a more consistent definition of \u2018ending\u2019 across titles), and compare this against the show\u2019s median episode rating.", "House of Cards props up the table once again, but Bloodline, another Netflix production, pips Game of Thrones into second (to last) place. Though, as we can see if we compare their episode ratings, neither Bloodline nor House of Cards ever quite reached the same heights as Game of Thrones did in its pomp.", "So, what can we conclude? Game of Thrones probably doesn\u2019t have the worst finale in TV history. But it\u2019s certainly up (or down) there. Of course, as much as fans can mourn the slightly ignominious demise of one of TV\u2019s greatest ever shows, we should remember that for much of its run, it was precisely that \u2014 one of TV\u2019s greatest ever shows.", "To not-quite-quote Tywin Lannister, we must accept D&D\u2019s decisions, and be thankful that we have Game of Thrones at all \u2014 D&D aren\u2019t perfect, but no one is.", "Let\u2019s just hope that I\u2019m not sat here in five years\u2019 time, writing a blog about how they tanked Star Wars\u2026", "Your home for data science.
