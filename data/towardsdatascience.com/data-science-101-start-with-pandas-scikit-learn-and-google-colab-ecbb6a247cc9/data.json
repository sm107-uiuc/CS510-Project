This corresponds to the \u201clibrary.function\u201d scheme where the function is extracted from the library.", "The \u201cread_csv\u201d function returns a \u201cDataFrame\u201d (i.e. tabular data) that we store into the \u201cdf\u201d variable (see code below).", "Pandas library provides numerous functions; let\u2019s explore the most useful ones for beginners.", "As mentioned previously, Python is an object-oriented language and we can call specific methods or properties corresponding to the type of object we manipulate. For example:", "For this first example, the \u201cread_csv\u201d function has returned a DataFrame object which benefits from a lot of inherited and dedicated properties or methods: .shape, .info(), .describe(), .mean(), etc.", "df.info() will provide the basic information regarding the DataFrame: the number of entries, the index type, the columns\u2019 names, types, and non-null count or memory usage:", "df.describe() will provide some elementary statistics regarding numerical features (you can notice that \u201cDateTime\u201d and \u201cQuality\u201d columns are not displayed): the number of entries, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles:", "df.corr() will display the correlation matrix of all numerical features:", "There are many more functions available: head(), sample(), tail(), merge(), concat(), etc. and you should explore a few in your notebook.", "My only advice is that before trying to create a data processing function on your own, always check that the corresponding tool does not already exist.", "One of the basic requirements to properly build a machine learning model is to train the algorithm on a large part of the dataset (from 70 to 90%) and then to perform tests regarding its robustness on the remaining unseen percents.", "This process checks that the algorithm has not been subject to \u201coverfitting\u201d, which can be considered as learning all training cases by heart and miserably failing to make predictions on unseen data.", "To randomly create this split, we call the dedicated \u201ctrain_test_split\u201d function from the SciKit-Learn library:", "But before using this new function, we need to separate features (Xs) and the target (Y). We also remove the \u201cDateTime\u201d column, useless for this specific example.", "Using the \u201c.shape\u201d property on every dataset created, we see that the number of lines is correct: \u201cX_train\u201d has 4000 rows (80% of the 5000 initial rows) and the same goes for \u201cy_train\u201d.", "This is because \u201cX_train\u201d and \u201cX_test\u201d are Pandas DataFrames whereas \u201cy_train\u201d and \u201cy_test\u201d are Pandas Series.", "To keep it (relatively) simple: a \u201cSeries\u201d is a single-column data structure and a \u201cDataFrame\u201d is a collection of Series. So there is no columns dimension in Series since there can be only one.", "The data is now properly structured into Train and Test sets; we can import a Random Forest algorithm.", "As our target is categorical (Premium, Approved, or Rejected), we choose a \u201cClassifier\u201d. In case we would work with a numerical target (i.e. predicting a value), we would opt for a \u201cRegressor\u201d but the syntax would be similar.", "First, we create a \u201cRandomForestClassifier()\u201d object and use the corresponding method \u201c.fit\u201d to train the algorithm on the training data:", "Some parameters used to build the model are displayed after the training: the number of estimators (aka \u201ctrees\u201d = 100), the maximum depth (here \u201cNone\u201d), the split criterion (here \u201cGini Index\u201d), etc. These are called \u201chyperparameters\u201d.", "The \u201c.score\u201d method allows us to evaluate the accuracy of the model. It compares the predictions from the model (y\u2019) based on the features provided (Xs) Vs the true target values (y):", "We notice that the model reaches a 100% accuracy on the training dataset. This could be good news but we are probably facing an \u201coverfitting\u201d issue, meaning that the model performs perfectly on training data by learning predictions \u201cby heart\u201d and it will probably fail to reach the same level of accuracy on unseen data.", "The score reached on Test data does confirm this assumption as we see a ~20% performance drop on accuracy.", "Without going into too many details, fine-tuning the hyperparameters (number of estimators, etc.) and using cross-validation (shuffling several times the data while training the model) could prevent it from overfitting.", "Let\u2019s have a look at the differences between predictions and actual values (I have chosen a \u201crandom_state\u201d that samples rows with numerous errors; changing its value would decrease their number):", "Even if imperfect, our model still achieves an acceptable accuracy with an 80% success rate.", "The question is: what are the features among the different process parameters which help the model predict the quality of the product?", "The \u201c.feature_importances_\u201d property of the model provides this information but the array is not easy (euphemism\ud83d\ude05) to interpret:", "Let\u2019s convert this array into a DataFrame to display it in a nicer way (the code is a little bit tricky, you have to trust me on that one):", "Process parameters are ranked by their importance and we can consider that \u201cOutside Temperature\u201d, \u201cInside Pressure\u201d, and \u201cColor Density\u201d play an active role in the predictions.", "If you have reached this sentence, you have created and evaluated your first machine learning model \ud83d\ude4c", "Here is a short summary of what you have achieved today:", "Your home for data science.
