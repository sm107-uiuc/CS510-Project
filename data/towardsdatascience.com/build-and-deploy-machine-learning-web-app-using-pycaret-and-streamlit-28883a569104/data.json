The final app looks like this:", "This tutorial will cover the entire workflow starting from training a machine learning model and developing a pipeline in Python, developing a simple web app using streamlit and deploying the app on the Heroku cloud platform.", "In the past, we have covered containerization using docker and deployment on cloud platforms like Azure, GCP and AWS. If you are interested in learning more about those, you can read the following stories:", "PyCaret is an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python that is used to train and deploy machine learning pipelines and models into production. PyCaret can be installed easily using pip.", "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science. Streamlit can be installed easily using pip.", "GitHub is a cloud-based service that is used to host, manage and control code. Imagine you are working in a large team where multiple people (sometimes hundreds of them) are making changes. PyCaret is itself an example of an open-source project where hundreds of community developers are continuously contributing to source code.

In simple words, this will allow you to take the application from your local machine to the cloud so that anybody can access it using a Web URL. In this tutorial, we have chosen Heroku for deployment as it provides free resource hours when you sign up for a new account.", "Deployment of machine learning models is the process of putting models into production so that web applications, enterprise software and APIs can consume a trained model and generate predictions with new data points.", "Normally machine learning models are built so that they can be used to predict an outcome (binary value i.e. 1 or 0 for Classification, continuous values for Regression, labels for Clustering etc. There are two broad ways to predict new data points:", "Online prediction scenarios are for cases where you want to generate predictions on a one-by-one basis for each datapoint. For example, you could use predictions to make immediate decisions about whether a particular transaction is likely to be fraudulent.", "Batch prediction is useful when you want to generate predictions for a set of observations all at once. For example, if you want to decide which customers to target as part of an advertisement campaign for a product you would get prediction scores for all customers, sort these to identify which customers are most likely to purchase, and then target maybe the top 5% customers that are most likely to purchase.", "In this tutorial we will build an app that can do both; online prediction as well as batch prediction by uploading a csv file containing new data points.", "An insurance company wants to improve its cash flow forecasting by better predicting patient charges using demographic and basic patient health risk metrics at the time of hospitalization.", "To build a web application that supports online (one-by-one) as well as batch prediction using trained machine learning model and pipeline.", "Training and model validation are performed in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Notebook either on your local machine or on cloud.

See the setup code for the second experiment:", "The magic happens with only a few lines of code. Notice that in Experiment 2 the transformed dataset has 62 features for training derived from only 6 features in the original dataset.

The R2 has increased by 10% with very little effort. We can compare the residual plot of linear regression model for both experiments and observe the impact of transformations and feature engineering on the heteroskedasticity of model.", "Machine learning is an iterative process. The number of iterations and techniques used within are dependent on how critical the task is and what the impact will be if predictions are wrong. The severity and impact of a machine learning model to predict a patient outcome in real-time in the ICU of a hospital is far more than a model built to predict customer churn.", "In this tutorial, we have performed only two iterations and the linear regression model from the second experiment will be used for deployment. At this stage, however, the model is still only an object within a Notebook / IDE. To save it as a file that can be transferred to and consumed by other applications, execute the following code:", "When you save a model in PyCaret, the entire transformation pipeline based on the configuration defined in the setup() function is created.

However, the front-end of our web application has an input form that collects only the six features i.e. age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region.", "How do we transform the 6 features of a new data point into 62 used to train the model? We do not need to worry about this part as PyCaret automatically handles this by orchestrating the transformation pipeline. When you call the predict function on a model trained using PyCaret, all transformations are applied automatically (in sequence) before generating predictions from the trained model.", "Testing AppOne final step before we publish the application on Heroku is to test the web app locally. Open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to your project folder and execute the following code:", "Now that the model is trained, the machine learning pipeline is ready, and the application is tested on our local machine, we are ready to start our deployment on Heroku.

It contains instructions written in the Bash language and like requirements.txt, it is used for creating the necessary environment for our streamlit app to run on the cloud.", "Procfile is simply one line of code that provides startup instructions to the web server that indicate which file should be executed when an application is triggered. In this example, \u2018Procfile\u2019 is used for executing setup.sh which will create the necessary environment for the streamlit app and the second part \u201cstreamlit run app.py\u201d is to execute the application (this is similar to how you would execute a streamlit application on your local computer).", "Once all the files are uploaded onto the GitHub repository, we are now ready to start deployment on Heroku.
