These potential problems can lead to difficulties in evaluating the model, determining approaching classifier thresholds, and using it fairly and without unintentional bias. Since content moderation systems act on complex social phenomena, they face problems that are not necessarily encountered in other machine learning contexts.", "For many applications of content moderation, it is difficult to provide an explicit definition of the phenomenon of interest. These topics are often very complex social phenomena, whose definitions are topics of constant academic debate. For example, cyber-bullying has various definitions in academic texts, and so it is difficult to create an all-encompassing definition that everyone can agree on. For this reason, instructions provided to manual content labelers may not be clear enough to produce very reliable labels.", "First, it may appear to users that the content moderation system is inconsistent, if some things that users deem to be violating rules are removes and some are not. This may lead users to not trust the content moderation mechanisms or believe that it is unfairly targeting certain users. Since, from the user perspective, these systems are nebulous black boxes, it is difficult to explain how such inconsistencies may arise.", "The other problem is that the labeled training data may have contradictory data points. If labeling inconsistencies cause two very similar data points to have opposing labels, then the model\u2019s performance may suffer as it struggles to learn the proper attributes and patterns in the data.", "Acquiring labeled data is often a costly process. For many content moderation tasks, the labeling tasks are relatively complex and require labelers to be trained. They have to understand a certain definition of a specific social phenomenon. This is in contrast to much simpler labeling tasks, such as determining if an image contains a certain object.", "Furthermore, in contrast to tasks such as image classification, there are very few public data-sets for these tasks, since they are often considered property of the company that collected it. Companies are unlikely to want to share this data as they consider it part of their competitive edge.", "Since the cost is high, it may be difficult to acquire large-enough data-sets to easily train a supervised machine learning model. To get around this problem, machine learning practitioners must often resort to semi-supervised or weakly-supervised methods to augment their data-sets. Typically, they leverage the small set of hand-labeled data (the \u201cgold standard\u201d data) to obtain labels on other un-flagged submitted content. Through this methodology, they are able to create a large data-set from the initial smaller pool of hand-labeled data points.", "While powerful, these methods are not without their own issues. Biases or errors present in the \u201cgold standard\u201d data will most likely be propagated to the entire data-set.", "When creating machine learning models that act on social content, there is always the risk of introducing algorithmic bias. Algorithmic bias refers to a situation in which an algorithm (the machine learning model) creates an unfair situation related to some racial or socioeconomic factor, such as by unfairly penalizing certain groups of people, or by segmenting groups of people away from the rest of the platform.", "When creating a content moderation model, it is important to try to avoid algorithmic bias to the best of your ability. If your model takes in user profile characteristics, such as location or demographic features, careful attention must be paid in order to ensure that model is not learning to discriminate based on these features.", "For example, in a cyber-bullying detection model, if an input to the model is gender, it may learn to increase the probability of cyber-bullying if a certain gender is involved. However, since cyber-bullying in general occurs more with people of that gender, the model simply inherited society\u2019s overall bias.", "In this situation, the machine learning practitioner must be careful and either not use certain demographic features, or verify that useful, non-discriminatory patterns are being learned with them. Otherwise, the model may become discriminatory and compound preexisting social inequalities.", "Naturally, for those whose content is deemed against the rules, these systems are thought to be stifling their freedom of expression on the platform. So, these people will often try their hardest to continue posting the same type of content while evading the flagging mechanisms of the machine learning systems.", "This is a very different situation than other machine learning contexts, in which the input data is often just raw sensor data or financial data. Once you introduce adversaries into the mix, the task of learning becomes more difficult and nuanced, as these adversaries will constantly change their methods in order to evade detection.", "A common example of this is for spam and scam/phishing detection. In order to avoid detection, offenders will try many techniques, such as altering the capitalization and spacing of the text, replacing words with synonyms, replacing characters with numbers or similar-looking non-standard characters, and embedding their actual content within a larger body of non-offending content.", "The willingness of these adversaries to constantly research new methods to evade detection means that the machine learning practitioner must constantly re-evaluate their models to ensure that they are still effective. Sometimes, this may necessitate the training of a new model to handle new classes of evasion methods.", "Your home for data science.
