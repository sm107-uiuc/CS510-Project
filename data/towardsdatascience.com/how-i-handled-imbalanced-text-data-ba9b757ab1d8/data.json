I am a chatbot developer at IMImoble Pvt Ltd and faced this scenario recently while training intent classification module. Any live business chatbot accessible to real-world users is bound to attract a significant number of out-of-scope queries along with messages pertaining to the task it is designed to perform. Even among the relevant task-oriented messages, imbalances are to be expected as all topics covered by the bot can\u2019t be equally popular. For example, in a banking use case, balance inquiries will outnumber home loan applications.", "Bot building is not similar to traditional application development. While the latter is relatively stable and is updated less often, the former needs frequent updates to improve user experience and intelligence of the bot. The imbalanced dataset is the problem where data belonging to one class is significantly higher or lower than that belonging to other classes. Most ML/DL classification algorithms aren\u2019t equipped to handle imbalanced classes and tend to get biased towards majority classes.", "Aiming only for high accuracy for the imbalanced dataset can be counter-productive because standard classifier algorithms like Decision Trees and Logistic Regression do not have the ability to handle imbalanced classes incorporated into them. This leads to a heavy bias towards larger classes and classes with fewer data points are treated as noise and are often ignored. The result is a higher misclassification rate for minority classes compared to the majority classes. Therefore, the accuracy metric is not as relevant when evaluating the performance of a model trained on imbalanced data.", "Consider the following case: you have two classes \u2014 A and B. Class A is 95% of your dataset and class B is the other 5%. You can reach an accuracy of 95% by simply predicting class A every time, but this provides a useless classifier for your intended use case. Instead, a properly calibrated method may achieve a lower accuracy but would have a substantially higher true positive rate (or recall), which is really the metric you should have been optimizing for.", "This article explains several methods to handle imbalanced dataset but most of them don\u2019t work well for text data. In this article, I am sharing all the tricks and techniques I have used to balance my dataset along with the code which boosted f1-score by 30%.", "You might think that this is not the solution you\u2019re looking for but gathering more meaningful and diverse data is always better than sampling original data or generating artificial data from existing data points.", "Can I change the delivery time for my delivery?", "Can I change time of my delivery?", "3. Merge minority classes \u2014 Sometimes multiple classes have overlapping features. It\u2019s better to merge those multiple minority classes. This trick helped me improve f1-score by more than 10%.", "The simplest way to fix imbalanced dataset is simply balancing them by oversampling instances of the minority class or undersampling instances of the majority class. Using advanced techniques like SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) will help you create new synthetic instances from minority class.", "If it\u2019s difficult to gather more data and above tricks do not show promising results then here is the last resort.", "Data Augmentation is a technique commonly used in computer vision. In image dataset, It involves creating new images by transforming(rotate, translate, scale, add some noise) the ones in the data set. For text, data augmentation can be done by tokenizing document into a sentence, shuffling and rejoining them to generate new texts, or replacing adjectives, verbs etc by its a synonym to generate different text with the same meaning. Any pre-trained word embedding or NLTK\u2019s wordnet can be used to find the synonym of a word.", "One of the interesting ideas used in Kaggle competition is converting English text to any random language and converting back to English using neural machine translation. This trick helped me to improve f1-score by 17%. Check this GitHub repo to find the code on Data augmentation using language translation, spacy, spacy_wordnet, and word embeddings.", "When dealing with imbalanced dataset there is no one-stop solution to improve evaluation metric. One may need to try several methods to figure out the best-suited technique for the text dataset. Let me know if you ever come across any such problem and how did you tackle it.", "Do you want more?
