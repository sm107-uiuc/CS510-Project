We can create a list and keep all the prime numbers there.", "Really? Think of the memory such a list would occupy.", "It would be great if we had something that could just keep the last prime number we have checked and returns just the next prime number.", "That is where iterators could help us.", "We create a class named primes and use it to generate primes.", "We can then use this as:", "Here I have defined an iterator.

So at every iteration in for loop the function variables like number, generated and max are stored somewhere in memory.", "So what is happening is that the above function is taking care of all the boilerplate code for us by using the yield statement.", "While not explicitly better than the previous solution but we can also use Generator expression for the same task.
