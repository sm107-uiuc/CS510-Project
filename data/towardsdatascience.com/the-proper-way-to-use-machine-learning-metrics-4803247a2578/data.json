Non data scientists will surely gawk at you while data scientists will ask for a lot more information.", "As a data scientist, you know it\u2019s hard to make it clear (particularly to non data scientists) why your model should be trusted because you cannot easily translate complex measures of accuracy into tangible elements. And that\u2019s 100% legitimate, models should be understood by everyone, at least their accuracy.", "On top of it, if your approach is scientifically correct, your model should have at least 2 accuracies \u2014 measured on training and validation sets \u2014 if not more \u2014 holdout, cross-validation.", "And there are many measures of accuracy. Precisely, 21 on scikit-learn for Classification problems only. So for 1 model, you would have 21 x 2 = 42 values on training and validation sets. What if you try 5 different models, would you look at 5 x 42 values?", "So the questions you should ask are how to use these measures of accuracy, how many of them you should check before validating your model and which ones you should share with non data scientists to convince them your model is accurate and which ones are too confusing to be shared.", "Some measures of accuracy are simple and straightforward, some are really complex. Some are a positive number, some are a series of numbers and some are charts! How to properly select and validate your model with such variety of measures\u2026", "Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix. These are standard, you should already know them. They are simple to understand and are the ones that you must share with business teams.", "However, for the data scientist, they\u2019re not good enough to identify the best model among several models. This is because these measures only focus on binary outcomes and not at the confidence (i.e probabilities) at which the model made predictions. This limitation is addressed in different ways by the following measures.", "Precision Recall curve: if you change the threshold probability of your model (generally by default at 0.5), the Precision and the Recall will vary in the opposite direction. The higher the threshold, the higher the Precision and the lower the Recall. Similarly, the lower the threshold, the lower the Precision and the higher the Recall. The goal is to identify the threshold with the best balance between Precision and Recall.", "F-1 score (and F-beta score): if selecting the threshold with the Precision-Recall curve is the empirical way, using the F-score is the mathematical way. If for a given problem, Precision is 5 times more important than Recall, then the model with the highest F-5 score (beta=5) should be the best model for this problem.F-beta score ranges from 0 to 1, 1 being a perfect model.", "ROC curve: ROC is the acronym of Receiver Operating Characteristic which was used by radar engineers in World War-II. This definition is obsolete in Machine Learning. ROC curve is simply a way to visualise a model\u2019s performance. If a ROC curve is highly skewed to the top left, it means the model is very accurate, while a straight diagonal means the model is no better than tossing a coin.", "AUC: short for Area Under Curve, it\u2019s basically the information contained from the ROC curve in one positive number. AUC is great because it makes it simple to compare multiple models: you select the one with the highest AUC. However it\u2019s very hard to interpret the value of AUC. An AUC of 75% is in no way the same as an Accuracy of 75% (I hear that sometimes\u2026). Usually, good values of AUC start from .75, but again, this depends on the problem and looking at absolute values is generally not helpful. You\u2019d rather use it to compare models. If your model has an AUC of 0.57 that means there\u2019s likely no signal in your data.AUC ranges from 0.5 and 1, 1 being a perfect model.", "LogLoss: short for logarithmic loss, a more mathematical and abstract notion here. It assigns a weight to each predicted probability. The further the probability from the actual value, the larger the weight. The goal is to minimize the overall sum of all the error weights. Note that the weight drastically increases if the probability is close to 0 and the actual is 1 (same with the opposite values 1 and 0). LogLoss discriminates models that are too confident on wrong predictions and is largely used in Machine Learning because it has useful mathematical properties. The problem is that the value of the LogLoss is impossible to interpret.", "You could compute these measures of accuracy on all the models you try, find optimal thresholds for each of the models, compare their Confusion Matrices with their optimal threshold and finally take your decision on which model x threshold fits the best to your problem. This would take multiple iterations, thousands of lines of Python code and a solid number of headaches to complete.", "Or you could follow a simpler approach that\u2019s as efficient. An approach in 3 steps:", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Product Manager @Doctolib after 5 years as data scientist.
