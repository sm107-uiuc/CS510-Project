You will be able to work with BIG DATA and scale your code, boosting your productivity.", "Welcome Data Science lover! You are interested in this article because either you have struggled with painfully long run times, or your data sets that fit into your RAM. If I\u2019m guessing right, you are a Python user who is comfortable using the most common Data Science Libraries like Pandas , Scikit-Learn or Numpy. After reading this set of articles, you will learn how to use Dask which boosts your productivity and will let you work with Big Data without the painful learning curve.", "We are going to scale an NLP text Classification problem using the Dask Python package. We\u2019ll also review data transformations that enable a scalable ML training pipeline.", "If you already know about the basics of Dask and Distributed Computing, go ahead to the second article to review how you can build a Dask cluster using SSH.", "If you have ever used Apache Spark, this section will look very familiar to you. The following layman\u2019s example demonstrates how Dask scales out tasks, using two key concepts: directed acyclic graphs (\u2018DAG\u2019) and lazy computation.", "Imagine this scenario. It\u2019s Sunday and a family decides to make a cake. They don\u2019t have any ingredients, so Mom drives her four kids to the supermarket. She hates shopping and the parking is really bad at the store, so today she decides to put the kids to work :", "Mom believes this new plan will allow the family to buy all the products FOUR times faster compared to doing all the steps together. The following figure shows Mom\u2019s strategy:", "Now, let\u2019s codify this example in Computer Science terms to demonstrate how DASK allows a Data Scientist to create scalable workloads. Think of each member of the family as a virtual machine (VM), or in more general terms, a node. The Mom is the Scheduler node and she is communicating with her kids, who in this case are other compute nodes acting like the workers to scale out the set of tasks. Also, the workers communicate with each other to make sure they are completing parallel tasks according to the plan (which in computer science terms is called DAG), and don\u2019t exceed their maximum memory or CPU/GPU usage.", "Remember that each kid may have different characteristics \u2014 Kid 1 could be younger and faster than Kid 2. Similarly, each worker node may have different number of CPUs and may have larger or smaller disks and RAMs. This is where the Scheduler helps in the Dask architecture \u2014 it coordinates the workloads and distributes the work across each worker node in a balanced way.", "This is how Dask works, in laymen terms. We now have a clear idea how Dask\u2019s Scheduler uses the concept of DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to distribute the computations across all available nodes.", "Now what about the other computer science concept, \u2018lazy computations\u2019?", "Dask allows you to construct a prescription for the calculation you want to carry out (DAG generated by the data scientist). Dask is a graph execution engine, and all the different tasks that you write are delayed. It means that no functions have actually been executed until you execute the .compute() function.", "This function will block the execution until the task (or) the constructed DAG is finished. After the DAG is finished, the entire computation goes straight from a lazy Dask collection to a concrete value in local memory. It might look complicated, but as all of this is abstracted, you will see how easy it is to implement all of this in the following articles with a practical example using NLP.", "Hope you are excited to get on with the next parts! No more theory I promise, just scalable data science.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Lead ML Engineer at Levi\u2019s.
