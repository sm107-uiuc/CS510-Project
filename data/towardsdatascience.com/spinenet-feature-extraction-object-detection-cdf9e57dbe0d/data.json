Probably, something like this: give an image as an input of size 512x512 and get a 10x1 classifier output. In between, there are convolution and max-pooling layers, that will decrease the image resolution slowly and slowly while retaining the important features.", "Now instead of a typical neural network like explained above, during CVPR-2020, Google Research and Brain Team came up with an unconventional network \u2014 SpineNet. This network consists of scale-permuted intermediate features and cross-connections that could be the possible solution for the many applications that require feature extraction like object detection or image classification.", "Let me show how Google is not only redefining the way we build our neural networks from the beginning, but also improving the outcome.", "Fig 1. shows the comparison of RetinaNet models (on the COCO dataset) adopting SpineNet, ResNet-FPN, and NAS-FPN as backbones. The red line represents the current SpineNet model (with different parameters)explained in the paper, while the blue dotted line represents the ResNet network with different parameters corresponding to the SpineNet model.", "At first glance, it shows that the red line has better AP(%) with fewer FLOPs as compared to the blue dotted line. This result on the front page excited me to see the approach in the first place.", "They have also shown results in tabular form with different datasets and compared them with the ResNet model. One can have a closer look at those, I have attached the paper link at the end of this blog.", "In general, one of the basic architecture for object detection\u00a0is shown in Fig 2.", "In this, the encoder is used to extract features (which could be used for image classification too) and decoder is used to recover those features to provide localization of the bounding boxes. Encoder and decoder are mostly connected with residual connection (ResNet) to use features from different resolution to retain the important information.", "This encoder is a scale-decrease network, similar to what has also been used in YOLOv3, Faster-RCNN, etc., which is commonly referred to as the backbone of a model. LeCun et al explains the motivation behind this scale-decreased architecture design: \u201cHigh resolution may be needed to detect the presence of a feature, while its exact position need not be determined with equally high precision.\u201d", "With the motivation to retain the spatial information as the model grows deeper and facilitates multi-scale feature fusion, this paper comes up with this scale-permuted network. One can capture the idea with Fig\u00a03.", "From Fig 3., one can observe that the conventional neural network(scale-decrease network) is on the left side. And on the right side, with no particular order between layers and connections, there is an example of a scale-permuted network.", "There could be many theories and questions that arise with this approach, and paper has tried to answer most of them. However, to keep this article short and to the point, I will focus on the first 2 questions that came to my mind after reading the abstract.", "To have a fair comparison, they claimed to use the same ResNet architecture layers and used NAS to find the perfect permuted combination. One of the versions (with the highest AP with 40.8%) of their final architectures is shown in Fig 5. In addition, as shown previously, this version uses lesser computational parameters as well as fewer FLOPS than the original ResNet network.", "In order to increase the model depth, like ResNet-100, ResNet-150, they have repeated the same network or combined the networks sequentially to produce SpineNet-96 or SpineNet-143 respectively as shown in Fig 6.", "Hopefully, this provided you with a nice overview of this interesting approach. If you have any doubt or want to discuss it further with\u00a0me, please reach out to me via LinkedIn.", "You can also access the full paper here.", "Your home for data science.
