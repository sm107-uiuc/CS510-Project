However, due to the Covid outbreak, it\u2019s quickly going from a nice to have to a necessity with companies like Google making it mandatory as a spread limiting precaution. Remote work is the only option in places where governments have mandated quarantine.", "Often data science work needs no more than a computer, the internet, and your wits. One might think that it is just as easy to be effective in a role like data science whether you\u2019re at home, on a beach (with WIFI), or zoning in with headphones on in an open office. This is partially true, but it is also easy to lose focus, feel disconnected, and quickly become frustrated when your only office mate is a plant and your coworkers are out of sight and out of mind.", "I have worked remotely for more than half a decade in various technical roles over my career. My latest remote stint is as a data scientist. The following is a set of strategies that have helped me continue to stay productive and grow my career as a remote employee. Luckily, as a data scientist, you\u2019re likely already familiar with a variety of tools to keep contributing at a high level!", "It is easy to fear missing out when you\u2019re remote. Depending on your organization\u2019s culture, a significant amount of innovation and communication might be tied to physical proximity. Hallway conversations and white boarding sessions serve as collaborative innovation wells and feedback is often garnered in over-the-cube-wall conversations. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t continue or collaborate on creative data science remotely, though. A couple of suggestions follow.", "You are using version control to share your notebooks and scripts already, right? Besides the basics, learning how to use advanced version control features like pull requests and version diffing can help you quickly understand the changes in shared projects when teammates aren\u2019t right there to show you and it will also make sure that your contributions see the light of day in the broader organization.", "Really, this applies to any collaborative software that you\u2019ve got at your disposal. In lieu of whiteboards, it\u2019s actually quite possible to make live progress remotely on collaborative cloud based docs, spreadsheets and drawing programs (like Google Drawings or Miro). The key is to realize that while you may have been drawing since you were an infant, software interfaces might require a little practice to get \u201creal time\u201d good at. It pays to become acquainted with shortcuts! On the upside, once you\u2019ve created something using one of these tools, you now have permanent legible documentation, which might not be the case for that scrawled whiteboard session. That leads to the topic of documentation.", "You\u2019ve spent the day exploring a new data source and you want to share what you\u2019ve learned so that your team can make a call on whether to use it to build models. The problem is you can\u2019t just tell them because they\u2019re on the other side of the planet and won\u2019t be up until you\u2019re preferably asleep. Even if the distance isn\u2019t quite that extreme, you still face the challenge of sharing your detailed thoughts effectively with a more limited tool box.", "To that end, document everything that your colleagues will need to understand in detail. If it is code, don\u2019t skip the comments and link to any necessary reference material. If it\u2019s model quality evaluations, write up clearly how the model works, how to evaluate it, and where any validation sets can be found. Many tools will work for this but wikis and other tools that allow Q&A to be recorded are especially helpful for capturing context on how an end product comes to be.", "Having thoughtful documentation in place allows teammates to make progress when you\u2019re not available. If face time is needed to explain, it can often be compressed to answering specific questions rather than going through every detail. As a final bonus, when you want to remember why or how you chose to do something later down the line, your documentation will have the answer!", "Sometimes you really do just need to exchange information faster than you can type. If Slack messages or email isn\u2019t getting the point across, don\u2019t be afraid to start an impromptu Slack call, Zoom, Hangout or whatever lets you use voice and preferably video. This doesn\u2019t always have to be a formally scheduled call. As long as all parties confirm they\u2019re available, a five minute chat right now with hand waving and quickly sharpied paper graphs can save a lot of frustration.", "Another way to stay high bandwidth is establish clearly when you\u2019re working and available and when you\u2019re not. A simple \u201cI\u2019m going to be offline for one hour\u201d on a shared channel will do. When you\u2019re not physically together, no one knows that you had to run an errand and can\u2019t be available to answer questions. While I\u2019m not advocating micro-tracking of time at desk by managers, in a high communication organization, letting relevant people know that you\u2019re temporarily not available can avoid the appearance of non-responsiveness.", "Working from home presents a different physical dynamic than being in an office with coworkers. Recognizing this, you can be proactive about making the most of it through choice of environment and control of your schedule.", "When you\u2019re at an office, it\u2019s clear why you are there. While modern offices are certainly not distraction free, being in a given environment can cue your mind to think in one way or another. If you\u2019re familiar with the idea of sleep hygiene \u2014 not doing taxing mental tasks in bed so that your mind gets in the habit of shutting down in that place \u2014 this should sound familiar. In the same vein, it can help to create a \u201cwork zone\u201d in your home. Even if it\u2019s not a separate room, having a distraction free place where you always go to work can help you get in the zone.", "On the other hand, being remote can offer something that isn\u2019t always as easy in an office. When you\u2019re feeling stuck on a problem, try switching locations. Go to another room and think about it or maybe your favorite coffee house and you might find that you\u2019re seeing things from another point of view.", "So you\u2019re out of the open office and no longer tuning in to every coworker\u2019s conversation on the floor. In theory this should be a focus panacea. Now you have the quiet time to have those deep thoughts! Except now at any time you can take out the trash or throw on some Netflix. The temptation is natural, so it\u2019s best to prepare for it. One strategy for this is to keep to well defined work hours. Between hours A to B, you\u2019re working, but not after or before. You\u2019re also not doing anything else during. If you do need some distraction to break the quiet or monotony, schedule that too. What works well for me is to plan to do non-work things on my lunch break. If I want to do some dishes or admittedly indulge in some entertainment, I\u2019ll set a timer when I break to eat. When the timer goes off, back to work.", "The upside of time discipline is that you stay productive without feeling the need to spread your work day later than it normally would go.", "So far this list has primarily focused on practical tips for staying productive. There is another side of working home that must be discussed if you\u2019re planning on doing it for a long time. In short maintaining your own mental well-being and job satisfaction.", "It\u2019s easy to start feeling like your coworkers are some abstract concept \u2014 just a question answering/posing chat bot farm at the other end of a Slack channel. That\u2019s probably not ideal. Even for someone who started working with computers since they seemed easier to deal with than people, having a vastly reduced number of daily human interactions can start to get, well, lonely. It\u2019s likely your coworkers are feeling the same way if they are also remote.", "If you were in an office, there would at least be a few moments of chatter each day as you run into each other at the architectural bottleneck known as the coffee machine. Since that\u2019s not happening naturally anymore, it might need to be consciously considered. If you start to throw a few minutes to catch up on less \u201cagenda driven\u201d items in your one on ones, it can at least replace some of that sense of community a good workplace can give. As with many of these suggestions, this is all about planning for something that might happen naturally anyway.", "Part of the payoff of being a data scientist is having a great idea, then seeing it be used and getting recognition for your creativity. Building a portfolio of successfully shared good ideas is how we advance. When the group of people you\u2019re interacting with is restricted, it can be harder to make sure your progress is known and it can feel like your career might go into stasis. This is not necessarily insurmountable.", "One strategy is to make sure your research progress is shared widely through the documentation that was recommended earlier. Multiple stakeholders will likely want to know some details of how your models work such as strengths, weaknesses, and accuracy metrics. The best way to share these might depend on your organization\u2019s policies, but a matter of transparency, recording these numbers in an internally public place can work nicely. Proactively recording and referencing details on a company wiki not only keeps you from having to constantly answer the same questions, but also puts your stamp on the progress you made. Even if the results aren\u2019t what you hoped for, sharing them builds trust and shows that you are conscientiously testing your approach.", "A scary part of sharing things more widely can be opening up to criticism. However, that is part of the path to better end results. If your counterparts in product management point out that your data set is missing key demographics, that doesn\u2019t make your work a failure. It is instead an opportunity to graciously explain your reasoning or take the suggestions and improve. It is better to start this cycle of open review early in the process rather than at the end when course correction is harder.", "Remote work can come with a set of challenges that simply don\u2019t exist in a shared space and it may not be ideal for all. There are real opportunities that can come from adapting proactively to it though. Transitioning successfully to working remotely means staying focused, connected, and continuing to tend to your well being. If you are proactive about this, you might find the practices you adopt can actually make your data science even more impactful \u2014 even if ultimately you end up back in an office.", "Your home for data science.
