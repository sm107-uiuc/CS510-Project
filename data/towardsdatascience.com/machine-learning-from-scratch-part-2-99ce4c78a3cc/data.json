I am delighted to see that many of you find the material useful. This series is gradually developing into a comprehensive and self-contained tutorial on the most important topics in applied machine learning.", "Last time, we focused on attributes and patterns. The first part of this article expands our conceptual toolbox through a discussion of data sets and collections. The second part then takes a look at natural language processing and applies the new concepts.", "Some of the first associations that should come to mind when you hear the term \u201cdata\u201d are collecting, counting, evaluating, logging, measuring, quantifying, rating, surveying, tracking and weighing. These are the activities that provide the precious raw material for machine learning.", "Data is any collection of measured attribute values. Biomarkers, financial numbers, sales figures, network connections, survey responses, user activity, video recordings, word counts and the number of available flavors in your favorite ice cream parlor all fall under the rubric of data.", "A datum is a single measurement of an attribute value. One datum is the number of words in this article (2,268).", "Suppose we are interested in a particular set of attributes and measure their values on several occasions \u2014 perhaps at different times, at different locations or for different objects. A collection of such measurements taken on any one of these occasions is a data point.", "Fitness trackers, for example, take measurements of cardiovascular performance, activity levels and sleep quality. The data collected for a particular person at a particular time constitutes one data point.", "An example is a data point that has been collected in an effort to solve a machine learning problem.", "If we wanted to predict the performance of online advertisements, each example would characterize a particular display of an advertisement that occurred in the past. This includes features with regard to the position, format and design of the advertisement as well as the presence or absence of certain words and demographic data about the user it was presented to.", "An example is labeled when it includes a target value and is unlabeled when the target value is absent.", "In the advertising example, an example is labeled when it includes a performance measure, such as a yes/no value that indicates whether the ad was clicked on.", "A data set is a collection of examples.", "Supervised learning uses data sets with labeled examples. Unsupervised learning, a type of learning that will be covered in later chapters, is an attempt to recognize patterns in unlabeled examples.", "During development, data sets are used as sources for pattern recognition and to evaluate the performance of a machine learning system.", "In production, the system is shown new data points. These data points are often similar but rarely identical to the examples that were available during development.", "The following tree shows the types of collections that will be used throughout this series:", "The two basic collection types are sets and lists.", "A set is a collection of distinct objects. In other words, no object can occur more than once. The objects that belong to a set are called members or elements. The number of elements in a set is known as its cardinality or the size of the set.", "Specific sets are denoted with capital letters. Members of sets are written in lowercase letters.", "Curly brackets indicate a collection of a objects form a set. A set of basic ice cream flavors could look like this: S = { vanilla, chocolate, strawberry }.", "The fact that an element x belongs to a set S is written x \u2208 S. The size of a set S is denoted with vertical bars: |S|.", "In the previous example, we have vanilla \u2208 S and |S|=3.", "A list, by contrast, is a collection in which objects can occur more than once. The objects that belong to a list are referred to as items or elements. The number of items that a list contains is known as the size or the length of the list.", "I will use square brackets to denote lists. A customer order of two scoops of strawberry ice cream and one scoop of vanilla at our basic ice cream parlor can be represented through the following list: [ strawberry, strawberry, vanilla ].", "Note that a list is the right choice in this case. A business that used sets to represent orders would be unable to serve the correct number of requested scoops of ice cream.", "Lists can be further divided into two sub-types:", "A tuple is a list of a fixed length. In other words, you can neither add additional items nor remove any of the existing items.", "Tuples of length 2 and 3 are called pairs and triples, respectively. Tuples of length 1 are unlikely to be used anytime soon in this series. (For the sake of completeness, I will note that they are referred to as singletons.) Two different naming schemes are used for tuples with a length of 4 or greater. Some people prefer Latin prefixes and refer to these lists as quadruples, quintuples, sextuples, etc. Others prefer to call them 4-tuples, 5-tuples, 6-tuples, and so forth.", "A tuple is denoted by parentheses and can be used to represent a datum.", "Suppose you are running an e-commerce site that offers a single product and allows customers to post a rating. In this case, a basic representation of a rating takes the form of a pair: (customer id, rating). As soon as you add a second product to the site, the format needs to extended from a pair to a triple: (customer id, product id, rating). A fourth item becomes necessary when you offer multiple products and allow customers to change their ratings over time: (customer id, product id, date and time, rating).", "In other words, the length of a tuple often depends on how much contextual information you would like to encode.", "A variable-length list is used when the number of items changes or cannot be predicted in advance. New items can be added and existing items can removed. Unless stated otherwise, the term list will always refer to lists of a variable length.", "To conclude our discussion of basic collections, I\u2019m providing an overview of the three types that we have covered:", "Before I forget, one last thing on this topic: collections can be organized in collections.", "In other words, we can have sets of sets, sets of lists, sets of tuples, lists of sets, list of lists, list of tuples, tuples of sets, tuples of lists and tuples of tuples. I will refer to these objects as higher-order collections.", "An image, for example, can be represented through the red/green/blue pixel intensities. For each of these three color channels, we have one list of intensities. The image as a whole can be regarded as a list of three lists. Several images, in turn, form a list of lists of three lists.", "It was mentioned that a datum can be thought of as a tuple and that a data point is a collection of attribute values (measured for a particular purpose and on a particular occasion). Equipped with the concept of higher-order collections, we can now understand a data point as a set of tuples. Finally, a data set in supervised learning can be described as a list of labeled examples, which, in turn, are pairs, consisting of a set of tuples (the data point) and a target value.", "As you can see, we can easily build increasingly complex higher-order collections from basic collections.", "Now that we have discussed data sets and collections, we can take a first look at one of the most fruitful applications of machine learning in recent times: the analysis of natural language.", "Throughout this series, we will explore methods that can be applied to text data and images. This is motivated by two facts:", "In 2010, the Google Books Search project reported a count of close to 130 million distinct books[3], while the number of scientific articles has been estimated to have passed 50 million by 2009[4].", "The number of patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office alone has reached 8 millions in 2011.[5] To be awarded a patent, an inventor must disclose technical information. Whatever the economic impact of patents may be, they clearly contain valuable insights and are subject to machine learning analysis.", "Speech recognition translates speech into text and, thus, further broadens the scope of text analysis. On average, humans speak about 16,000[6] words per day. Globally, this amounts to more than one hundred trillion words spoken over the course of twenty-four hours. Furthermore, it has been reported that 400 hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube every minute.[7]", "The existence of overwhelmingly large amounts of text data, combined with the ability of machines to learn, has given rise to machine reading. The answers provided to us every day by search engines and virtual assistants are, in large parts, obtained through systems that have read through millions of text documents.", "We expect that our artificially intelligent assistants cover a broad range of topics and provide accurate answers. All other things being equal, a greater availability of data helps with both requirements: it increases the coverage and leads to a boost in the ability to recognize patterns.", "We can use the difference between lists and sets to compute our first natural language processing feature.", "The vocabulary is the set of words in a text document. In other words, this is the collection of words that occur at least once in the document. The actual text, on the other hand, can be thought of as a list of words (and some other symbols).", "Suppose your objective is to determine the suitability of a book for entry-level language learners. One of the features you can use for this task is the ratio between the size of vocabulary (set size) and the length of the text (list size). This is known as one of several measures of lexical variety.", "The value of this feature is relatively low for children books and text books for foreign language learners. In these cases, the size of the vocabulary is small and the length of the text is (relatively) large to provide ample learning opportunities.", "On the other end of the spectrum, we have Herman Melville\u2019s novel Moby-Dick. Forty-four percent of the words in the Moby-Dick vocabulary occur only once and 75% occur no more than four times[8]. Roughly speaking, a new word is introduced on every line of the book and the book is, thus, more suitable for advanced students and avid readers.", "The term word count is the epitome of self-descriptiveness. It denotes a pair that consists of a word and a count.", "An example is the fact that there are two occurrences of the word dexterity in Melville\u2019s novel.", "A single word count doesn\u2019t really tell us anything. To start performing text analysis, we have to obtain the count for every word in the vocabulary.", "Articles, prepositions and pronouns tend to be at the top of frequency rankings. The most frequently occurring word in Moby-Dick is the definite article the.[8]", "More interestingly, the words his and whale are ranked #9 and #21, respectively. Even if we didn\u2019t know anything else about the content, just by looking at these two statistics, it would seem likely that the book has something to do with a man and a whale.", "Obtaining word counts is one of the very first steps in natural language processing workflows. Counts may be processed and enriched with other features in sophisticated ways, but they always play at least some role.", "Over the course of this series, we will expand upon word counts and systematically use them as the basis for effective text analysis.", "The next part of this series will discuss how to precisely formulate a problem you are confronted with in terms of machine learning. It will combine all concepts that have been covered so far to introduce functions and to explore the notion of a model.", "Your home for data science.
