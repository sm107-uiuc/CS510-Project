It is based on operating in an environment wherein a hypothetical person (agent) is expected to take a decision (action) from a set of possible decisions, and to maximize the profit (reward) that is obtained by making that decision, by iteratively learning to select a decision that leads to the desired goal (basically trial and error). I\u2019ll explain this in greater detail as we proceed through the article.", "In this article, I\u2019ll be discussing the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning or RL (with examples wherever possible).", "First things first! Before even starting to talk about RL, we\u2019ll first see how exactly it differs from supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.", "Let\u2019s consider an example of a kid who is learning to ride a bicycle. We\u2019ll see how this problem would be addressed if the kid was to learn in a supervised, unsupervised, or a reinforcement learning way:", "Well, now you know why is it said to be the closest to the way humans learn! Now you can expect the topics to get a little formal as we proceed further.", "Let\u2019s continue with the example of the kid, who knows a set of actions that he can perform to ride a bicycle. So, consider a scenario where he has finally figured out that hitting the pedal continuously would drive the bicycle. However, he doesn\u2019t realize that after riding, he has to stop at some point (i.e. applying brakes at the right time is an integral part of riding a bicycle). But, he\u2019s happy that now he knows how to ride the bicycle and doesn\u2019t care about future events. Let\u2019s call his happiness as \u2018reward\u2019, meaning that he is rewarded for his action of hitting the pedal. And since he\u2019s being rewarded, he is purely \u2018exploiting\u2019 the current action, i.e. pedaling, not knowing that maybe in the end he might crash somewhere which would leave him far from achieving his ultimate goal; which is riding the bicycle correctly.", "Now, he can \u2018explore\u2019 other options from the set of available actions instead of just pedaling. Eventually, he\u2019ll be able to stop the bicycle whenever he wants to. In a similar fashion, he\u2019ll learn how to take a turn and in this way, he\u2019d be a good rider.", "But, too much of anything is bad! We saw that too much exploitation can lead to failure. In the same way, too much exploration is also bad. For example, if he just randomly changes his actions on every instance, he\u2019ll be nowhere near riding the bike, would he? So basically, it\u2019s a trade-off and it is coined as the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma and is one of the major parameters to consider while solving an RL problem.", "Note that the kid would decide his action at a given instance on the basis of his current \u2018state\u2019 w.r.t to the environment i.e. his current motion/position while cycling and the rewards obtained from the previous tries (This decision-making mechanism is what RL is all about).", "We\u2019ve got an intuition about what an RL problem looks like and how one can address it. Moreover, we distinguished RL from supervised and unsupervised learning. However, Reinforcement Learning is way more intricate than the outline laid in this article; but it is enough to clear the fundamental concepts.", "Your home for data science.
