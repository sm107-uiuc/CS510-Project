In this article, we\u2019ll explore from the ground up how machine learning is applied to credit risk modeling. You don\u2019t need to know anything about machine learning to understand this article!", "To explain credit risk modeling with machine learning, we\u2019ll first develop domain knowledge about credit risk modeling. Then, we\u2019ll introduce four fundamental machine learning systems that can be used for credit risk modeling:", "By the end of this article, you\u2019ll understand how each of these algorithms can be applied to the real-world problem of credit risk modeling, and you\u2019ll be well on your way to understanding the field of machine learning in general!", "Let\u2019s begin learning about what credit risk modeling is by looking at a simple situation.", "Say your buddy Ted needs ten bucks. You\u2019ll want those bucks back, so he promises he\u2019ll repay you tomorrow when you see him again.", "But you\u2019ve heard that Ted has a bit of a history with being difficult when it comes to repaying people. As a result, you know there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll never see your ten dollars again.", "Would you lend him the money?", "To make this decision, you need another piece of information.", "Just how difficult has Ted been in the past?", "If he just forgot to pay back the wrong dude once, then you\u2019re probably good. On the other hand, if he has a habit of getting deep into debt and fleeing to other countries, then you should probably keep your money to yourself.", "Ted\u2019s history tells us something about the risk of lending money to him.", "If he\u2019s been trustworthy in the past, then the risk of lending money to him is relatively low. If he\u2019s been untrustworthy in the past, then the risk of lending money to him is relatively high.", "The concept of risk gives you a logical way to make the decision about whether or not to lend Ted the money. First, determine how much risk you\u2019re okay with. Then, figure out how risky Ted\u2019s history makes lending money to him. If the risk of lending money to Ted isn\u2019t greater than your maximum tolerated risk, then you can go ahead and lend him the money.", "If it\u2019s just Ted asking you for money, you\u2019ll probably rely on your intuition and feelings to determine the risk associated with loaning money to Ted. This works well enough for just one person.", "But what if you had hundreds of Teds asking you for money?", "You can\u2019t get to know every one of these people so that you can decide whether loaning to them feels like a good idea. But if you just loaned to them randomly, you might loan money to some people who are never going to pay you back. You also might reject some perfectly responsible people who would pay you back quickly. Instead, you\u2019d want to use a more scientific process.", "This scientific process is called credit risk modeling, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ll be exploring in this article.", "Formally speaking, credit risk modeling is the process of using data about a person to determine how likely it is that the person will pay back a loan. Based on the name of the process, it\u2019s no surprise that credit card companies do credit risk modeling all the time. But credit risk modeling doesn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with credit cards, even though \u201ccredit\u201d is in the name. Credit risk modeling applies to any loans, not just loans associated with credit cards.", "Countless organizations use credit risk modeling, including insurance companies, banks, investment firms, and government treasuries. Sometimes, individual people make a living using credit risk modeling to strategically loan away their own money. Credit risk modeling is ultra important anywhere people are borrowing money.", "Even more importantly, understanding the process of credit risk modeling will make it easier to understand any type of modeling that involves probabilities.", "But for now, let\u2019s come back to Ted so that we can get a solid grasp of the fundamentals of loans.", "If you\u2019re lending money to Ted just to be nice, you\u2019ll probably just ask him to give you back the same amount of money you gave him. But you could also take this opportunity to make a bit of extra money.", "You could tell Ted that he has to give you back the same amount of money you gave him, plus ten percent.", "This means if you give Ted $10, he\u2019ll have to give you $11 back. The extra money he gives you back is called the interest. In this case, Ted is paying you $1 in interest, and the interest rate is ten percent. If you raised the interest rate to 20%, Ted would have to pay you $2 in interest, which means he\u2019d have to pay you $12 in total.", "If Ted really needs the money, then he\u2019ll probably be okay with paying some interest. Paying interest on a loan is basically buying the ability to spend money that you\u2019ll have in the future.", "Spending future money in the present is a convenient thing to do, and like all convenient things in the business world, it comes with a price.", "With interest rates, you can see how it could be pretty useful to have 500 Teds asking you for money at the same time. If you charged all of them 20% interest, then loaning $10 to each of them could make you a thousand dollars.", "But we get to that figure of $1000 by making a pretty big\u2013and invalid\u2013assumption: that everyone will pay you back.", "If somebody doesn\u2019t pay you back, then you permanently lose the $10 you gave them. You also miss out on the $2 they would have paid you in interest. This means that for each person who doesn\u2019t pay you back, you miss out on $12.", "If just 84 out of the 500 people don\u2019t pay you back, then you\u2019ll actually lose money from this whole lending process. It\u2019s amazing that it takes less than 17% of the people to screw this whole system up.", "To make a living off of this, you need a better system.", "Fortunately, credit risk modeling lets you estimate the probability that each person will fail to pay you back. Defaulting on a loan means failing to pay it back, so each person\u2019s probability that they\u2019ll fail to pay back their loan is called their default risk.", "Determining somebody\u2019s default risk is important. Once you know somebody\u2019s default risk, there\u2019s a way to calibrate their interest rate to mitigate the risk of lending money to them.", "But before we can understand how to use a default risk to calibrate somebody\u2019s interest rate, it\u2019s important to understand a fundamental statistics concept: the Law of Large Numbers.", "Let\u2019s start with a simple situation: flipping a coin.", "We\u2019ve all heard that there\u2019s a 50% chance of getting a heads and a 50% chance of getting a tails. This is called a theoretical probability.", "If you flip the coin once, then you\u2019re going to get either heads or tails. If you flip the coin 10 times, you could get 5 heads and 5 tails (50% heads). But it\u2019s also totally possible that you get 6 heads and 4 tails (60% heads), or even 9 heads and 1 tails (90% heads).", "These observed results are called the experimental probability. The experimental probability doesn\u2019t necessarily equal the theoretical probability.", "So what does a 50% chance of getting heads actually mean?", "It means that if you flip a coin a lots and lots and lots of times, the overall result will be that about 50% of the flips come of up heads.", "Let\u2019s look at this step by step.", "Let\u2019s flip a coin 5 times. The number of heads we got is the number of red dots, and the number of tails we got is the number of blue dots.", "This looks pretty imbalanced so far, with 80% of our flips coming up heads. That\u2019s an 80% experimental probability, which is pretty far from our 50% theoretical probability. But let\u2019s keep flipping. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve gotten after flipping the coin 15 times.", "Now we\u2019ve had a total of 60% of our results come up as heads, which is a lot closer to 50%. If we keep flipping until we\u2019ve flipped the coin 50 times, here\u2019s what we get.", "That\u2019s 46% of our total flips now coming up heads, which is even closer to 50%. If we keep flipping the coin over and over again, then we\u2019re going to see this percentage of heads get closer and closer to the theoretical probability of 50%. It might not get closer to 50% with every single flip, but it will generally tend to get closer to 50%.", "If we keep flipping, until we get to 100 flips, the blue line represents the cumulative percentage of heads over time. The red line is 50%.", "The blue line starts off really high because our first four flips were heads, which means that 100% of our cumulative tosses came out heads for a little bit. But as we get some tails in the mix, the blue line tends to get closer to the red line.", "As you can see, as we flip the coin more and more times, the blue line, which represents our experimental probability, approaches the red line, which is our theoretical probability.", "This is how we define a theoretical probability, like a 50% chance of getting a heads or a 16.7% chance of getting a 1 when rolling a 6-sided die.", "The Law of Large Numbers is that the experimental probability tends to approach the theoretical probability as we do a large number of trials. The more trials we do, the closer the experimental probability tends to get to the theoretical probability.", "To illustrate this concept, here\u2019s a coin flip simulation graph with fifty thousand flips:", "By the end, the experimental probability gets so close to the theoretical probability that the blue and red line are almost on top of each other.", "This means that when we\u2019re dealing with a ton of trials, we can assume that the experimental probability will basically equal the theoretical probability. In this case, if we flip a coin fifty thousand times, the experimental probability will be super close to 50%.", "It\u2019s important to highlight that each time you flip the coin, the probability of getting a heads is always 50%, no matter what came before it. Even if you\u2019ve gotten 10 heads in a row, the probability of getting another heads on the next flip is still 50%.", "This helps explain why the blue line in the graph above doesn\u2019t always go straight to the red line. Even near flip 30,000, you can see that the blue line still wiggles just a little. But over time, the blue line generally tends to approach the red line.", "The important thing to take away from the Law of Large Numbers is that a large number of trials gets the experimental probability really close to the theoretical probability.", "If you think this idea is making a bit of sense, you\u2019re ready to understand the process of calibrating interest rates based on default risk.", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re thinking about making loans of $10 to a large number of people, such as 10,000 people. Using credit risk modeling, you discover that on average, each person\u2019s theoretical default risk is 15%. The Law of Large Numbers tells you that the experimental probability approaches the theoretical probability for a large number of trials. Given that you have a large number of people here (10,000 people), it\u2019s safe to assume that about 15% of the people you loan to really will default, and 85% will pay you back.", "If you know that about 15% of people probably won\u2019t pay you back, then you know that you\u2019re going to permanently lose 15% of the $10 loans you make. Because 15% of 10,000 people is 1500 people, and you\u2019re loaning each person $10, you know you\u2019ll probably lose $15,000.", "But you don\u2019t need to just be okay with losing $15,000. There are a few things you can do here.", "This way, the 85% of people who actually do pay back their loan will end up paying a total of $15,000 extra. Because 85% of 10,000 people is 8,500 people, that\u2019s about an extra $1.76 of interest per person. In this case, that\u2019s equal to raising the interest rate by 17.6 percentage points.", "Here\u2019s the issue: if the interest rate is already set at 20% so that you can make some profit, then raising the interest rate another 17.6 percentage points makes the total interest rate 37.6%. That\u2019s a big increase, and increasing the interest rate like that might deter some potential borrowers.", "Credit risk modeling lets you see each individual\u2019s default risk separately. Some people might have a 40% default risk, while others might have just a 1% default risk. If you only give loans to people whose default risk is below a certain threshold, say 2%, then the percentage of people who will pay you back will be much higher. This means that fewer people will default, and you\u2019ll lose less money.", "As a result, you can charge a lower interest rate, because you won\u2019t have to make up for as much lost money due to defaulting. The problem with this strategy is that you might have to turn away a big portion of people who want a loan, which would decrease your profits.", "This is the most important strategy in the real world. As we go through all the borrowers, we\u2019ll call each individual borrower \u201cborrower x\u201d. For each borrower x, you charge borrower x an interest rate such that you wouldn\u2019t lose any money if every borrower had borrower x\u2019s default risk.", "That\u2019s a dense idea, so let\u2019s unpack it.", "When analyzing the first strategy, we discovered that we should add 17.6 percentage points to each borrower\u2019s interest rate if each borrower has a 15% default risk. (This is the same as 15% being the average default risk.) This way, the extra interest paid by the 85% who don\u2019t default will make up for the 15% of people who default.", "If everybody you\u2019re loaning money to has the same default risk, then there\u2019s always a certain amount that should be added to each borrower\u2019s interest rate to offset the people who default.", "In fact, the amount that should be added to each borrower\u2019s interest rate can be calculated with the following formula:", "There\u2019s no need to delve into this formula if you don\u2019t want to, but if you want to learn how it works, this paragraph will show you how. The risk term on top represents the share of people who are going to default. Defaulting is a binary outcome; this means that every person is either going to default or not default. There\u2019s no in-between. The number 1 represents 100% of the people, so the term 1 \u2014 risk (one minus risk) is the share of people who don\u2019t default. You divide the defaulters by the non-defaulters to determine what percentage of each defaulter\u2019s loan the non-defaulters need to pay off.", "Even if each borrower\u2019s default risk is different, you can use this formula to calculate exactly how much you should add to each borrower\u2019s interest rate to counterbalance their risk. If you add this amount to every borrower\u2019s interest rate, and you have a large number of borrowers, the Law of Large Numbers shows us that you almost certainly won\u2019t lose money in the long run.", "Just to recap, here\u2019s a breakdown of the money somebody might pay you back after you loan money to them.", "In the real world, these strategies are combined. In accordance with strategy 1, lenders often increase everyone\u2019s interest rate by small fixed rate, regardless of default risk, to make up for uncertainty in their models. In accordance with strategy 2, lenders often have a risk threshold, so they won\u2019t accept everyone. And finally, in accordance with strategy 3, lenders use each borrower\u2019s default risk to add a certain number of percentage points to each individual\u2019s interest rate.", "If you\u2019re getting the hang of these three strategies, then you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of loaning money.", "At this point, we\u2019ve explored why finding somebody\u2019s default risk is so useful. Now, we\u2019re ready to dive into the machine learning models used in credit risk modeling to calculate these default risks.", "People toss around the term \u201cmachine learning\u201d a lot nowadays, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what it means.", "Simply put, a machine learning model is a mathematical predictive model that gets better as it sees more data.", "To do machine learning, you need two things: a model, and data.", "There are tons of different types of machine learning models. A machine learning model is the name for the set of steps that are used to make predictions based off the data. Below, we\u2019ll explore four fundamental machine learning models that are important in credit risk modeling.", "You also need historical data, and lots of it. This data needs to contain both the thing you\u2019re trying to predict (called the target) and other characteristics that are related to the thing you\u2019re trying to predict (called the features). In the case of credit risk modeling, you need historical data for lots of individual people. The target data here is whether or not each person defaulted. The feature data here consists of statistics about each person, such as their income, age, and employment status.", "Once you have your data, you need to train the model by feeding it historical data. Machine learning models are built to connect the feature data to the target data. After training, the model can look at cases where the feature data is known and the target data isn\u2019t, and the model can make predictions.", "This situation is common in real life. When you\u2019re trying to decide whether or not to give someone a loan, you usually have all their feature data, such as income and age. You just don\u2019t know the target data: the probability that they\u2019ll default on their loan.", "Calculating this probability is where machine learning models shine.", "Let\u2019s start with a simple, but surprisingly powerful model.", "Let\u2019s say we have a bunch of historical lending data with two features: each person\u2019s income and their age. We also know whether each person defaulted on their loan. If they defaulted, then their dot is colored red on the graph. If they paid back their loan, their dot is colored blue on the graph.", "Now let\u2019s say Ted is asking again for a loan. We want to know how likely it is that he\u2019ll pay back his loan, and we now have a much more powerful tool than our feelings alone. If we know Ted\u2019s income and age, then we can plot him in green on the same graph.", "We then select a number of \u201cnearest neighbors\u201d that we\u2019ll look at. This number is called K. If K = 5, then we\u2019ll select the 5 dots that are closest to Ted\u2019s dot and figure out what percentage of them defaulted.", "In this case, 80% of people nearest to Ted paid back their loans (4 people), and 20% of them defaulted (1 person). This means that we tentatively estimate Ted\u2019s default risk as 20%.", "Of course, you\u2019re probably thinking that setting K equal to 5 seems pretty arbitrary. There is a way to optimize our K value, and it lies in testing the model.", "To test the model, we split our historical data into two parts: the training data and the testing data. We then set our K value to an arbitrary value, say 10, and we feed the model our training data to generate a graph like the one above. Then, for each person in the testing data, we make our trained model guess whether or not the person defaulted on their loan. The model doesn\u2019t get to see the target column of the testing data; it only sees the features. During testing, the model has to make predictions based on the features alone, just like it would in real life.", "Each time the model makes a prediction, we record whether the model predicted correctly. We then calculate the model\u2019s accuracy score by finding the percentage of cases it predicted correctly.", "To optimize our K value, we test the model over and over again with different K values until we find one that works best. Sometimes the ideal K value is 1, while other times the ideal K value is huge. (Of course, for credit risk modeling, a K value of 1 would be silly, because this would either give us a 0% or 100% default risk.)", "In the 2D graph above, we only had 2 feature variables: income and age. But the k-nearest neighbors algorithm works great with more than 2 feature variables as well. If we had 3 feature variables, we could plot the points in a 3D box instead of a 2D square.", "With 3 variables, the same set of steps applies. Training the model gives us a 3D graph with a bunch of blue and red dots on it. When we have a person whose default risk we\u2019re trying to predict, we plot them on the graph. To calculate their default risk, we find this person\u2019s K nearest neighbors, and we calculate the percentage of these neighbors who defaulted. We say that this percentage is the new person\u2019s default risk.", "Once we get to 4 variables, the graph becomes hard to visualize. But the computer can deal with a nearly infinite number of variables. In fact, it\u2019s not too difficult to algebraically calculate nearest neighbors by hand with 4 or more variables using the Pythagorean Theorem. (Google it if you\u2019re interested!)", "k-nearest neighbors might seem like quite a simplistic model, but with thousands of data points and many features, it can be quite powerful.", "In some cases, however, other models are more effective. Let\u2019s discuss another classic machine learning model: logistic regression.", "The simplest form of logistic regression involves a dataset with a target column and a single feature column. For instance, a historical dataset that contains borrowers\u2019 incomes and whether or not they defaulted on their loan would be very simple to use for logistic regression.", "For logistic regression, the target data must be binary, which means that it can only have two outcomes. In credit risk modeling, the target data is indeed binary: a person can either default or not default on a loan.", "In order to make a graph, we can represent this binary outcome as the probability that a person in the past paid back their loan. If somebody defaulted on a loan in the past, then we can say that there was a 0 probability that they paid back their loan. If somebody actually did pay back their loan, then we can say that the probability that they paid back their loan was 1. It might feel weird to assign probabilities to past events, but probabilities of 0% or 100% are just another way of saying that we know something either definitely didn\u2019t happen or definitely did happen.", "Here\u2019s what a graph of income vs historical default probability might look like:", "Because we\u2019re dealing with definite past data, all the dots are either on the top, or bottom. A blue dot on the top represents a person who did pay back their loan, while a red dot on the bottom represents a person who defaulted.", "This is where things get cool. Using some interesting math that we won\u2019t dive into here, the logistic regression algorithm calculates a line that looks something like this:", "This line tells us the probability that a new person with a given income level will pay back their loan.", "Predicting a new person\u2019s default risk with logistic regression is pretty simple. You just find the point on the income axis that corresponds to the new person\u2019s income, and the logistic regression line\u2019s y-value that corresponds to this point gives you the probability that they\u2019ll pay back the loan. Subtracting this value from 1 gives you their default risk.", "Let\u2019s say that Ted\u2019s income is right here:", "To find the probability that Ted will pay back his loan, we go up and meet the logistic regression trend line.", "Based on this model, it looks like he has about a 85% chance of paying back his loan. This means that his default risk is 15%.", "It\u2019s worth noting that this version of logistic regression put Ted\u2019s default risk at 15%, while our k-nearest neighbors model put Ted\u2019s default risk at 20%. Getting different predictions from different models is totally normal in the world of machine learning. To decide which model to use, we would have to do a bunch of train/test cycles with historical data to see which model consistently performs best in this scenario.", "A 2D version of the logistic regression model is pretty simplistic, just like 2D k-nearest neighbors. But just like K-Nearest-Neighbors, a computer (or a person with a pencil!) can extend logistic regression to an infinite number of dimensions without any problem.", "K-nearest neighbors and logistic regression are both great models for making approximations, especially if the data follows a linear pattern. But sometimes, it\u2019s nice to have a model that picks up on subtle, non-linear patterns in the data. The decision tree model is a simple model that\u2019s excellent at finding such patterns.", "To understand decision trees, let\u2019s go back to the graph we used to illustrate how k-nearest neighbors works.", "As we\u2019ve seen, one way to make sense of this graph would be to use the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. However, we could also make some simple rules for how we classify points based on their location. For instance, we could draw a line that splits the graph in half, like this:", "Drawing this line splits the data into two halves. One way to represent this is using a tree diagram, as we can see below.", "Then, we can split each of these splits again, so that they end up looking like this on the graph:", "And here\u2019s what this second split looks like in tree form:", "We can keep making smaller and smaller splits like these until we\u2019re left with just one outcome\u2013default or no default\u2013on the bottom of each branch. Another way to look at this is that we keep making the boxes on the graph smaller and smaller until each box only contains one color of dots.", "For each split, the computer finds the optimal value to split on by using an interesting mathematical process that we won\u2019t delve into here.", "To test a new case using the decision tree algorithm, you simply start at the beginning and follow the branches down.", "Let\u2019s say Ted makes $50,000 a year and is 30 years old. We start at the top of the tree.", "Then, we move down and right, because Ted makes more than $20,000 per year.", "From here, we move to the right because Ted is older than 28.", "This process continues, until we get all the way to the bottom of the tree, where there is only one possible outcome on a leaf. In a real decision tree, there would be many more branches than the two layers shown here.", "The issue with this algorithm is that it returns a binary result: either Ted will default, or Ted won\u2019t default. Given that any model is inherently imperfect, this binary result isn\u2019t that useful for credit modeling. We can\u2019t use a binary result to set Ted\u2019s interest rate.", "The solution is to use random forests. A random forest is simply a collection of decision trees, all structured slightly differently. To make a prediction, each tree in the forest \u201cvotes\u201d for whether or not it thinks Ted will default on the loan. Ted\u2019s credit risk is the percentage of the trees that say he will default.", "Like the other algorithms we discussed, the decision tree algorithm can be extended to as many dimensions as we want. One advantage of the decision tree algorithm is that it\u2019s very good at capturing non-linear data. However, decision trees sometimes look too far into noisy data, thinking that they see patterns where statistically significant patterns don\u2019t exist.", "There\u2019s one more type of machine learning algorithm that we\u2019ll briefly touch on here.", "Neural networks are considerably more complex than the three algorithms we\u2019ve already discussed. They\u2019re a fascinating algorithm that\u2019s modeled off of the human brain, and they\u2019re at the core of most systems that can be considered \u201cAI\u201d.", "Neural networks are usually overkill for simple credit risk modeling problems, but in certain cases, they can be tremendously useful.", "If you want to learn more about neural networks, you can read a detailed explanation of them here.", "These four classes of algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision tress, and neural networks) are just the beginning of the machine learning used in credit risk modeling. But understanding the basics of these algorithms gives you a bit of insight into the whole credit risk modeling process, and this understanding gives you the perfect springboard to learn more about machine learning.", "First, we developed a bit of domain knowledge about how loans and interest rates are used in the real world. Then, we looked at splitting the data into train and test sets to analyze various models. Finally, we analyzed several models that we could test out, and we know that we\u2019d use the most effective models\u2019 outputs to make our predictions.", "A similar process is applicable to almost any problem that involves machine learning.", "First, it\u2019s important to develop some domain knowledge about the problem you\u2019re dealing with so that you know how to ask the right questions. Then, you have to clean and prepare your data (a topic we didn\u2019t delve into here). Next, you train and test a variety of models, honing the models to maximize prediction accuracy. Finally, you present your results to others and apply them to real world problems, repeating this process continuously.", "If you have a better understanding of this general process, then you\u2019re well on your way to better understanding credit risk modeling and machine learning as a whole!", "Your home for data science.
