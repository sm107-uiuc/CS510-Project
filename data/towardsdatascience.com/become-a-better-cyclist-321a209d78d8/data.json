This involved compiling road safety indicators and risk factors; analysing a GSV dataset, before using two state-of-the-art tools, YOLOv5 and PSPNet101, to detect objects and segment images, respectively, and further analysing their results; determining the limitations of YOLOv5, PSPNet101 and suggesting ways of making cyclists\u2019 safety assessment more accurate.", "Approximately 2 million objects were identified, and 200 billion pixels labelled in the 500 000 images available in the imagery dataset. On average, there were 108 images per Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA). Using YOLOv5, the distribution of the following risk factors was (in)directly identified at an LSOA level: high vehicle speed, tram/train rails, truck circulation, parked cars and pedestrian presence. Statistically significant negative correlations between cars x buses, cars x cyclists and cars x people (strongest) were found. And positive correlations between people x bus and people x bicycles (strongest). Long-tail distribution on the number of heavy-vehicles was observed. Using PSPNet101, building (27%), sky (22%) and road (22%) pixels were the most common. Thus, objects in any of these areas can be equally detected. All results and implementations were made available in the project\u2019s repository.", "Future developments include increasing the availability and resolution of GSV images.

They can be categorized in five main domains: safety, economy, environment, equity and health [1].", "The main cause of death in the USA in youngers is traffic accidents. Accounting for 41% of the total number of deaths in the age group 15 to 24 (CDC). In the EU, in the past 10 years, deaths among cyclists remained constant, while for car drivers and passengers had decreased 24%. Among pedestrians fell by 19% [8]. UK was one of the only 3 EU nations which fatality rate among pedestrians increased, 1.3% a year. On average, it fell 2.6% in EU per year. For cyclists, in the UK, the number of fatalities decreased 1.3%, with the 13th-best average annual drop. Given that 99% of the pedestrians killed were struck by motor vehicles and 1% by bikes, it is evident the necessity of promoting cyclists\u2019 safety and increase their number in the streets. In parallel, this promotes safety in numbers: cyclists are safer if their number increases. The awareness drivers develop by contacting more frequently with cyclists is the root cause.", "Many economic benefits for individuals, companies and communities are known from promoting walking and cycling as alternative ways of transportation [9]. According to 2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard, the cost of congestion for the US in 2014 was 160 billion dollars. For an individual was estimated to be 960 dollars each year. These values account for time and fuel expenses. While the cost of having a car in the USA in 2018 was calculated to be 8849 dollars, for a bike was 308 dollars and walking was considered free. 2018 Benchmarking Report adds that bike tourism has a positive economic impact in multiple regions worldwide. Protected Bike Lanes Mean Business Report shows the positive impact cycling may have in business. It was found that workers cycling in their commutes, on average, spent more time and travelled more often to their companies, then car drivers. Moreover, in a 2011 study, the Political Economy Research Institute found that 11.41 jobs were on average created when investing 1 million pounds in bicycle-only projects, comparing to 7.75 jobs while investing the same amount in road-only projects.", "Reducing the dependency on non-renewable sources is one of the positive aspects of cycling. It was estimated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that the transportation sector was responsible by the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 28% (in the USA). From those, passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks account for most of the overall transport sector \u2014 60%. Moreover, it is known structures such as roads and parking lots increase significantly the probability of urban flooding, stormwater runoff and urban heat island effect (due to the lack of shadows and exposed land in the cities, they often register higher temperatures than the surroundings, resultant from the low levels of air humidity). Promoting cycling will reduce the need of the previous infrastructures and mitigate some of the negative consequences.", "Promoting cycling in a country promotes equity. Due to the high cost of car ownership, when a city prioritizes road infrastructure for these vehicles, it puts in higher risk low-income families that cannot afford it. This is particularly important in low-income communities where a brief from Bridging the Gap estimated that only 50% of the roads have sidewalks, comparing to 90% in high-income homologous. This results in higher threat for pedestrians and cyclists.

Relate to some aspect of road safety, such as the causes or consequences of a road accident;", "2. Be measurable in a reliable way;", "4. Allow road safety engineers or public health experts to set targets;", "5. Be useful for establishing comparisons and benchmarking different safety performances.", "There are six dimensions common to all indicators: geographical scope, time span, numerical format, representation/visualization, reliability, accuracy, representativeness and a specific \u201clevel\u201d of road safety. The first encompasses where the measurement takes place: organisation, city, region, country, Europe or global. The second relates to the time frame comprehensive to the analysis: day, week, month, quarter, year, decade or longer. The units of the measurement are represented by the third feature. They can be a proportion, a percentage or some other well-defined ratio. Representation described the way in which data is presented, for example, in the form of a map, graph or table. Reliability, accuracy and representativeness are linked to the design and implementation of the measurement system. Finally, the \u201clevel\u201d of the indicator differs on whether it considers one of the following: impact of the crashes, post-crash response, crash outcomes, crash causes and predictors, road safety policy and measures, or safety culture and safety systems.", "Crash outcomes, including indicators such as mortality, severely/slightly injured and accident rates, were the ones considered while selecting the risk factors presented in the next section.", "Road safety indicators were introduced so that a clear ranking of the most relevant cyclist\u2019s risk factors could be established", "To list and order the most relevant risk factors for cyclists in London, accident, injury and fatality rates were considered. In London, the fatality rate for cyclists is relatively low (Figure 2), consequently, priority was given to the other two more discriminative ones. Accident and injury rates were used to order all risk factors when designing Figure 3 diagram. Note there is also a strong qualitative and experience-based component inherent to these rankings, once a common safety metric to all risk factors was not found.", "The top 3 most relevant factors identified that influence cyclists\u2019 safety was the presence of a cycle lane, road speed limits and road lane width. Next, statistical data that supports the rankings defined in Figure 3 are provided. Note that only a small number of accidents involving cyclists are reported [11], consequently, the statistics presented in the next paragraphs may not totally reflect a real-life scenario.", "Cycle lanes can be physically separated or located on the road.", "Physically separated lanes reduce the probability of crash when a car tries to overtake a cyclist or, in the case of fall, to be hit. One of the main causes of injury among cyclists are falls caused by bad pavement quality [12] [13] [14]. With no cars parked in the surroundings, these lanes reduce the risk of injury among cyclists by half. [15] For all these reasons, risks associated to high speed road limits, narrow bicycle lane widths, road pavement quality and parked cars were not considered.", "In the case of an on-road cycle lane, vehicular speeds tend to be lower and there are less interactions between these and the cyclists, when comparing to no lane [16].", "This makes the first scenario the safest, followed by on-road and no cycle lane.", "The presence of a cycle lane was considered the most decisive factor by preventing many of the previously identified risks. It was considered the number one in the rankings of risk factors.", "Speed was found to be one of the major factors involved in around 10% of all accidents and 30% of the fatal ones. Speed of vehicles involved in a crash is the single most important factor in determining the severity of injuries. [17]", "There are two distinct factors when considering speed. Not only higher speeds are known to be responsible for an increased rate of accidents, injuries and deaths, but also large speed differences. Roads with high speed variance are more unpredictable, once they favour the number of encounters and an increased number of overtaking manoeuvres. Consequently, reducing speed limits sometimes may only result in the decrease of the vehicles\u2019 average speed and not its variance. [18]", "In the core of the danger posed by vehicles\u2019 high speeds are the increase in the braking distance and kinetic energy that is transferred from the vehicle to the cyclist. Once both increase with the square of the velocity, the possibility of avoiding or surviving a crash decreases quadratically. [18]", "In a biological perspective, it is known the human body can only resist the transference of a limited amount of kinetic energy in a crash. [19] This amount varies for different body parts, age groups and gender. Considering the best-designed car, if the vehicle exceeds 30 km/h, this limit can be exceeded. [20] Studies also show if a car travels at a speed lower than 30 km/h, the probability for a pedestrian to survive a crash is higher than 90%. When hit by a car at 45 km/h, the chance of surviving decreases to 50%. [21] Or, as the speed of a car rises from 30 km/h to 50 km/h, the probability of surviving a crash decreases by a factor of 8. [22]", "This was considered the second most relevant factor. In the case of an on-road cycle lane next to a low-speed limit road, the risk factors related to parallel traffic were considered negligible, regardless of the width of the lane.", "In the United Kingdom, recommended cycle lane width is 2 meters. Minimum required is 1.5 meters. All values below 1.5 m are considered too narrow, allowing little room to manoeuvre around obstacles, such as: debris, potholes and water drainers. It is frequently referred it is safer not having a cycle lane, than one that is too narrow, once motorists tend to drive right up to the line and cyclists too close to the kerb.", "After the road speed limits, cycle lane width was considered the following most important factor. Whenever it is considered wide, traffic risk factors were not considered. Regardless of the width of an on-road cycle lane, low-speed limits were enough to discard all traffic related risk factors.", "After the top 3, streetlight was considered the most relevant criterion in determining road safety. It is known to affect drivers and cyclists\u2019 reaction time and make cyclists unnoticeable particularly when not using any reflective or luminous gear. Moreover, in the cyclists\u2019 perspective, they are less aware of other road risks associated for example to the quality of the pavement. It is not expected to encounter many significantly under illuminated roads in London, consequently, it was placed in fourth place of the ranking.", "Pavement Quality, Tram/Train Rails and Water Drainers", "As frequently referred in literature, pavement quality is a crucial factor to consider when evaluating safety. [12] [13] [14] Pavement quality refers to the quality of the road when there is no cycle lane, or to the cycle lane itself, when it is present. Along with the presence of water drainers and trails, these were the following most important risk factors. This was placed under streetlight once with enough luminosity and circulating at a moderate velocity, it should not pose a significant threat.", "The majority of bike and car crashes occur in intersections. In [23], the reported percentage was 60% over the total number of crashes. Additionally, as part of the same study, intersections where streets do not meet at right angles, posed an additional danger to cyclists. Crashes at these areas were 31% more likely to cause serious injury to the cyclist. The main reason is the decreased intersection visibility.", "In the last years, economic development and consumer demand have been increasing, and so as the number of trucks in the cities. [24] [25] While cycling has following the same trend, the number of encounters among them has significantly increased. As an example, in New York City, 15% of bicycle networks overlap with 11% of truck networks. [26] The increased number of encounters has contributed to a higher accident and mortality rates involving trucks. Truck-bicycle accidents have usually more severe consequences than any other type of accidents. [27] [28] [29] [30] In some EU countries, 30% of all cycling fatalities are associated to trucks. [31] Studies in the past 2 decades have identified trucks as the most common vehicle category involved in cyclist deaths, in London. [28] [32] [33]", "These lines present in several European countries such as Belgium, Denmark and United Kingdom, allow a head start to certain types of vehicles (namely, bicycles) when the traffic signal changes from red to green. This has several advantages. First, drivers behind the line can clearly realize the presence of cyclists around them and take the right precautions to avoid danger manoeuvres. Second, it becomes safer for a cyclist to turn to the left avoiding a crash with the cars that are behind. In terms of statistical data on accident, injury or mortality rate, it was not found any.", "Several sources identify bends as a risk factor. Bends and intersections are often jointly considered as posing similar risks to the cyclist. Low visibility, in the cyclist\u2019s perspective, make risky situations that usually are not \u2014 sudden presence of pedestrians or intrusive vegetation. In the driver\u2019s perspective, it can make cyclists unnoticeable and, consequently, a vulnerable element. [12] There is no clear statistical data showing how bends affect cyclists\u2019 accident, injury or fatality rates.", "Among all age-groups, pedestrian fatalities most often occur in children younger than 14 years old, when comparing with adults aged between 15 and 64 or 65 or more. In terms of gender, men are at a greater risk than women. [34] For these reasons, locations with higher concentration of people satisfying these criteria (e.g. \u2014 school areas) are at additional risk. Nevertheless, in car-free zones, accidents between pedestrians and cyclists are extremely rare and almost never serious. [35] This was considered the least important of the risk factors.", "Considering Figure 3, from the left to the right of the diagram, the number of risk factors decreases. The most unsafe situation was the absence of cycle lane. Secondly, high speed limits with a narrow lane in an on-road scenario. Thirdly, high-speed limits but with a wider lane. Fourthly, low-speed limits regardless of the presence of a narrow or wide on-road lane. Finally, a physically separated lane was considered the safest scenario.", "In the next two sections are described the tools used to capture objects and structures from imagery.", "OD is a computer technology that closely relates to image processing and computer vision fields. It is used in tasks such as image annotation, activity recognition, face detection, face recognition, video object co-segmentation and object tracking [36].", "Every object has a set of special features that helps classifying it as belonging to a specific class. For example, when looking for circles or rectangles, objects that are curve or perpendicular on the corners are searched [36].", "Methods for OD fall in one of these two categories: machine-learning or deep-learning based approaches. In the case of the first, a list of the most relevant features to look is defined a priori. A support vector machine is one possible example.

Although, the number of detected traffic lights is almost five times bigger.", "In terms of positive correlations, Person x Bicycle high value suggests pedestrians and cyclists feel safe occupying the same space.", "Once bus is a public transport, it is expected high number of people in the surroundings. Consequently, the Pearson coefficient for Person x Bus is relatively high. There is a significant difference between the correlation values of Bicycle x Bus and Bicycle x Truck.", "This might suggest cyclists feel safer next to buses than trucks.", "This should not be surprising once bus drivers are more experienced driving close to vulnerable pedestrians. Relative high correlation between buses and trucks, and the fact of being structurally similar suggests one might have been wrongly classified as the other sometimes.", "For negative correlations, the statistically significant Pearson coefficients for Person x Car and Bicycle x Car suggest areas with high concentration of cars are dissuasive for cycling and walking.", "One factor that cannot be discarded is that bigger objects occluding smaller ones might contribute for the latter being less detected. Consequently, resulting in a negative correlation. Due to the height from the ground GSV images were captured, this is unlikely to be a recurrent phenomenon.", "It was not found a precise metric to estimate cyclist\u2019s road safety based on the detected objects in the roads of London. Although, based on the objects\u2019 distributions in Figure 12, one positive and another negative combinative measure of safety were formulated.", "One of the features that influences cyclist\u2019s safety is the number of other cyclists in the surroundings. This happens because drivers become more aware of their presence when in large numbers. Moreover, the vast majority of serious injurious are caused by crashes between vehicles and cyclists. It was found there is a statistically significant negative correlation between the presence of cars and people. This way, the higher the presence of pedestrians, the lower the number of cars. Consequently, less risky for cyclists to get injured.", "Bicycle and Person LSOAs were combined into one, after summing the average number of each of these objects per image, as a positive combinative measure of safety.", "If cars are the main contributors for injury rates, heavy vehicles are particularly relevant when analysing the fatality rates of a certain area.", "A second LSOA map was created joining the average number per image of the following objects: Bus, Car and Truck, as a negative combinative measure of safety.", "It is important to highlight we cannot extract a holistic metric of safety from these 2 generated LSOAs (Figure 14). A simple example is a road where cyclists are physically isolated from the traffic is not necessarily unsafe for cycling.", "High level of confidence was found for all the detected road safety objects (Figure 12). YOLOv5 can detect a wide range of object sizes, even when partially occluded (Figure 15). Moreover, low contrast between objects and background do not appear to have caused a high number of non-detections. An example of this was when the algorithm detected a car reflected in a window on the roads of London (Figure 10). Nevertheless, this is considered a misclassification \u2014 misclassification of sorts.", "It was compiled a set of ten random object detected images, so that the reader can verify by themselves the accuracy of YOLOv5 (Figure 15).", "An example of a segmented image is provided in Figure 16. It was identified with the respective labels of the detected structures.", "In the next section are detailed the absolute and relative label distributions across the GSV dataset.", "Buildings (27%), sky (22%), road (22%), vegetation (18%) and cars (6%) cover 95% of the total area of all images (Figure 17). In the case of the first four structures, this is explained by their intrinsic dimensions. Once this dataset exclusively contains images obtained from the roads of London, it was expected to find a higher number of cars than any other objects. This pixel frequency number is not only associated with their size, but their frequency in the images. This way, both OD and IS seemed to be in accordance.", "The relative distribution of segmented pixels across the different categories also suggests that not only objects present on the roads can be detected, but also in the surroundings, including in buildings and in the sky.", "Although for some of the following objects it was not found a clear correlation with road safety, they show the power of using GSV images to detect structures in a wide range of locations. Embedded in the buildings landscape, 2 750 clocks were wrongly classified instead of satellite dishes. In the same area, 37 917 potted plants were identified. In the sky, 234 airplanes were detected. Having detected a significant number of pixels labelled as sidewalk suggests objects regularly present are likely to be captured (107 266 people were found, along with 5 013 benches and 1 168 fire hydrants).", "In Table 7 are the absolute counting for all pixel labels distributed by 19 segmented categories.", "Again, from an IS point of view, GSV dataset appears to be useful to estimate the area of roads and sidewalks due to the relative high number of pixels detected and consistent shapes. The same applies to streetlights. In spite only 303M pixels were identified, the dimensions of this object suggest that a significant number of those should have been detected.", "After individually analysing one segmented image per LSOA for the complete dataset, it appears that both the area and shape of the roads and sidewalks can be accurately retrieved.", "As it was identified in the Introduction, these last properties are relevant in a road safety context because they allow to calculate road and sidewalk width. And the presence of streetlights or poles, as they are called in Cityscapes, it is a proxy to assess road visibility.", "In Figure 18, these concepts are exemplified along with an illustrative image on the side.", "Due to the dimensions of certain structures, PSPNet101 was not able to accurately capture their shape. One example are the poles which are thin and, consequently, their detection is highly influenced by the resolution of the images in the dataset. This is not particularly problematic once the most important about these structures are their detection and not capturing their shape.", "In terms of the roads and sidewalks, sometimes occlusion appears to be an issue. Nevertheless, by accounting for the objects that are usually present in any of these areas, considering their overlapped areas simultaneously seems to be an effective workaround. Specifically, this was observed for cars on the roads and people on the sidewalks. This way, it should still be possible to extract information on the shape and size of these structures.", "Extracting absolute dimensions of these structures on the roads of London can be a hard task. Criteria can widely vary accordingly to the angle the images were taken. One way to overcome this would be to focus on the relative dimensions across the objects (Figure 19).", "For OD, one step forward in assessing cyclist\u2019s road safety would be to find a common road safety indicator allowing us to compare, for example, in terms of accident or injury rate, how objects influence safety differently. Training YOLOv5 in a bigger dataset and with a higher number of object categories than MS Coco. This would involve annotating additional images. Documentation on how to train YOLOv5 is very detailed and easy to follow. Static images cannot capture several features. Using video recordings including pedestrian, cyclist and vehicle movement would allow to capture variables that are highly influenced by the time images are obtained.", "In terms of IS, these models can be exclusively used for detecting new objects.", "One structure that was identified as determinant for cyclists\u2019 road safety was the presence of cycle lanes. It was not found any dataset including those. Creating one including this category is of great importance to assess their safety.", "Although we did not find evidence whether sidewalks correlate with cyclist\u2019s safety, in the future, proven there is an association, PSPNet101 pre-trained in Cityscapes will be able to capture it.", "Figure 18 summarizes all road safety information (identified in this project) that can be extracted using PSPNet101 in the GSV dataset.", "The goal of this project was to use OD and IS to extract cyclists\u2019 road risk factors from a dataset of GSV images of Greater London. This included the study of image distribution across all LSOAs. Identifying relevant road safety indicators to determine and rank cyclists risk factors. Using YOLOv5 and PSPNet101 to detect objects and segment images. Analysing object distributions and correlations among the different categories. Finally, identifying common misclassifications and limitations of both methods, and propose new ways of advancing road safety assessment.", "Approximately 2 million objects were identified, and 200 billion pixels labelled in the 500 000 images available in the dataset. On average, there were 108 images per LSOA. Using YOLOv5, the distribution of the following risk factors was (in)directly identified at an LSOA level: high vehicle speed, tram/train rails, truck circulation, parked cars and pedestrians. Car (84.5% of all objects), person (6.01%), truck (3.92%), bus (0.60%), traffic light (0.4%), stop sign (0.07%), parking meter (0.05%) and train (0.04%) counting were used to identify the previous risk factors. London road traffic was found to be higher outside of Central London. In contrast, the presence of cyclists and pedestrians was higher inside this area. Former was defined as a negative combinative measure of safety and, the second, positive. It was found a statistically significant negative correlations between cars x buses, cars x cyclists and cars x people. Positive correlations between people x bicycles and people x buses. Long-tail distributions on the number of heavy-vehicles (buses and trucks) was observed. Using PSPNet101, building (27%), sky (22%) and road (22%) pixels were the most common. Thus, objects in any of these areas can be equally detected. All results and implementations were made available in the project\u2019s repository.", "Future directions include increasing the availability and resolution of GSV images. Train YOLOv5 and PSPNet101 with datasets containing a higher number of categories relevant for road safety. Define a safety metric to weight and combine (at a road level) detected objects or segmented structures. Finally, to process street view images or video in real-time would allow to better capture the dynamics of road safety (video).", "[4] S. M.

Given a large dataset, there are plenty of information that can be extracted.", "While analysing all the processed LSOAs atlas, it was found two that illustrate the potential of this technique: Airplane and Potted Plant categories (Figure 20).", "In the case of the first, it was detected a higher density of planes per image in the areas next to the airports of Heathrow and City of London. Moreover, all detected planes are on the right of each of these structures. This phenomenon is explained by the wind direction West -> East, which makes the planes preferably landing from East -> West, and the fact landing takes significantly longer than take-off. Thus, only images taken on the right contain them. Finally, it is also clear the difference on the number of detections next to each of these airports. Due to the increased air traffic of Heathrow, most of them are in its proximities.", "Potted plants were also frequently detected. These were mainly present in images closer to the biggest parks of London. This category includes all vegetation inserted in any type of pot. Given vegetation was the second most labelled type of pixels across the GSV dataset after executing PSPNet101, it is not surprising the high levels of captured potted plants (fourth most detected object).", "For the objects we defined as relevant to cyclist\u2019s road safety, the number of misclassifications was very small. This was achieved because it was defined a high threshold of 0.5 to count as a detection and in MS Coco training dataset the most common objects are the ones we are interested.", "Although, there were objects consistently misclassified. The most common were satellite dishes being detected as clocks. Depending on the angle, arm dishes can easily resemble a clock pointer. It was detected 2750 clocks in the complete GSV imagery dataset (Figure 21). Other less represented objects were also wrongly identified.
