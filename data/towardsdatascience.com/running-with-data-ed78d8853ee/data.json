While we all analyze the course, continue to train, and stress about weather on race day, I\u2019ve wanted to do a statistical analysis on the 2019 Boston Marathon. I\u2019ve chosen this marathon for 3 reasons: it is one of the largest marathons in the world, the April 15, 2019 results are released, and a lot of Boston Marathoners are from NY (you\u2019ll see below).", "There are approximately 570 marathons held in the United States every year. The Boston Marathon is the world\u2019s oldest marathon which started in 1897. I wanted to start this project with statistical analysis. The analysis includes charts and descriptions followed by a conclusion of the data.", "I start the project by collecting the data from the web. The source used to web scrape the results of the race was https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/results.", "I used Beautiful Soup, a python library, to pull results into a list/dataframe. Then conducted statistics on the data.", "Of 26,647 runners, the average age was 42 years old and the average official time was 3 hours, 53 minutes and 2 seconds. The oldest runner was 83 years old and (due to the minimum age requirement) the youngest runners were 18 years old.", "The picture below shows the participants per age group. You\u2019ll see that ages between 40 and 50 are quite high.", "Males seen below in orange typically are older than females who ran the 2019 marathon. Males averaging at about 45 years old whereas females averaged around 40.", "The top 20 cities where residents are from are shown on the last chart below.", "You can see our distribution before normalization with our me of age 42. After normalization is shown in pink. We want to convert Official time into seconds in order to see if there is a correlation between age and time.", "It\u2019s important to note our independent and dependent variables. Independent variables are variables that stand alone and cannot be changed by other variables. In this case, our independent variable is the age of the runner. Dependent variables are variables that depend on the values of the independent variable. In this case, we believe that official time depends on the age of the runner.", "You can see we have an extremely low R-squared value. This can be due to our extremely large dataset (over 26,000). So we want to dig further with plotting the correlation of both variables.", "I wanted to analyze how strongly correlated the age variables were to the overall rank of a participant. My thoughts on this would be that the older the person the slower that pace which would mean the higher the overall rank. Our correlation between Overall_Rank and Age = 0.3 which means that the two variables have a positive but low correlation.", "As you can see there are numerous observations in our analysis. The line through the observations is called the regression line. It's a line that fits through all of our observations. The regression line is based on the least square method.", "Notice the y-intercept is at 3.16 on our y-axis and our slope is 0.017 (which is why our regression line is slightly tilted. Our linear equation states that the y (dependent variable) is the outcome of how old the runner is.", "The Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot above is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. This is a visual check of the overall shape of our data against the required distribution.", "We can see in the chart above that there is a positive relationship between runners age and runners official time. We have low correlation and a low r-squared which can be due to the fact that we have over 26,000 observations.", "The consultant in me has tried to come up with reasons why companies would be interested in this data. When analyzing the marketing mix of a company you strategize with the 4 P\u2019s: product, price, promotion, and place.", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a startup running clothing company and you\u2019d like to promote your product effectively with runners in large cities (Product). Given the study analyzed above, I\u2019d suggest having a popup location in the Boston area (Place/Promotion) in the Spring. As said above The Boston Marathon is the oldest and one of the most well-known marathons in the US. Have your target market age group be 40s-50 years old and with your pricing strategy catored towards that age demographic (Price).", "Your home for data science.
