I\u2019m only stating that it does not work all the time with Data Science.", "We have common sense: a way of seeing and understanding things based on what has been \u201cgood\u201d for us as a species. That could be a definition that we could expand into something more technical:", "Sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters, or a basic ability to perceive, understand, and judge that is shared by (\u201ccommon to\u201d) nearly all people.", "According to this definition, if we want to follow common sense, we need to understand and judge based on what is shared with \u201cmost people\u201d.", "Ok, don\u2019t get me wrong, this is important in some aspects of life. I mean, if a dangerous animal is approaching you, it is common sense to run or just generally do something to keep yourself alive. It is also common sense not to eat the plant that has killed half of the village. That\u2019s more than fine.", "But as I stated before, the common sense that reigns in our culture is sadly Aristotelian and Medieval (\u00c9tudes d\u2019histoire de la pens\u00e9e scientifique \u2014 Alexander Koyr\u00e9). This means that intuition fails a lot of times when trying to understand the world (imagine scientists still thinking that rocks fall to the ground because that\u2019s their natural place!). \u201cCommon sense\u201d sometimes comes with poor judgement, creating a bias in the way we see things.", "We are used to only seeing what is right in front of us and \u201ctrusting our gut\u201d.", "I mean, I tried to write something here, but I\u2019ll just let three definitions and three pictures do the talking.", "The ability to acquire knowledge without proof, evidence, or conscious reasoning, or without understanding how the knowledge was acquired.", "A thing that one knows or considers likely from instinctive feeling rather than conscious reasoning.", "The ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning.", "And the great images by Scott Adams:", "As expected, obviously, we translated our common sense and way of \u201cdoing things\u201d into our companies and our work life. Although it is true that both common sense and intuition made millionaires a while ago, now the world has changed. It is now very unlikely that people that trust their uninformed instincts can beat others that take their decisions from a deep study and analysis of the world and the data we have.", "Something interesting to think about at this moment is that knowledge is not inside us \u2014 it is in the space between us. It is just there, waiting for us to interpret what it has to say.", "Ok, I know this sounds kind of weird, but before judging (or trusting your gut who\u2019s screaming, \u201cNonsense!\u201d), first read more about it:", "So what does Data Science have to do with any of this? Going beyond common sense and intuition is the only way of solving complex business problems. In a world full of intuitive models, disruption and advancement come from going a bit further, using data to understand what cannot be seen with the naked eye or with an \u201cexpert look\u201d.", "As Russell Jurney stated in the \u201cManifesto for Agile Data Science\u201d", "In software application development, there are three perspectives to consider: those of the customers, the developers, and the business. In analytics application development, there is another perspective: that of the data. Without understanding what the data \u201chas to say\u201d about any feature, the product owner can\u2019t do a good job. The data\u2019s opinion must always be included in product discussions, which means that they must be grounded in visualization through exploratory data analysis in the internal application that becomes the focus of our efforts.", "Again: The data\u2019s opinion must always be included in product discussions.", "Repeat that in your head. It is very important.", "We need to listen to what the data has to say. Stop trusting that we know better than data all the time. If our \u201cexperts\u201d in the area can solve everything, what is the need for a Data Scientist? Models either come from data (not anecdotal \u201cexperience\u201d or intuition), or aren\u2019t models at all.", "I think the first step towards making a data-driven organization is proving to the team, directors, managers and board that \u201clistening\u201d to the data, using it and understanding it is way better than using our feelings. In other words, they need to know that this will work, and that informed decisions are made only after a whole analysis and Data Science Cycle is concluded.", "I would love to hear what you have to say about this, and share your thoughts on the subject.", "Thanks for reading this. I hope you found something interesting here :)", "If you have questions just add me in twitter", "Your home for data science.
