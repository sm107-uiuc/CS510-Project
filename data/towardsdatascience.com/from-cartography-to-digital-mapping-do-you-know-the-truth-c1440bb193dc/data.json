Especially cultural institutions like art galleries, museums, libraries and archives faced criticism to make accessible their objects through the digital medium. These institutions can turn the current pandemic crisis into an opportunity to change. Adaptation will allow for sustainable ways to conserve, present and consume heritage for everyone anywhere, catering to a contemporary audience that \u201cexpects both stability and flexibility\u201d [1].", "What else does a contemporary audience expect? The ways in which exhibitions offer heritage consumption, they should also offer ways to study history as a critical tool. Used for reflecting on present challenges the tool can be very handy. There is no limit to the \u2018space\u2019 a digital object can take up, so why not utilise that freedom? [2]", "The Boston Public Library\u2019s Leventhal Map Center is currently curating a year-long online exhibition called \u2018Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception\u2019 [3]. It challenges traditional online displays by offering interactive materials for students. The idea originates from \u2018Persuasive Cartography\u2019 \u2014 the history of how maps and visual data manipulate reality for subjective agendas [3]. If you think you\u2019ve never heard of this, trust me, you\u2019ve seen it. How about national propaganda and political campaign maps, advertisements, or statistical graphs on the news?", "Garret Dash Nelson, Leventhal Center\u2019s map curator, explains the exhibition guides the viewer on how to become a responsible map reader [4]:", "\u201cEvery map is infused with its maker\u2019s decisions, which ultimately present a pattern, story or argument.\u201d", "He\u2019s not only referring to medieval maps of Prussia or the WWII Japanese Empire, but highlighting how persuasive cartography\u2019s history is relevant \u201cin an age of abundant data and digital tools\u201d [4]. We might think \u2018modern\u2019 tools bring objectivity and accuracy, but the relationship of data to truth remains ambiguous \u2014 be it on paper or digital.", "\u201cHow can you tell what\u2019s real, and what\u2019s a distortion?\u201d asks Garret [4].", "The exhibition's interactive format takes you through three sections: Why Persuade?, How The Lines Get Bent, and The Power to Make Belief. There are photos, descriptions, explanations, immersive content, mini-tours and much more. It forces us to ask who made these maps, what meanings motivations and persuasions they hold, and how do they \u2018bend\u2019 reality?", "The first section draws scrutiny towards the intent behind someone creating a map, such as patriotism for nationalist and imperialist maps. For example, \u2018The Ever-Threatening Octopus\u2019 is a widely recognised 17th-century map of the Russo-Turkish War using the visual motif of an octopus to represent and exaggerate threat.", "The second section dives into the many techniques to classify and quantify data, including representational choices to communicate and symbolise information. As part of this, Garret explains they commissioned a project called Same Data, Different Stories to show how the same set of data can produce different visual results.", "One example came from Massachusetts\u2019 geographical data across categories of environment, infrastructure and demographics. From this, cartographers were asked to make a pair of maps with opposing conclusions. Maggie Owens, an analyst, created a map pair showing toxic hazards across the state. One visual map argued cities are most affected by pollution whereas the other showed rural areas are.", "\u201cWe\u2019d like to think that numbers speak for themselves, but whenever we\u2019re using data there\u2019s a crucial role for the interpreter, and the way people make those maps can really affect the assumptions they\u2019ve brought into the assignment,\u201d says Garret [4].", "The last section is about the relationship between truth and power; and how it\u2019s represented visually, touching upon themes including race, language, and territory. Ending with special educational activities, it leaves younger students asking for more.", "In a time of endless information, or an \u201cinfodemic,\u201d it\u2019s crucial to learn which visual representations of data are trustworthy [5]. In the news, when you see electoral maps or statistics about Covid-19, they\u2019re subject to biases. Given the pandemic context, Bending Lines has a larger objective as explained by Garret [4]:", "\u201cWe also wanted to think about this as a way to promote data literacy, which is a critical attitude towards media and data visualisations, to bring together this long history of how maps produce our sense of reality.\u201d", "Garret is right. While \u201cthe web is crawling with numerous sophisticated visualisation projects\u201d [6]; and seeing how misinformation spreads like a beehive explosion [7], we need to learn how to become responsible data readers. One of the major drawbacks of visual data and maps is disproportional reductionism. Numbers, lines, points, shapes and colours claim to represent objects and their relations \u201cregardless of whether these are people, their social relations, stock prices, income of nations, unemployment statistics, or anything else\u201d [6].", "On the web and in the news, Covid-19 maps tend to emphasise on some factors while hiding others. For instance, they normally show only confirmed cases and not all cases. This means while claiming to show a country\u2019s state of outbreak, they\u2019re actually representing the country\u2019s scale and level of testing for the disease [8].", "Without contextualising visual data within things like geography, socio-demographics, cultural aspects and political decisions, misinformation continues to spread [5].", "Why does misinformation continue to spread by visual maps? They possess a certain power by enabling people\u2019s trust in them and tendency to \u2018naively\u2019 accept them as true [5]. Visual language is largely linked to the paradigm of scientific objectivity. As a viewer, we tend to forget that the data we see is never free from context, interpretation or explanation [9].", "\u201cData is often communicated in visualisations that are crafted to tell a specific story, and context is often lost in the process of simplifying data; similarly data is often touted as objective, inherently factual information, untouched by human interference\u201d [9].", "Visual data is subjected by where it\u2019s situated, like every act of communication. So, Covid-19 maps and graphs we see every day aren\u2019t the \u2018objective\u2019 representations they claim to be. We associate them with \u201clogical arguments and scientific enlightenment\u201d [7] while forgetting their social, cultural and political context.", "Bending Lines is a powerful exhibition, both in its format and content. It tries and utilises digital freedom in new ways to exhibit history interactively, while allowing the viewer to engage and reflect on history from a critical lens. We learn to spot what is and isn\u2019t trustworthy data in a time when \u2018truth\u2019 is more distant than ever.", "[3] Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception. www.leventhalmap.org, https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/.
