The idea is pretty simple: transform the input through a series of hidden layers but ensure that the final output layer is the same dimension as the input layer. However, the intervening hidden layers have progressively smaller number of nodes (and hence, reduce the dimension of the input matrix). If the output matches or encodes the input closely, then the nodes of the smallest hidden layer can be taken as a valid dimension reduced data set.", "A variational autoencoder (VAE) resembles a classical autoencoder and is a neural network consisting of an encoder, a decoder and a loss function. They let us design complex generative models of data, and fit them to large data sets.", "After reading an article on using convolutional networks and autoencoders to provide insights into user churn. I decided to implement VAE to a telecom churn data set that can be downloaded from IBM Sample Data Sets. It is a bit of overkill to apply VAE to a relative small data set like this, but for the sake of learning VAE, I am going to do it anyway.", "Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer\u2019s attributes described on the column Metadata.", "The data set includes the following information:", "TotalCharges should be converted to numeric.", "Most features in the data set are categorical.
