Part 2 describes the technical setup and data collection. Part 3 is about how to train the Pigeon Recognition Model and run it on Raspberry Pi.", "Imagine a beautiful summer morning. The sun is shining through the leaves, the birds are singing happy songs, and everything is full of cheerful colors. You make your first cup of coffee and step on the balcony to enjoy the peace and harmony that only Sunday mornings can provide. Suddenly something disrupts you from the contemplation of the beauty of terrestrial life. In my world, it is the pigeon poop that I find on my balcony almost every day. I am a busy woman. I like enjoying my morning coffee in peace, but what I do not like \u2014 to clean the balcony from pigeon\u2019s feces.", "This morning I decided to start a war against the pigeons and Artificial Intelligence is the right weapon for this.", "Now I set the emotional part aside and jump straight to the business of engineering, wiring, modeling, and soldering.", "Pigeons regularly visit my balcony and left certain traces there. I want to get rid of pigeons without harming them, but by delivering a clear message that they are not welcomed here.", "I have built a Pigeon Avoidance System that detects pigeons and shoos them away. The initial hardware setup includes:", "The overall solution works in the following way. Whenever a pigeon lands on the balcony, the motion sensor detects a light change. It triggers the Main Pipeline, which in return activates the camera. The camera takes a picture and stores it on the Raspberry. The Main Pipeline sends the picture to the Pigeon Recognition Model that calculates the probability of a pigeon being on the picture and returns back the class. If a pigeon was detected, the Main Pipeline activates the stepping motor that shoos pigeon away by lifting up a stick with ribbons. Sounds pretty straightforward, though effective.", "There is one element on the architecture diagram that hasn\u2019t been explained so far, the Pigeon Tinder. That is exactly the moment when people usually raising their eyebrows asking: \u201cWhat the hell is the Pigeon Tinder?\u201d Pigeon Tinder is an essential part of the overall solution. Apparently, in order to train the Pigeon Recognition Model, I need to feed labeled data into it. Pigeon Tinder is a web app hosted on the Raspberry that helps me to manually label the images. Initially, I wanted to implement a mobile app where the left swipe would label the picture as \u201cNot a Pigeon\u201d and the right swipe as \u201cPigeon\u201d. However, shortly I realized that first, mobile app development is a bit of overkill for the Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Second, in reality, I need three classes, as whenever I drink coffee on the balcony I would produce a lot of motion and the Raspberry would go off by making hundreds of pictures and then trying to classify them. Therefore I introduced a class \u201cHuman\u201d that causes a two minutes delay before the next picture is taken. My main hope is that pigeons are not impudent enough to get on the balcony while I am already there. Because of these reasons, I settled for a web app running on Apache HTTP Server installed on the Raspberry. That how the interface of the Pigeon Tinder looks like.", "As I prefer to tinder pigeons on my phone, the web page is adapted for mobile usage. The app is very simple. Whenever I assign a label to the image, it moves the picture into one of the folders: \u201cpigeon\u201d, \u201chuman\u201d, or \u201cnothing\u201d. That is also a proper directory structure for future training. The Delete button temporarily moves the picture into a \u201ctrash\u201d folder that is regularly emptied by the clean_directories.py script that is run by a cron job every night.", "By the way, all code, including training routine, inference, Pigeon Tinder, and Raspberry automation is available on GitHub.", "Even though I didn\u2019t go for the original idea of the mobile app, I still kept the original name of the labeling module. I hope Tinder will not sue me for this, otherwise you will hear about me in the news.", "I am documenting this project in a few articles under the name \u201cPigeon Avoidance System\u201d. Part 2: \u201cHow to set up data collection for the pigeon avoidance system\u201d will explain how to access external Raspberry components like camera, motion sensor, and stepping engine. It will also provide details about the data collection and how to set up the overall system on the balcony. The Deep Learning part is described in: \u201cHow to use Deep Learning to shoo the pigeons from the balcony\u201d. However, I would recommend reading the article about the data collection first. So stay updated and in the meantime, a sneak peek for Part 2: me soldering cables in my kitchen. I indeed need a lot of cables for this project.", "If you got any questions about this project, please feel free to reach me via LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
