Well, it\u2019s the best show if you love basketball. The Emmy Award-winning program follows the pre-game and post-game analysis of some of the NBA\u2019s biggest games of the year. Hosted by Ernie Johnson, the show covers a variety of NBA topics including the critical analysis of the other studio analysts: former NBA champions Shaquille \u201cShaq\u201d O\u2019Neal and Kenny \u201cThe Jet\u201d Smith. Oh, and some guy named Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Barkley. What makes this show so compelling for basketball fans is the chemistry between the analysts. The show consists of 70% basketball talk, 25% talking non-sense (mostly trash talk) and 5% is simply Ernie trying to get everyone to stay on topic. One second the crew will be talking about Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, then switch over to talking about how often you should fill up your gas tank. Seriously, they spent over 2 minutes talking about that!", "One of the ongoing topics the Inside the NBA crew bring up constantly is the debate of old school vs new school. Shaq, Kenny, and Chuck will go on for days talking about how NBA players of their era were better and tougher, as well as more competitive. Now, I\u2019m going to test that debate with some data visualization. What better way to settle this debate with some Python! Okay, it might not sound like much fun, but I\u2019ll try to make this analysis worth the time.", "To conduct this analysis, I will focus on a more specific set of players by only looking at the 3 best NBA draft classes (not debatable): 1984, 1996, and 2003. Why? Well, they each have some of the greatest players of all time. 1984 has Hakeem Abdul Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and of course, Michael \u201cGOAT\u201d Jordan (debatable? Maybe). 1996 has Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, and Kobe Bryant. 2003 has Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, and LeBron \u201cLABron\u201d James (yes, I\u2019m a Lakers fan). Aside from being the best draft classes ever, these draft classes each represent different era\u2019s of the NBA.", "The data for the analysis comes from Basketball Reference. Basketball Reference provides stats for fans and analysts from their website, which means all stats are official. It also includes the fact that the Golden State Warriors blew a 3\u20131 lead to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals. But that discussion is for another time.", "NOTE: All code used for this post can be found on GitHub, organized on this notebook.", "We start our analysis by organizing the data.", "The first data set has all NBA player stats from the past 68 years, starting with the 1949\u201350 season and ending with the 2016\u201317 season.", "Right away, there is a lot of data that will not be used. The analysis will focus on players from the 1980s and beyond. Therefore, I will only include player stats from that time period.", "There are different types of players during an NBA season. There are All Star caliber players, role players, and bench warmers. The latter is not really that important (unless you have Robert Sacre on your team). For this analysis, I want to focus on players that had some sort of impact. Therefore, I will include players that played at least 20 minutes per game during the NBA season. To do this, I need to create a new column for minutes per game (MPG).", "Another aspect that I will need to exclude from our analysis is season totals. Whenever a player plays for 2 or more teams during an NBA season via trade or buyouts, a new row is added to show the players season totals. For example, in 2013 Jonathan Clay Redick, also known as J.J. Redick (you probably had no idea his name was Jonathan), was traded from the Orlando Magic to the Milwaukee Bucks right before the trade deadline. Therefore, the data shows multiple entries for the same seasons (including a totals entry).", "I will remove these rows since we will be grouping the stats by player later in the analysis. Also, I will remove a special character that is included on some player names.", "The second data set consists of player information, including the time period in which the player played in the NBA. For the analysis, I will include every player drafted in 1984, 1996, and 2003. Here, I chose the draft year by including each player\u2019s rookie year. For example, Michael Jordan was drafted in 1984, but the data has his rookie year noted as 1985.", "For the last part of the data cleaning process, I will create a new data table that includes some of the stats we will be analyzing. Since I will be comparing career stats of NBA players by draft class, I will group the stats by draft class.", "How do we determine which draft class is the best? It\u2019s easy to simply compare the career points, rebounds, and assists totals of players from each draft. Does that actually tell us that players from a certain draft class is better than the others? Probably not. To analyze the draft classes, I want to use stats that take into consideration other aspects of the game. These are the 3 best stats for the analysis: Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Value Over Replacement Player (VORP), and Win Shares Per 48 Minutes (WS/48).", "PER is a stat created by John Hollinger that takes into account accomplishments, such as field goals, free throws, 3-pointers, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals, and negative results, such as missed shots, turnovers and personal fouls. As stated in the name, this stat rates how effective a player\u2019s impact is on the floor. Just to put this into perspective, Michael Jordan and Lebron James are the career leaders in PER. So, it\u2019s a solid indicator for this analysis.", "VORP is a box score estimate of the points per 100 team possessions that a player contributed above a replacement level player, translated to an average team and prorated to an 82-game season. It is equivalent to WAR in baseball, where it indicates a players total contribution to their team.", "WS/48 is a stat that simplifies the number of win shares a player produces every 48 minutes (equal to 1 NBA game). Like VORP, win shares calculates the overall contribution of a player to a team\u2019s win. Since every player does not play the same amount of minutes, WS/48 adjusts the stat to help compare among players.", "Okay, Shaq, Kenny, and Charles could have a point when they say players from back in the day are better. Although my analysis shows that the draft class of 1984 was better in PER, VORP, and WS/48, there are some issues. First, some rules that are currently set forth in today\u2019s NBA didn\u2019t exist back in the day. For example, the three-point foul, clear path foul, and defensive 3 second rule were all not part of the NBA in the early 1990s. Each one of these rules lead to extra free throws, which can increase or decrease your PER (depending if the free throw is made).", "Should I have brought these issues up before doing my analysis? Maybe. Yet, this justifies my whole point of this analysis: let\u2019s stop comparing generations and enjoy the show! All these generations are different and that\u2019s the best part about basketball. Magic and Bird were different. Jordan was different. Lebron is different. Steph Curry is different. Basketball shouldn\u2019t focus too much on the past, but more on what\u2019s ahead.", "Your home for data science.
