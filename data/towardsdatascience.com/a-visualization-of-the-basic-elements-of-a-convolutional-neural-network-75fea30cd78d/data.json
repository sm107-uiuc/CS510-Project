In this article, we will go through the basic elements of a convolutional neural network using visual aids. The article begins with providing a template (visually) for a basic CNN with different building blocks and then discusses the most commonly used elements for each of the building blocks.", "A basic CNN consists of three kinds of layers. Input, hidden, and output as shown below. The data gets into the CNN through the input layer and passes through various hidden layers before getting to the output layer. The output layer is the prediction of the network. The output of the network is compared to the actual labels in terms of loss or error. For the network to learn, the partial derivatives of this loss w.r.t the trainable weights are calculated and the weights are updated through one of the various methods using back-propagation.", "The complete visual template for a basic CNN can be seen below.", "The hidden layers in the network provide a basic building block to transform the data (input layer or the output of the previously hidden layer). Most of the commonly used hidden layers (not all) follow a pattern. It begins with applying a function to its input, moving onto pooling, normalization, and finally applying the activation before it can be fed as input to the next layer. Thus, each layer can be decomposed into the following 4 sub-functions", "We will go through each of the sub-functions explaining their most common examples.", "There are much more complex CNN architectures out there which have various other layers and rather complex architecture. Not all the CNN architectures follow this template.", "The most commonly used layer functions are the fully connected, convolutional, and transposed convolutional (wrongfully known as deconvolutional) layers.", "These layers consist of linear functions between the input and the output. For i input nodes and j output nodes, the trainable weights are wij and bj. The figure on the left illustrates how a fully connected layer between 3 input and 2 output nodes work.", "These layers are applied to 2D (and 3D) input feature maps. The trainable weights are a 2D (or 3D) kernel/filter that moves across the input feature map, generating dot products with the overlapping region of the input feature map. Following are the 3 parameters used to define a convolutional layer", "The 4 figures below visually explain the convolutional layer on an input of size (i) 5x5 for a kernel size (k) of 3x3 and varying strides (s) and padding (p)", "The stride and padding along with the input feature map control the size of the output feature map. The output size is given by", "Usually used to increase the size of the output feature map (Upsampling). The idea behind the transposed convolutional layer is to undo (not exactly) the convolutional layer. Just as the convolutional layer, it is also defined by the stride length and the padding. If we apply the provided stride and padding on the output and apply the convolutional kernel of the provided size, it will generate the input.", "To generate the output, two things are carried out", "The 4 figures below visually explain the transposed convolutional layer on an input of varying size (i), for a kernel size (k) of 3x3 and varying strides (s) and padding (p) while the output (o) is fixed to 5x5", "In-depth details on transposed convolutional layers can be found below", "The most commonly used poolings are Max, average pooling, and max average unpooling.", "A non-trainable layer is used to decrease the spatial size of the input layer based on selecting the maximum/average value in a receptive field defined by the kernel. A kernel is slid across the input feature map with a given stride. For each position, the maximum/average value of the part of the input feature map overlapping the kernel is the corresponding output pixel.", "A non-trainable layer is used to increase the spatial size of the input layer based on placing the input pixel at a certain index in the receptive field of the output defined by the kernel. For an unpooling layer, there needs to be a corresponding pooling layer earlier in the network. The index of maximum/average value from the corresponding pooling layer is saved and used in the unpooling layer. In the unpooling layer, each input pixel is placed in the output at the index where the maximum/average occurred in the pooling layer while the other pixels are set to zero", "Normalization is usually used just before the activation functions to limit the unbounded activation from increasing the output layer values too high. There are two types of normalization techniques usually used", "LRN is a non-trainable layer that square-normalizes the pixel values in a feature map within a local neighborhood. There are two types of LRN based on the neighborhood defined Inter-channel and Intra-channel and can be seen in the figure below.", "BN, on the other hand, is a trainable approach to normalizing the data. In batch normalization, the output of hidden neurons is processed in the following manner before being fed to the activation function.", "2. Introduce two trainable parameters (Gamma: scale_variable and Beta: shift_variable) to scale and shift the normalized mini-batch output", "3. Feed this scaled and shifted normalized mini-batch to the activation function.", "A summary of the two normalization techniques can be seen below", "A detailed article on these normalization techniques can be found here", "The main purpose of activation functions is to introduce non-linearity so CNN can efficiently map non-linear complex mapping between the input and output. Multiple activation functions are available and used based on the underlying requirements.", "The gif below visually explains the nature of the most commonly used activation functions.", "The most commonly used activation function is ReLU. Bounded activation functions such as tanh and sigmoid suffer from the problem of vanishing gradient when it comes to deeper neural networks, and is normally avoided.", "Once you have defined your CNN, a loss function needs to be picked that quantifies how far off the CNN prediction is from the actual labels. This loss is then used in the gradient descent method to train the network variables. Like the activation functions, there are multiple candidates available for loss functions.", "The details on these loss functions can be seen in the plot below", "Backpropagation is not a structural element of the CNN, rather its the methodology through which we learn the underlying problem by updating the weights in the opposite direction of the change in gradient (gradient descent). In-depth detail on different gradient descent algorithms can be found here.", "In this article, animated visualizations of different elements of a basic CNN have been presented which will help understand their functions better.", "Compact cheat sheets for this topic and many other important topics in Machine Learning can be found in the link below", "If this article was helpful to you, feel free to clap, share and respond to it.
