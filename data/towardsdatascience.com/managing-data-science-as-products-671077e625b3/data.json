However, it does not mean data scientists have it easy. With the October 2019 Report from MIT Sloan and Boston Consulting Group citing \u201cseven out of ten companies report minimal or no impact from AI so far\u201d, data science teams are under tremendous pressure to overcome these hurdles and demonstrate impact.", "In the 2017 Kaggle State of Data Science and Machine Learning Survey, 16,000 respondents identified the 7 biggest barriers for data scientists at work as:", "Aside from dirty data, all of the hurdles faced by data science teams relate to organizational and stakeholder management issues.", "No amount of Python or R code will solve such challenges. Instead, data science teams need to immediately employ product management practices to engage stakeholders effectively and demonstrate their value to the organization. Below are some simple steps Data Science teams can put into practice", "Every process or methodology for data science or software development requires an understanding of stakeholders requirements. With today\u2019s quantum speed of change in the business landscape, data science teams must extend beyond taking requirements and become thought partners for the business.", "By employing Harvard Business School Professor, Clayton Christensen\u2019s \u201cjob to be done\u201d framework, data science teams can gain a better understanding of the full business application. This starts by learning from stakeholders what is the situation they are in, what is motivating their needs, and ultimately, what they want to accomplish and what their desired (and measurable) outcomes are. Such understanding can be reached via discovery conversations and potentially utilizing other user research methods.", "As an example, a B2B sales or marketing team may ask a data science team to create a lead scoring model to identify top leads based on the firmographic, demographic and behavioral data the company captures. For many data science teams, this would be an ideal request as there is a clear business use case and it is a project that could be executed on with measurable outcomes (quantity of leads, lead conversion, lift, etc.) However, after conducting stakeholder interviews, the data science team may learn that the business really wants to expand margin this year.", "Though a lead scoring model could achieve higher margins through better pipeline conversion, there may be other strategies the firm could utilize, such as optimizing pricing. By acknowledging what the business objectives are, data science teams can become true partners by providing valuable insight to their organization and suggest alternative solutions that are of higher value, yet require lower costs and still achieve the intended goals.", "By putting on the strategic lens that product managers have in understanding customer challenges, data science teams can become a lot more effective at the organizational engagement challenges that the Kaggle survey respondents highlighted, such as overcoming lack of organization support, adoption and understanding.", "Once data science teams have a better understanding of their stakeholders\u2019 needs, they can start applying Agile methodologies to managing data science as data products. Defining data products is less about the building the best machine learning model, and more about defining how the model will be used. By utilizing the \u201cjob to be done\u201d framework and becoming thought partners to the business, data science teams can begin to develop a strong vision for what data product(s) needs to be built.", "Data products can materialize as algorithmic features of a website, an interactive dashboard, or other analytics-driven solutions. For example, data products on eCommerce sites may include product recommendations carousel on a product detail page, an up-sell banner on a checkout page, personalized offer recommendations, etc. Behind each data product could be different iterations of models or analytics that the data science team will continue to improve over time.", "Once a vision of what needs to be built has been established, the next question is how do you maintain that engagement with the business or product teams and make sure you demonstrate value continuously as you move into development? This is where Agile development is key.", "Agile development focuses on iterative development and adapting to changing requirements and solutions as well as following the principles of the Agile Manifesto. There is a tremendous amount of resources available on Agile Methodology and it will not be covered in this article. However, as it applies to data products, there are 4 key things data science teams must value to be Agile:", "Many values of the Agile Manifesto are highly applicable when it comes to data science. Interactions and communication between business, data science, technology, etc. as individuals is ultimately more important than any standardized tool or process. By understanding the \u201cjob to be done\u201d for business stakeholders, and being thoughtful partners to other internal teams is extremely crucial to successfully developing data products.", "Aside from business stakeholders, data scientists must also engage and communicate with data engineers, product managers, DevOps, MLOps and other stakeholders to form relationships with their peers and understand what is required to accomplish their objectives. By developing relationships across the organization, data scientists will have a bigger picture view on all the tasks needed to operationalize and deploy their models.", "Once a data scientist understands the requirements, their mandate is usually to develop the best possible model. For traditional machine learning models used for prediction, this usually means engineering a broad and diverse set of model features, collecting, cleansing and aggregating the data, then training and validating the model in hopes of a highly predictive model.", "However, this process is extremely time intensive and sometimes business stakeholders don\u2019t see any results of model performance until months have passed. In situations where the models need to be deployed in real-time by the technology team, it may turn out the features may be extremely costly to compute in real-time.", "Instead, data science teams can employ an iterative design approach. In practical terms, this means first working with the business and technology teams to decide on a subset of model features to utilize. Especially in cases where there has been no model developed, it\u2019s more important that a Minimal Viable Data Product be released faster than it is to try to improve R\u00b2 by a few points.", "This iterative mentality can be applied when there is not enough data to properly train a model. Don\u2019t be blocked by lack of data. Instead, do a simple analysis with the data available and start influencing the thinking of stakeholders with those insights. Afterwards, it\u2019s much easier to build on top of that and communicate that sometimes machine learning models require more data before their value can truly be realized.", "As highlighted in the first section of the article, the largest hurdles for data science teams can largely be overcome with better stakeholder collaboration. And as discussed, the solution to this includes:", "One additional challenge for data science teams must help overcome is when ownership of data becomes office politics. Sometimes different teams will view their ability to control \u201ctheir data\u201d as their source of power. Unfortunately, this type of mentality when shared by multiple business, data science, analytics and technology teams results in data hoarding. This creates silos of data and limits the data science team\u2019s ability to develop great models. The end result are data science or AI projects that have created no value. The only way to overcome such a situation is to make sure all the stakeholders are aligned and are collaborating from Day 1, and that senior sponsors are collectively behind the success of the data products being developed.", "Being able to reach across the aisle and align stakeholder needs sometimes also means data scientists need to step into roles when their stakeholders may be lacking certain skills. Sometimes this means training business stakeholders on data science basics, creating visualizations to demonstrate insights from models, prototyping predictive model endpoints that other engineering teams can consume, etc.", "In summary, collaboration means breakdown hurdles, doing whatever is necessary to unblock a project, and empathizing and working with all stakeholders to deliver a successful product.", "The pace of change is ever increasing in the business and competitive landscape. If your company is already a laggard in utilizing data and machine learning as a means to compete, it is even more important that the data science team be able to respond to change instead of following a plan.", "Let\u2019s go back to our prior example where the data science team recommended implementing a pricing optimization algorithm to help the business achieve higher margins.", "Assume the data science team finished developing a model and they were two weeks away from deploying it with the engineering team. However, based on recent shifts in the market, the Executive team was going to change strategy by moving into a broader market with more affordable products at lower prices.", "Should this data science team go ahead with the release, knowing that the model they developed tends to increase pricing? No! Unfortunately, some companies may move ahead because in their view, \u201cthe ship has sailed.\u201d However, a data science team that is truly a partner for the business will be transparent about their findings, and be able to ask for more time to assess how best to respond.", "If it turns out pricing optimization is no longer a viable route, through the earlier ideation and consultation process, the data science team should already have a portfolio of other data products that could be deployed. By following an iterative design and Minimal Viable Data Product release mentality, they would lose less time and be able to utilize the same process to quickly release a different data product.", "Changing process and culture is never simple or quick. However, there are three product management practices that the data science team can do right away:", "Richard Sheng is the Global Director of Data Science & Analytics at Z-Tech, part of Anheuser-Busch InBev, bringing data-driven technology solutions to small businesses around the world.
