Experiments are excel at improving internal validity, separating causation from correlation, and generating and testing hypotheses.", "There is a psychological trap that often trips Data Scientists over: they choose the most familiar method rather than picking the one that best answers the question.", "\u201cIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d", "To err on the side of caution, I elaborate on the pitfalls of experiments in today\u2019s post. While adopting the method, Data Scientists should look at the research question first and then check the method\u2019s applicability and limitations. That is, check what you want to answer and check what information and constraints you have.", "If one or more of these three scenarios happens, you may want to think twice about experiments:", "The whole point of adopting an experiment lies in its high internal validity, which originates from a randomization process (My explanation). That is, study participants are randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups.", "However, a high non-compliance or dropout rate suggests a problematic design and vitiates the research credibility.", "Here is a hypothetical scenario. The Data Science and UX teams partner up at Google and try to track user behavioral changes after a search algorithm update. A user named John was selected to be exposed to the new design, but he dropped out in the middle of the study. e.g., users churn out after empty their cookies after a while. Researchers scrambled to find a replacement with similar user attributes as John\u2019s. However, the replacement is not John, and user replacement in the middle of an experiment poses challenges to statistical assumptions (e.g., missing data, dependency).", "Besides, cross-contamination across experimental groups creates biased estimates. John may unintentionally expose the treatment condition to the control group (e.g., updating his Facebook status and letting his friends know about the research).", "The experimental environment is not the real world, and users alter their behaviors once they realize they are being watched. There is a gap between these two worlds, and researchers should narrow the gap and identify the scope and limitations of their designs.", "In Social Sciences, there is a phenomenon called Social Desirability. That is, people express themselves and behave in a socially acceptable and avoid confrontations, if possible. Everyone wants to be a part of a community.", "As a doctoral student in Politics, this is my favorite real-life example. In the 2016 Presidential elections, multiple waves of poll studies indicated Hilary would win by a big margin. It was a huge surprise when the final result came out. A lot of survey respondents hid their true political preferences and gave socially desirable responses.", "Besides, experimental findings in one region do not hold in other locations. European users have different cognitive and behavioral patterns than their American counterparts. Any experimental results from European users should be taken with a grain of salt while applying to the American case.", "In other words, what is the scope of your research applicability? Does your research have a high/low external validity? Please be extra cautious when you try to generalize to a broader scope of cases while the experimental case is unique.", "Some experiments cause stress and harm to research participants. For example, researchers once manipulated social media feeds with positive and negative emotions, trying to see how human emotions spread out in a virtual environment.", "Under such a scenario, researchers should inform study participants about any potential risks and harms. The study should not continue until users give explicit consent to participate.", "The tradeoff is users may behave in an unexpected way if they know they are participating in a study. Also, there may be fundamentally different attributes between the study participants and non-participants. Both scenarios create biased estimates to our results.", "Please find me on LinkedIn and Twitter.", "Also, check my other posts on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.", "Your home for data science.
