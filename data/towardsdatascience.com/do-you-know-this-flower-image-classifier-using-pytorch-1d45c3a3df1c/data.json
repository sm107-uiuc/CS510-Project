About this I want to recommend this awesome story from Anne Bonner. Anyway the goal of this project was to build an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images to make predictions on the given input. The specific dataset provided by Udacity was about flowers", "The dataset contains images of flowers belonging to 102 different categories. The images were acquired by searching the web and taking pictures. The images have large scale, pose and light variations. In addition, there are categories that have large variations within the category and several very similar categories. More information in this paper by M. Nilsback, A. Zisserman", "The labeling of the images and the mapping between categories name and labels was provided by Udacity in a json file: cat_to_name.json", "Udacity also provided the all dataset in an organized directory tree:", "In each folder there is a folder named after the category label in which we find the images in .jpeg format for that category", "The project is broken down into multiple steps:", "The default network used by the application is torchvision.models.vgg16 which is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper \u201cVery Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition\u201d", "To use this network we have resized the images to 224x224 pixels because the input for cov1 layer is of fixed size 224 x 224 RGB image. Udacity provided guidelines for the development of this project through a Jupyter Notebook so a lot of steps are pretty straightforward. To help the network generalize in order to obtain better performance we will apply transformations such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping", "The pre-trained networks you\u2019ll use were trained on the ImageNet dataset where each color channel was normalized separately. For all three sets you\u2019ll need to normalize the means and standard deviations of the images to what the network expects. For the means, it\u2019s [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and for the standard deviations [0.229, 0.224, 0.225], calculated from the ImageNet images. These values will shift each color channel to be centered at 0 and range from -1 to 1", "Now that we have a pretrained network we have to:", "By default the training is done using the GPU if it is available by checking torch.cuda.is_available()", "torch.cuda adds support for CUDA tensor types, that implement the same function as CPU tensors, but they utilize GPUs for computation.
