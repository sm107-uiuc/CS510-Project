Inflation by definition is the change in prices within an economy over time. While rising prices may seem to be a bad thing, when moderated these price increases are indicative of strong and growing economy.", "Inflation expectations are one of the most important channels whereby monetary policy influences the economic activity. They play a salient role in the process of consumer goods price formation at both producer and retailer levels. Economic agents find it relatively costly to adjust prices often since they have to bear the costs related to promoting and advertising the new prices. Individuals that price a product too high in the short run may see lower sales while those that price a product too low in times of rising input costs may be forced to take on losses, cut profits, or even be forced out of the market.", "This further impacts financial markets as investors must predict how inflation will affect real earnings returns and if companies will be able to maintain profit growth during periods of stagnation. Inflation, in the long run, must either drive up wages or will result in less purchasing power for individuals. Both cases harm corporate profits by either increasing input costs, both labor and capital costs, or by reducing consumer demand as individuals are able to purchases fewer products for the same income level.", "All of these implications affect policy makers, particularly those at central banks who maintain monetary policy. Central bankers work to control inflation and money supply in the economy in order to maintain a structurally sound economy with sustainable growth. If inflation remains too low, the economy will stagnate. If it becomes too high then money begins to rapidly lose value, individuals and businesses lose purchasing power, and the market become riskier for investors. Central bankers and policy makers closely track inflation, in part, in order to set benchmark interest rates. Expectations of these interest rates ultimately set the interest rates businesses and individuals pay for everything from home and business loans to credit card rates.", "Developing a robust forecast of inflation expectations is essential for businesses, financial institutions, policy makers, and even individuals to better make decisions in the marketplace. Whether it is setting the price of a product, determining a repayment scheme for a loan, or deciding how much to save for retirement, a keen understanding of future prices and consumption is vital.", "For data, I use the CPIAUSL series from the FRED-MD database. FRED-MD is a database maintained by the Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis which was \u201cdesigned for the empirical analysis of \u201cbig data.\u201d The data is updated in real-time through the FRED database.", "The CPIAUSL variable represents the all items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. It is a measure of the average monthly change in the price for goods and services paid by urban consumers. The index is calculated by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics based on monthly surveys of product. The index value serves as the basis for calculating the percent change in prices, or inflation, from the same month in the prior year. While this variable is not the most closely followed by the Federal Reserve in setting interest rates, it is one of the most commonly forecasted variables of inflation.", "For this analysis, I forecast the change in the price index over each period and convert this change into an annualized percent change (the percent change from the same month one year prior). From the database documentation, we know the data is already de-seasonalized so we do not need to deconstruct the series to obtain its trend. The series is first differenced to produce stationarity and then structured in a tensor of rolling 18-month periods with a single feature. The rolling average input is similarly structured. After differencing the series the moving averages are calculated and then structured in a tensor of rolling 18-month periods with each of the three moving averages serving as a feature.", "For this analysis, I develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict inflation for each of the next twelve months.", "Convolutional Neural networks are series of deep learning algorithms that were originally designed for the classification of images. The network takes an image, passes that image through a set of filters applying weights to different aspects of the image and ultimately provides a prediction. This works as a feature engineering system whereby, over time, the network \u201clearns\u201d what aspect filters are most important in classifying an image.", "A similar method can be applied to time series. Although a time series does not have \u201cphysical\u201d features in the same way an image does, time series data does contain time dimensional features. If we think of our time series data like an image we can think of the convolutional network like a spotlight, or window, which scans across the time period illuminating the shape of our series in that period and then filtering it to find the feature shape that it most represents. A simple illustration of this model is below:", "The CNN network that I utilize for this analysis is diagramed below. First, we begin with two inputs, the raw inflation time series and three moving average smoothed series. The smoothing series each represent the prior three month, six month, and one year moving averages for any given observation.", "These inputs are then fed into separate convolutional layers to extract the relatively important feature weights of each input series. These results are then pooled and fed into fully connected layers before being merged together and passed to a series of fully connected blocks. Each subsequent block in the stack of fully connected blocks contains fewer nodes than in the previous stack. Between each block a residual, or skip, connection is used allowing the model to use the information learned in earlier layers to continue training the later ones. This prevents the information which was output from the convolutional layer from being too quickly lost or obscured by subsequent layers of the model. This also helps to prevent the vanishing gradients problem and allows for some smaller details from the original series to be maintained further in the model structure. Finally, a dropout is applied to the final layer before outputting the final predictions.", "After differencing the data, I split the dataset into a training and test set (70/30 split). The data is trained on all months up to June 2001 and then predictions are made on for July 2001 through September 2019. I use a one step rolling prediction. For every month in the test set the inflation rate for each of the next twelve months is predicted and then the observed values of inflation are used to predict the next set of twelve months. During this process, however, the model is only retrained every five months over the training period. Predictions are made in a multivariate fashion, predicting each of the subsequent twelve months simultaneously, and validated on every tenth observation in the series.", "This is a fairly realistic approach, as in forecasting the next period of inflation the analyst will have observed rates of all prior periods. By using a one step prediction we maintain this increasing stock of modeling information. In actual situation, however, the analyst would retrain the model each month likely leading to improved predictions as the model is fit to more, and more recent information. This would allow the model to pick up any structural changes in the series that may occur over time.", "The error rates for the model are presented in points of the index value. So if the index is 150 in time T and increases to 154 in time T+1, the model will seek to predict the 4 point increase. If the model predicts a 3 point increase, the error for that time period would be 1.", "As a benchmark to the model I present the error rates over the test period of the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia\u2019s DAR model (their highest performing benchmark for the SPF). The SPF is the longest running forecasting survey of macroeconomic indicators in the United States. The error rates for these benchmarks are calculated from the SPF official error rate documentation.", "Below is a summary of the model results:", "We can see that the multivariate convolutional model far outperforms the Dynamic Autoregressive Regressive model and the survey aggregated forecasts. While there are some differences in how these forecasts are run and thus how the error performs, we can see that the convolutional model outperforms these more traditional methods at every time period. The SPF forecasts are performed on a quarterly basis in the middle of each quarter and are then forecast for the end of current quarter and subsequent quarters rather than on a monthly basis. These can still be compared by treating each quarterly forecast as a three month out forecast and the current quarter forecast as an approximately one month forecast.", "Below, we can see the model\u2019s performance across the full time series. In general, we can see the model fits the data well with some slightly higher error over periods of greater variance or when the trend changes quickly.", "If we look more closely at only the test period, we can see that the model performs well in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis and in the years after the crisis. During the crisis the model performs slightly worse. This is unsurprising, as the 2008 financial crisis was the worst financial downturn since the Great Depression. As such the model has not been trained on any similar data and is unable to perform as accurately.", "From this analysis, there is strong evidence to support the use of convolutional neural networks in the forecasting and prediction of US inflation. This analysis used only a single predictor variable, the history of inflation, in order to predict future inflation rates. It is possible that by adding in additional predictors that model performance may improve. It is also likely that performance would be improved by retraining the model on each month of rolling forecast. This would be the most realistic scenario as analysts would typically re-model their forecasts each month as new data became available.", "Utilizing other machine learning methods, such as Long Short Term Memory networks, may also improve model performance by allowing for an additional modeling of the time component of the data. But this will be the subject of future analysis", "Below is a link to the relevant data sources as well as my GitHub which includes the jupyter notebook used for this analysis. I will continue to update the code and refine the model so results may change slightly.", "Your home for data science.
