This is a typical regression predictive problem, which impacts the performance of the team\u2019s racing and energy strategy.", "Why we use OptimalFlow? You could read another story of its introduction: \u201cAn Omni-ensemble Automated Machine Learning \u2014 OptimalFlow\u201d.", "The number of laps left in the race can define its strategies, i.e. deciding to drive aggressively and expend more battery, or drive conservatively and save energy. The team always knows the car battery\u2019s status.", "Formula E public data, including historical race timing data by lap for every driver and weather data(wind, rain, etc), on its official website: https://results.fiaformula.com", "We will simplify the problem into a goal to predict the total number of laps in a Formula E race. And we will ignore other human intervention factors, like crash possibilities, or safety car\u2019s impact on the race timing, which could influence the variance of features.", "Get the public timing and weather data from https://results.fiaformula.com, and keep their hierarchy, saving them in similarly structured folders. We will extract their folder dictionary as the features about Series Season(i.e. 2017\u20132018), Match Location(i.e. Berlin), Match Type(i.e. FP1), etc.", "Before you feed data to OptimalFlow modules, essential data engineering steps are required. There are 3 types of data: analysis data, weather data, and classification data. For this simplified problem, we can consider the analysis data as the race data, and ignore the classification data. Also, we will include the analysis data from Free Practices, Qualify ing Races, Super Pole, and Races.", "The next challenge is we found the weather data and the race data are separated, which will be hard for us to find impacts relationship between them. So we need to set up a connection by creating a \u2018key\u2019 column/feature.", "To create the join key, we should quickly go through the raw data, but obviously, there\u2019s no race date information, only lap-by-lap timing data there. But we know the weather data and analysis data are all saved in the same folder directory, which means we could use data\u2019s file directory information as the \u2018key\u2019 to merge weather and analysis/race data.", "So combine all weather data to one dataset, and race data appended by year. Meanwhile, saved extract all dataset\u2019s file location information(named it as \u2018file_loc\u2019) individually for further merging with weather data.", "After the previous coding, we will receive yearly contest datasets, and weather integrated dataset.", "Next, we will find common features in all yearly contest datasets, and combine the yearly contests datasets as one integrated dataset, saved it as \u201ccontest_data.csv\u201d.", "Then we need to use the datasets\u2019 file directory information to create the \u2018key\u2019 column to connect integrated weather data and integrated contest data. (Please pardon my wrong spelling with word \u2018weather\u2019 in following codes\u2026)", "Thus, we will get mata dataset for further merging step. And you will have \u201cmatch_key\u201d as the \u201ckey\u201d column I mentioned previously.", "In statistics, exploratory data analysis(EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.", "I prefer to use pandas-profiling library to accelerate this step. But this step just gives us an overall feeling about the integrated datasets, features relationship and understand what features may be relevant to our final prediction goal. So we don\u2019t need to spend too much time in this step, also OptimalFlow\u2019s autoFS(auto feature selection module), and autoPP(auto feature preprocessing module) will help us cover them, in case we miss some insights in the EDA step.", "We need to predict the total number of laps of a race, so the lap-by-lap contest data and time-by-time weather information are not clear and powerful as dependent factors.", "So the better idea should be data aggregation. We don\u2019t know which aggregating approach will highly impact the prediction results, so we could try common calculations, such as mean, median, skewness, STD, etc. , and imply them to both integrated weather data and contest data. Here\u2019s the code example of weather data aggregation:", "Then we will merge contest data with weather data. There\u2019re total 74 features rest in the merged dataset. Each row of records is covering one driver in a specific Formula E event/race, with the aggregated contest and weather features. The output or we usually called \u201cprediction\u201d in our problem is \u201cTotal_Lap_Num\u201d column.", "Data preparation is crucially important for machine learning. As the foundation of further modeling steps, it usually needs both data engineers and data scientists' efforts. The domain experience and familiarity with the data source are the key factors that impact the strategy of how to clean and integrate the raw data.", "In Part 2 of this tutorial, we will use OptimalFlow library to implement Omni-ensemble automated machine learning.", "Ensemble Feature Selection in Machine Learning using OptimalFlow \u2014 Easy Way with Simple Code to Select top Features", "Ensemble Model Selection & Evaluation in Machine Learning using OptimalFlow \u2014 Easy Way with Simple Code to Select the Optimal Model", "Build No-code Automated Machine Learning Model with OptimalFlow Web App", "I am a healthcare & pharmaceutical data scientist and big data Analytics & AI enthusiast.
