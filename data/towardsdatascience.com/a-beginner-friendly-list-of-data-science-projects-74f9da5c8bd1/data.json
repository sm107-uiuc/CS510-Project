They work with a wide range of methods, including applied machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining, and data analysis.", "In the age of big data, data engineers are becoming increasingly important, and there are a number of different types of data scientists in the field of data engineering. They can be considered as a kind of \u201cdata architect\u201d and are responsible for data management, product management, and data visualization. The data a data scientist uses in a big data application often comes from multiple sources and is extracted, stored, transformed, integrated, moved, extracted and integrated in a way that optimizes analytics, business intelligence, and modeling", "Data mining applies algorithms to a complex data set to uncover patterns, which are then used to extract useful and relevant data from the data set. Data science comprises tools from several disciplines to collect and extract meaningful data and to interpret the data sets for decision-making purposes.", "Statistical measurements and predictive analyses are used to extract data to assess whether future events are likely to occur based on what data show and what has happened in the past.", "The automation of the life cycle of data science enables experienced data scientists to focus on the more interesting and innovative aspects of the field. Data science is evolving, and the combination of programming experience \u2014 in models, machine learning, and automation \u2014 keeps the industry agile and innovative.", "Successful data experts today understand that they need to improve their ability to analyze not only data, but also data models, data structures, and data analysis tools", "Project-based learning is one the best methodology to learn something new and it promotes the exchange of ideas and healthy cooperation. You can test hypotheses and ideas by conducting experiments in your own home. More importantly, the first-hand experience offers the opportunity to become active participants, not just observers. Learning from mistakes and helps you to go from newcomer to expert on the subject.", "Project-related learning promotes critical thinking skills that are developed through questioning and research. Some of the greatest minds in history were proponents of project-based learning methods.", "Here are some beginner-friendly list of data science projects;", "The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \u201cVinho Verde\u201d wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).", "These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).", "Project type: Prediction Modeling | Link to the dataset", "This dataset provides a nutrition analysis of every menu item on the US McDonald\u2019s menu, including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, soda, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts.", "Project type: Exploratory Data Analysis | Link to the dataset", "This dataset deals with pollution in the U.S. Pollution in the U.S. has been well documented by the U.S. EPA but it is a pain to download all the data and arrange them in a format that interests data scientists. Hence I gathered four major pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Ozone) for every day from 2000\u20132016", "Project type: Visualization |Link to the dataset", "The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013\u20132016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.", "Project type: Exploratory Data Analysis | Link to the dataset", "This dataset is a list of all the medal winners in the Summer Olympics from 1976 Montreal to 2008 Beijing. It includes each and every medal awarded within the period. This dataset is intended for beginners so that they can get a taste of advanced Excel functions which is perhaps one of the key skills required to be a great data scientist. I too got my hands dirty with the dataset and played with some advanced Excel functions. Further, this dataset can also be used for a predictive model as to which country is likely to fetch the highest number of gold in a particular sports category (just an example), etc.", "Project type: Exploratory Data Analysis | Link to the dataset", "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19).
