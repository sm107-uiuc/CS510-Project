This one is mine and comes at you from a more applied angle. In this post, I\u2019m going to tell you how I prepared and how you can get certified, too.", "My perspective is a little bit different from what I assume to be most exam-takers. I\u2019m already working full-time as a machine learning practitioner and I\u2019m not a student looking for a job, nor am I a self-employed consultant. The exam seems to be mostly promoted at those two categories. I hope therefore that my post will be most useful to those who already have a good foundation in data science or programming.", "So you might be wondering what exactly TensorFlow is and why you ought to care. TensorFlow is a giant in the ML world. It is a Python framework maintained and published by Google. It is meant for Deep Learning and not as a substitute for classical ML libraries such as Sci-kit learn. Since version 2.0, TensorFlow implements the Keras API which basically means that you can interact with TF code like you would with Keras. This is significant, as Keras is much higher-level and much easier for beginners to learn. TensorFlow is a framework particularly popular in industry and for production-level tasks.", "But of course, you already knew all of that. You probably found this post in a google search looking for whether this exam is worth it for you and whether you can take it. And I hear you. There are some perks associated with the exam:", "Furthermore, like all certificates the exam in itself is not an endorsement of skill and neither does it guarantee to open up any more doors for you. There are also no barriers to entry. You could arguably take the exam without prior experience with TensorFlow, though I would not recommend it.", "In order to prepare for the exam I went through the following materials in order:", "The Candidate Handbook (pdf) is the main document you can get information from on the exam. I read it and took notes on anything that seemed interesting. It also links to another pdf that details how to set up your environment. As both files are living documents, I checked back just before I took the exam.", "The TensorFlow in Practice Specialization is essentially the curriculum to the exam. Given by Laurence Moroney, it\u2019s the official introduction to TensorFlow and how to code deep neural networks in TensorFlow. It\u2019s a four course specialization, and each course consists of four weeks. If you\u2019re starting from scratch this means it could take a while for you to work through this.", "However, it can take significantly less time if you\u2019re already experienced and power through it. For me, course 1 to 3 were already part of my job and I could power through them in about four days. I took notes and kept adding to them for each course. Only when I got to the fourth course on time series I slowed down, as I only have limited experience with time series.", "With the specialization done, the last stop was practicing solutions. I chose to do my studying in PyCharm. The exam itself is also administered by a plugin in PyCharm, and you\u2019ll need to download it if you don\u2019t have it. I don\u2019t regularly use PyCharm for my deep learning work but I have some familiarity with it. I figured this was a great way to prepare for any GPU errors and the like. To help me scope the learning process I made a list of things I could work on based on what I had little experience with. Some examples of these included using TensorFlow Datasets, Poetry generating LSTMs, and time series prediction in general. I spent most of my time here, as it took me several weeks of after-work study hours to go through everything.", "As a last step, I set-up my environment to mimic the testing environment to make sure everything would go smoothly. Before the exam I also had a Jupyter notebook server running. While you should be able to do all the work locally in the five hours, you are allowed to use other environments to prototype solutions \u2014 even on the cloud.", "I decided I was ready and I figured setting everything up would probably take an hour or two. I created an account on the exam website and submitted my ID and payment. I downloaded the plug-in, accepted the terms, and made sure my internet would hold up. Everything was set for launch.", "Once I pressed that big [Start Exam] button the timer started counting down. There are a number of problems you need to solve in the five hour time frame and each question is harder than the one before. Some of the latter models are computationally intense, even on a GPU. Whenever I got to the point where I could train a solution, I\u2019d start coding away on the next.", "Eventually, I ran into a CUDA issue that seemed to be due to a mismatch of versions. Mild panic and long epochs ensued. I could update the exam environment but wasn\u2019t sure if that would open me up to more issues. I wasn\u2019t able to solve it in ten minutes time (and didn\u2019t really feel like doing more under pressure) so I let my models train on my CPU. At this point, I was already 2.5 hours in.", "There were also some minor issues such as the plugin not refreshing the screen with the submit button. I had to restart my IDE a few times. It was not terribly bothersome, as fixing issues is more or less part of normal development.", "However, with these minor issues affecting my ability to troubleshoot I switched to the Jupyter instance I had kept running and used that for prototyping. This meant that I could still prototype models there while my PyCharm was powering away with tensors in the background.", "Without giving away too much information, the exam does give a little bit of feedback so you know when your solution to a problem is good enough and you can move on. At around four hours in I felt confident with all of my solutions and got a wee bit complacent. I started to improve a model that did not score perfectly and due to now training on a CPU I spent a while on it. I overwrote my previous model in the process. You might have guessed it- the newer model performed worse and even reduced the previous score. Luckily for me, with about ten minutes left on the clock, I was able to submit another model which performed at the same level as the old one.", "Directly after I submitted the exam I got an e-mail saying that I passed!", "While the grading of the exam was instantaneous, It took a couple of days for the badge to roll in and a week for my name to pop up on the certified directory. I feel like this reflects that it\u2019s probably not an automated process and that they\u2019re still figuring out the best way to go about it.", "This style of examination suited me a lot more than taking a proctored exam. I find doing an exam while someone\u2019s watching you on your laptop nerve wracking. I can\u2019t do it. This was a pleasant experience even though the exam took five hours.", "The fact that TensorFlow now has a certification did motivate me to learn a little bit more about it. I like having goals in mind when I study.", "The expectation is that there\u2019ll be more certifications in the future. I certainly hope so. There are a lot of fun advanced NLP topics they can cover and I feel that there are some elements in the greater TensorFlow ecosystem that would lend themselves well to this style of examination. To be continued, I guess. :)", "Good luck with your own TensorFlow journey and I hope you found this post useful. Let me know if you have any questions below.", "Your home for data science.
