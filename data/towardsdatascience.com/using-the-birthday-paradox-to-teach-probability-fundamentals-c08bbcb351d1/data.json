That\u2019s because it\u2019s an easy playground to get some basics across and most humans probably (heh) already have an intuition for it. Examples: What are the chances your fair coin comes up tails? 1/2. What are the chances you roll a 6 on a six-sided die? 1/6. What\u2019s happening here?", "NUMERATOR: number of ways the event we\u2019re interested in can happen.", "DENOMINATOR: number of ways any (relevant) event can happen.", "On a coin, the possible relevant events are HEADS and TAILS. That\u2019s where the 2 comes from. Easy peasy.", "To work with event-based probability, you need to be able to enumerate events and count them. That\u2019s why your textbook probably drags you through combinatorics till you\u2019re thoroughly sick of it. Combinatorics gives you the math that you need for counting the number of ways events can happen (for that nice NUMERATOR and DENOMINATOR you\u2019re after).", "In the event-based world, all building block events are equally probable so as to lend themselves to basic arithmetic unmolested by layers of messy modifiers. It\u2019s a world where all the coins are fair, all the dice are balanced, all the cards are unscuffed, and all the birthdays are equally likely.", "For the birthday problem, we need to know a quick something about counting:", "\u201cAND\u201d asks you to multiply (x) counts", "\u201cOR\u201d asks you to add (+) counts", "Go look up a proof if you like\u2026 or satisfy yourself with a quick example and move along: If I have 2 options for a vegetarian dish OR 3 options for a meaty dish, then how many meal options do I have? 2 + 3 = 5. What if I can choose a main course AND one of 2 desserts? How many different meals am I choosing from? 5 x 2 = 10.

Just when you were getting the hang of all those combinations and permutations (see illustration above), they\u2019re never heard from again. Instead, suddenly there are distributions everywhere. What\u2019s up with that?", "Consider this question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the probability you need to wait more than 10 minutes for the bus?\u201d This is going to be tricky to count (in nanoseconds?) and a pain because counting events means you can\u2019t work with time as a continuous thing. It gets worse if you have a bus driver who has some probability of stopping for a smoke break that\u2019s dependent on how late the bus is already. How are you going to enumerate that? You\u2019re not. Maybe counting events isn\u2019t your friend here\u2026", "Enter the frequency-based definition, which says something like, \u201cIf this were a random event happening in infinite parallel universes (governed by rules I specify, er, assume), in how many of them would the bus take more than 10 minutes to arrive?\u201d (Parallel universes?! Yeah, no wonder we statisticians have the crazy eyes.)", "And then \u2014 usually much later \u2014 when you hit the subjective definition in your Bayesian stats textbook, you get to make the distributions up based on what you feel is likely. See what kind of twisted stuff you wind up with when we take away your ability to enumerate events? Well, luckily for the birthday problem, if we assume all 366 birthdays are equally likely*, we can stick with counting. Whew!", "*What, you don\u2019t like my assumption?

If you don\u2019t like my assumptions, then you need to come up with a different solution because mine is no good to you. Statistics gets creative because we\u2019re all allowed to make any assumptions we like.

Turns out that it\u2019s mostly a means to an end, since the assumption that all elementary events are equally likely is too amateurish for most pros to stomach\u2026 even for birthdays. Isn\u2019t it funny that when nonexperts think of what we stats folks do all day, they tend to think of card counting and coin tossing? Some rumors are hard to kill!", "A big part of what makes the birthday problem a classic fixture of the statistics undergraduate experience is that it gives you just enough pain to rub a key point in: budding statisticians need to learn how to rephrase problems so their moving parts are easier to handle.
