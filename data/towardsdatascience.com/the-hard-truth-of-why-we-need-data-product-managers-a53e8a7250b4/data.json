Models Will Run the World, with the big winners being those model-driven organizations that build products that collect data and continuously learn to optimize growth, in turn accelerating that cycle. But the underside of that phenomenon is that at the core of any successful model is representative data. While the idea and the end product may be awe-inspiring and great for quarterly OKRs, it requires a lot of un-sexy effort. Just like software, data needs its own frameworks for managing this process in order to achieve successful outcomes \u2014 enter the Data Product Manager.", "The Case for the Data Product Manager", "I like to think of technology solutions as Maya \u2014 Indian philosophy\u2019s term for the synthetic world of facts and events, imposed on the world through abstractions such as measuring, classification, division. The lifecycle of these solutions is its own kind of technological Karma (kind of like tech debt) \u2014 anytime we build a solution, it necessitates further action of quality control, maintenance, extension. The act of forcing technological Maya on the world is inherently anti-equilibrium, creating karmic consequences for the team and customers.", "Under this view, the role of any good product manager is to pick the right problems, match them up with the right solutions, and groom the slopes for the team. Getting to the \u201cgoodness\u201d of models running on representative data is no different: while the upside of a successful model is huge, there is an even larger potential for a black hole of complexity.", "Data is no longer just making reports \u2014 data is becoming its own product domain, with its own deliverables, customers, development lifecycle and infrastructure needs. In order to meet expectations and avoid the chaos of go-it-alone hope-for-the-best analyses, we need product managers to steer these data products from ideation to completion.", "\u201cProduct Management\u201d, even more so in \u201cData\u201d, is nebulous. Let\u2019s define what that is.", "Some organizations distinguish between more strategic & customer-focused \u201cProduct Managers\u201d vs more implementation-focused \u201cProduct Owners.\u201d Thankfully there is a small cottage industry of blogs that disparage this \u201chorizontal\u201d model, because we get a situation where the Product Owner won\u2019t understand the customer, and the Product Manager won\u2019t know what\u2019s technically possible. The end result:", "It\u2019s nice that we tried to establish clear responsibilities, but we ended up with a high stakes game of broken telephone.", "We need product managers who can connect between the business case and the technical details, serving as a partner to both customers and engineers. That means that the Product Manager takes on a larger, end-to-end role, focused on product strategy, prioritization, solutioning and delivery. Naturally, the Product Manager can\u2019t do everything, and that\u2019s where products ops/analysts come in, serving as day-to-day interfaces with customers, sizing up problems for prioritization, and ensuring the smooth delivery of solutions through UAT and rollouts.", "This should make sense for any product team, but even more so for a data product team. Since the data product is basically a model of reality, product managers should be in touch with the reality of the customers, but also capable of fitting a technical solution to that reality. The Data Product Manager should be able to see the technical concept from start to finish, working with front-end product teams to collect useful data, with data engineering on ETL processes, with ML engineering on model development, all the way through to deployment. At this nexus, the Data Product Manager is responsible for the following stages in the data product lifecycle:", "Data products are basically models of reality, and modelling reality is hard. As these models become more prevalent, we need good data product managers to lead this process from the front-lines, and we need to be clear on what that process is. I hope this article has helped clarify what that should entail.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Product Manager @ WeWork.
