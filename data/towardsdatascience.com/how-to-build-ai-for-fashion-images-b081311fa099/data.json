I will focus on footwear however this approach can be applied also on other Apparel. This approach is suitable not only in the Fashion domain. The great news is that this tutorial is code-free!", "There are several reasons: better user experience, increasing click-rate, engagement, revenue \u2026 Here is the big research what is the most important features in fashion retail that should every shop have:", "As you can see, some of the features are purely based on Machine Learning and visual AI. Most of the fashion stores are closed all over the world because of COVID-19 quarantine, so e-commerce is now the most important part of retail. If you are having a fashion shop site then consider adopting some machine learning features. It can help your business too! There\u2019s never been a better time to improve your digital product.", "Most common use cases of visual AI in Fashion:", "Thinking about taxonomy is one of the most important steps! And it is a very tough one!", "Before we start we should define our taxonomy of footwear recognition system-> in other words what kind of labels we would like to recognize. When we are working with shoes, there are thousands of styles with hundreds of different patterns. For example, there are sneakers which are for leisure time and there are sneakers for running. The entire Footwear taxonomy can be complex as we could recognize the style, color, brand, pattern, heel size, \u2026. As we said before, just the style itself can have a lot of options. Always start with something simple!", "Whenever you are working with domains where are thousands of options possible (Fashion, Real Estate, \u2026), be very careful. The problem with Fashion taxonomy is that there is no unified standard. Every shop with Apparel uses different names and categorization. Just look at the ASOS website or urbanoutfitters.com. My advice is don\u2019t invent the wheel. Just look at some of the most famous shops with clothing on how they are doing it and be inspired.", "Style: let\u2019s say that we can recognize the Elegant, Leisure, Sport. If we recognize Elegant then we could divide this category by gender. Most of the time Women elegant shoes look a bit different than Men\u2019s. It is a bit harder to say it in the Leisure category and even harder to say in Sport/Trainers. Most of the women\u2019s elegant shoes could be also recognized by the height of the heel.", "Subcategory: If we recognize elegant footwear then we can say if there are loafers, boots or pumps. If we are talking about Sport then we could divide them into sneakers, running, hiking.", "Color: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Black, White, Orange, \u2026. I would recommend predicting just basic colors. The more colors you introduce the more inconsistent your labels against images are going to be. Labeling products by colors can be tricky! Every picture can be a little bit different on various screens. The new MacBooks has true tone technology adjusting the colors of display to warmer based on your environmental lighting. If you are working in a team, people could see colors a bit differently.", "Brand: Brand in some of the Trainers can be easily recognized. Adidas, Nike, Puma sneakers most of the time contains a large logo or other visual features. It can be much harder in elegant shoes. Maybe elegant footwear from Tommy Hilfiger could be easier because the brand logo is almost always seen even in shoes.", "Putting it all together our simple Footwear taxonomy can be written as hierarchy and solved by hierarchical classification. Hierarchical classification means that we will call multiple models and if we predict some of the labels we could also call another model depends on the predicted label. So for example, if we predict the ELEGANT label then we will call the model for predicting Heels Size. If we predict SPORT label then we could call other models.", "Machine Learning systems are biased about the data they have seen.", "Simply said, Machine Learning is an optimization technique that is trying to learn important knowledge from your data.", "Thinking about that is also another critical step when working with AI/Machine Learning. Is your system will be used only on the product photos: the background is most of the time clear or the photos are taken by professional cameras? Then your dataset should contain similar images.", "If you are working on a mobile app that is going to take footwear pictures with the real background then include this kind of image in your dataset. Obtaining the \u201creal world\u201d pictures can be much harder, however, your product can be more valuable if it can do well on \u201cworse quality\u201d pictures. Should your application work in every possible setting? Then you should have high quality and balanced dataset fo.", "We need to download our data. We can use google or bing search and downloading some data manually from the image page. If you know how to program then you can write a script for downloading images from google or bing. You can use for example scrapy library to crawl images from the shop pages. For non-coders -> There is also a great option to use some Chrome or Firefox plugins for getting images from websites.", "How many images should we download for every label?", "Focus on the iterative approach, 50 images per label is pretty good to start to train your model if you are using transfer learning technique. If the results are not good, then continue with increasing the number of images. The more complex your taxonomy is the more images you will need. Sometimes hundreds of images per label are required.", "Because this is a tutorial for people with no Machine Learning and programming experiences, we are going to create a recognition system with the Ximilar platform. Don\u2019t worry, it is very easy to do it.", "Login to the Ximilar App and then click on the Image Recognition service. Go to the tasks page and Create a new task. Then choose the Categorization task and create and connect labels for the task. Task represents a Machine Learning/Deep Learning model.", "The next step is to train your model. Just click on the TRAIN button.", "In this way, we can create other tasks for color, material, pattern, \u2026", "Connect your Tasks/Models to hierarchy with Flow", "Now we are going to use an innovative feature that allows you to connect machine learning models into taxonomy/hierarchy on a few clicks. From the dashboard go to Flows service and create a new flow. Then create a \u2018List operation\u2019 as the first step. Then add \u2018Branch selector\u2019 on Style recognition task with Heel task. Finally append color, category, gender, and brand tasks into the list.", "Your entire system is deployed behind one easy to use API endpoint with Flows! You can connect your mobile application or website to the API. The final app can look like this:", "Machine Learning is everywhere in retail, helping to increase revenue and improving user experience.", "Check out our DEMO for our Visual Fashion AI system.
