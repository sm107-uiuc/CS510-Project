A giant so big and powerful, that everybody knew the giant. It had a rather peculiar smell, terrible for the environment, but that\u2019s for another story. People loved the giant, obediently working for it all around the world.", "One day, a Fairy came flying to the Giant. The Fairy gave the Giant a pill and said: \u201eThis Machine Learning pill was created by a powerful magician from a land far, far away. It will give you great powers but beware, it will also inflict severe pain on you.\u201c.", "This is the first part of this trilogy about the impact of Machine Learning on the automotive industry. To better illustrate the complexity and challenges of using Machine Learning at established car manufacturers, the main points are complemented by this story about the Giant and a wondrous pill. The insights are based on my experience in working in the automotive industry and long-standing conversations with automotive experts from around the world. The trilogy is divided into the following parts: importance (I), opportunities (II), and challenges (III) of the automotive industry in implementing the transcendent technology of Machine Learning.", "Let\u2019s focus in the first part on why the protagonist of this fairytale is a Giant rather than a turtle or pony. And while the automotive industry might face serious challenges, why should you care? Let\u2019s look at the economic, societal, and future impact of the automotive industry.", "The automotive sector is one of the most important industries in the world. To prove that point, let\u2019s examine two of the four largest contributors to the world GDP, USA and Germany, and the importance of the automotive sector therein.", "The chart below shows the market capitalization of publicly listed companies grouped by industry sector. The market capitalization indicates how valuable the market believes a certain company, or industry, is. It is calculated by multiplying the current stock prices with the number of shares outstanding. For example, the stock of General Motors, a large US car manufacturer, is priced at 36.56$ today on Dec 30, 2019. The company has 1.43B shares outstanding. Thus, the market values General Motors at 36.56$ * 1.43B = 52.28B$.", "If you add up the market capitalization of all companies that operate in the automotive sector in the USA, you get an industry valuation of > 800B$. As the chart above shows, the automotive industry is more important than the airlines or the tobacco industry. The software industry is valued vastly higher than all other sectors. A hint for the future direction of the automotive industry? Still, the graph shows the importance of the automotive sector to the largest economy in the world.", "Next, let\u2019s consider the importance of the automotive industry to the fourth-largest economy of the world, Germany.", "Germany hosts global automotive companies like Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Continental, or Bosch. Their combined market capitalization exceeds 200B\u20ac, slightly edging the chemicals industry for the top spot. The main driver of the German economy is the automobile.", "After understanding the economic impact of the automotive industry, let\u2019s make it more personal and evaluate the societal impact of the automotive industry on worldwide employment.", "According to the International Organization of Vehicle Manufacturers, more than 9 million people are employed by the global automotive industry. Additionally, the automotive industry creates an ecosystem of adjacent businesses. Car dealerships, insurers, or wash shops rely on the continued workings of the automotive industry. If you account for the people who work in car adjacent businesses, more than 50 million people are indirectly employed by the automotive industry. That is 1 in 60 working adults.", "If we compare numbers for Germany, we find a similar distribution. The German Association of the Automotive Industry estimates that more than 800.000 people are directly and almost 2 million people are indirectly employed by the automotive industry. In Germany, the ratio of 1 in 50 adults who rely on the automotive industry is even more extreme.", "After understanding how important the automotive industry is for your or your neighbors\u2019 salary, let\u2019s look at the current state and future predictions for the automotive industry.", "For the past 5 years, global automotive sales have been flat, as reported by Scotia Bank in 2019. The automotive industry has enjoyed tremendous growth since 1990, doubling the number of cars sold within 15 years. Yet, this growth has stagnated and especially demand in wealthy markets has stalled, as shown in the VW sales by region infographic below. Some hope lies in rising demand from emerging markets, like South America, but it is unclear if they can make up for the lack of growth in existing markets. To grow their business and market capitalization, what can automotive companies do?", "On the other hand, global demand for mobility solutions is predicted to skyrocket in the coming decade. Statista estimates that demand for services such as ride-hailing, public transport, or flights will continue to increase. Shared mobility solutions instead of ownership will become more attractive for some customers. Embracing this opportunity, some automotive companies began to rebrand themselves as mobility providers. For example, BMW\u2019s corporate mission is to \u201cshape tomorrow\u2019s INDIVIDUAL PREMIUM MOBILITY\u201d, not to produce cars.", "To recap, currently global automotive sales are stagnating, while demand for mobility is increasing. The automotive industry faces serious challenges in finding opportunities to grow and prosper. Can the Machine Learning pill extend the life of the Giant and help it grow to newfound strength?", "The first part showed you how important the automotive industry is, and why you should care about it. The automotive Giant is all around us and touches many lifes.", "Continue to the next episode (coming Jan 12) to read about the effects of the Machine Learning pill on the Giant. The final part (coming Jan 19) elaborates on the challenges and side effects of implementing Machine Learning across this well-established industry.", "This story was presented at the Data Festival 2019. Find the video of this talk here. If you\u2019d like to hear more about the intersection of Business, Project Management, and Data Science, follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, or Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
