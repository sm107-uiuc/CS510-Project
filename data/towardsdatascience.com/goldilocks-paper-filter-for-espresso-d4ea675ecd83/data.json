While it has definitely shown to improve extraction yield and taste, it could be easy to cut the filter wrong and have a bad experience. I recently paid more attention to the paper filter cut, and I found even small changes in paper filter size made a huge difference. After extensive tests, it is clear that the precision of the paper filter cut impacts the extraction.", "This is the second part of a three part set of experiments I\u2019ve done to examine how paper filters work. The first part went through a few experiments on how water spreads across the filter and affect flow rate. The third part will examine re-using filters and how that impacts performance.", "Typically, I do a staccato tamp technique where I tamp half way through the shot preparation, add more coffee, and tamp again but lighter. I found placing a paper filter in between these two layers improves taste.", "I found the exact size was very important. If your filter is too small, it doesn\u2019t help in interrupting the side channeling. If it is too large, part of the filter will go up the side of the filter making the side channeling worse. So it needs to have a nearly perfect fit so it can force the water, that is coming down the sides faster, into the middle.", "In summary, I found a big difference in extraction with minor changes in cuts as shown in this table, and I\u2019ll go in more detail on the mechanics below. Extraction yield is definitely impacted by these minor changes.", "All of these shots also had a paper filter on the bottom, and I have found for paper filters on the bottom, the main key is that the paper filter covers all the filter holes and does not go up the sides of the filter.", "All of these shots also use an uneven density distribution. I achieved this using a tool to make a concave shape in the grounds, and then when I tamp, the outside ring has a higher density than the middle. This doesn\u2019t resolve all side-channeling, but it improves it. Side-channeling has been worse for my machine because it is a lever machine (Kim Express), and the way the water comes into the puck, it is prone to coffee donuts.", "Because of the staccato tamp and the paper filter, I have a unique opportunity to dissect each puck afterwards for failure analysis. I\u2019ll start with too small, then too large, and finally just right.", "On the top, there is a large channel, but when you flip the top half, it looks and feels pretty even. The fewer the clumps, the better. There aren\u2019t any dark spots that indicate slow flow areas.", "Looking from bottom, there is a donut ridge. The darker regions indicate areas where water flow stopped, and the dissolved coffee stained the paper as well as the puck. The lighter areas are where coffee flowed through more evenly. The aim is for the paper filter to be the same color throughout.", "The middle filter in this case didn\u2019t say much to the way it channeled. If the channeling is throughout the whole puck, the middle filter will also have a ring. The main thing to note is that there is a tiny ring around the puck that the middle filter doesn\u2019t cover.", "The top of the puck had the large channeling mark. When it was flipped over, you can see the grounds have a similar consistency, but there is a dark ring which indicates that the donut channeling went up through the top half of the puck.", "On the bottom, there is a dark ring on the filter and the puck indicating that there was donut channeling.", "The middle filter was larger than the diameter of the filter basket, so it went up the sides of the filter basket.", "My theory is that during pre-infusion, the water is getting to the edge of the paper filter (pushed up on the side) faster than the rest of the puck, and so the paper filter going up the side of the puck accelerates side-channeling.", "After some back and forth, I was able to cut the filter down just right. The top of the puck in the middle got stuck to the shower screen, as is common, but otherwise, the top half was even colored and had few clumps which indicated that it did not suffer from channeling too much.", "The bottom of the puck had few signs of donuting. There is a slight brown haze, but overall, it is clean.", "The middle filter was mostly the same color except for a slightly lighter ring around the outside. Underneath, on the top side of the bottom half (underneath the paper in the middle), the color of the puck is consistent indicating little channeling.", "Here are the bottom filters for comparison as they tell the best story of how the coffee flows.", "If you look at the size difference of the paper filters, it is quite small. I would not have suspected such a small difference would have such a big impact.", "I looked at how precise a paper filter should be cut, and I found a paper filter that better fits the basket performs better. When a filter is too large and pushes up the sides of the basket, it will make side channeling worse. This is true for a middle filter, and it would also be a problem for a bottom filter because the issue is at the filter level or the coffee above.", "These tests also reiterate that the difference between good and bad espresso are minor differences in puck preparation.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
