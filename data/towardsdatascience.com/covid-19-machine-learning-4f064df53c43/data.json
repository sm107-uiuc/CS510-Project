But the below method can easily be generalized as other affecting countries are also having similar challenges as in India.", "In addition, I have made this ML approach by considering the learnings from highly infected and worst-hit countries like Italy, Spain, UK, the USA, and highly successful countries in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic like South Korea; China-Wuhan, Australia, UAE!", "How does the COVID-19 test work: here", "1.2: Then, What should be the testing threshold?", "To find this, we need to see understand the visualization. I have also attached the link to the entire ipython notebook below.", "Clearly, from the above visualization, we can conclude that to control COVID-19 spread, the (test_per_million \u2265 population_per_million * 100) means that a population of 1 million needs at least 100 tests capacity.", "Countries like India, the USA, the UK, Spain, and Italy have not been able to match the above testing criteria and have been still struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, even with testing_per_million > population_per_million.", "1.3: What are the Challenges in increasing the # of testing_per_million for INDIA & other countries? And why is it needed in multiples?", "Why We Don\u2019t Have Enough COVID-19 Tests (detailed): here", "So, if the problem is a Lack of focused Testing!!! Then the solution for the COVID-19 pandemic is nothing but:", "\u201cTest Test Test & then Quarantine\u201d", "But, I had already mentioned that the Challenges in increasing # of Testing are not very trivial, especially when INDIA and other countries, even the USA, UK, Italy, and Iran, also had minimal health resources and have the same problem.", "In Computer Science, there is a prevalent saying: \u201cThe best solutions are the simplest ones!\u201d. We need to increase the # of tests per million in very little time, and here I am proposing my idea/solution to this problem:", "We should prioritize the Testing using the Priority-based Automated Testing System (PbATS) using ML/AI. This helps prioritize the Testing and helps in determining the priority of giving limited healthcare services.", "Using PbATS, we will categorize the population based on their input. Doing this, let\u2019s say we categorize the population into three categories as follows:", "Category 1 (Self-Quarantined): They are either not affected or are still not showing the systems but affected (the false negatives). It mainly contains the unaffected & some of the false-negative cases. Hence, they will need to undergo the PbATS periodically up to a specific duration.", "Category 2 (Test-Priority): This category contains some false-negatives but started showing symptoms and hence need manual Testing", "Category 3 (Healthcare services-Priority): This category consists of highly likely people affected with COVID-19, and hence, they should be strictly Quarantined and have been given priority hospital services.", "Note: This PbATS mechanism will be an AI/ML approach with which we categorize these three categories based on the historical data of all the past COVID-19 patients. And as we all know, that \u201cAll Machine Learning models are wrong and only some are useful\u201d \u2014 Considering this also, my solution contains multiple attempts for category one and category 3, as category two already having manual Testing in place.", "Also, the # of categories and periodicity can be decided accurately with the help of Domain Experts/COVID-19 Experts.", "Now, For the above solution to work, we need robust PbATS. I will now demonstrate a potential approach to building this PbATS using Machine Learning techniques.", "ML Problem formulation: We need to categorize the population based on there, features (age, sex), symptoms, and past travel history.", "Solution workflow: Once this PbATS is ready, each needs to undergo this PbATS by filling their details digitally or via a volunteer (to minimize the errors), and then Doctors can easily prioritize the Testing /Healthcare services and can select whom to Quarantined. Which helps Doctors and GOV to stop COVID-19 with minimal health resources.", "Eventually, This PbATS Mechanism will indirectly help the Government & Healthcare providers to increase the test_per_million according to the population_per_million needed to stop the COVID-19 spread.", "4.1: Data? For this, I have taken the data and scraped the data (using text mining techniques), and concatenated them. Data sources are as follows:", "Here are what the raw data looks like:", "4.3: Then, I did some feature engineering as follows:", "4.5: Natural Language Processing (NLP) on master symptom", "Then, I have performed all the standard NLP techniques for vectorizing the master-symptom. I have used BoW+W2V (Word2Vec-gensim). I am using W2V because I need to cluster the symptoms based on the relationship (not similarity & counts), which helps in the clustering process.", "I have used BoW instead of TF-IDF because Our Dataset does not have many rare, occurring words that need more importance.", "Finally, I have done clustering using KMeans++ (most general purpose). The no of clusters we are getting using the elbow method is also 3 (coincidentally), but it can be changed using much more Domain Knowledge also!", "Final Categories: As you can see from the above word clouds of master-symptoms, We can approximately categorize the prone populations as:", "Category 3 (Healthcare service-Priority): [Age between 30\u201375] + [fever, cough, respiratory, runny nose, sore throat, pneumonia, headache, chest tightness with dpos > 4] + [th-1 active travel histories mainly]", "Category 2 (Test-Priority): [Age between 0\u201375] + [fever, cough, malaise, pneumonia, stiffness, joint, muscular soreness with dpos between 1\u20133] + [th-0/1 active or inactive travel histories]", "Category 1 (Self-Quarantined): [Age between 0\u201375] + [fever, cough, weakness, diarrhea, dizziness, chills with dpos between 1\u20133] + [th-0 mostly inactive travel histories with some active travel histories also]", "learning: As we can see, the symptoms patterns (mixed symptoms) depend on Age, mainly in the case of COVID-19, and gets severe with dpos. My efforts were to detect these patterns only for prioritizing the Testing using PbATS.", "Simply No! The above solution only helps INDIA and other countries to stop COVID-19 spread with limited Healthcare services. And hence helps in the containment of Sars-CoV-2.", "This permanent solution is Vaccines, which require weeks and even months to be ready. This gap can easily field also using ML/AI by finding a vaccine using a combination of existing virus vaccines (Sars-1, Spanish flu), etc., using ML/AI techniques.", "Last, yes, the above approach address limited Healthcare resources problems. Still, Countries like India and others need to have at least 30%-40% of the population per million Healthcare resources (Beds/Ventilators) for category 3.", "This blog is my small contribution battle against COVID-19 esp prevalent in INDIA.
