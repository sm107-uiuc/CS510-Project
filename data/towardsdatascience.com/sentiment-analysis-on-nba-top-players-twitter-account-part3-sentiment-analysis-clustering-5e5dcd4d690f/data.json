Let's recap some results from the previous part we had made:", "We will implement the sentiment analysis to the original tweets, sentence_tokenized, and sentence_snowstemmeed to observe the difference between these methods and check their effect. When talking about sentiment analysis, there are three common types we use and rule-based methods will be selected in this chapter because it is easier to apply and there is no need to have an actual training set to train the data.", "Later, we try to cluster the players to see if each group of players have similar words using behavior in K-means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.", "We use the package called vaderSentiment, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically for sentiments analysis in social media because it works well on special characters such as emojis and some combination of punctuations. We can think lexicon approach just a dictionary of sentiment and we are just searching for the corresponding sentiment scores according to each word, and also consider how much weight should the score be based on each length and characteristics of the sentence.", "Right now, you may be thinking that emotions can be very different on each person. People have different expressions in the same word. To Solve this, the creators of the package enlisted a number of samples and averaged the ratings for each word.", "Then, we create a sentiment_analysis() which is just a method to enable us to analysis through a huge number of sentences:", "Here is the result of the first player\u2019s sentiment score on each tweet based on simple tokenizing method:", "The compound score here is calculated by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (maximum of the negative score) and +1 (maximum of the positive score). By convention, a compound score of \u2265 0.05 is regarded as a positive emotion; \u2264 -0.05 is a negative emotion; a score between -0.05 and 0.05 is considered as neutral.", "Now let us take a closer look at the sentiment score on the original tweets, tokenized tweets, and stemmed tweets. The following figure presents the original tweets and the score based on different approaches. See any difference? Sentences that been processed tend to have stronger emotions right now!", "Now, we transform the compound score into \u201cpositive\u201d, \u201cneutral\u201d, and \u201cnegative\u201d according to the previous definition and put into the data frame.", "Before begin the clustering, we must create the TF-IDF matrix and model first. TF-IDF refers to Term Frequency\u2013Inverse Document Frequency and it is a product of two statistics that reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus:", "In order to make things simple, here we only use the stemmed sentence and product the TF-IDF matrix. The Tweets_mix is just a list that gathering all the stemmed sentences and only doing so will we able to generate the TF-IDF matrix.", "First, we implement K-means for the clustering and we pick 3 clusters in this article:", "Next, output the players and their corresponding clusters:", "Remember that we try to cluster the players to see if each group of players have similar behavior when choosing their vocabularies. In other words, we need to know the word sets for each cluster. However, according to the previous process, we had used stemmed words to generate our TF-IDF matrix, which means that the word sets for each cluster are also stemmed words.", "For example, that\u2019s say if cluster one shows that \u201cfamli\u201d and \u201chappi\u201d for their most frequent words, which we know \u201cfamli\u201d equals to \u201cfamily and \u201chappi\u201d equals to \u201chappy\u201d; while it is not always straightforward for us.", "To solve the issue, we have to translate back to the words we are much familiar with. To do so, we create a dictionary such as {\u201chappi\u201d : \u201chappy\u201d} so that when we calculate the frequent stemmed word we can trace back the original one immediately. The docs_tokenized and docs_snowstemmed are lists that contain tokenized and stemmed words according to each player, and we are going to use them for our original word translation.", "Then, we output the corresponding clusters of each player and the words that frequently used by them:", "In the output, we can see players like Stephen Curry or Anthony Davis tend to use the same specific words many times on the tweets. On the other hand, player like Russell Westbrook usually tags the state he belongs to.", "Note that when the numbers of clusters are somewhat not uniformly distributed in each cluster then you probably get a bad cluster. Also, the clusters here seem not to have too much information but what we are saying is just to demonstrate that we can implement clusters on NLP as well.", "latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a kind of generative model that makes sets of samples to be explained by unobserved groups and to show why some parts of the data are similar to each other. In LDA, each document may be viewed as a mixture of various topics where each document is considered to have a set of topics that are assigned to it through LDA.", "Let\u2019s say if observations are words in a document in LDA, then we say the document is a mixture of various small topics and each word\u2019s creation is attributable to one of the doc\u2019s topics as the following figure:", "In a mathematical way, the basic intuition looks like this:", "In this article, we set 3 components since we also have 3 clusters in K-means methods. The n_stop_words means that we are hoping to see the first 3 frequent words in each topic. The number is set to 4 is because of the indexing issue so we have to +1 for the result of 3. The LDA method is as follows:", "Same, here is the output of the corresponding clusters of each player and the words that frequently used by them:", "That\u2019s all for the sentiment analysis and clustering. Chapter 4 we are going to check whether there is a correlation between the players\u2019 performance and do some EDA before the correlation test.", "Your home for data science.
