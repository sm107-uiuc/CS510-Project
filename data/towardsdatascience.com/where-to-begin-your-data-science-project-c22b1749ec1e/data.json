The raw data you get from various sources is not in a form that one can directly apply algorithms on it. It needs to be cleaned, missing data needs to be addressed, data needs to be transformed so that algorithms can be applied to it.", "I\u2019ll be talking about simple data sets that consist of only categorical and numerical data.", "We need to find a dataset to work on. I\u2019ll be listing a few resources that you can check out", "Besides these available datasets, one can also make their own datasets by scraping data from the web. python has inbuilt libraries to help you with this process.", "With data in your hand, open your preferred working environment (I use Jupyter Notebooks) and start by importing libraries.", "For starters we\u2019ll import Pandas, it helps to organize and manipulate data efficiently and is very useful when it comes to data analysis. Next, we import NumPy, which helps with manipulating numerical data. Add matplotlib.pyplot for plotting simple graphs.", "One easy way to use these libraries is to keep a shortcut for them while importing.", "For example, while importing if you write \u201cimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\u201d you can use this library in the future simply as \u201cplt\u201d.", "Now let\u2019s finally get our dataset in our working environment. We\u2019ll be accessing our data as a DataFrame. DataFrame is an object of Pandas, you can visualise a DataFrame as a spreadsheet.", "Say you want to name your DataFrame df1, so you can load your dataset onto df1 as:", "Here \u201cread_csv\u201d is to read .csv files, you can use \u201cread_excel\u201d to read .xls files. Similarly, Pandas provides you tools to read .html, .json, .sql files.", "So this was just the introductory part, we haven\u2019t really done any modifications to our data. Now we begin the interesting part.", "When you begin to observe your data (run \u201cdf1.isnull().sum()\u201d to get a quick overview of the missing records in your data) the first thing you\u2019ll notice is that not all data attributes are complete. You\u2019ll notice \u201cnan\u201d in many places. This right here is your missing data. Any data you work on will always have missing values. There are a few techniques to tackle this issue.", "The naive method would be to drop the rows that contain any missing value. You generally will be working on datasets containing thousands of tuples, so removing a few hundreds should not make a difference, right?", "\u201cdf1.dropna()\u201d will drop all the rows containing any missing value.", "But what if the rows you are deleting represent some crucial information about the data? So we try and avoid deleting any entries.", "Restrict dropping rows only when missing values account for less than 1% of the data.", "Another approach we take is by filling up the missing values. One way to do so is by using the Imputer class of sklearn library. The Scikit Learn or sklearn library in python consists of a lot of useful tools for machine learning and statistical modelling. This lets you fill the missing values with the mean (mode/median) of the existing values.", "A similar thing can be achieved using the \u201c.fillna()\u201d function. \u201cfillna()\u201d also lets you fill the missing value with the preceding or succeeding value by \u201cbfill\u201d and \u201cffill\u201d parameters respectively.", "I mentioned that we\u2019ll be dealing with categorical and numerical data.", "The various machine learning algorithms require inputs and outputs to be numbers.", "We will import LabelEncoder class from sklearn.preprocessing. This will very quickly assign a number to each categorical variable.", "Say you have 4 different variables- Green, Yellow, Blue and Red. So using the above method, your code will map each of these variables to 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.", "Using LabelEncoder has a limitation- when you set Colour as one of the variables in your model, the model will interpret that Yellow(1) is more important than Green(0).", "It will give weightage to the variables according to the number they are assigned.", "This works perfectly when our categorical variables are similar to say Small, Medium, Large because Small<Medium<Large.", "Hence for variables that do show some precedence, LabelEncoder works fine.", "To tackle the problem in case of the attribute Colours, we will introduce Dummy Variables. In Dummy Variables we have one column for each categorical variable. Each column will have only two values- 0 or 1.", "When you create dummy variables and input them in a model, you ensure that each of these variables is getting equal importance. This can be achieved using the OneHotEncoder class in sklearn.preprocessing.", "Now that we are done with most of the preprocessing we can go ahead and divide our data into training and testing datasets.", "A general rule of thumb is to keep 15\u201320% of the data for testing purposes and the rest for training.", "It\u2019s important to test your final model to get an idea of how good or bad your model is and it\u2019s essential to not test your model on the same data that you are training it on. We again have the sklearn library to rescue. The train_test_split class of sklearn.cross_validation will make two random subsets of the existing dataset.", "One last thing we\u2019ll do before applying a suitable algorithm- feature scaling. A majority of the algorithms like K-means, SVM, linear regression, logistic regression, etc are very sensitive to the scale of the attributes, that is they require all the data to be on the same scale. Many distance-based models use Euclidean distance, if attributes are on different scales then one of the attributes will tend to dominate the distance. Even if the appropriate algorithm is not based on distance, scaling helps the algorithm converge faster. I\u2019d like to add here that tree-based algorithms are not affected much by feature scaling.", "So there are two ways to bring down all the attributes to the same scale- normalisation and standardisation", "Normalisation scales the data from 0 to 1, using a pretty simple formula:", "This can be done by importing MinMaxScalar class from sklearn.preprocessing.", "In standardisation, we use the mean and standard deviation of the attribute to scale our data.", "The scaled data has mean 0 and standard deviation 1. There is no particular range that the resultant data is restricted to.", "It is advisable to split your data BEFORE feature scaling. You fit the scaler on training data and use it to transform the testing data.", "So with this, your data is ready to be used to build models. Remember to practice preprocessing thoroughly, this stage takes a lot of time.", "If you have any suggestions or questions, you can reach out to me here.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I like data science, painting and I sometimes cook.
