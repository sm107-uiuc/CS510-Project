We need to drive practitioners away from using uniform priors. Probabilistic programming is growing rapidly, which is excellent, but that means some people learn about MCMC without ever learning about ANOVA.", "Bayesian statisticians are in resounding agreement that uniform priors are silly. The Stan documentation discourages uniform priors. They appear in textbooks to simplify calculations \u2014 we don\u2019t want to bog students down with tedious calculations when communicating concepts. However, uniform priors have very little place outside of textbooks.", "After explaining why, I will offer ways to choose better priors in the second half of the article, keeping practical applications such as A/B testing in mind.", "A previous article explained all of the unreasonable statements that come attached to a non-informative prior. We should diagnose our priors using prior predictive checks, preferably through visualizations. Bayesian models are generative and we can simulate some data to assess the sanity of our assumptions.", "I\u2019ll make up a silly conversation to illustrate my objections to a uniform prior. In this scenario, we want to perform a one-sided hypothesis test with large n.", "Alice: \u201cWhat is a 95% confidence interval?\u201d", "Bob: \u201cThere is a 95% probability that the parameter is in the interval.\u201d", "Alice: \u201cNo! Don\u2019t be ridiculous! For example, if we know the parameter to be 0, then there is 0% probability that it\u2019s contained in this 95% CI:\u201d", "Bob: \u201cOh, right. If we take random samples of size n from the population, 95% of the intervals created will cover the true parameter.\u201d", "Bob: \u201cThe probability that the null hypothesis is correct.\u201d", "Bob: \u201cUh, I mean, given that the null hypothesis is true, it\u2019s the probability of observing the test statistic or something more extreme.\u201d", "Alice: \u201cRight! It\u2019s important to be precise!\u201d", "Bob: \u201cBut it\u2019s so confusing and unintuitive! How do we explain that to laypeople? Oh, I know! How about we slap a uniform prior on that?\u201d", "Bob: \u201cThen the 95% credible interval is the same as the 95% confidence interval, but we can say that there\u2019s a 95% probability of the parameter being in the interval!\u201d", "Bob: \u201cAnd forget confusing p-values! We can give people the probability of the null hypothesis being true! Here, I place a uniform Beta(1,1) prior, and after flipping a coin once and get heads, I conclude that there is a 75% probability that P(H) > 0.5!\u201d", "Alice: \u201cBut that conclusion is completely ridiculous! Do you truly believe the majority of coins in the world are extremely unfair?\u201d", "Bob: \u201cIt\u2019s called being Bayesian. Haven\u2019t you heard about all the rage? It\u2019s so much more i n t e r p r e t a b l e. We change a few words, and magically statements that were previously incorrect become correct. Checkmate, frequentists!\u201d", "Uniform priors offer no regularization whatsoever even though it is one of the main advantages of going Bayesian. Even worse, if you choose e.g. a Uniform(0,10) prior then you are placing 0 mass outside of this interval and the Bernstein-von Mises theorem does not hold. In other words, even if you had infinite data, you can still be terribly wrong with such priors.", "In the absence of informed prior belief, we can still do better than a uniform prior. As the Stan documentation recommends:", "Don\u2019t use uniform priors, or hard constraints more generally, unless the bounds represent true constraints (such as scale parameters being restricted to be positive, or correlations restricted to being between -1 and 1). Some examples:", "You think a parameter could be anywhere from 0 to 1, so you set the prior to uniform(0,1). Try normal(.5,.5) instead.", "Empirical Bayes is using your data to come up with a prior. We\u2019ll ignore the question of \u201cis a prior estimated from the data even a prior?\u201d In practice, empirical Bayes works very well. The performance of the James-Stein estimator puzzled people for a while, but we have accepted that, just like much of medicine, the important thing is it works.", "The simplest approach is to use method of moments. Suppose you are testing conversion rate with a 50/50 split. Combine all of your observations, calculate the mean and variance of conversions, and use them to estimate the \u03b1 and \u03b2 of the Beta distribution you will use as your prior. Pretend the mean and variance are 0.2 and 0.01. Then:", "Thus, our prior should be Beta(3, 12) according to empirical Bayes.", "If you have multiple or no observations per user, e.g. purchases, then you want to aggregate by user (such as total purchases, number of purchases) before doing method of moments. Remember that some users have 0 purchases and we need to include them in the estimation. We are assuming that the parameter varies by person, not by purchase.", "A hierarchical model can be interpreted as learning the prior from the data. You can try running MCMC on this, where x_i is our i-th observation and beta_j is the mean of the group (e.g. control vs treatment):", "The priors are chosen to be generic, but you should have more informative priors based on your historical data, especially for mu. Also, you can make better distributional assumptions based on what metric you\u2019re evaluating in the experiment. Even if the prior on the hyperparameters is extremely weak, we should still get a reasonable distribution for beta after the partial pooling.", "The joke is that you can always rescale your data so that a N(0,1) prior makes sense. For instance, if we think a 1% change is reasonable but a 20% change is unlikely, then rescale your data (or the normal prior) to reflect that. If you\u2019re afraid of the influence of outliers, try using t-distribution as a prior. As mentioned at the start of this section, a normal prior is almost always better than a uniform prior.", "Whenever you think about using a uniform prior, remember: just don\u2019t.", "Your home for data science.
