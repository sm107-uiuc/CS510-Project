Now, this isn\u2019t intended to be a full course on linear algebra, as it is impossible to teach one in 5 minutes (if you\u2019re not you know who), but the article will cover how to deal with linear algebra data structures \u2014 vectors and matrices \u2014 and how to do cool stuff with them.", "So yeah, the article assumes you know at least something on the topic, and are familiar with linear algebra operations in let\u2019s say Numpy, but are eager to see what Julia has to offer.", "Without further ado, let\u2019s get started! I\u2019m assuming you have Julia installed and running in some environment like Jupyter (if you don\u2019t refer to the article above). You\u2019ll only need to import one library, and you can probably guess which one is it gonna be:", "There\u2019s no point in talking about eigendecomposition and Euclidean norm if we don\u2019t know how to declare basic vectors and matrices. It\u2019s quite easy though, I\u2019d say a bit easier than in Python (not sure about R).", "To make a row vector, you\u2019ll need to surround the elements with square brackets, and NOT to put commas in between (if you put commas you will not get a vector):", "In a similar fashion, to make a column vector all you need to do additionally is to put a single quotation mark at the end, everything else is the same as with the row vectors:", "The syntax for creating a matrix is very similar \u2014 you will declare it row by row, putting semicolon (;) to indicate the elements should go on a new row:", "The syntax to create an n*m matrix of zeros is very similar to the one in Python, just without the Numpy prefix:", "Same goes for the n*m matrix of ones:", "If you want to make a diagonal matrix, ergo a matrix where elements that are not on the diagonal are 0, you can do it via Diagonal() and passing in the array for values of elements on the diagonal:", "In a similar fashion you can create an n*n identity matrix:", "To create an n*m matrix with elements drawn from a uniform distribution, you can use the rand() method:", "Or use randn() to draw elements from the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, var = 1):", "Now that was quite a bit we did already but still haven\u2019t covered any linear algebra operations \u2014 that\u2019s coming in the next section.", "In this section, we\u2019ll cover stuff like matrix multiplication, inverse, determinant, eigendecomposition, and much more. Let\u2019s get started!", "To calculate the matrix transpose you can use the convenient transpose() function:", "An array can also be reshaped \u2014 here I\u2019m creating an array with elements from 1 to 10, both included, and reshaping them into a matrix of 2 rows and 5 columns:", "You can flatten n*m matrix into a column vector easily \u2014 this will have so many use cases later when covering data science:", "I\u2019m sure you can guess the name of a method for calculating the dot product:", "To perform matrix multiplication you can use the multiplication symbol, as opposed with Python where you\u2019ve used the @ sign:", "To multiply elements element-wise, use .* symbols:", "To calculate the inverse of a matrix, use the inv() method:", "And to calculate determinant use the det() method:", "You can also perform the eigendecomposition of a matrix. It will return eigenvalues and eigenvectors, so if you want to store those you\u2019ll need two variables:", "And finally, to calculate simple Euclidean norm you can use the norm() method:", "And I think this will be enough, maybe even a bit too much. I hope it wasn\u2019t a big problem for you. For me, linear algebra feels natural in Julia, maybe even a bit more than in Python. Let\u2019s hope this claim remains true in the future when we\u2019ll deal with real datasets.", "Before jumping into some \u201cconcrete\u201d data science, where concrete means EDA, data visualization, and machine learning, I want to make sure the basics are covered properly. The main reason is \u2014 you need to know the language you\u2019re working with. Seeking for answers online is cool, but what\u2019s not cool is constantly doubting yourself because you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ve done things properly.", "That\u2019s why you can expect three more articles similar to this one, covering:", "And only then will we take a step towards some applicative data science.
