This is especially true once you start dealing with periods smaller than daily data. By data engineering, I define the methodologies, technologies, software, procedures and infrastructure used to retrieve, store, parse, ensure quality and distribute data to end clients.", "While this area shines less than the algorithms to obtain successful trading strategies it is an important part and must be properly addressed. This infrastructure setup is part of the professional operation and it is one of the differences between an amateur and a professional approach to the field. Defining the right infrastructure is part of business operations and plays an important role in the mid and long term journey of making money using quantitative trading.", "There are different approaches to cope with this data engineering need. All approaches can be equally valid but there are significant trade-offs among them and it is important to understand your resources and environment to choose the right one. I will describe what I have seen, the information comes from my experimentation, information gathered from industry people, information given by wealthy quantitative sole-traders and information that I have gathered from well-established trading companies (prop-trading and commodities mainly, as unfortunately, I do not know that many players in the industry).", "Large companies moving large amounts of trading capital not requiring high-speed or fine time granularities can choose a proprietary environment \u2014 such as Microsoft ecosystem \u2014 to move and store data around. By doing that you count with friendly programming environment for whenever anything custom is needed (C# and Python), integrated cloud storage via Azure and the Microsoft ETL tools to build an easy to maintain data pipeline \u2014 Microsoft says so \u2014 . This approach has the advantage of using the same technology for everything and you can expect a smooth integration within the different components. Using a commercial solution provides also vendor support \u2014 which is always good \u2014 . As a trade-off: it is expensive, you are tied to one vendor, it involves recurrent costs, and certain activities can not be properly done because you are using general-purpose tools. I have seen this approach being used in a commodities trading well-established company. It is probably not the best environment if you need to deal with high-speed or very custom or ML intensive strategies (which was not the case there).", "Another approach largely used in the industry is building up a pure Python solution. For those who had read in the past other articles you probably already know that my personal feelings on Python are mixed. As an advantage Python is extremely easy to code and counts with many ML libraries, Jupyter notebooks can simplify the maintenance of the structures and it promotes self-documenting the procedures. It is not the best solution but in a mixed environment, I truly think that it can provide real benefits in terms of operations. I keep thinking that Python is not a good choice in terms of performance or speed, but it is extremely good to code high-level maintainable software layers. The benefit of shorter development times and easier collaboration among the team outperforms performance handicap. Experienced Python developers can also employ alternatives that can speed up Python, although you are pushing Python beyond the limits of its nature. I have seen this approach being used very successfully in a small hedge fund well-established firm.", "Another approach involves using C++ or Java as environment, and developing a custom framework to handle data. This is the approach used by firms operating intraday or high-frequency with large amounts of data. For tick data, you probably need this approach at least for certain areas of your infrastructure. Regarding the specific language to be used, C++ is the preferred choice for the flagship institutional firms, but Java can be used at a lower operational cost and I have seen very successful small firms delivering everything in Java. The reality is that you can have almost the same performance than in C++ but with a much easier to manage language and development/debugging environments than C++. I am lately doing a lot of stuff in Java because I am not a particularly good programmer. Certain aspects of trading software are much better represented by C/C++ language (specifically I find that defining data structures for OHLC and tick data is more natural in C than in Java). Using Java in trading always involves coding in a way which is not that natural to Java programmers as you need to think always in terms of low-level programming and performance, hence a background in C is beneficial.", "Data itself can (and it is usually stored) in a database, but this might be a mistake. Both SQL and non-SQL approaches can be used. I no longer use SQL for market data \u2014 I used it at the very beginning \u2014 , but this is because my focus now is on intraday strategies with very few instruments, so I have to handle large amounts of pretty homogeneous data. Relational databases provide no value in that area. An alternative is to use CSV files (yes they are widely used, and there are reasons for that) or other plain text methodologies (such as the one I use and I describe later). The advantages of this approach is that data can be consumed, reviewed and accessed easily and that you have effectively removed another point of maintenance and pain: the database.", "A common denominator of these described approaches is that they usually rely on a given language or technology rather than on a systems engineering approach. This does not mean that there is no certain systems engineering involved, but often it is not the main approach.", "An alternative can be successfully used, specially for the sole-trader, small hedge funds operating with limited resources or small prop-trading firms (or startups) is described here. Disclaimer: the approach will hurt feelings as it promotes reusing 40 years old technology.", "In my quest for simplicity, I have tried to remove as many layers and software as possible, and also reduce the amount of custom code that needs to be delivered. Anything that contributes to this can help to lower operational expenses and reduce the amount of total work and maintenance that needs to be done. While thinking about this I found that reusing the classic UNIX approach of files and small cooperative tools might be highly beneficial to set up operations, based on UNIX systems engineering rather than on DevOps or programming language-based infrastructure.", "I always use the word UNIX because I use FreeBSD but it equally applies to Linux.", "There is a 1985 book written by Kernighan & Pike named \u201cThe UNIX Programming Environment\u201d. It is a very old book, the C code is even in K&R pre-ANSI style, but it is still well known among the C programming community; it is probably the best book you can read to understand what truly UNIX is: a programming environment to build solutions easily reusing small programs and tools and with small effort.", "Concepts such as extensive file usage (the \u201ceverything is a file\u201d UNIX approach) has been largely abandoned to embrace much more complex structures and solutions. But you can always stop and take a minute to think about: do you really need a database or you just assumed you need one because everyone told you so? do you really need an API-based cloud storage or can you just work with a plain file system \u2014 which can be perfectly backup or stored on Cloud, nothing wrong against that \u2014 ? do you really need to code API access in Python using the latest trendy framework or is it may be enough to install an HTTP service or a remote file server right on top of your data filesystem? The first option even allows building a REST access system without programming a single line of code.", "These are questions that are usually not warmly welcomed by biased professionals, especially among the ones who are specialised in one technology or language as it defies common bloated current practices with simpler than simple tools and approaches with zero maintenance.", "Zero maintenance is very important for those \u2014 like me \u2014 who had reached a certain age (experience) because we have already made the mistake of building complex stuff in the past. For smaller operations lacking both resources and team, deploying simple solutions is a necessity.", "I will describe in the following sections how to set up a 1-second aggregated FOREX data infrastructure service. This is part of my latest infrastructure setup to backtest and analyse quantitative strategies in FOREX and I will illustrate how relying on a mixed environment of small cooperative tools within a UNIX box can speed up operations.", "In my last quantitative analysis, I want to work with Forex data, using 1-minute aggregated data. One minute aggregated data means that I want to explore how price only information can replace volume information (which is not always available in Forex). This comes from merging the market concepts of Market Profile (where time and price equals interest or value) and Volume Profile (where volume equals interest or value). As a consequence Time and Price can replace Volume and therefore can be used to successfully ride the markets (that is my premise and what I want to analyse, it could be wrong or right but sounds reasonable).", "To have 1-minute market profiles we need certain granularity, ideally tick data but let\u2019s assume that 1-second price information would suffice (again, that is our premise, assumption or axiom that could be right or wrong).", "This is my business need: to analyse if market profile over 1-minute candles information can be used to edge the market or not. This business need translates into a technical or infrastructure need: I need to be able to consume market profile of 1-minute candles in Forex easily in my analysis.", "Therefore I need to store data grouped each 1-minute, and probably later process that data and generate additional files with the aggregated information.", "Behind any technical need, there must be always a business need. And behind any technical solution, there must be a full cost/resource analysis, both for the project and operational expenses. These basic checks are not always done specially for people with technology-only backgrounds who might not have a natural understanding of mid and long-term operational costs.", "You always need a data provider, both for historical and real-time. It makes sense to have your data stored locally (or in your private cloud) as cache if you are going to use it, but dedicated data companies will ensure continuity and reliability much better than you can do, and at the end, you need to have access to market data and you can not pay (or it makes no sense even if you can pay it) the exchange market access fees and associated project costs involved.", "Let\u2019s retrieve the 1-second data for EUR USD, let\u2019s have a look to the Polygon.oi API for this:", "There are several alternatives to retrieve and store this data, the first one that usually comes to mind is to use a programming language and a database. So Python and SQL could be an option. As the number of records returned by Polygon.io is limited to 10.000, you will need to perform several calls populating the offset argument until you retrieve all the information so certain programming is definitively required. The information is also retrieved as JSON, but we definitively do not want to store or process JSON, because it is highly inefficient.", "Here are my tips for the task:", "Here I will not use any database. Instead, I will store all Bid/Ask information as a space-separated values in a single file. As we obviously need sort kind of random access we will separate this data in one file per natural day. For 20 years that poses a maximum of 7300 files, definitively a figure within the limits of what any modern OS can handle.", "Time zones matter, they are usually a challenge and a pain point. The best option I have found is to simplify them: I always use Eastern Time. I do so because most data vendors deliver data in this time zone (even for European instruments/assets). I do so because New York cash session is likely the most important period of the day in terms of trading (or at least a relevant one). I do so because it is terribly simple to know that all your data, no matter what, is stored in Eastern Time.", "Shall I group my data according to the New York cash session? Maybe yes. But in my experience to store data it is much much better to use natural days in the Eastern Time zone. If you want to analyse a particular time (9:30 onwards for example) you can do that in your analysis. But the data shall be stored in natural days. Why? I do so just because according to my experience is the easiest thing to do. You might raise objections like \u201cthe Asian session can include the end of the previous natural day and the beginning of the current natural day\u201d or \u201cI want to handle regular and extended trading hours and the extended hours crosses two natural days\u201d, etc. All objections are valid, but again, the simplest answer I have found even when dealing with these questions is always the same: store your data grouped by natural days in Eastern Time.", "A great achievement from the UNIX world is the directory structure. Use it, it is free and zero maintenance. So group your files in directories by year, by year and month or by year and month and day. In my case, I have chosen the latter because I intend to further deploy many more files with aggregated information.", "So if you want the data for April 3rd of 2019 for EURUSD, you already know that it is located at /data/EURUSD/2019/04/03/EURUSD.2019.04.03.tape. And if you want to read it you just do a cat over that file to display its contents:", "See? It is embarrassingly simple \u2014 and convenient\u2014.", "Do not store data in CSV, use fixed-size fields. The difference is subtle but has great performance benefits later. In the first one fields are variable length (1.1373 and 1.13732), in the second case you define exact lengths for each field and pad with zeros if needed (1.13730 and 1.13732). In the above example, we know that EURUSD has 5 decimal places and 1 natural place, so each price takes exactly 7 characters. This simplifies using low-level routines in C and Java which will make your backtesting data retrieval faster. Do not use commas because in UNIX columns are usually separated by spaces and because manually inspecting a file is easier when columns are separated by a space, by doing so you can always use CSV techniques but you will be able to get performance by reading fixed-width fields too.", "Write a simple, self-contained command-line tool to retrieve all data for a given day and store it. As you have already defined where data for each day goes, you can do it easily. And surprise surprise, you do not need even to program anything to retrieve data, someone, smarter than you and me, already coded a tool named curl, which will retrieve it for you. You still need a small script to iterate over requests because every day will likely have more than 10000 records. You can do it in Python or in just shell script, as in below example. Notice how reusing existing tools simplifies programming:", "This is the way UNIX was intended to be used: small tools that do just one thing.", "Retrieving data day by day is really time-consuming. So you can write a command to retrieve the data for a whole year. In this case, parsing dates is easier in Python, so write the command in Python. It just invokes the previous one in a loop.", "In this article I have briefly reviewed how usually things are planned in terms of storing financial data for backtesting, I have also presented a really simple way to retrieve and store data. The next step is to preprocess that data to get the analysis you want (in my case I want to analyse Bid/Ask and price distributions in time, so I will generate more files accordingly). The takeaway of this specific article is that by doing these simple steps we have effectively decoupled (with just two simple tools) the retrieval and storage of the data from our strategy analysis. Not only that but we have also defined a way to store data that it is extremely easy to communicate, understand and remember, and has zero maintenance. Decoupling is really important in any software project, as it is the best strategy to make reusable components and avoid future problems.", "Using plain files to store data will not please everyone. \u201cToo many files\u201d, \u201ctoo many file descriptors\u201d, \u201cslow \u201c\u2014 without having had it tested \u2014, \u201cthere are better options\u201d, \u201clacks functionality\u201d, \u201cnot cool enough\u201d. But in the end, you will find it hard to find someone raising a real benefit (which can exist in certain scenarios) of not using files.", "Do not get stuck suffering with complex Amazon AWS or WhateverLatestTrendy Cloud Storage API. Most of the times, you do not need that complexity.", "The files are compact and easily addressable by natural day. You can locate any specific time easily because each file has fixed-width records and is around 80Kbytes, which is easy to parse and it is easy to implement search algorithms if you really need to jump to specific positions (I think it is easier to read the whole file into memory though).", "A further aggregation phase where new files are created with the specific aggregated data that your analysis requires reinforces this point. Plain column fixed-width files can be consumed in every language or tool (Octave, R, Python, C, Java, sed, awk, whatever) and can be even really efficient if you take into consideration that each record (line) has always the same length.", "This is especially true within the context of a prop-trading running analysis and backtesting against historical data. The main concern might be the access time, but backtesting and analysis normally involve a large number of calculations on sequential data so disk access time would be usually negligible. If not, data can always be put on a cached RAM filesystem, which solves the issue without a single line of code written.", "If data needs to be accessed remotely a simple NFS can be used, or an HTTP server can be deployed to dispatch the files. With just a couple of lines of configuration, you will have a REST service without programming a simple line of code. The take away is that UNIX has many tools and services that are intended to simplify and reuse, no matter how old the technology might look like: programming is not always the answer.", "A side note: Not storing data at all and requesting on-demand data to the data provider might be an option if you are dealing with aggregated basic OHLC data. But normally, you will always want to do things with data, custom calculations or aggregation. Or you are iterating over large amounts of data, so normally, what I have found is that you always need to download data and access it locally.", "Consultant, retail trader & lifelong learner |
