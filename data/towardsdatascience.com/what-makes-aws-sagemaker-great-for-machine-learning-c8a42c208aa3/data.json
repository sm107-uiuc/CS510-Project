Data scientists are expected to build and use the data pipelines, work with data warehouses, train and host ML models in the cloud etc. In this blog, we will focus on machine learning model development.", "Amazon SageMaker is a powerful service by AWS for building, training and deploying your machine learning models. It was released by AWS in 2017 and it has quickly gotten a lot of popularity, however, not many data scientists are using the service as it is pretty new. In this blog we will talk about SageMaker and how you can use it yourself in your machine learning project \u2014 not just for building and training the model but also for deploying your model to be used by thousands and millions of users.", "One great thing about SageMaker is its modular design. If you prefer to train elsewhere and just use SageMaker for deployment, you can do that. If you just prefer to train your model and use its hyper-parameter tuning capability you can do that as well. This is something which I really like about SageMaker. With this in mind, let us get started in our understanding of Amazon SageMaker. We will cover 3 broad areas that SageMaker helps with: model building, model training and model deployment \u2014 along with 3 advantages in each area.", "At the most basic level, SageMaker provides Jupyter notebooks. You can use these notebooks for building, training and deploying ML models. Many data scientists use these notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model building stage. You might want to start off using something like Pandas here to explore the dataset \u2014 how many missing rows do you have? What does the distribution of data look like? Do you have imbalanced data and so on? You can build many different models ranging from say logistic regression or decision tree from Scikit Learn to deep learning models from Keras and get baseline performance very quickly. So when you move to SageMaker the notebook interface remains the same \u2014 there is no difference!", "Then a question you might ask is \u2192 what is the advantage of using SageMaker notebooks instead of local or notebooks hosted on an EC2 server somewhere? Well, SageMaker lets you decide the type of machine you prefer so you don\u2019t need to manage any complex AMIs or security groups \u2014 this makes it very easy to get started. SageMaker also provides access to GPUs and big machines with high amounts of RAM that might not be possible on a local setup.", "Let us list out all the advantages of SageMaker for model building: 1. From 2 core and 4GB machines all the way to 96 core and 768GB RAM machines, you have access to these with a click of the button and notebooks are hosted in these machines without any extra effort from you. You don\u2019t have to manage any security groups or AMIs or manage IP addresses of machines or anything. Below is a list of different notebook types and the pricing per month if running 24x7.", "2. The second advantage is that it comes with environments pre-configured \u2014 you do not need to install TensorFlow or other common libraries separately.", "3. Another advantage is that you can link your Github account with these notebooks \u2014 so that you can keep committing to the Github repo as you build the model \u2014 no need to worry about downloading and uploading files for version control! This is available via the JupyterLab interface for the SageMaker notebooks. I really love this feature.", "Next step is model training. You can use the same notebooks to train the model and store the model artifacts and files in S3 and then move to the next step of model deployment. But what if you are doing a model that takes several hours to train, say, language translation model with complex LSTM models? In this case, instead of using the notebook itself which might be running on a small instance, you can just call a GPU from Sagemaker notebook itself to train the model. This way you can save the cost while running the notebook as most of the tasks are around building, checking and exploring the model. Again, for training the model training itself, you can just use another machine which is different from the machine being used to run the notebook.", "So the advantages of using SageMaker for model training are: 1. You can run a notebook on non-GPU t2.medium which costs around $40/mo but then you can use p2.xlarge GPU instance that costs around $1.2 per hour \u2014 and only the seconds that were used to actually train the model will be billed to you. This can be a huge costs savings esp. as typically you would start an EC2 server with a GPU \u2014 install everything, run your scripts and have to remember to shut it down. Here, you are automatically billed by second for the actual training time. So to repeat, you can use a cheap instance to host your notebook which can run 24 hours and will not cost a lot but then use GPUs to train the model right from the notebook itself.", "2. Another feature of SageMaker for model training is hyper parameter tuning. You can create hyper parameter tuning jobs so that your model can tune overnight and you will be shown the best hyper parameters in the morning.", "3. Yet another advantage is how you can use Amazon\u2019s own pre-built models that have been highly optimized to run on AWS services. These models come pre-built and you do not need to do much to build and check the model. You can use prebuilt XGBoost or LDA or PCA or Seq to Seq models \u2014 all these are available via high level Python SDK called sagemaker. This is a good time to mention that there is a low level SDK as well to access SageMaker and it is written using boto3 \u2014 boto3is a common way to access other AWS services in Python.", "Finally, my favorite reason to use SageMaker is for model deployment. Even though your model might not be too complex and can get trained easily on your local machine, you would still need to host the model somewhere. Then there are issues about scaling the model \u2192 can you build a service to serve your ML outputs that can be used by hundreds and thousands of users at the same time? What about latency? What if there is sudden spike of demand? For all these SageMaker is awesome as it lets you host the model behind an endpoint. This endpoint is a service running in a hidden EC2 server somewhere. Of course you need to still choose what instance type you like. But you do not need to worry about setting this server up \u2014 during the creation of endpoint you can say choose things like auto-scaling groups, how many servers do you want etc.", "So the advantages of using SageMaker for model deployment are: 1. Host the ML model in an endpoint \u2014 you can then call this endpoint from any other code written in the common languages. You can also call this model from a Lambda function. This way your web app can just call the Lambda function which can call the model endpoint. If you are hosting your own API somewhere, then the API code can call this endpoint. You can also configure API Gateway to receive a HTTP request which calls a Lambda function which then calls the SageMaker endpoint such as below:", "Note: Amazon hosts the SageMaker model on a physical server that runs 24 hours a day \u2014 the server doesn\u2019t turn on/off depending when the request is received. So SageMaker is somewhere in the middle of EC2 and Lambda in the spectrum of serverless. The server keeps running all the time like EC2 but you don\u2019t configure and manage it just like Lambda.", "2. Another great advantage is that you can host multiple models in the same endpoint. For this you will need to create a custom Docker container image though. This is fairly complex, but there are starter codes in Github by AWS. You\u2019ll need to create your own image and host it in ECR and then use this image while hosting multiple models. Multi-model endpoints let you host multiple models, and the instances are pre-configured to handle load of multiple models without you having to worry about the DevOps of this.", "3. All your logs get easily stored in CloudWatch logs. You do not need to create your own logging pipeline \u2014 this is yet another advantage. You can monitor the load on your machines and scale the machines based on demand.", "But, what\u2019s the catch? SageMaker is expensive and can cost 30 to 40% more than the equivalent EC2 server option from AWS. A t2.medium costs $33/mo but an equivalent ml.t2.medium for SageMaker costs $40/mo. But I feel that all these advantages make a big cost difference overall \u2014 you are only charged by the second for model training time you use in expensive servers. This brings me to the 10th advantage which is that Amazon is constantly innovating and is bringing new features such as SageMaker Studio \u2014 so you will be having access to all these advantages as you use SageMaker in your model pipelines.", "I feel that it may come across that SageMaker is a magic pill for every ML problem you might encounter. I would say that it is not a magic pill but rather a very useful tool. You would still need to configure the preprocessing and post processing pipelines using \u201chandler\u201d functions and also figure out how you want to configure Docker containers for multi-model endpoints. All this is not easy and AWS documents are honestly not that good \u2014 for this reason I will recommend you to start small and deploy MNIST endpoint and then build from there. SageMaker is a great tool but I wanted to paint the full picture \u2014 will be great to hear from you how you have been using it and also let me know if I missed something in this episode. Reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email or via comments below. All the best in your ML journey!", "If you prefer to listen to the audio version of this blog, I have also recorded a podcast episode for this blog post \u2014 where I go into more details of each of these points. You can listen to it on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or Anchor.fm, or on one of my favorite podcast apps: Overcast.", "For comments/feedback/questions or if you think I have missed something in the episode, please reach out to me at sanket@omnilence.com or LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanketgupta107/", "Resources:1.
