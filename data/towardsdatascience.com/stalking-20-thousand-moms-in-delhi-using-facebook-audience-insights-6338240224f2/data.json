But it is an intrinsic human tendency \u2014 to desire to know more about others, while having a mask on our own faces.", "Let us take a look today at Facebook Audience Insights (which is available on this URL if you want to try out yourself \u2014 https://www.facebook.com/ads/audience-insights/interests). While it is a tool to help marketing folks better target audiences to reach people of intended groups, it also is a powerful tool to profile a city or an entire country. It can give us insights of unprecedented levels like", "These insights and analysis, of the order, magnitude, and accuracy that huge firms pay millions, even billions of dollars to big survey houses (like Nielson, IRI, IMRB etc) for.", "Note: If you want a different case study using 18\u201325 year old Uttar Pradesh redidents instead of moms from Delhi, read this instead https://medium.com/@championswimmer/what-young-people-in-uttar-pradesh-think-and-do-fd632c3b30bc", "We\u2019ll start from \u201cEveryone in the world\u201d and narrow down from there.", "Then we will select a city or county or even a country. Facebook will guide you along in your creepventure.", "Let us say we want to select all the nice moms in my city, Delhi. We can pick age group and gender.", "Now not all 45\u201350 aged women are necessarily married, let along be mothers. But Facebook takes care of that as well.", "You can select marital status for targeting. And then you can select \u201cparenthood\u201d properties. That is, using the Facebook family properties (someone marks you as their mother on Facebook, Facebook knows how old your child is), you can target mothers, and specifically mothers of kids of a particular age group. I will address this here, because this needs to be said, allowing big firms to target mothers of children of age groups 0\u201312 months (one of the options) is a very slippery slope. But anyway let\u2019s proceed, I want moms of kids in high-school, just about to go into college.", "There are extremely fine-grained selectors, including", "Now that we have our sights on our target audience, this is the point where most marketing firms would just blast an advertisement towards this group. But wait, we let\u2019s find out more about the lives of mothers aged 45\u201350, with kids in high-school and college, living in Delhi.", "Facebook now, on the right hand side pane shows trends. What do these people do, what do they like ? Do they use a desktop or a mobile ? Which places they visit. This is a treasure trove.", "So we see that lot of people in Education and Libraries (suggesting school teachers) and Management being the biggest draw. We also see that in Delhi, people in this segment are far less likely to be in healthcare/medical services/architecture/engineering than the average on Facebook.", "Let us find out what Delhi moms like then.", "Ok, this is really interesting. I know down here in India, we have a bunch of well educated people still falling of \u201cbabas\u201d and \u201cmatas\u201d of spiritual and numerological leaning (God save India from its weird superstitions) so we see high affinity towards Nirmal Guruji, and Neha Lalwani, and some Guru ji. About a thousand of our Delhi moms are into this mystic shit, which I am guessing all three pages have strong overlap (using the Facebook Insights tool, we can check cross-affinity and confirm our hunch).", "Delhi moms are into clay kitchen ware and wedding gifts too, naturally. So Ekaani and Mora Taara have high affinity as well. For both these brands, Delhi moms make up close to 5\u201310% of their audience.", "While that list was ranked by affinity (showing how much more likely Delhi moms are to like something compared to the rest of the people on Facebook), let us take a look at absolute numbers now. We figured how specifically Delhi moms are different from others, but not let us find out what they all really really like, in raw numbers.", "Whoa there. A whole 17% of them are into further fake-spiritual shit \u2014 some BK Shivani (a female iteration of Asaram Bapu / other fraud babas). Next up on the list, is Fabiosa India. So Fabiosa is a digital magazine / Facebook page for moms. So I get it. They are good at being mom-magnets.", "Ofcourse, moms that age need to start think about nutrition \u2014 whether it is for their kids, or they (and their husbands) want to lose weight. So Dr Shiksha has been making a killing with Delhi moms. Also home decor is important, you don\u2019t want to invite people over at this age in life to a spartan home. You want people to compliment your sofas and ask you where did you get that nicely designed TV table from ? In comes Livspace and UrbanLadder.", "How can you talk about Indian women, and not talk of sarees ? Jaypore is definitely selling a bunch of Pashminas to Delhi moms, or at least they definitely desire to get some.", "I do not know how many husbands of these Delhi moms will appreciate but at least 10% of them are ardent followers of Ssumier S Pasricha, whether you like it or not.", "What these women surely want a lot is to leave their husbands and kids off to themselves for a while, and gang up and take a trip down to Rajasthan or Shimla or somewhere. Because the affinity and the absolute numbers for Women on Wanderlust is through the roof. If you are her husband or her kid, and you\u2019re reading this, you need to take your mom/wife to some vacations. Seriously. Data says so.", "Taking middle aged women on trips is lucrative business folks. Just see the happy faces in the photos. Come on, someone needs to start giving WoW some competition.", "Honestly I am not. There are quite a few takeaways.", "One, definitely is, this is a great tool, and in the hands of an able marketing professional, can generate brilliant insights. Me, not a marketing professional, with no understanding of how 45\u201350 year old women in Delhi behave, can tell you right now, you have a better chance of getting Delhi moms are your customers if you are a travel agency organizing all-women tours, than anything else. Unless ofcourse you want to don some white clothes and start your own spiritual sham (no business model better than that, of course).", "The other, increasingly as we are learning since the Cambridge Analytica fallout, is that Facebook has been creeping into our lives like anything, and then selling this mass-stalking analysis and insight to anyone who wants it. Mind you, to get the data that I got, I did not actually pay Facebook a single penny. All this data is available even before I actually pay for a single advert on Facebook. Facebook (and mind you, Twitter and LinkedIn too) have been playing fast and loose with access to this huge aggregate data that can allow people to profile a group of people. Often times, based on race, color, religion too (although such targeting isn\u2019t explicitly available, but correlating with other factors, entirely possible.", "Finally, it boils down to the very choice of lives we are living on these digital platforms. Opening up our lives, our relationships, our tastes and distastes up for the world to see. And machines \u2014 with access to unlimited data \u2014 is the most potent profiling tool; better than any profiler the FBI has ever trained.", "When a mom of a 8 month baby keeps seeing the advertisement of a particlar brand of cereal over and over on her Twitter feed, Facebook feed, her Instagram feed. It starts to make home in her subconscious mind. She doesn\u2019t have to look at the ad and think \u201cOh we will buy cereal XYZ\u201d immediately. But when she is at a supermarket, looking for cereals, those advertisements she has constantly seen on her mobile and laptop screens day in and day out will trigger her (without her conscious and deliberate choice) to pick up cereal XYZ. Legal precedent prevents targetting based on race, religion and color. It prevents targeting ads on Facebook users below 18. But it doesn\u2019t prevent anyone to target parents of a 8 month old baby, who, even before she can start walking or talking, is consuming products advertised to her parents via deeply invasive tools that had profiled her parents down to the bone.", "Jeffrey Hammerbacher, former Data Scientist at Facebook, who in large part contributed to building the systems that give us these invasive profile of an aggregate group of people, found his conscience tugging at the strings of his heart one day. One morning he woke up and decided he cannot do this anymore.", "He now runs Cloudera. But I am not sure the tools he is building is still, now, even in an indirect way, continue to affect our lives the very same way he didn\u2019t want to.", "Note: If you want a different case study using 18\u201325 year old Uttar Pradesh redidents instead of moms from Delhi, read this instead https://medium.com/@championswimmer/what-young-people-in-uttar-pradesh-think-and-do-fd632c3b30bc", "I am neither a data scientist, not am I connected to the world of marketing research.
