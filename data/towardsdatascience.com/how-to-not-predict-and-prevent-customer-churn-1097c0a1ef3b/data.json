Whether it is a B2B business model or B2C, every company strives for a sticky customer base with minimal attrition to ensure an ongoing, recurring revenue stream.", "But how do you determine the specific customer characteristics that ensure customer longevity? How to identify \u2018at-risk\u2019 customers, i.e., those that are likely to churn? Given a customer\u2019s probability to churn, just when can we expect him to churn? Important still, how much can we afford to invest in \u2018at-risk\u2019 customers to try and retain them?", "These are all the questions that a business should ideally have answers to if it is interested in minimizing its customer churn. And I will try to help you get answers to these.", "Analyzing customer churn in a non-contractual setting (e.g., retail) is a non-trivial exercise since churn cannot be discretely defined here. A customer who has made X number of purchases so far can either return for another purchase, or may never return. Various approaches have been proposed to tackle this, including anomaly detection and Lifetime Value (LTV) analysis. I have covered LTV analysis in a non-contractual setting in another post.", "Contractual or subscription-based models, however, are easier to analyze since churn is a binary classification problem at a given point in time in these scenarios. If a customer does not renew his subscription, then he has undoubtedly churned. There can be no two ways about this: either a customer is active or has churned. We will cover churn analysis as applicable to subscription models in this post.", "Traditional approaches to churn modeling have utilized logistic regression, random forests, or gradient descent boosting to analyze and predict customer churn. However, we will utilize Survival Analysis techniques to gain additional insights related to customer churn. This will help us to answer the further questions stated at the beginning of this article.", "Survival Analysis is a branch of statistical analysis, which addresses questions such as \u2018how long would it be before a particular event occurs\u2019, i.e., it is a \u2018time to event\u2019 model (compared to the probability of an event happening). Traditionally, survival analysis is heavily used in the medical and life sciences fields to determine the expected lifespan of an individual or other biological organisms.", "Survival analysis is applicable in situations where we can define:", "While logistic regression and decision trees are appropriate for binary classification problems (will the customer churn or not?), Survival Analysis goes beyond that to answer when will the customer churn. If we do not expect a customer to churn right now, it does not automatically imply that he will never churn. If not now, there is a high probability that he might churn later. In such cases, survival analysis can throw light on such \u2018censored\u2019 customers by predicting their survival (or churn) at various points of time in the future.", "This ability to deal with \u2018censorship\u2019 in data makes survival analysis a superior technique to other regression and tree-based models.", "In the traditional sense, censorship refers to losing track of an individual during an observation period, or where the event of interest is not observed during this period. This data is \u2018censored\u2019 because everyone dies or leaves/cancels a subscription at some future point in time; we\u2019re just missing that information. Only because we haven\u2019t observed them canceling their contact or subscription doesn\u2019t mean they never will. And we can\u2019t wait till they cancel their subscription to do our analysis. This is called Right-Censorship.", "Other types of censorship include Left-Censorship and Interval-Censorship. The former refers to the scenario where we do not know when an individual became our customer because his \u2018birth\u2019 event happened before our observation time period. In contrast Interval-Censorship occurs when data is collected at specific time intervals that do not constitute a continuous observation period. Thereby, some life/death events could have missed out from being represented in the data.", "Survival analysis techniques are designed to identify the survival function through two main data points: duration or Time to Event and a binary flag, whether our event of interest has occurred or not for each observation. Survival analysis is not really concerned with the Time of Event or Time of Origin. Instead, the Time to Event information is of paramount importance.", "Several studies have been conducted to determine if survival analysis can also predict both the probability and the expected time to the customer default However, no significant improvement was observed relative to traditional logistic regression methods. Plus, the fact that banking regulators and Basel accord require an easily comprehensible and interpretable methodology for credit decisions makes logistic regression a superior choice in these cases.", "We will cover the two most well-established, documented, and in-practice models to estimate the survival and hazard functions through observed data.", "Although we don\u2019t have the true survival curve of the population, we can estimate a population\u2019s survival function based on observed data through a powerful non-parametric method called the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The KM Survival Curve plots time on the x-axis and the estimated survival probability on the y-axis.", "KM Survival Analysis requires only two inputs to predict the survival curve: Event (churned/non-churned) and Time to Event. Note that no other features or predictors are utilized by KM to assess the survival function.", "In real-life situations, along with the event and duration data, we also have various other covariates (features or predictors) of the individuals in our population. It could very well be that these additional covariates also impact the probability of our event of interest not occurring (called survival probability) at a specific point in time in the future. For example, in a telco setting, these additional features could include gender, age, household size, monthly charges, etc. CPH model can handle both categorical and continuous covariates.", "The CPH model determines the effect that a unit change in a covariate will have on an observation\u2019s survival probability. CPH is a semi-parametric model comprising of two parts:", "The real essence of a semiparametric model lies in the fact that it allows us to have the best of both worlds: a model that is interpretable and can be manipulated (parametric part) while still offering a fair representation of the real-life data without making any assumptions related to its functional form (non-parametric part).", "However, the CPH model has a very strong assumption, called the proportional hazards assumption. This assumption states that a covariate\u2019s associated hazard may change over time, but the hazard ratio remains constant over time. Consider the married binary covariate: the hazard or risk of a married individual dying may change over time. But the ratio of the following two is assumed to remain constant over time:", "We will discuss this assumption in detail and whether any deviations can be tolerated in real-life applications during our practical example later in this post.", "Enough with the theory, let us now turn to a practical case study where we will utilize Survival Analysis techniques on a telco customer data set to predict when specific customers are expected to churn and how much we can afford to spend to retain them.", "All the related survival analysis techniques are included in the lifelines package available for Python. We will use a publicly available dataset of telco customers containing, among other covariates, information on an individual\u2019s tenure/duration with the company together with a binary flag representing whether he has churned or not as at the date of data collection:", "Our initial data exploration reveals the following:", "We will then perform the following feature engineering steps to prepare our data for survival analysis:", "Note: For each dummy variable, we typically drop one of the encoded features to eliminate the risk of multicollinearity. However, we will manually drop a specific dummy variable that is generally representative of our subscriber population. When we drop one of our dummy columns, the value of that dropped column becomes represented in the baseline hazard function. Manually controlling which dummy variable should be dropped ensures that our baseline hazard function is representative of a typical subscriber. Everything else is a deviation away from this recognized baseline, thereby being intuitively understood by the business. Therefore, we will drop that dummy variable that occurs most frequently in our sample.", "The CPH model implementation in lifelines does not work well with highly collinear covariates, so let\u2019s check for the existence of multicollinearity through a heatmap:", "Since the above heatmap does not indicate any high pair-wise correlation, we will continue with our survival analysis.", "Code for steps performed so far, other than that for visualizations and data exploration follows:", "Note: We are lucky here in the sense that our data already has a duration or tenure column. Oftentimes, instead of having these durations, you may encounter start and end times of each observation. lifelines has a handy utility function to convert start and end dates into a NumPy array of floats representing durations and a boolean array of event observations: datetimes_to_durations", "We will start our survival analysis by first plotting a KM curve of our sample that shows us the historical survival probability of an average customer at specific points in time. Remember that the presence of covariates has no impact on a KM curve as it is only concerned with the durations and an event flag. Usually, in practice, KM curves are looked at first to get a feel of our data before a more in-depth analysis through the CPH model.", "Our first KM curve for all customers and with a 5% confidence interval looks something like this:", "The above should give us some basic intuition about our customers. As we would expect for a telecom business, churn is relatively low. Even after 72 months (the max tenure in our data), the company can retain ~60% or more of its customers.", "The rows at the bottom of the plot shows some additional information to be interpreted as follows:", "At this point, we do not know which of our covariates have a material impact on our customer\u2019s survival chances (the CPH model will help us with that). However, intuitively we know that having a more extended fixed-term contract can be expected to affect a customer\u2019s survival probability. To examine this potential impact, we will draw KM curves for each unique value of the Contract column:", "Materially different survival curves we have here with survival probabilities dropping sharply over time for customers on a monthly contract, as expected. Even after three years (at 40 months, to be precise):", "Now comes the more interesting stuff where we will analyze the interaction between survival curves and other covariates in our data. Fitting a CPH model is just like any other ML model in scikit-learn. The following model summary is accessed through the model\u2019s print_summary method:", "The above model summary lists down all of the one-hot encoded covariates analyzed by the CPH model. Let us look at the critical information presented here:", "So our model\u2019s concordance of 0.929 is a pretty good one!", "But what is the Concordance Index?", "A Concordance of 0.929 basically means that our model correctly predicted 92.9 pairs out of 100 on uncensored data. It basically assesses the discriminatory power of a model, i.e., how good is it in differentiating between alive and churned subjects. It is useful to compare two different models. However, concordance does not say anything about how well our model is calibrated \u2014 something that we will evaluate later on.", "A pair here refers to all the possible customer pairs in our data. Consider an example where we have five uncensored customers: A, B, C, D & E. From these five customers, we can have a total of ten possible pairs: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, D), (C, E) and (D, E). In case E is censored, then the Concordance Index calculation will exclude pairs related to E and will consider the remaining eight pairs in the denominator.", "Recall the CPH model\u2019s proportional hazards assumption that was explained above. The PH assumption can be checked using statistical tests and graphical diagnostics based on the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. The assumption is supported by a non-significant relationship between residuals and time (e.g., p > 0.05), and refuted by a significant relationship (e.g., p < 0.05).", "Without going into many technical details, I will instead focus on practical applications only. The PH assumptions can be checked by lifelines\u2019 check_assumptions method on a fitted CPH model. Executing this method will return the names of the covariates that do not satisfy the PH assumption, some generic advice on how to rectify the PH violation potentially, and, for each variable that violates the PH assumption, visual plots of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time transformations (a flat line confirms PH assumption). Refer to this for further details.", "Upon checking the PH assumption for our model, we find that 3 of our covariates do not conform to it. However, project\u2019s purpose, we will ignore these warnings since our end objective is survival prediction and not to determine inference or correlation to understand the influence of a covariate on the survival duration and outcome. Refer to this for further details as to why we can safely ignore these deviations.", "lifelines library has a built-in function to perform k-fold cross-validation of our fitted model. Running it using the concordance index as the scoring parameter results in an average concordance index of 0.928 across ten folds.", "The Concordance Index does not say anything about the model\u2019s calibration \u2014 i.e., how far are the predicted probabilities from the actual true probabilities? We can draw a calibration curve to check this propensity of our model to predict probabilities at any given time correctly. Let us now plot a calibration curve at t = 12 using sklearn\u2019s calibration_curve function:", "Given our data\u2019s skewed distribution between churned and non-churned customers, we have set calibration_curve\u2019s strategy parameter to \u2018quantile\u2019. This will ensure that each bin will have the same number of samples based on the predicted churn probabilities for the 12th month. This is desirable as otherwise, we would have equal width bins that would not be representative given the unbalanced class distribution between churned/non-churned customers.", "The above calibration plot shows us that for the first seven deciles plotted, our CPH model under-predicted the churn risk and overpredicted for the last two.", "Overall, the calibration curve doesn\u2019t look too bad. Let\u2019s confirm it by calculating the Brier Score, which we find to be 0.17 (0 is an ideal Brier Score), not bad at all!", "We can also plot the Brier Score for each month, as follows:", "We can see that our model is reasonable calibrated between 5 and ~20 months and then deteriorates as we start to predict further out in time.", "Let us now visualize the coefficients and hazard ratios of all the covariates analyzed in the CPH model:", "Through this plot, we can quickly identify the specific customer characteristics that are critical to predicting churn.", "Covariates likely to result in churn:", "Covariates likely to help with customer retention:", "Let us now plot and visualize the effect of varying a covariate over the survival curve at specified levels together with the baseline survival curve:", "Evident that customers whose total spend is closer to zero are more at-risk (their survival curve drops off sharply) than those whose total spend is closer to 3,000 or more. Further, having a long-term contract improves the customer\u2019s survival probability.", "All the code related to CPH modeling, validation, visualization is below:", "So now we know which covariates we can focus on to reduce the churn risk of our existing right-censored customers, i.e., those that have not churned yet.

That is, estimate the remaining life of our customers.", "predict_survival_function\u2019s output will be a matrix containing survival probability for each remaining customer at specific future points in time up to the maximum historical duration in our data. So if the maximum duration in our data was 70 months, predict_survival_function would predict for the next 70 months from today. The method also allows us to calculate the survival probability for a specific month in the future (useful to answer questions like how many customers do we expect to retain by the end of the next 3 and 6 months) through the times parameter.", "Example output from predict_survival_function for two specific customers:", "The customer in column 15 is expected to be 99.9% alive after 73 months from now, while that in 16 is expected to have a 74.4% probability of alive after only 4 months.", "We can use these survival probabilities to identify the specific month for each customer where his/her likelihood of survival falls below a certain threshold. Depending on the use case, we can choose any percentile, but for our project, we\u2019ll use the median through the median_survival_times method. qth_survival_times can be used for any other percentile.", "The output of the median_survival_times method is a single row representing the future month where the survival probability of each censored/alive customer falls below the median survival probability:", "inf basically means that this customer is almost sure to be alive.", "Next up, we will perform the following:", "Our data, sorted on descending order of expected loss, looks something like this now:", "We have now identified the customers who pose the highest monetary risk to us if they were to leave us today.", "What can we do to retain them? The coefficients from our CPH model and associated KM survival curves indicate what features we need to focus on to retain our current customers. However, let\u2019s now try to estimate the monetary benefit if we can convince our customers to sign up for these specific features that prevent churn if they are not already subscribed to them.", "Accordingly, we will estimate the potential uplift in our revenue for the following features if we can get a customer who does not have the following to subscribe/sign on for them.", "We will now calculate the potential uplift for each of the above covariates and each customer through nested for loops under hypothetical scenarios. For example, we can calculate the revised expected churn month if he signs up for a one year contract in case he was not on a one year contract.", "Our initial uplift analysis results in something like this:", "Now we have the revised expected churn month for each customer if we can sign up for a specific feature, ceteris paribus. For example, we can expect customer 7590-VHVEG to stay with us for 11 more months if we can just get him to sign up for a one year contract, ceteris paribus. Or he is expected to stay for 4 additional months if he sets up automatic payments, ceteris paribus.", "As noted earlier, we have some very good customers with low churn risk, represented by inf values in the baseline month. We do not need to focus our marketing efforts on them for the time being. So we will exclude them from further analysis.", "Let us go a step further and see the customer-wise financial impact of each potential upgrade over the expected revised lifetime, instead of just the expected additional months. This is a simple calculation whereby we take the difference between the baseline and revised churn month for each covariate and multiply that by the monthly charges.", "So now we know the following for customer 7590-VHVEG:", "All the code related to churn prediction and prevention analysis is below:", "Now we have some actionable insights into not only which of our customers are at risk of churning, but some actionable insights as well with regards to expected time to churn and potential uplift in revenue through the introduction of customer-specific strategies.", "The complete Jupyter notebook is available on GitHub here.", "As always, feel free to reach out to me if you would like to discuss anything related to data analytics, machine learning, financial and credit risk analysis.", "Your home for data science.
