That task can be such a demanding task.", "That being said, the ability to read others\u2019 code efficiently is one of the skills that could make one\u2019s job in software engineering much more pleasant. Unfortunately, it is also a skill that is widely overlooked by schools, bootcamps, and companies. It is one of those skills that everyone assumes you know, or be good at, just because you know how to write code.", "The thing about writing code is, everyone has their own coding style. Reading code is not like reading a novel or a story; it\u2019s not just about reading instructions on the screen. Instead, when you read code written by someone else, you\u2019re not just reading their code. You\u2019re trying to get into their thoughts process and what they were thinking when they wrote that code.", "Needless to say, that is an extremely challenging task. But, it\u2019s a task that you can make exponentially easier. In this article, I will walk you through my 4 steps process of reading and understanding other people\u2019s code.", "To explain the different steps, I will go through a code I wrote for a web scraping tutorial.", "Whenever you get a code that you need to read and understand, the first thing \u2014 and most apparent, I may argue \u2014 to do is to run the code and see what it does. What does it take as inputs? What are the outputs?", "So, let\u2019s go ahead and run the code above and explore the results.", "Not all codes will result in a chart; some codes\u2019 output will be a text output. Regardless of the output type, we can explore it to guess \u2014 if you don\u2019t already know \u2014 the general idea of what the code was written to do.", "However, this might not give you a lot of details about the details of the code, or if this code was a part of a bigger project, you might not know how it all connects, but you will learn how to build it and run it. Also, you will get to know about the libraries it uses and the frameworks it depends on.", "Nevertheless, running the code will give you the information you need to understand it better, and to make sure you got every dependency, you need to start working and expanding it.", "Now that we know what the code does and what the output is/are, we can start looking deeper into its details. To do that, we need to pinpoint the start of the code. If you\u2019re using a programming language with a must main function, like C, C++, or Java, start from there and walk your way through to the other functions.", "If you\u2019re using Python, however, not all codes will have a main function, but you can use the indentations to know where the code starts. For example, in the code above, we have multiple functions, and then the starting point of the code is on line 80.", "So, we can start going through the comments first \u2014 if there is any \u2014 and go through the entire main section of the code without going into the details of the subfunctions.", "Going through the main function gives you the general flow of the code, what each subfunction does, not how they work, but what they do.", "Once you\u2019re done carefully reading the main part of the code, you may find it useful to run the code in debugging mode. The reason for that is, when you run code in the debugger, it allows you to observe how your code interacts with the memory.", "It will show you how each variable changes with every step in the code. Doing so will give you a more in-depth understanding of the inner functionality of the code and its different functions.", "Once you see how each variable in the code changes with every line, you can start adding your own comments in the code, explaining to yourself what every line of the code does.", "One thing I found to help tremendously is to build a mindmap of the code connections while I am running it in the debugger mode. The debugger mode shows you a clear connection between the different code items.", "Start with the name of the code file in the middle of your mindmap and then branch out with the different functions and how they connect. Try ti encourage the variables in the code into the mindmap as well, maybe not all of them, but the ones that have the most effect on the overall results.", "Moreover, try to include the inputs and outputs of the code as well as their types or expected types. Here\u2019s the mindmap for the code above.", "Building the mindmap will save you so much time whenever you interact with this codebase. It will help you know the connection in case you want to add or remove any parts of the code.", "Reading code written by other developers can be such a challenging task; you need to understand their logic, their style, and their specific choices. I have read so many codes written by programmers of different levels and ages. Having experienced that, I came with my own 4 steps process to ease up reading, exploring, and understanding codes written by basically someone who is not me.", "This 4 step process is simple and will save you a lot of time and effort; all you need to do is:", "I hope you find these steps useful in saving you much time and effort in your next code exploration adventure.", "\u201cIndeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. \u2026[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.\u201d", "Your home for data science.
