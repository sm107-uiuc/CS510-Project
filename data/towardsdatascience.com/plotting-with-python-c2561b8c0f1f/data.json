We will do this by utilizing data from the World Happiness Report 2019. I enriched the World Happiness Report data with information from Gapminder and Wikipedia to allow for the exploration of new relationships and visualizations.", "The World Happiness Report tries to answer which factors influence happiness throughout the world.", "Happiness in the report is defined as the responses to the \u201cCantril ladder question\u201d asking respondents to value their lives today on a 0 to 10 scale, with the worst possible life as a 0 and the best possible life as a 10.", "Throughout this article, I am going to use Life Ladder as a target variable. Whenever we talk about Life Ladder, think Happiness.", "This article is intended as a code-along guide and a point of reference to revisit whenever you want to look up a specific type of plot. I will, for the sake of space, sometimes combine multiple charts into one image. But rest assured, you can find all the underlying code in this Repo or the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.", "I hyperlinked the different sections of the article, so feel free to jump straight to the plotting sections if you don\u2019t care about the intro. I won\u2019t judge.", "I started learning Python more seriously about two years ago. Since then, rarely a week has passed where I did not marvel at the simplicity and ease of use of Python itself or one of the many amazing open source libraries in the ecosystem. The more commands, patterns, and concepts I become familiar with, the more everything just makes sense.", "The opposite holds true for plotting with Python. Initially, almost every chart I created with Matplotlib looked like a crime escaped from the eighties. What makes matters worse is that to create said abominations, I typically had to spend hours on Stackoverflow. Researching nitty-gritty commands to change the slant of the x-ticks or something similarly silly, for example. Don\u2019t even get me started on multi charts. The results look impressive, and it is a fantastic feeling to create those charts programmatically. For example, generating 50 charts for different variables in one go. However, it is just so much work and requires you to memorize a whole lot of otherwise useless commands.", "Learning about Seaborn was a relief. Seaborn abstracts away a lot of the fine-tuning. The aesthetics of the resulting charts are, without a doubt, a big leap forward. However, it is also built on top of Matplotlib. Frequently it would still be necessary to go down to what feels like machine-level matplotlib code for non-standard adjustments.", "For a brief glimpse in time, I thought Bokeh would become my goto solution. I came across Bokeh when I was working on geospatial visualizations. However, I quickly realized that Bokeh, while different, was just as stupidly complicated as matplotlib.", "I did try out plot.ly (from now on referenced as plotly) a while ago. While, again, working on the visualization of geospatial data. Back then, it seemed even more absurd than the libraries mentioned earlier. You needed an account, had to log in through your notebook, and then plotly would render everything online. Then you would download the resulting chart. I quickly discarded plotly. However, recently, I came across a Youtube video about plotly express and plotly 4.0, where most importantly, they got rid of all this online nonsense. I played around with it, and this article is the result of it. Better late than never, I guess.", "While not a Python library by any means, Kepler.gl is a potent web-based visualization tool for geospatial data. All you need are CSV files, which you can easily create with Python. Give it a try!", "Ultimately I settled on using Pandas native plotting for quick inspections and Seaborn for charts I want to use in reports and presentations (where visuals matter).", "I taught statistics (Stats 119) while studying in San Diego. Stats 119 is an intro class to statistics. The curriculum included statistical fundamentals like data aggregation (visual and quantitative), concepts of odds and probabilities, regression, sampling, and most importantly distributions. This time was the time my understanding of quantities and phenomena almost entirely shifted to one that is based on representation through distributions (most of the time, Gaussian).", "To this day, I find it astonishing how far the two quantities mean, and standard deviation can get you in grasping a phenomenon. By merely knowing these two numbers, it is straightforward to conclude how likely a specific outcome is. One immediately knows where the bulk of the results are going to be. It gives you a framework of reference to quickly distinguish anecdotal events from statistically significant ones without having to go through overly complicated calculations.", "Generally speaking, my first step when being confronted with new data is to try to visualize its distribution to get a good understanding of the data.", "Let\u2019s load the data we are going to use throughout the article. I did apply some preprocessing to the data. I inter- and extrapolated where it made sense.", "The dataset contains values for the following columns:", "Pandas has built-in plotting functionalities that can be called on a Series or DataFrame. What I love about these plotting functions is that they are concise, they use reasonably smart defaults, and they quickly give an idea of what is going on.", "To create a plot, call .plot(kind=<TYPE OF PLOT>) on your data, like this:", "Running the above command will produce the following chart.", "There are five main parameters that I use when plotting with Pandas:", "Let\u2019s quickly go through the different available types of plots.", "Plotting with pandas is convenient. It is easily accessible, and it is fast. The plots are fairly ugly. Deviating from defaults is borderline impossible, and that is okay because we have other tools for more aesthetically appealing charts. Moving on to seaborn.", "Seaborn utilizes plotting defaults. To make sure that your results match mine, run the following commands.", "As mentioned before, I am a big fan of distributions. Histograms and kernel density distributions alike are potent ways of visualizing the critical features of a particular variable. Let\u2019s look at how we generate distributions for a single variable or distributions of multiple variables in one chart.", "Whenever I want to explore the relationship between two or multiple variables visually, it typically comes down to some form of scatterplot and an assessment of distributions. There are three variations of a conceptually similar plot. In each of those plots, the center graph (scatter, bivariate KDE, and hexbin) helps to understand the joint frequency distribution between two variables. Additionally, at the right and top border of the center graph, the marginal univariate distribution of the respective variable is depicted (as a KDE or histogram).", "A scatterplot is a way of visualizing the joint density distribution of two variables. We can throw a third variable in the mix by adding a hue and a fourth variable by adding the size parameter.", "The violin plot is a combination of a box plot and a kernel density estimate. It plays a similar role as a box plot. It shows the distribution of quantitative data across categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared.", "The Seaborn pair plot plots all combinations of two-variable scatter plots in a large grid. I typically feel like this is a bit of information overload, but it can help to spot patterns.", "Seaborn\u2019s FacetGrid, to me, is one of the most convincing arguments to use Seaborn as it makes creating multi-plots a breeze. With the pair plot, we already have seen an example of a FacetGrid. The FacetGrid allows creating multiple charts segmented by variables. For example, the rows could be one variable (category of GDP per capita) and the columns another one (continents).", "It does require a bit more customization (i.e., using matplotlib) then I\u2019d personally like, but it is nonetheless compelling.", "It is also possible to add facet specific notation to each chart in a grid. In the following example, we add the mean and the standard deviation and a vertical line drawn at the mean (code below).", "One of my favorite plot types is a heatmap FacetGrid, i.e., a heatmap in every facet of the grid. This type of plot is useful to visualize four dimensions and a metric in one single plot. The code is a bit cumbersome but can be adjusted quickly to your needs. It is noteworthy that this kind of chart requires a relatively large amount of data or proper segmentation as it does not handle missing values very well.", "Finally, no more Matplotlib! Plotly has three vital features:", "We call plotly plots by running fig = x.<PLOT TYPE>(PARAMS) and then fig.show() like this:", "That\u2019s it for today. In this article, you learned how to become a real Python visualization ninja. You learned how to be more efficient when it comes to quick explorations and how to create more beautiful charts when it\u2019s time for that damned board meeting again. You learned how to create interactive plotly charts, which are especially useful when it comes to plotting geospatial data.", "Reach out to me on LinkedIn if you discover some fantastic new visualizations, want to give feedback, or simply have a chat.", "If you liked what you\u2019ve read check out the other articles I wrote on Medium.", "Your home for data science.
