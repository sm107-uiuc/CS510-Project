the 19th century, doctors might have prescribed mercury for mood swings and arsenic for asthma. It might not have occurred to them to wash their hands before your surgery. They weren\u2019t trying to kill you, of course \u2014 they just didn\u2019t know any better.", "These early doctors had valuable data scribbled in their notebooks, but each held only one piece in a grand jigsaw puzzle. Without modern tools for sharing and analyzing information \u2014 as well as a science for making sense of that data \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much to stop superstition from superseding what could be seen through a keyhole of observable facts.", "Humans have come a long way with technology since then, but today\u2019s boom in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) isn\u2019t really a break with the past. It\u2019s the continuation of the basic human instinct to make sense of the world around us so that we can make smarter decisions. We simply have dramatically better technology than we\u2019ve ever had before.", "Today\u2019s boom in AI isn\u2019t really a break with the past. We simply have dramatically better technology than we\u2019ve ever had before.", "One way to think of this pattern through the ages is as a revolution of datasets, not data points. The difference isn\u2019t trivial. Datasets helped shape the modern world.", "Consider the scribes of Sumer (modern day Iraq), who pressed their styluses to tablets of clay more than 5,000 years ago. When they did so, they invented not just the first system of writing, but the first data storage and sharing technology.", "If you\u2019re inspired by the promise of AI\u2019s better-than-human abilities, consider that stationery gives us superhuman memory. Though it\u2019s easy to take writing for granted today, the ability to store datasets reliably represents a ground-breaking first step on the path to higher intelligence.", "If you\u2019re inspired by the promise of AI\u2019s better-than-human abilities, consider that stationery gives us superhuman memory.", "Unfortunately, retrieving information from clay tablets and their pre-electronic cousins is a pain. You can\u2019t snap your fingers at a book to get its word count. Instead, you\u2019d have to upload every word into your brain to process it. This made early data analysis time-consuming, so initial forays into it stuck to the essentials. While a kingdom might analyze how much gold it raised in taxes, only an intrepid soul would try the same line of effortful reasoning on an application like, say, medicine, where millennia of tradition encouraged just winging it.", "Luckily, our species produced some incredible pioneers. For example, John Snow\u2019s map of deaths during the 1858 cholera outbreak in London inspired the medical profession to reconsider the superstition that the disease was caused by miasma (toxic air) and to start taking a closer look at the drinking water.", "If you know \u201cThe Lady With The Lamp,\u201d Florence Nightingale, for her heroic compassion as a nurse, you might be surprised to learn that she was also an analytics pioneer. Her inventive infographics during the Crimean War saved many lives by identifying poor hygiene as a leading cause of hospital deaths and inspiring her government to take sanitation seriously.", "The one-dataset era took off as the value of information began to assert itself in a growing number of fields, leading to the invention of the computer. No, not the electronic buddy you\u2019re used to today. \u201cComputer\u201d started out as a human profession, with its practitioners performing computations and processing data manually to extract its value.", "The beauty of data is that it allows you to form an opinion out of something better than thin air. By taking a look at information, you\u2019re inspired to ask new questions, following in the footsteps of Florence Nightingale and John Snow. That\u2019s what the discipline of analytics is all about: inspiring models and hypotheses through exploration.", "Unfortunately, without a second dataset, you can\u2019t know if this data-inspired opinion of yours is nonsense or not. Does it work in general, outside the specific datapoints you looked at? You have no legitimate way of knowing. Welcome to analytics in the 1900s.", "You can\u2019t trust your findings because your unconscious biases (such as confirmation bias) take the wheel \u2014 you\u2019ll immediately see whatever is most convenient to see and you\u2019ll miss all the rest. You may think you\u2019re seeing all there is to see, but you\u2019re actually barely scratching the surface. We humans have smaller attention spans and memories than we like to think, so exploratory datasets are often a sort of baboon trap for us.", "Analytics is about inspiration and exploration, but opinions that grasp beyond the data explored cannot be taken seriously.", "To test your opinion about how the world beyond your data works, you can\u2019t use the data that inspired that opinion in the first place. Our species finds Elvis\u2019s face in potato chips. While this chip might look like Elvis, we can\u2019t use it to conclude that most chips do. To learn whether our opinion is to be taken seriously beyond the examples that inspired them, we must test them on new chips we haven\u2019t seen before.", "In the early 20th century, a desire to make better decisions under uncertainty led to the birth of a parallel profession: statistics. Statisticians help you test whether it\u2019s sensible to behave as though a phenomenon also applies beyond your current dataset.", "Statistical rigor requires you to call your shots before you take them; analytics is more a game of advanced hindsight.", "A famous example is associated with the world\u2019s first statistics textbook. Its author describes performing a hypothesis test in response to his friend\u2019s claim that she could taste whether milk was added to tea before or after the water. Hoping to prove her wrong, he was instead forced by the data to conclude that she could.", "Analytics and statistics have a major Achilles\u2019 heel: If you use the same data point for hypothesis generation and for hypothesis testing, you\u2019re cheating. (Read this to understand why.) If you choose to use your data for rigor instead of inspiration, you have to get your inspiration elsewhere. The classic source is thinking hard. In other words, you sit and meditate in a broom closet, carefully framing your statistical question, articulating all your assumptions, and then you\u2019ve got one shot at testing whether your mental model of the world actually holds any water.", "Unfortunately, it takes an awful lot of effort and training to mathematically specify the entirety of your hunch in such a way as to test it. You need quite the mental focus. But at least now you have a legitimate way of checking whether your impressions are worth acting on. Welcome to statistics in the late 1900s.", "Statistical rigor requires you to call your shots before you take them; analytics is more a game of advanced hindsight. These disciplines were almost tragicomically incompatible, until the next major revolution \u2014 data splitting \u2014 changed everything.", "Data splitting is a simple idea, but to a data scientist like myself, it\u2019s one of the most profound. If you have only one dataset, you must choose between analytics (untestable inspiration) and statistics (rigorous conclusions). The hack? Split your dataset into two pieces, then have your cake and eat it too!", "The two-dataset era replaces the analytics-statistics tension with coordinated teamwork between two different breeds of data specialist. Analysts use one dataset to help you frame your questions, then statisticians use the other dataset to bring you rigorous answers.", "Split your dataset into two pieces, then have your cake and eat it too!", "Such luxury comes with a hefty price tag: quantity. Splitting is easier said than done if you\u2019ve struggled to scrape together enough information for even one respectable dataset. The two-dataset era is a fairly new development that goes hand-in-hand with better processing hardware, lower storage costs and the ability to share collected information over the internet.", "In fact, the technological innovations that led to the two-dataset era rapidly ushered in the next phase, a three-dataset era of automated inspiration. There\u2019s a more familiar word for it: machine learning.", "Ever wondered why statisticians tend to be tend to be on the twitchy side when it comes to rigor and data? Looking at a dataset before you\u2019ve planned your questions destroys its purity as a source of statistical rigor. If you ask the wrong question or you ask it foolishly, you don\u2019t get to ask the oracle a second time.", "Even if you\u2019re thinking about making multiple comparisons corrections \u2014 that statistical incantation that allows multiple hypotheses per dataset \u2014 your procedures are only valid if you plan all your hypotheses in advance. You\u2019re not allowed to play 20 questions with your test dataset, zooming in on a shiny result iteratively and pretending that you\u2019ve kept your hands clean.", "Testing is still a one-shot proposition \u2014 you\u2019re not allowed to go creeping iteratively towards a solution.", "For the rigorous approach to be valid, you must plan up front, use some apology-laden math if there\u2019s more than one question, then execute the tests simultaneously one time. You may not open that test dataset more than once.", "Since you only get one shot, how do you know which \u201cinsight\u201d from analytics is most worthy of testing? Well, if you had a third dataset, you could use it to take your inspiration for a test drive. This screening process is called validation; it\u2019s at the heart of what makes machine learning tick.", "Validation is at the heart of what makes machine learning tick \u2014 it allows you to automate inspiration.", "Once you\u2019re free to throw everything at the validation wall and see what sticks, you can safely let everyone have a go at coming up with a solution: seasoned analyst, intern, tea leaves, and even algorithms with no context about your business problem. Whichever solution works best in validation becomes a candidate for the proper statistical test. You\u2019ve just empowered yourself to automate inspiration!", "This is why machine learning is a revolution of datasets, not just data. It depends on the luxury of having enough data for a three-way split.", "Where does artificial intelligence (AI) fit into the picture? Machine learning with deep neural networks is technically called deep learning, but it got another nickname that stuck: AI. Although AI once had a different meaning, today you\u2019re most likely to find it used as a synonym for deep learning.", "Deep neural networks earned their hype by virtue of outclassing less sophisticated ML algorithms on many complex tasks. But they require much more data to train them, and with processing requirements beyond those of a typical laptop. That\u2019s why the rise of modern AI is a cloud story; the cloud allows you to rent someone else\u2019s data center instead of committing to building your deep learning rig, making AI a try-before-you-buy proposition.", "The rise of modern AI is a cloud story, since the cloud makes AI a try-before-you-buy proposition.", "With this puzzle piece in place, we have the full complement of professions: ML/AI, analytics and statistics. The umbrella term that encompasses all of them is called data science, the discipline of making data useful.", "Modern data science is the product of our three-dataset era, but many industries routinely generate more than enough data. So is there a case for four datasets?", "Well, what\u2019s your next move if the model you just trained gets a low validation score? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019ll immediately demand to know why! Unfortunately, there\u2019s no dataset you can ask. You might be tempted to go sleuthing in your validation dataset, but unfortunately debugging breaks its ability to screen your models effectively.", "By subjecting your validation dataset to analytics, you\u2019re effectively turning your three datasets back into two. Instead of finding help, you\u2019ve unwittingly gone back an era!", "The solution lies outside the three datasets you\u2019re already using. To unlock smarter training iteration and hyperparameter tuning, you\u2019ll want to join the cutting edge: an era of four datasets.", "The cutting edge is four-way data splitting to fuel acceleration.", "If you think of the other three datasets as giving you inspiration, iteration and rigorous testing, then the fourth fuels acceleration, shortening your AI development cycle through advanced analytics techniques geared at providing clues as to what approaches to try on each round. By embracing four-way data splitting, you\u2019ll be in the best position to take advantage of data abundance! Welcome to the future.", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "Let\u2019s be friends!
