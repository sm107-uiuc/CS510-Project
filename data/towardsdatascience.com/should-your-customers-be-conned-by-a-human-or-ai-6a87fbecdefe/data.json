We are looking to get honest feedback gold from someone with very little up front investment to avoid building everything. You should be considering what problems people have and their solutions.", "Talked about AI usually starts with the singularity or how it is magic. When the real discussion starts there is a focus on automation since it cuts costs or saves personnel. We should consider how AI can be assistive, augmentative, agentive, and even generative for human needs.", "Through MVPs you learn about the real problems that people have so you can iteratively build something that solves those problems. Human\u2019s provide the purpose to machines. Most of the time people will need to be part of the solution for exceptions that the machine will not do a good job with.", "For products with AI you need to be asking some important questions: will your customers trust a human-first or machine-first system? Do you want people to expect that a human being, with all of their quirks, is available? Or do you want to cold efficiency and lack of bias from machines?", "We will talk about the pros and cons of each model and how to avoid the common pitfalls when building for AI, machine learning, deep learning, and other machine intelligence.", "The \u2018concierge\u2019 is how you solve a customer\u2019s problem yourself. You reduce the interface down to direct communication between a human and the customer. Solving the customer\u2019s problem is done with a human touch.", "In particular, you are learning how to solve these problems by actually doing it yourself. In the case of a concierge solution, the most valuable learnings come from exposure to all the cases you didn\u2019t think of when you conceived the service.", "AI will generally play an automation or assistive roles to the human playing the concierge to get their job done faster. Over time the service is improved to automate more of the human\u2019s tasks from rote to complex and remove the noise from the decision making processes.", "StitchFix is a great example of a company that employed a concierge model to deliver their service. It has grown over time to be more generative in how they decide which clothing to stock. StitchFix\u2019s algorithms help the stylists make decisions on what clothing to send customers.", "Brad Klingenberg, Director of Styling Algorithms, did a great talk about Humans in the Loop uses of AI. Rather than just one AI feedback cycle there are multiple including tools for the stylists, customers, warehouse, etc.:", "The concierge MVP technique breaks down when you need large scale. Generally this is a good problem to have but signals that you need to find another way to do things than just scaling up the number of people.", "When planning to use AI, you may not get access to the data or be able to train the right model to replace a significant amount of the human intervention as you scale.", "The Wizard of Oz is when you make it seem like it is all being done by a machine but it is really a human behind it. You build out an UX facade of a service that appears to be fully mechanized but you actually have a human pulling the levers in the background. This is best when you know the basics and build that into the facade but don\u2019t assume many exceptions.", "The expectations of the customer is that this is a service that should just work. If it doesn\u2019t work it will communicate the errors well to them. They don\u2019t expect a complex conversation with a person (or autonomous agent).", "What is powerful about the Wizard of Oz MVP for AI is that the human behind the scenes is creating labeled data from interactions. The human will be taking the ideal action the machine should eventually take.", "Expensify, a great expensing management service, is a good example of a Wizard of Oz for their receipt SmartScan technology. When they first were starting to parse photos of receipts they would do some amount automatically but would use Mechanical Turk to parse the receipts (besides some controversy). If you aren\u2019t familiar with Mechanical Turk (MT) it is a service by Amazon to outsource short tasks to real humans for a few pennies each task.", "There are some issues with MTs human assistance that are related to the gig economy. When you don\u2019t know that humans are doing the job people don\u2019t worry about treating them as humans.", "The Wizard of Oz isn\u2019t always right for the service though. A poor example of this is most chatbots. They are putting forward the idea of an automated system in a conversation with the customer but really need humans to power most of it initially. This is a bad use of the Wizard of Oz because you are setting the expectations incorrectly.", "In summary, the MVP models maximize different things but still try to get to the core of what is needed by the customer.", "The less you know about customer and their problems the better the concierge will help you find that out.", "The more you think you know about your customers and their problems the better a Wizard of Oz will help you validate and invalidate that knowledge.", "For a more in depth background on both of these MVPs check out some great posts by Allen Cheng and Grasshopper Herder.", "Beyond the benefit for learning about your customers and their problems you are able to test how they feel about human-first or AI-first interfaces. Either way you should be building centaur systems that combine the best of humans and machines.", "When considering these two options you need to think about the trust that you will build over time. Again: Do you want people to expect that a human being, with all of their quirks, are available? Or do you want to cold efficiency and lack of bias from machines?", "In the end, it comes down to the niche you are trying to fit in people\u2019s lives. Here are some questions when talking to customers about your MVP, performing user research, or testing your prototype:", "Running exercises with your end customers can be beneficial too. At Philosophie, we have used Empathy Mapping for the Machine to help understand what the expectations are from the humans interacting with the service. Confusion Mapping can help understand how error cases for the system impact customer outcomes. These exercises avoid AI jargon by asking outcome-focused questions related to what customers actually need.", "Humans should be in the loop for handling exceptions, but we should always consider how we solve people\u2019s problems in a meaningful way. You need to think about whether your customers want a human or a machine to help them for their problem.", "Your home for data science.
