This time with an example at hand which has, unfortunately, become very relevant over the last 4 months (Its July 05th, 2020 today) with COVID-19. We will be using a simulated example to help us understand how accuracy, as a measure in an imbalanced dataset, can be misleading.", "Let\u2019s assume that a company releases a COVID test-kit claiming that their test achieved a \u201c95% accuracy\u201d in its trial run. There is a catch in the claim that the organization does not disclose as part of its release letter. The test isn\u2019t actually performing a medical check internally, the kit is rigged and marks everyone as \u201cno COVID\u201d by default. Let\u2019s see how we can make sure we are not misled.", "Before we move further, let's quickly look at the following diagram which explains the ratios that the terms precision and recall stand for", "Precision: gives us a ratio of our \u201ctrue positives\u201d within \u201call the positive predictions we have made\u201d", "Recall: gives us the ratio of our \u201ctrue positives\u201d within \u201call actual positive values\u201d (the false negatives in the denominator are the negative predictions we incorrectly made that were actually positive)", "Accuracy: on the other hand, is the ratio of \u201call our correct predictions (both Positive and Negative)\u201d to \u201call the predictions we made (all samples)\u201d", "Lets circle back to the case we discussed in the first section. The test-kit developed by the company claiming 95% accuracy. We find out that on average, 5 out of 100 people in a trial test are actually COVID positive (we consider this to be our source of truth for our considerations here). The dataset, therefore, is an imbalanced dataset(a 19:1 ratio).", "Remember, the test-kit, by default, will mark every one of the 100 patients as \u201cnot-COVID\u201d.", "Let's draw the confusion matrix below:", "Understanding the values in the confusion matrix:", "Let's calculate the values of each of the three metrics one-by-one:", "If we only look at the accuracy, this looks like a superb innovation for test-kits and can be released to a larger audience, but wait, do we trust the kit only based on the accuracy metric? Let\u2019s calculating precision and recall next", "4. We can also look at the F1 score which is a weighted average of Precision and Recall.", "which in this case would amount to an N/A as the Precision is N/A", "Both Precision and Recall tell us that the kit is rigged because the scores are either 0 or N/A, raising sufficient doubts about the test.
