The majority of logic textbooks contain an opening, central definition for an argument \u2014 one that likely sounds much like the following:", "An argument contains one or more special statements, called premises , offered as a reason to believe that a further statement, called the conclusion, is true", "Premises are the atoms of logic theory: everything is built up from them. A premise is a declarative statement that must strictly evaluate to only either true or false. A single premise is referred to as a primitive premise \u2014 there are 50 states in the U.S.A (which is true). Connecting multiple premises together form a compound premise \u2014 there are 50 states in the U.S.A and it snowed in Miami today (which is false). How does one connect multiple statements? Like you see in the previous example, with operators that you\u2019re already familiar with but that require their own language & syntax.", "Similar to other branches of math, premises have their own set of fundamental operators (adding, subtracting, etc\u2026). In logic theory, five basic logical connectors, collectively known as connectives, fill this role. They\u2019re summarized in the table below, assume the letters P & Q represent two primitive premises:", "If you\u2019ve been exposed to programming at any level, then it\u2019s highly likely that the table above seems at least vaguely familiar. This is because connectives are at the very core of common language syntax & almost always have some special character designated for each connective (&& = and, | = or, etc\u2026).", "Which of the five connectives is used as a logical connector between two premises determines the overall truth value of the compound statement based on the truth values of the premises being modified. An important principle here that might seem counter-intuitive at first is worth extracting: when analyzing compound statements it\u2019s not necessary to know what parts P & Q actually say, only whether those parts are true or false.", "Of the five connectives, one is immediately worthy of further inspection \u2014 the implication, aka, if-then statements. The implication is a connective with the standard form of P \u2192 Q where P is known as the hypothesis (or antecedent), & Q is known as the conclusion (or consequent).", "While the implication has a standard form defined above, there exists three other common types of conditionals that are worth reviewing. The following four conditionals are simple yet quite common & powerful compound statements made by combining conditionals with the core connectives introduced:", "A conditional is itself a compound premise, that is, it strictly evaluates to either true or false. For any implication, just like for any other connective, the truth value of the compound premise is determined by the truth values of its two independent premises. Corresponding with the definitions introduced above, for example, an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false, or when the conclusion is true; which leaves only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true & the conclusion is false.", "If that seemed like a lot to track mentally, as it did for me, then breath easy & rest assure that powerful tools lay in the near future that makes analyzing complex conditionals as simple as following a blueprint. The main tool we\u2019ll use is a nifty logic-101 tool by the name of truth tables. Before we get into truth tables, however, let\u2019s make a quick detour to fill one last gap in our knowledge of basic logic theory notation. Inspect a peculiar scenario \u2014 is the following statement a premise?", "Under our strict definition introduced in the opening paragraph, a premise must evaluate to either true or false \u2014 the statement cannot be ambiguous or left open-ended. Which means that variables, as we\u2019re used to seeing them since algebra, is a no-no in logic theory; not at least without some modification.", "The bolded statement above is not considered a premise as x could be 5 or 25, making the statement true or false, but currently neither. This, however, doesn\u2019t mean that we have to delete variables from our tool set altogether. There is a way to make use of variables; the process is called quantifying, a clever way of notating bounds on unknown variables in logic. Take a look at the following, updates statement \u2014 is this now a premise?", "for all x, x is larger than one hundred", "Now that we\u2019ve defined the universe, or domain, of the variable, the statement is no longer ambigious \u2014 it\u2019s now a premise as it evaluates to categorically false. The use of this \u201cfor all x\u201d is known in logic theory as applying a quantifier. There are two main types of quantifiers. The first, which we\u2019ve just seen, is aptly named the universal quantifier. Dictated by an upside down \u201cA\u201d, \u2200, it\u2019s easy to remember that it stands for All or every possible instance within the universe of the statement made. Inspect this second alteration:", "there exists an x larger than one hundred", "Once again without removing the variables we\u2019ve found a way to convert a statement into a premise by applying a quantifier as the statement now evaluates strictly to true. This second type of quantifier is known as the existential quantifier. Notated by a backwards \u201cE\u201d, \u2203, it usually reads as \u201cthere exists\u201d or \u201cthere is.\u201d Both quantifiers are summarized below:", "Now with basic notation out of the way, it\u2019s time to leap to an elementary form of application through truth tables. In the next part, we\u2019ll start by first defining equivalency in logic; in order to use truth tables to analyze which, if any, of the four conditionals we introduced are equal to each other. After inspecting a few example statements, we\u2019ll finally head to the core of logic theory: proofs.", "Logic: The Theory of Formal InferenceThe Foundations of Mathematics", "Your home for data science.
