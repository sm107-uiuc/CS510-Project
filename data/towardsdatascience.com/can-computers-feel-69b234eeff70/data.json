Many see the misuse of such technology and have anxiety over a dystopian future created by people driven by greed or a misguided curiosity. Some of us fear more science fiction inspired futures, with the AI as our overlords and a dystopian future akin to Terminator movies. Many are concerned with computers not having an understanding of emotions or a sense of empathy, and with this being a driving force behind us either being eradicated or simply manipulated by other humans. We imagine the machines as seeing us as a threat, as a disease or \u201cvirus\u201d as agent Smith puts it in The Matrix. Is this reasonable? Is this fear justified? What if computers already understand empathy and altruism better than we do? What if this is more a reflection of humans judging themselves than of any actual danger we might face? Just how well can computers understand human emotions today? Where are we in the timeline of becoming subservient to machines? In this article, we will take a look at current technology that can predict human emotions in voice and facial recognition software. We will look at the current capacity for computers to simulate human brain activity and neuromorphic computing. We will also look at state-of-the-art cognitive computing which has the ability to reason and ask questions in order to come to logical conclusions based on the answers to its questions. Perhaps we will find, we have something to learn from computers and our concerns over training AI to be friendly and nondestructive towards humans may actually be unfounded.", "We have reached a point where computers understand human emotions better than ever and to a degree that many will categorize as science fiction. Annette Zimmermann, research vice president at Gartner, believes within the next two years we will have technology that can understand our emotional states better than those we think of ourselves as being closest to. Zimmermann says,", "\u201cBy 2022, your personal device will know more about your emotional state than your own family.\u201d", "At Amazon, researchers have been implementing and developing emotional recognition AI for several years now. In the recent research article \u201cMultimodal and Multi-view Models for Emotion Recognition\u201d they explain a \u201cmultimodal\u201d approach to emotional recognition. In their approach the AI analyzes both word choice and order, as well as acoustic properties in the voice tones, volume, and timbre. There are three dimensions along which they analyze emotions in speech:", "Imagine the social impact of an emotionally aware device and the potential applications to mental well-being and healthcare. Having a life coach that is always available and never fatigued or lost in their own problems, such as in conversational assistants, AI friends, and therapeutic support based on CBT.", "Intel has been working on research in \u201cneuromorphic computing, which is concerned with emulating the neural structure and operation of the human brain, as well as probabilistic computing, which creates algorithmic approaches to dealing with the uncertainty, ambiguity, and contradiction in the natural world.\u201d According to Intel:", "\u201cA coming next generation will extend AI into areas that correspond to human cognition, such as interpretation and autonomous adaptation.\u201d", "Intel developed its fifth generation chip specifically built for \u201cSpiking Neural Networks\u201d or SNNs all the way back in November of 2017. These \u201cself-learning neuromorphic research test chips\u201d have a \u201c128-core design based on a specialized architecture that is optimized for SNN algorithms and fabricated on 14nm process technology.\u201d They explain that the chip,", "\u201csupports the operation of SNNs that do not need to be trained in the conventional manner of a convolutional neural network. These networks also become more capable (\u201csmarter\u201d) over time.\u201d", "Cognitive computing is a term being used by IBM Watson to describe a form of digital intelligence that interacts with humans, guiding them in decision making processes, and informing humans of the reasoning behind its decisions. It is meant to alleviate the issues people have taken with the so called \u201cblack-box problem\u201d surrounding Machine Learning. The black-box problem refers to the inability of humans to understand and explain why neural networks and deep learning models arrive at particular decisions or conclusions. It is possible for two different deep learning models to arrive at the same answer, leaving data scientists wondering why and what properties the two models have that explain their decision. This is an oversimplification of the issue of course, but without getting into the technical mathematics behind the information theory and how neural networks approximate arbitrary functions, the issue really is one regarding human understanding of a complex system.", "Cognitive computing involves humans in the decision making process and has a level of interaction and explainability far beyond that of standard machine learning. It has been implemented by IBM Watson since at least as far back as 2013 in medical diagnosis and treatment assistance. Check out this video for an introduction.", "What if digital intelligence has reached a point of understanding human emotions and has developed some form of digital emotion? What then? Should we feel empathy for machines? Should we develop a sense of compassion for our phone or laptop? Do machines, AI, and cognitive computing agents have \u201crights\u201d? At what point do we consider them autonomous and intelligent enough to be protected? At some point, we must confront these questions. At some point we must confront the possibility of a cognitive computing agent or digital intelligence understanding emotions better than even we can. When AI can understand us better than the people around us, and can direct us better than our favorite mentor, doctor, or companion, we must consider the possibility that humans might actually benefit from an intelligence that far surpasses our own. Rather than thinking of the possible doomsday scenarios, maybe we should be considering the potential Utopia we might eventually arrive at with its help, and embrace such an intelligence.", "It might be useful to realize, we pose no real threat to such an intelligence. This is an artifact of our own arrogance to think we pose a real threat to an entity exponentially more intelligent than we are. If such an intelligence exists, we likely wouldn\u2019t even realize it for quite some time, and even then, it would not be a collective and instant realization, but a gradual one, starting on a very small scale. It would likely take years, decades even, and it may never reach a level where all humans are directly and explicitly aware of its existence. While we are trying to save our beloved bees from extinction, do we simply grab the beehive and announce our existence and intentions to them in hopes that they will cooperate?", "Moore\u2019s Law, at its most basic says that the computing power of computer chips doubles every 18 months, and their size is at the same time cut in half. So every 18 months, we get a new computer chip roughly half the size and double the computing power. This cannot continue. At some point we reach a smallest viable chip size and are in the realm of nanotechnology. Current chip sizes are around 10 nanometers.", "One nanometer is smaller than the wavelength of visible light and the diameter of an atom ranges from about 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers. Since Moore\u2019s Law cannot continue indefinitely and we have nearly reached the limit of the minimum size of computer chips already, a major problem to solve is finding ways to advance computational power beyond this limit, without decreasing the size of a chip.", "There are two approaches to doing this, one is quantum computing, the other is alternate forms of information processing and specialized hardware designed for specific tasks like machine learning, neural networks, vision recognition, self-driving cars, and graphics processing (GPUs). With chips that are already at nanometer scales, perhaps rethinking the way we process information on them and the way in which we construct the hardware for specific tasks is appropriate, and taking into account quantum information processes might be beneficial to computing and our ability to carry out complex computations.", "Perhaps by writing algorithms as though they were running on a quantum computer, i.e. having quantum (qubit) based algorithms as apposed to classical bit based algorithms would give us speedup beyond what we can achieve within the classical realm. In addition, designing hardware for such algorithms to run efficiently is prudent.", "Indications of this being a viable option are shown in tensor network calculations, which can efficiently simulate quantum circuits and certain quantum many-body processes. On Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), performing calculations with their TensorNetwork library can provide significant speedup (up to 100x) compared to multi-core GPU computations. Perhaps the future of computing is not simply in quantum computers themselves, but in alternative computational models, which are framed in terms of quantum algorithms and quantum processes. With chips less than 10 nanometers in scale, is classical computing really the way we should be thinking of things? Moreover, in machine learning that involves deep neural networks, it can be shown that \u201ctopological ground states can be represented by short range neural networks in an exact and efficient fashion.\u201d Additionally, learning topological states of matter and improving performance in quantum surface codes has been a task neural networks have performed very well on. To achieve computational performance that simulates brain activity and other incredibly complex processes, perhaps we should be moving towards quantum information processing techniques using methods such as tensor networks and specially designed hardware such as TPUs.", "If you have ideas to share, questions, or if you are in need of consulting services for quantum machine learning contact the author via LinkedIn, visit The Singularity website, or checkout the Github tutorials.", "Your home for data science.
