Hence, his Twitter profile could be a rich source of data ripe for analysis. Plus, analyzing a politician\u2019s statements is fun!", "That\u2019s why I decided to analyze his profile for this project. This blog would be helpful for someone who is looking for a simple data analytics project based on real data.", "Before diving into details, here are the key parts of the projects:", "I just had to register and answer a few questions on the Twitter Developer website. The approval from Twitter came in around 2\u20133 hours.", "We need the following information from your developer account: consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_key, and access_secret.", "Tweepy is easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.", "First, let\u2019s import all the libraries we will be using.", "Next, let\u2019s save all the Twitter credentials. I have obviously hidden mine. It\u2019s a good idea to create a separate file to store a credential, but I have used in the same file.", "Next, we iterate to extract the Tweets scrapping 200 tweets at a time. In doing this analysis, I have taken inspiration from Rodolfo Ferro blog sentiment analysis of Trump\u2019s tweets.", "Let\u2019s create a Panda DataFrame, which will help in analyzing the Twitter data. We also need to understand the structure of the data we have downloaded.", "Next, we will add these relevant parameters to the DataFrame.", "This section is relatively straight forward. We want to figure the simple statistics such as mean length of the tweet, most liked Tweet, and trend of Likes and Retweets over the years.", "Next, let\u2019s look at the trend of Likes and Retweets over the course of the last 2 years. I haven\u2019t explored the limit Twitter puts on general access to API, but I believe it limits to 3200 tweets. That\u2019s why we have just last two years data.", "In order to plot the trend, we will create Panda Series and then plot. Even in this short time period, we can observe an upward trend in terms of Likes and Retweets.", "First, we will create a correlation plot to understand characteristics of liked and retweeted tweets.", "Some unsurprising learnings are \u2014 RTs and Likes are highly correlated. Some more insightful learning include:", "Second, let\u2019s plot the sentiments, Likes, and RTs on a scatter plot to recheck our hypothesis.", "This again points that tweets with negative sentiments getting more RTs and Likes. However, we haven\u2019t done extensive cleaning and Indian English (with the usage of Hindi words) could have influenced these results.", "For Sentiment Analysis, we will use TextBlob. It\u2019s a Python Library that offers simple API access to perform basic natural language processing tasks.", "TextBlob works just like Python Strings and hence can be similarly used to transform data.", "We would perform sentiment analysis in 3 steps \u2014 cleaning of Tweet\u2019s text, Tokenization, and sentiment analysis.", "In analyzing the tweets, we just want to restrict ourselves to tweets posted by Mr. Modi. Although we have no way of identifying the tweets retweeted by Mr. Modi. We have one shortcut. We can ignore the tweets that have zero likes, as Twitter doesn\u2019t designate \u201cLikes\u201d on retweeted Tweets to users who retweeted. Plus, it\u2019s highly unlikely that any tweet from Mr. Modi would have zero \u201cLikes\u201d.", "Let\u2019s start with data cleaning step.", "Next, we will do tokenization and sentiment analysis.", "One of the memorable initiatives of Mr. Modi for me was \u201cSwachh Bharat\u201d- an initiative to keep India clean. Let\u2019s see how many times he talked about \u201cSwachh Bharat\u201d in these tweets.", "Let\u2019s first create a word cloud to visualize the relative frequency of usage of different words. I have created a simple word cloud, but you can go fancy and create an image-colored word cloud.", "Interestingly, West Bengal and Odisa, where Mr. Modi\u2019s party made surprising gains, have been mentioned more frequently.", "I also created a frequency table in the old python way:", "Suppose you have all the speeches of Mahatma Gandhi in text form. You could use topic modeling to figure key themes in these speeches.", "I came across a brilliant talk by Christine Doig at PyTexas on Topic Modelling and tried implementing in our case.", "Essentially, in topic modeling, we use statistical models to discover abstract topics that occur in a large volume of unorganized text. It\u2019s an unsupervised learning method. The picture below explains what we aim to achieve with Topic Modeling.", "There are two ways to conduct topic modeling \u2014 LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and probabilistic Inference methods such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Below is a pictorial representation of the difference between LSA and LDA. In our case, we will use LDA.", "Let\u2019s implement LDA to figure themes in Tweets.", "The output is an interactive graph, which I am not sure how to embed. However, you could find the complete code with output here.", "I could see two clear themes \u2014 politics and gratitude \u2014 represented by 4 and 1 respectively. However, topic modeling wasn't much use here. I will probably apply these on a collection of speeches.", "That\u2019s it from my side. I know we can do a lot more analysis here.
