Well, you could. But it may take days, weeks, or even months.", "That is no way to live your life: waiting around for your processes to complete. Upgrade your hardware today!", "However, I must warn you: these powerful computing machines can quickly burn a hole in your pocket if you are not responsible.", "Lucky for you, I was already responsible about it and live to tell the tale!", "After much research and shopping, I put together what I believe to be the perfect computer to get started in the world of Data Science.", "Build the perfect computer for a data scientist while on a budget (~$1,000).", "Choosing the graphics card was perhaps the toughest decision to make. This is one of the most important parts of having an effective data science machine.", "I ended up going with a higher tier graphics card because I did NOT want to be limited by this component in any way.", "I went with the Nvidia GTX 1660S. Based on my research, I determined that the 1660 Super was a pretty good deal for $245.", "By getting the \u201cSuper\u201d version, it offers comparable performance to the next level up (GTX 1660 Ti). It felt like I was getting the most bang for my buck with this, and so far it has not disappointed.", "Some key specs: Streaming Processors: 1408", "But for my uses, I don\u2019t need something that is overkill. No overclocking will be necessary (at this point in my career at least); although, it can be overclocked up to 4.4GHz.", "I went with an AMD processor rather than an Intel. Why? It seemed like I could get similar processing power for a much lower price. Also, when will I ever have the opportunity to use something other than an Intel processor again?", "I\u2019m excited to see if I notice a difference between AMD on my PC and Intel on every other computer I use. So far, I have not.", "Also, I got the CPU and motherboard in a bundle for a very reasonable price ($230) at Micro Center. The same CPU alone on Amazon is $190 (at the time of writing this).", "This motherboard was part of the processor bundle, so after learning it was compatible with the AMD processor and all the other parts I was looking at, it seemed like a no brainer. Also, it had WiFi capabilities, which were a necessity for me.", "MSI has a decent reputation as a trusted brand, as well. So that helped.", "I read that 8 GB should be more than enough, but RAM is so cheap that it seemed silly not to have the extra memory. Treat yo self.", "The decision to go with a hard disk drive or solid-state disk didn\u2019t end up being a tough one. Micro Center was having a sale on one of their 512GB SSD\u2019s and the read speed was about 10x faster than a comparable model. So this was an excellent deal.", "512GB isn\u2019t a crazy amount of storage, but if I ever need more, I can buy it for pretty cheap.", "IPSG is the Micro Center brand. A similar wattage power supply unit from a name brand would have been closer to $130. The only thing you sacrifice by going for the cheaper brand is the efficiency. The efficiency rating for the more expensive model would have been 80 Platinum (this was 80 Gold).", "Maybe I will end up paying that difference back via my electricity bill in the long run? We will see.", "The case was less about the specs and more about the overall look. Once you find one with an adequate amount of fans, ample space, and reasonable cable management, it comes down to personal preference.", "I spent $85, but I could have easily seen myself spending much more because some of the cases are just so cool.", "Either way, I\u2019m happy with the case I selected. I love having the tempered glass so I can see the insides.", "I love Windows 10, so this wasn\u2019t much of a decision. I got a good price on it at Micro Center because I did a price match with the listing on Amazon.", "I went for the cheapest mouse + keyboard from a trusted brand (HP) that I could find. They get the job done, and I like the feel of both.", "I already had these monitors. Just two rather cheap 23-inch monitors.", "Getting my graphics card to output to two monitors was NOT an easy task because I kept buying the wrong display cables. I finally got it working with HDMI to HDMI and DVI to DVI.", "Some things I learned along the way that might be useful for a first time PC builder.", "I suggest doing a price match with what they have in stores versus what\u2019s on Amazon. I saved about $25 on Windows 10 by doing this but could\u2019ve saved about $60 more if I had done it for all the parts.", "When building your computer, make sure you have more than enough room and have a nice, open workspace. It is so easy to lose pieces. Also, I suggest good lighting because you need all the help you can get when plugging those tiny cables into your motherboard.", "Open up all of the chambers of your case. I was so close to buying new screws on Amazon because I didn\u2019t do this. The manufacturers like to set you off on a little scavenger hunt to find all of the pieces.", "Make sure you read the manual when you are struggling to construct your computer. I kept trying to find online guides or videos, but the manual\u2019s ended up being the most helpful (very millennial of me, I know).", "Install drivers for each of your hardware components. I\u2019m finding that to get the most out of each of these pieces, you must install its respective driver. I\u2019ll explain below because this was something I didn\u2019t know.", "What is a driver? A device driver is a piece of software that allows your hardware to communicate with your operating system. This is how we ensure the information sent from our graphics card, our motherboard, or any of our pieces of hardware to Windows 10, is correct.", "Whenever you are having a hardware problem, the first place you should check is the Device Manager in the Control Panel to make sure you not only have the device driver, but it\u2019s up to date.", "Not having proper device drivers is undoubtedly not obvious to PC build newbies. I was having trouble displaying on dual monitors, but the second I installed the NVIDIA driver, it worked.", "The same happened to my motherboard. My WiFi connection was being very spotty, and I knew it wasn\u2019t the fault of Verizon since all of my other devices were connecting just fine. Once I downloaded the Intel Wireless-AC 9260 driver, boom. It worked.", "I found a lot of great resources to help me complete this project. I\u2019ll list them below:", "https://www.logicalincrements.com/ \u2014 Helped me figure out what parts to choose. It can be overwhelming at first because there are SO MANY. This website helps you narrow down which parts you want based on how much you want to spend and how powerful you want your machine to be. The prices you find on this website give you a good benchmark for what you should be spending.", "https://pcpartpicker.com/ \u2014 I read through a couple of other people\u2019s builds to see how they were choosing their parts. Most were for gaming, which I\u2019m not really into, but was still helpful primarily to ensure compatibility between components.", "https://www.microcenter.com/ \u2014 This was where I went to buy my pieces. I went during a Black Friday sale, so I got some excellent deals. I only intended initially on buying my CPU and motherboard that day but ended up buying the whole set. The employees at Micro Center are very knowledgable and helpful, and I feel they lead me down the right path (most of their recommendations were in line with the research I had done prior).", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhX0fOUYd8Q \u2014 This was the video I followed while building my PC. This guy knows what he\u2019s doing, and was enough for me, somebody who had no idea what they were doing.", "If you are reading this because you are looking to gain some inspiration for your PC build, I wish you the best of luck!
