Public officials seem to have a partisan divide on re-opening their states, and citizens are beginning to protest across the country. Though political party seems to play a role, the division may also be caused by the uneven impact of the coronavirus. There is no doubt that America\u2019s cities have been hit the hardest.", "With the largest population densities and potentially the largest disparities in healthcare access, cities are predictably the most impacted locations. But could the spread of the virus come down to something even more fundamental to the cities themselves. From the chart, we see that largest impact comes from the northeast, while cities seem to be less and less impacted the further west we go.", "The disparities in impact between cities begets the question of whether there is something fundamental to the northeastern cities that cities further west don\u2019t have to worry about. Could, for example, the coronavirus have been proliferated by the massive differences in public transportation use? Take a look at this chart from 2013.", "They almost look like the same image. And it makes sense. A daily commute in a packed subway car or a small-enclosed bus with even a single carrier could lead to a spree of new infections. Not to mention, the plethora of frequently touched metal, glass, and plastic surfaces which the virus can survive on for many hours. Further, this may also explain the relatively more severe impacts in Europe and other developed nations which also have a developed public transit system. Though it looks compelling at the initial glance, let\u2019s see if the numbers back it up.", "As state governors and mayors make plans to re-open their communities, great precautions should be taken to prevent a reemergence of new infections. Public transit could be a key driver in making sure we do this right. In this article, I\u2019ll walk you through a step-by-step analysis to estimate the effect of public transit on the spread of coroanvirus.", "I use a county-by-county breakdown of coronavirus cases from the New York Times, and I use data on public transit use published by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Also included in the file are county-level population and income data collected from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). All data used for this article can be found here.", "A simple way of quantifying the effect of some independent variable on a dependent variable is linear regression.", "Here we can model whether there is an effect of public transit use, x, on infections, y, by estimating the beta coefficient of x in the regression above. We can do this in python and check its significance. First, we import the relevant packages:", "Then we run the regression and print the results!", "After performing the regression, we find that we have a coefficient of 0, but a really significant p-value. So there is no impact?", "Well, it should be noted that the magnitudes of our independent variable are much, much higher than they are for the number of cases. This may have led to a coefficient that is less than 0.0001, but is still significant because the number of passenger trips are on the order of thousands and/or millions. Thus, we should normalize our variable before performing our regression to get a more reasonable estimate.", "Now we see a much more interesting result that public transit may actually have a relatively significant impact on the number of cornavirus cases.", "Is this result accurate? Probably not. There could be many factors that are correlated to public transit use that may also have a causal impact on the number of infections.", "For example, it could be that heavy public transit use is correlated with a higher prevalence of low-income individuals. These individuals may not be able to follow stay-at-home orders due to financial reasons and may therefore be more likely to be infected. High population density could also be correlated with high public transit use, more people means more traffic \u2014 leading to a higher probability of using public transit. More dense environments may lead to more infections regardless of whether public transit exists or not. In short, the beta coefficient is likely overstated. Correlation does not mean causation.", "So how can we improve this? One way is to use an instrumental variable that isolates the portion of the variable which is uncorrelated with other factors. Though effective, it is pretty difficult to find a valid instrument variable in practice. The prevalence of public transit is inherently tied to density, incomes, and the local governments.", "We could also try a difference in differences method. If there were areas of the country which closed public transportation, we could compare the difference in change in infection rate in these counties with those that did not. However, there were not enough counties which did this to make an accurate estimation. So instead, we will simply add some control variables to try and reduce the bias caused by omitted factors.", "The main controls that we should add are for population density and income levels since these two factors are most likely to cause an overestimation of the effect of public transportation. We can accomplish this with the following code:", "And we see that it has a dramatic impact on our results. The effect of public transport has been halved, but it still seems to have major impact on the number of cases of coronavirus.", "So, based on the analysis, it\u2019s likely that public transportation has an impact on the number of new infection. There were some limitations in the merging of datasets due to conflicts between county level data and city level data, but we still see a fairly compelling result that it may have contributed to the wider spread of the virus in cities compared to more rural regions. As governments plan the re-openings, they should be especially cautious in how they go about re-opening high risk areas, and they should rely on rigorous analysis to back up their decisions.", "This article is the second article of a three part mini-series of coronavirus related python tutorials.
