In this article, I\u2019ll discuss what transfer learning is and how we can use it for a problem at hand. The notebook is linked below:", "Transfer Learning is a technique in which a model that is trained on a certain task can be used to make predictions for another task based on its learning (weights).", "Let\u2019s try and understand it better by taking an example of a Convolutional Neural Network to understand triangles. Let\u2019s consider that the model has two layers. In the first layer, the model will detect edges. In the second layer, the model will combine those edges to understand triangles.", "Let\u2019s consider another CNN model which has to be trained to detect rectangles. What if we could use the knowledge of the previous CNN model to understand edges and just change the final layer such that during training it now detects rectangles instead of triangles. This is what Transfer Learning is. Using an already trained model to make predictions for another task.", "Transfer Learning is a very essential concept which can be very useful when working with many deep learning models. The benefits it instills include:", "Let\u2019s try and solve the Cats vs Dogs problem using Transfer Learning.", "We have a set of images for both Cats and Dogs. We would like to distinguish between the two classes using a deep learning model.", "I\u2019ll first create a CNN model on my own and measure its performance. Then, I\u2019ll use Transfer Learning on a popular model, MobileNet, to train on the classification. I\u2019ll set the image size for each model to be uniform 224x224 and apply data augmentation to the data supplied to each model.", "As the problem is a 2-class classification problem, I\u2019ll compile each model with the adam optimizer, sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function and metrics as accuracy.", "Training custom made modelI created a CNN model with 4 Conv2D layers, with 32, 64, 128, 256 nodes respectively and relu activation function. Each of these convolutional layers is followed by a MaxPooling2D layer. Next, I add a Dropout layer to prevent overfiting. I add a Flatten layer so I can pass it to 256 node Dense layer. The final layer is a 2 node Dense layer with the softmax activation function which gives the probability of each class. As I\u2019m training the model from scratch, I\u2019ll run it for 100 epochs.", "Training MobileNet model with Transfer learningI\u2019ll download the MobileNet model from Tensorflow Hub. I\u2019ll then freeze it such that the weights inside the model do not change. I\u2019ll append a Dense layer with 2 nodes (for two classes \u2014 Cats and Dogs) and the softmax activation function. As it\u2019s a pre-trained model, I\u2019ll run it for only 5 epochs.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the accuracy and loss curves for the two models.", "For the custom CNN model, after 50 epochs, the model achieved a validation accuracy of 76%. However, even though the accuracy is still increasing, the difference between training and validation accuracy is widening indicating that it\u2019s beginning to overfit.", "Right after 5 epochs, the MobileNet Transfer Learning model achieved a validation accuracy of 96%.", "The accuracy of Transfer Learning model is whopping 20% more than the custom made model. This also took less time to train.", "From the process of using an existing model, to training it on a dataset is just so simple and easy. This really opens up a vast opportunity for anyone to just pickup a trained model and use it for their problem.", "As we can see, the Transfer Learning model performed exceptionally well in comparison to custom CNN model and that too with very less epochs. It is clear that Transfer Learning is a very special and powerful technique to create a deep learning model and help solve multiple problems with existing models.", "Thanks for reading!
