We will be using the coronavirus infection data along with other key factors that we think may influence the infection cases to analyse the correlations between factors on Python.", "While there are other methods which can also shed insights on the relationship between factors, the correlation matrix is one of the simplest tools for shortlisting the highly-correlated factors for analysis. However, it also has its own limitations. It is, therefore, important to note that the result of the analysis is not the end of the process but the starting point to further explore and validate the relationships between factors.", "The dataset that we are going to use contains the reported cases of coronavirus by country (as of 17th April 2020) by Worldometer [1]. The \u2018blank\u2019 cells indicate that the data are not available. In case you would like an updated version feel free to update the columns with the latest data. You can get the initial dataset here:", "From the dataset, there are several factors mapped that we hypothesised may affect the coronavirus data points as follows:", "As you can see, some of the data may be a tad bit too old with some in the form of the national or annual average. This is because many of the open-source detailed data are not available for these factors. Nonetheless, we would be using these data to understand the general data trend at this stage. If there are any meaningful insights that can be derived, we can always focus our approach on the relevant factors at a more granular level.", "Now that we have the dataset ready, we will start analysing the correlation matrix on Python. First, we will need to import the following libraries.", "Then, we import the dataset. Here, we can import the dataset directly from the repository or you can also save the file and import the dataset locally using \u2018read_csv\u2019 or \u2018read_excel\u2019 if you have saved in Excel format.", "The sample data rendered on Python are as follows:", "As you can see there are some records with \u2018NaN\u2019 data, which result from the lack of data at the source level. We will then have to replace these \u2018NaN\u2019 so that we can proceed to analyse the dataset.", "With this, we will be replacing \u2018NaN\u2019 with blank or \u20180\u2019. Now, with the data cleaned, we will jump right to the data analysis. Since our objective is to find the factors that may affect the total infected cases or the mortality rate, then why not try the correlation plot to see the relationships between each factor.", "Rule#1: Correlation \u2260 Causation. Correlation does not imply causation even if there is a high correlation between the two factors. Therefore, it is imperative for us to research more on the relationships between the factors before establishing the causal links.", "First, in order to map the correlations between the factors, we will have to make sure that all the values are in numerical so that we can calculate the correlation coefficients. Categorical data like the lockdown status is listed in \u2018Y\u2019 or \u2018N\u2019 format. We will need to convert those into the numerical format. With factorisation, we can change \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018N\u2019 to something like \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019, respectively.", "You will notice that I have added +1 at the end. That is because I do not want to have some category converted to \u20180\u2019. I would like it to start at \u20181\u2019. While this does not affect the correlation analysis, it is useful when we are doing operations between columns. You would not want to divide 2 columns only to find that some values are divided by \u20180\u2019s.", "Next, we will plot the correlations between each factor. Here, we will be using \u2018seaborn\u2019 package to plot the correlations in the form of a heatmap.", "Lo and behold, we now get the correlation matrix of our dataset.", "If the texts are all crammed up or the figure is too small to make sense, you may have to play around with the \u2018figsize\u2019 value to adjust the figure size and rerun the correlation code above.", "Here, we will be shortlisting the factors and form hypotheses from the correlation matrix. There are many grids and regions that are quite correlated. While some of them are closely related factors that give redundant information (ex. the \u2018%Test Positive\u2019 vs. \u2018Active Cases\u2019, \u2018Infected cases\u2019 vs. \u2018Deaths\u2019, etc.), there are also several others which are slightly far-fetched and irrelevant at this stage (ex. \u2018Current Lockdown Status\u2019 vs. \u2018%Pop. Age \u2265 65\u2019, \u2018Avg. Wind Speed (m/s)\u2019 vs. \u2018Pop. Density (per km2)\u2019, etc.). Therefore, it is important that we look for highly correlated factors that fall in between these two extremities. Those are often the ones that we can form hypotheses to prove the causal links further. Some of the hypotheses are as follows:", "A. \u2018Average wind speed\u2019 vs. \u2018Infected Cases\u2019: The correlation between these two factors is quite a deep blue. While there is no direct information that suggests the direct relationship between the two factors, it may be worth exploring the relationship further. It has been reported that the virus droplets from the infected patient can traverse and infect other agents close by. (UPDATE: There is a recent report that the virus strain was found on the air pollution particles [6]). It may be possible that the wind speed may affect the distance in which these droplets can travel or vice versa.", "If one observes the map below, the average wind speed in the highly affected areas in the mid to the east coast of the United States seems to be higher than the west coast [2]. This seems to be correlated with the distribution of the cases detected thus far at the time of writing.", "Of course, there can also be other climate factors that may affect the wind, or air in general, which may also correlate with the number of reported cases. For example, there are data that suggest that high humidity can slow the influenza spread [3]. The closest data to the relative humidity (%) data is the average annual precipitation data in the correlation matrix.", "Therefore, we will need to find data at a more granular level before we can analyse and establish the causal links between the rise of infection cases with higher wind speed (or any climate factors).", "B. \u2018%Pop. High income\u2019 & \u2018%Pop. Upper-middle income\u2019 vs. Infection data: These two correlations are in slight red. In fact, the high and upper-middle-income segments are mostly in red when compared to the infections data. When you look at this section along with the remaining three income segments, the low income and the poor segments seem to be more positively correlated with the number of cases and active cases than the upper-middle-income and above segments (albeit slightly positive).", "The hypotheses about the relationship between demography and the reported cases are not something new. There are data which reported that the rich may have more access to protection against the virus. The upper class, for example, does have access to work-from-home and relatively higher income to sustain during the lockdown compared to the lower-income segments, who may be working as front-line workers [4].", "These correlation data, therefore, serve as a starting point for us to understand how different income segments may be affected by the pandemics. If the causality relationship is fully established, then this should be one of the top priorities for the governments around the world to provide aids and support to help those in need during these tough times.", "C. Other notable relations: There are still many things that we can explore from this correlation matrix.", "With the lockdowns deadline coming closer, many people are concerned about the possible spike in the infection cases and the re-emergence of the second-wave infections. It is, therefore, crucial to have a plan to handle the possible scenarios that may happen before the lockdowns are lifted.", "Imagine if the above correlations do hold direct causal links. We would then have to rethink about the way we cope with the pandemics, especially during post-lockdown.", "Of course, wearing masks, maintaining distances, and preventing any contacts to the face (especially the soft tissues like noses and eyes) are not only important but an imperative to save your loved ones in this dire time. However, exploring other insights can also be useful for general precautions, especially if you were ever in such a position with little to no protective equipment.", "Given that these are only correlation data, the real work would start from here. We will need to research more on the relationships between the factors in order to prove (or disprove) the hypotheses before we can arrive at a fair conclusion about the causal links.", "Apart from the research, we may also need to update the dataset to better reflect the present-day scenario (UPDATE: The pollution dataset may also be added since there is a report that virus strain has been found on the pollution particles [6]). We may collect the data in the form of time-series to better analyse the trends, henceforth. A city-wise or monthly data may also be useful in this case, since we will be able to avoid the problem of using average data over a large area, which may result in errors. Then we can use the refined data gathered to re-analyse using the correlation matrix or Predictive Power Score (PPS), which may yield possible new insights.", "Furthermore, a simple prediction model can be trained based on the said factors for a certain area. An example linear regression model to predict tomorrow\u2019s number of cases in a certain area can be written as follows:", "Infected cases (Day N+1) ~ Avg. Wind Speed (in the past 1 week \u2014 or incubation period) + Population density + Current Active Cases", "This way we can also test the hypotheses for those factors whether they hold or not. If the predictions on the test set yield poor accuracy, then we may have to change the factors (or find new ones) in the regression models.", "Finally, I hope that this article has helped you create simple correlation matrices not only for this dataset but for any custom datasets that you may have. Stay safe!", "[2]: Grassi, Veronesi, Schenkel, Peier, Neukom, Volkwein, Martin, and Hurni. (2015).

The governments are scrambling the enforce and extend the lockdown to delay the surge of infections. The medical staffs and facilities are strained.
