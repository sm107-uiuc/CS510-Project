While this enables many types of analysis that can\u2019t be performed within the Google Analytics interface, it also doesn\u2019t provide any basic metrics, e.g. bounce rate, to use.

The positive effect: my understanding of the metrics on a conceptual level improved considerably.", "The BigQuery cookbook helped me out in some cases, but also seemed incomplete and outdated at times. Since Standard SQL syntax is the preferred BigQuery language nowadays and a lot of old Stackoverflow entries are using the (soon to be deprecated?) Legacy SQL syntax, I spent hours and hours to get my head around the SQL queries I had to write to get the reports I wanted. Apart from the calculated metrics that I needed to take care of, there was another hurdle to cross: nested and repeated fields.", "Each row in the Google Analytics BigQuery dump represents a single session and contains many fields, some of which can be repeated and nested, such as the hits, which contains a repeated set of fields within it representing the page views and events during the session, and custom dimensions, which is a single, repeated field . This is one of the main differences between BigQuery and a normal database. (source)", "With this article I hope to save you some trouble.

The other \u2018rows\u2019 are in fact nested fields, in most cases NULL values. Only the hits.product columns are populated with values.", "To deal with this fields and to be able to query our tables so they meet our needs, we need the UNNEST function.", "The problem here is that is essentially an array (actually in BigQuery parlance it\u2019s a \u201crepeated record\u201d, but you can think of it as an array). (\u2026) This is where the UNNEST function comes in. It basically lets you take elements in an array and expand each one of these individual elements. You can then join your original row against each unnested element to add them to your table.
