Businesses must earn the loyalty of their customers and reduce churn rate.", "The aim is to help offline merchants (specifically small and medium businesses) better understand their customers, reduce their churn rate, and increase customer loyalty to the brand. With several product options such as loyalty and pickup options, merchants can identify their best customers and know how best to engage them.", "This article entails a combination of machine learning, data analysis, and programming. Information on customers and their orders will be reviewed, and any distinct segment or trend will be identified.", "Customer loyalty and retention are critical to the growth of any business. Offline merchants (specifically small and medium stores) struggle to offer personalized services to their customers. In the same vein, customers expect to be treated with the same engagement as major brands such as Netflix, Amazon, and others. With a myriad of options for customers to pick from, these businesses have to evolve or risk being left behind.", "What are the personalization challenges that small businesses face?", "Small and medium merchants do not have enough resources to gather and interpret customer data. Some of their challenges include;", "Customer churn or customer attrition refers to the tendency for a customer to stop patronizing a brand or business. Various reasons may guide the customer\u2019s decision, and if too many customers abandon a brand in the same period, the business risks a total shutdown. Below are common causes of customer churn;", "To achieve this, it is crucial that the store owner understands customer behavior and categorize customers based on buying behavior and demographics. This will help build a relationship that can lead to customer loyalty.", "Starbucks is an excellent example of a brand that leverages customer data. They send specific offers at certain times of the week to certain customers.", "We should think of \u201cwhat types of questions should be asked? How should the data be reviewed?\u201d", "We will use a subset of Nugttah dataset (Loyalty application) to test our hypothesizes", "These are the potential limitations that may be anticipated in this project. However, they will be duly considered during the data analysis:", "An excellent method for machine learning and data science project is highlighted below:", "In this step, we will import dataset and check it Out", "Here, the dataset will be imported and reviewed. read_csv function will be used to read the sheets", "The %matplotlib inline will be used to produce inline plots in the notebook. The sns.set() will be added to the code to modify the visualization style to a base Seaborn style:", "We\u2019ll be using the head() function to display its first 5 observations of the data set, and shape features to find out how many columns and rows are present in the data frame.", "Total number of rows and columns in the data set using shape", "The data consists of 104850 observations and 29 characteristics.", "At this point, the summary statistics can be determined using the describe() to return the mean, count, minimum and maximum values, standard deviation, and the qualities of the data.", "The data must pass through a cleaning process before it is analyzed. Some of the data cleaning processes include;", "The following data files were loaded:", "Note: The original data was initially scrambled in various datasheets. They had to be gathered and merged using a pd.merge to merge the data frame.", "Delete the data fields that have duplicate data", "Make every purchase a single line", "The data was extracted from MongoDB, and some columns are in the JSON data format, the whole data type will be displayed as a string. To change this, json.loads was used to convert it to JSON to be accessed as a dictionary data structure.", "If you have any Null value, either drop it or replace it", "Change any value that doesn\u2019t make sense", "There is now a good description of the store data, loyalty data, customer data, and other available datasets.", "Once the data cleaning process has been completed, a data visualization and statistical analysis is performed on the data. It is good practice to visualize categorized data through a separate data set.", "Patterns and insights will now be drawn out of the analyzed data.", "This shows that we have 1711 females and 5094 males in our datasets", "Histograms are a great way to discover the distribution of each attribute.", "The graph shows that there is a slightly higher percentage of male than female customers.", "to get more insight, we will divide them based on registration year", "In age analysis, the very first thing we have checked is the outliers and have found few outliers so any discovered outliers were eliminated from the dataset.", "The age range was between 20 and 40 as you can see in the below graph. Highlighting the validity of the describe() call results.", "The average age was 26. This indicates that younger people preferred coffee in comparison to other groups. The longer right tail shows that this distribution is right-skewed.", "Stats associated to customers age customers", "The image depicts that females spend more than men even though we have fewer females users.", "Cites Analysis | Top 20 cities ranked by user residence", "People in Dammam have the highest coffee consumption.", "Cites Analysis | Cities Of Top 20 Active Customers (The Most Frequent The most No. Of Orders)", "Correlation Matrix Plot Between Significant Variables of Active Customers", "Correlation depicts the similar changes between two variables. When this change happens in the same direction, it is considered a positive correlation. If the changes occur in a different direction, it is considered a negative correlation.", "To put it simply, Correlation Matrix is the correlation between each pair of attributes. It can be plotted on a graph to discern the degree of correlation between several variables.", "This calculation is is useful to know, because some machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression can have poor performance if there are highly correlated input variables in your data", "Above, the matrix can be seen as being symmetrical, i.e., the bottom left, and top right of the matrix are identical. Also, it displays 6 different views on the same data in a single plot. It can also be inferred that the strongest correlated variable is between the final price (total spending) and earned points. This is a positive correlation \u2014 the higher the final price a customer can attain in this data set, the higher their earning points. However, other variables do not share this same correlation. Yet, they provide useful information and work on the same fundamental principle.", "When the skewness of the average price is reviewed, it can be deduced that there are a few expensive items, but generally, the prices fall into one group. Also, the negative skewness implies that the median is lower than the mean \u2014 this is usually caused by low-priced products.", "As shown, April 2020 recorded 264 sales and can be categorized as the single outlier in the 2018 data.", "Also, there was a sharp decline in sales in May 2019. This decline, caused by the pandemic, can be seen from the start of 2020 with a sharp drop in April 2020.", "In Saudi Arabia, Thursdays and Fridays are regarded as weekends. However, Fridays are much lower than Thursdays.", "Change of Customer Behaviors (POS) Due to COVID-19 pandemic:", "After analyzing the last 3 moths statistics for all food and beverages in Saudi Arabia and compare it with our dataset output, we found the below result", "Here, we are going to perform the following operations:", "RFM Analysis | Computing Quantile of RFM value", "Customers with the lowest recency, highest frequency, and monetary amounts considered as top customers.", "qcut() is Quantile-based discretization function. qcut bins the data based on sample quantiles.

However, the most important thing to understand is that it isn\u2019t about how fancy a method is, but its compatibility with the test data.", "When predicting, it is vital to select only the most important attributes needed for the predicted outcome. Also, the appropriate ML method has to be chosen. Regarding customer discussions, the following suggestions are recommended:", "Recommendation and Customer Segmentation of loyalty campaigns such as bonus rewards, points top-up, free tier upgrade, and specifically optimized reward programs that boost revenues and ROI. Therefore, customers were segmented to discover the best group.", "Segmentation is vital to wide scale personalization. Moreover, the system should analyze the data of like-minded users that share no direct correlation to other users but share the same criteria in search and purchasing patterns (with the aid of ML algorithms to offer more detail and show similarities between user profiles).", "Sales Prediction can be used to predict the volume of future sales. By analyzing further, data such as sales per store, sales per category, and sales per product can be deduced.", "Lifetime Value Prediction can be used to identify the most appropriate customers based on segmented customers and behavior patterns.", "Churn Prediction can be used to determine the amount of churn within a specified period.", "Proceeding with the initialization of the random number generator to a fixed value (7).", "This step is crucial to guarantee that the results of this model can be replicated again. It also ensures that the stochastic process of training a neural network model can be replicated.", "With the correct data, personalization is achievable. Today, small and medium-sized businesses do not need a big team of analysts or marketers to predict customer behavior and trends.", "Segmentation can help businesses identify the right customer and send them the right message, at the right time.", "Name: Recommendation System as a business model", "Your home for data science.
