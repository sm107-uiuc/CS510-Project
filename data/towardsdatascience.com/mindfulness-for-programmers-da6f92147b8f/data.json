My script will not run, vague errors that are not helpful at all keep mocking me on the screen and all I want to do is drill into my laptop with a jackhammer and gather the balls to claim that Tuesday is an appropriate day to start the weekend. Code has strict rules, and everything that has strict rules can be incredibly frustrating at some point. It might seem foolish but if I let it happen, one piece of code I cannot solve can ruin my entire day.", "If I can recognize early enough that I am about to get incredibly frustrated and that it might be one of those moments where I better walk away for a little while or ask someone\u2019s help, I might save my day from being ruined and earn myself some time by breaking the frustration cycle. That is when mindfulness comes into play.", "In my opinion, Programming is an art that requires creativity and innovation. The best programmers I know are creative, and seek creativity in all their projects. Surprisingly, writers and programmers have a lot in common. If you are sitting down at a computer, at least 80% of your time, starring at the screen and writing lines following strict syntax rules, you can be either one. While being a writer sounds like the dream life, when many imagine a writer looking at the sunset from his lovely desk, with a glass of wine next to his laptop and a pile of paper with long sentences scribbled on it, most people see the life of a programmer as lonely, nerdy, boring, where romanticism is clearly dead and creativity is a silly word.", "As I mention in my previous article about mindfulness and creativity, a creative mind requires rest and space. Research has shown many times that mindfulness practices and meditation have a positive effect on the creative mind. It counts for the supposedly romantic writer, definitely but it also counts for the programmer.", "When I am programming, I often get absorbed into my task and most of my colleagues do as well. It represents the moments when we are the most productive, focused and in what they call \u201cperformance mode\u201d. Nonetheless, I have noticed that many programmers (including myself) can turn slightly rude, inconsiderate or simply reticent to communication when they get really focused on their task and disconnect from the outside world. As much as focus has a positive effect on productivity, most of us have to work in teams and not everyone will get their \u201cfocus moment\u201d at the same time during the day. None of us have a light shining above our heads indicating \u201cBugger off, I am in the zone\u201d when it happens and most people that are trying to contact us then often do not have the aim of bothering us (hopefully). Being mindful about the fact that I am (or was) in the zone has helped me reacting appropriately when someone asks me for help at what could be defined as the \u201cwrong moment\u201d.", "As a programmer and writer, I spend more time touching my keyboard than probably anything else in the entire world. It might sound slightly sad when you realize that your hands are lying most of the day on a machine you have little connection to. A few moments during the day, I try to mindfully type and realize how quick my fingers are at knowing where the letters are and how being mindful of it can make it worse, better, or just slightly weird. Little exercises like this can bring you back to the present and break you out of your thoughts for a little while. When I start typing in a frantic way and get frustrated by my typing mistake or by the fact that I feel disconnected to my task, I try to take a few slow breaths and look at my hands typing, acting as if they had a mind of their own.", "I installed a few apps (such as Headspace or Insight Time) and I just started meditating, from once a week to several times a week. To be fair, normal practice can feel intensely weird at first. I was extremely restless the first few times. I was sitting on the floor, or on a chair, doing absolutely nothing and watching my breath, or feeling the weight of my bottom on the seat. One of the many thoughts that would come up quite often would be \u201cwhat the fudge am I doing here? I have better things to do, I am too busy for this crap\u201d. Nonetheless, I held onto it, and the restless feeling during each practice decreased little by little.", "Some guided practices can be very spiritual, speaking of connection, looking inside yourself, etc. Others will be very practical and will give you simple guidelines to quiet your mind and have a simple meditation practice. Choose what fits you. I hate when people speak too much, so since I now know the basic steps of meditation, I prefer using the app Insight Timer because it has a simple timer (hence the name), with a nice soft music I can choose to meditate on for however long I want.", "Every time I run my code (or every so often depending on how fast that code can run), I try to be present, take a few deep breath and recognize whether I feel restless, bored, or just okay. I sometimes stand up and take a walk to the toilets or the coffee machine where I will do a short version of a meditation walk by feeling my feet touching the floor, noticing colours, lights, people, sounds. It is a very helpful exercise to do when I am in the process of solving an error in the code and want to avoid wishing for the jackhammer drilling again.", "You can obviously make up any mindfulness exercise yourself using your daily activities and reminders (e.g. focusing on your body posture during your daily stand up), as long as it helps you to be present, mindful of your task and mindful of others. For general daily mindfulness practices, I really recommend the book \u201cHow to train a wild elephant\u201d. It has absolutely nothing to do with elephants, but it is a wonderful tool if you would like to start with mindfulness practices.", "\u201cThe feeling that any task is a nuisance will soon disappear if it is done in mindfulness.\u201d \u2014 Th\u00edch Nhat Hanh", "For more articles about Mindful Programming, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI or Leadership, follow me on Medium or Twitter.", "If you would like to read more stories of mine:", "Your home for data science.
