This is a typical question I\u2019m receiving quite often from my friends and as well from people on social media. My short answer would be: take part in some Data Science competition. But to provide a little bit more details, in this article I\u2019ll go through all the main aspects of using Competitive Data Science to gain knowledge and experience.", "There are many platforms and websites, offering Data Science and Machine Learning competitions where anyone can take part and try to solve a given task, competing with others for some prizes. Currently, the most well known such competition platform is Kaggle, but there exists a lot more.", "Before I go through the main pros and cons of participating in competitions, I\u2019ll first start with some short background about my own experience\u2026", "About some 5 years ago Data Science and Machine Learning started to attract my attention. I wanted to learn something new and this was the biggest hype and the most promising technology at that time. So I started to look around searching for some learning path I would like to take. First I took some beginner level online course about Machine Learning. This was good to get some basic knowledge and learn related terminology. But it was quite far from \u201creal\u201d Data Science tasks and after completing this course I really didn\u2019t felt like I could go and tell everybody that I\u2019m now a Data Science expert. So I was looking for something else. And this \u201celse\u201d turned out to be Data Science competitions, which pretty well matched to what I was looking for.", "Competitions offer real (or close to real) problems to solve. At least if we talk about serious competitions with prominent prize pools. Fact, that somebody is ready to pay real money (as a prize pool) for solving these tasks, means that they have some research or business value hidden behind. Of course, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that model of e.g. Credit risk scoring competition winner will be put directly in production for assessing risks from now on. Very likely that only some ideas, approaches, features, or tools will be taken from winning solutions.", "But in either case, knowing that problems are close to real means that if we will learn to solve these tasks we will be able to solve \u201creal\u201d problems out there, too. And this is an important thing to know that we will be able to use gained knowledge and skills outside competition platforms.", "If the only thing that I wanted was just a real problem to solve, I could take some real publicly available data (like Wikipedia usage history) and try to predict future usage. That would be a real problem to solve, right as I wanted. But\u2026 it is quite unlikely that I would succeed trying to gain knowledge this way. As in the beginning, we need some help, guidance, and \u201cgood\u201d examples to learn from. The problem alone is now enough.", "Communities on competition platforms serve very well for this purpose. There are hundreds and even thousands of people working on the same problem, so you are not alone. And these people are sharing some thoughts, insights about the problem, some basic starter models, code. If you are a beginner it is easy to take them as a starting point. They also are not \u201ctoo good\u201d, meaning that there is still enough room for your own experiments and struggles to improve those solutions.", "And this is important as we learn best by doing things ourselves, not just by looking and listening.", "One more issue with online courses or learning on a real problem is a lack of feedback. Of course, there are homework and exams in courses, but does passing an exam means that you are now good at Data Science? And if 10000 other people have passed the same exam, does this mean that they all have the same skills? Of course not.", "And this is where competitions have something almost unique: a leaderboard. When you make your solution to the given problem and submit it, you will instantly get objective feedback in a form of score and place on the leaderboard. Using your place on the leaderboard you can compare your model performance with other models developed by other competitors on \u201creal\u201d unseen test data. I believe this feedback will be much more objective and valuable rather than \u201cpassed\u201d score on some exam after an online course.If your model will be bad, you will find yourself somewhere at the very bottom of the leaderboard. And now you can see your progress and movement towards the top of the board while learning and improving your model.", "And this is important as feedback shows you what works and what doesn\u2019t on a given type of data. This will give you feeling (you can call it experience) about different types of approaches and techniques which you\u2019ll be able to use in the future.", "Once the competition ends, very often winning teams are sharing their approaches, models, and sometimes even full source code of their solutions. This will give you very well and \u201cproved\u201d by winning the resource to learn what really works. What I mean by \u201cproved\u201d? It is easy for some \u201cexpert\u201d to write an article or even a book about some algorithm, technique, or tool, stating that this is the best or most effective, etc. We can find a lot of descriptions of such \u201cbest\u201d algorithms and tools. But sadly part of those tools and algorithms are quite far from being even good, not close to calling them best. So whom can we believe to?", "Winning competition in my opinion is a good argument that used approach is worth exploring and learning about it. And this is important as we can\u2019t learn everything, so it is wise to concentrate on really effective and progressive things.", "By taking part in competitions (even if not winning them), discussions and communities, you will gain some reputation. Once you will prove yourself as a good competitor or simply smart person, people will recognize you, will start following you and listening to your opinion. They will start asking for your advice and can even offer some job or research opportunities.", "With more than 10 years of experience in IT, I\u2019m receiving job offers very regularly. But I\u2019ve never received as many offers before as after winning my first Data Science competition on Kaggle.", "It is similar as I previously mentioned about winning a competition as a \u201cproof\u201d for algorithm or tool \u2014 it is a \u201cproof\u201d for people to. Everyone can state being an expert in Machine Learning. And almost everyone can finish an online course about Machine Learning. But by far not everyone is indeed good in Machine Learning. Winning a competition however is a good reason to believe that person really knows something and can use his/her knowledge on real tasks (or at least is extremely lucky).", "And getting contacts and reputation is a good thing, as you never know, what life-changing opportunities can come to you this way.", "Not everyone will win prizes. Which is naturally as there can be several thousand competitors but prizes are very few (typically only some 3 to 5, sometimes even just one). So prizes should not be the main reason for entering Data Science competitions. On the other hand, as you will get better and better in Data Science and competing, your chances of getting some prizes will significantly grow.", "Top competitors can get thousands of Euros every year from competition prizes \u2014 it\u2019s a really nice bonus to receive something for doing a thing that you like in addition to the gained knowledge. Of course, a good data scientist could earn even more by taking some contracts with companies offering freelancing opportunities on Data Science tasks or doing some other stuff. But contracts mean promises and hard deadlines. On the other hand, competing is your free will \u2014 you can do it while you like and benefit from it and can stop any time if you find something better or more valuable to do.", "And last, but not least \u2014 it\u2019s fun! And a feeling of competition can give some extra motivation at the moment when it is really needed.", "How many people register for the free online course? And how many of them will listen to the whole course until the end? From my experience, those numbers will be greatly different. This is because at the beginning people have a huge motivation, a lot of energy \u2014 they can read, learn, experiment for many hours a day. But as time goes, enthusiasm shrinks. And it requires a really strong will to finish a task and to keep learning, requiring several weeks or even months of hard work.", "However, with competitions it is a little bit easier. At the beginning you will be somewhere at the very bottom. And using your huge starting enthusiasm you can get up quite high on the leaderboard. And then you\u2019ll need just a little bit to climb even higher. You\u2019ll get there and there will be again someone just a little bit ahead, so you will continue to catch him. And so on. And as you will move closer and closer to the top, you\u2019ll get even more motivation as the very top is so close. Extra motivation and fun of competitions can help not to give up until the finish and to learn much more.", "So far I\u2019ve talked about only positive things regarding Competitive Data science. Is there something negative? Yes, there are some concerns. Not too many though, but still worth mentioning.", "There could be cases when competition organizers fail to properly prepare data for a competition. That can affect negatively your possibilities to learn from this data. In order to perform well in such competitions, you will have to find data leaks or other data preparation problems instead of trying to solve a Data Science prediction problem. Of course, finding problems in data will teach you something, too. But in general, such problems will damage your learning experience for a given competition.", "Luckily most of the competitions I\u2019ve taken part in were prepared qualitatively, but still, a potential presence of data problems is something one should be aware of.", "Competitive Data Science can learn us a lot. There are different kinds of competitions with image data, tabular data, natural language processing tasks, time-series data, and many others. And competitions captures many aspects of Machine Learning, including data preparation, feature engineering, cross-validation, model selection, tuning of hyper-parameters, post-processing, stacking.", "But there are still several real-life tasks which are not covered by typical competitions. Like the gathering of data, choosing of metric for optimization, deployment of a model in production. So competitions won\u2019t teach you absolutely everything about Data Science and Machine Learning and you will have to find ways for learning things left out of scope here.", "Time is one of the most valuable resources we as people have. And we must choose carefully how to spend it. Our family, kids, work, hobbies, the rest \u2014 everything requires time. And almost always time is not enough for all of that, so we need to make some compromises.", "And seriously competing for top places requires a lot of time! Especially at the beginning, as there are so many things to learn \u2014 theory, Machine Learning algorithms, terminology, programming language, libraries, tools, and many other things. Of course \u2014 all those things will be useful further, in other competitions, in real-life Data Science tasks, so that time spent in learning them won\u2019t be wasted. But definitely, something will have to be sacrificed \u2014 either it is time for sleep or time spent on the TV or something else.", "In my opinion, investing time in competitions is not the worst thing, as benefits and returns from this will be huge. However be careful not to exceed all limits, spending whole days and nights competing. Competitive Data Science can be very addictive \u2014 decide on how much time you will spend there and follow your limits!", "That\u2019s it. I\u2019ve shared all my positive and negative impressions regarding Competitive Data Science as a learning path. Hopefully, you\u2019ve got some useful insights and now can decide if you want to try taking part in some competition if hadn\u2019t done yet before.", "Your home for data science.
