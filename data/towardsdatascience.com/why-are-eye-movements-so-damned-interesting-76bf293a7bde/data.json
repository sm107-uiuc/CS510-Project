My father (a real doctor) was visiting, and I was excited to show off the lab. He was seemingly mesmerized by a wall full of journals on Presbyopia. But after a long period of concentration he said, \u201cPresbyopia? You get old; you need reading glasses. What else is there to say?\u201d I found that hard to disagree with, so I struggled to explain why I found eye movements so interesting.", "Yet, the study of eye movements played a critical role throughout the history of Science and \u2014 inexorably intertwined with study of vision and perception \u2014 served as the crucible for emerging fields of psychology, neuroscience, and cybernetics. Eye movements have fascinated \u2014 and eluded \u2014 some of the greatest minds over the millennia, including Aristotle, Ptolemy, Galen, Alhazen, da Vinci, Bacon, Descartes, Helmholtz, and Sherrington.", "Perhaps the most influential of the ancients was Galen of Pergamon (129\u2013200 AD). He was one of the most prolific writers in antiquity, his surviving works exceed 1 million words. (He was also personal physician to Roman Emperors Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus, Commodus, Septimius Severus, and Caracalla.) Galen gave us the first detailed understanding of muscular contraction. He recognized muscles worked in agonist/antagonist pairs and speculated that they were powered by \u201canimal spirits\u201d flowing through the nerves. He performed dissections of rhesus monkeys, detailed the organization and structure of the six extraocular muscles, and even performed surgeries to correct strabismus and cataracts. Not bad for 200 A.D.", "Over most of the next millennium, most advances in mathematics and sciences can be attributed to the \u201cIslamic Golden Age.\u201d Arab mathematician \u1e24asan Ibn al-Haytham (Latinized Alhazen) expanded on the ideas of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Galen and was the first to apply these theories to the \u201cscientific method\u201d of hypothesis testing. His contributions preceded or anticipated many developments over the next thousand years. He reasoned that vision was the result of light impinging on the retina, rather than emanating from the eyes. He calculated the existence of a surface in space, the horopter, where vision is monocular (both eyes see the same image). Alhazen (as well as Ptolemy) also noted that eye movements were either conjugate (the same) or disjunctive (opposite). In the 1800\u2019s, this phenomenon was formally established as \u201cHering\u2019s Law,\u201d and continues to be a significant topic of study and debate in neuroscience and psychology. (More on this later. See Fig. 5.)", "Alhazen had been commissioned by Caliphs of Egypt, to regulate the flooding of the Nile at Aswan. But his plan proved unworkable, and he was arrested by caliph Al-Hakin bi-Amr Allah. While under house arrest, Alhazen wrote his seven-volume Book of Optics (1011\u20131021). This is widely credited with having established Optics as the first, modern scientific discipline, and Alhazen is often referred to as \u201cThe Father of Optics.\u201d His work was first translated into Latin 200 years later and became widely influential on Renaissance scientists after it was printed in 1571.", "The most significant advance in Western science was the invention of corrective eyeglasses in Italy (circa 1280), but the eye movements gained renewed attention in the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci created hundreds of anatomical studies or the eyes and brain (using cows, as human dissections were forbidden). He was one of the first to recognize the optic nerves crossed hemispheres (Fig. 2). Johannes Kepler\u2019s work on the retinal image extended Alhazen\u2019s ideas. Even Francis Bacon had something to say about eye movements, though admittedly, not his best work:", "\u201cThe eyes do move one and the same way; for when one eye moveth to the nostril, the other moveth from the nostril. The cause is motion of consent, which in the spirits and parts spiritual is strong\u00b2.\u201d", "The Eyes and The Scientific Revolution", "To history buffs, it probably comes as no surprise that Rene Descartes was to have the most lasting impact on the field. Through his seminal studies of the optics of the retina, the reflex arc, and oculomotor mechanics, he offered one of the first, integrated views of neurobiology. Cartesian physics was uncompromisingly mechanistic, placing the enterprise on a testable, scientific foundation and ushering in the Scientific Revolution across several branches of biology.", "For instance, his \u201cballoon theory\u201d of ocular muscle operation (1664), launched a 300-year quest to unravel the mechanisms of muscular contraction. Descartes proposed muscles were powered by hydraulic fluids from a central reservoir (the ventricles of the brain [Fig. 3]). His theory had a short reign, being disproved in 1667 by Jan Swammerdam, who demonstrated muscles did not change volume when contracting\u00b3. (From this point on the canonical muscle of study transitioned to the more convenient, frog legs.) Galvani (1791) demonstrated electricity can trigger muscle contraction, leading to electromotive theories (and inspiring re-animation in Mary Shelly\u2019s Frankenstein). Protein folding and spring theories dominated the field for 100 years. The modern, sliding filament theory was developed in 1954\u20131969 by Andrew Huxley\u2074. Incidentally, Andrew Huxley received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, but not for his work on muscle. He and Alan Hodgkin developed the mathematical model for the propagation of neural action potentials with Alan Hodgkin in 1952. His half-brother, Aldous Huxley, wrote Brave New World.", "What was the scientific appeal of eye movements? Beyond our natural fascination with the visual senses, the oculomotor system possesses three, unique advantages as a system of study.", "First, unlike almost everything else in Science \u2014 the goal, or purpose, of an eye movement is obvious. They are subject to both conscious and unconscious control, allowing lines of research into reflexes, volitional control, as well as psychological processes.", "Second, the oculomotor system is almost the simplest mechanical system imaginable. The human eyeball is nearly spherical, and the eye does not physically interact with the environment (it does not have to lift anything). This greatly simplifies the dynamical equations used to model its\u2019 operation. The eye is controlled by an ensemble of 6 extraocular muscles. For the most part, horizontal eye movements are driven by a single pair of muscles (medial and lateral rectii). Vertical and cyclorotary movements are only slightly more complicated. For instance, the Superior Oblique muscle operates using a pulley fashioned from a loop of tendon, the Trochlea (Fig. 4A), efficiently leveraging muscle force, while reversing its\u2019 direction. Another interesting tidbit: owls and hawks have the full complement of 6 extraocular muscles, despite the fact that they can barely move their oddly-shaped eyes (Fig. 4B). The head movements of owls are analogous to mammalian eye movements.", "Third, there are only a handful of distinct types of eye movements:", "1. Saccades: rapid \u201cjerks\u201d of the eye to reposition the eye in space, like while reading. \u201cSaccade\u201d is French for \u201cjerk.\u201d Human infants produce saccades, but not tracking movements.", "2. Tracking movements (smooth pursuit, optokinetic, whole field tracking): Deficiencies in tracking eye movements are evidence of schizophrenia, autism, and other disorders.", "3. Vergence: simultaneous movements of both eyes in opposite directions, to maintain binocular vision. An extreme example of vergence is to go \u201ccross-eyed.\u201d", "4. The Vestibular Ocular Reflex: counter-rotation of the eyes to stabilize the gaze as the head rotates. The three vestibular semi-circular canals detect angular acceleration, acting as biological gyroscopes. Disorders of the VOR can lead to motion sickness and vertigo.", "5. Accommodation: changing the focal length by reshaping the lens.", "6. Pupillary: shrinking the pupil to reduce light intensity. Head trauma can cause asymmetrical pupillary response.", "As we will see, these 6 movements are driven by separate control systems, yet are integrated in function. The simple dynamics of eye movements allowed focussed, incremental research, often leading to breakthroughs far ahead of other areas in physiology and neurobiology.", "Eye movements are essentially two-dimensional, but the eye can move with three degrees of freedom (horizontal, vertical, and cyclorotary). There is little in the anatomy of the eye muscles themselves to prevent the eye from doing some very weird things (think of the chameleon). This observation led to a line of research to understand why they don\u2019t. In the 19th Century, it was fashion to cast nearly any relationship between observations as a natural \u201claw.\u201d Accordingly, the era witnessed the discovery of several \u201claws of eye movements,\u201d building toward an understanding that it was neurobiological control, rather than mechanical constraints, that governed eye movements.", "If eye movements were simple rotations about the axis, a 45-degree oblique eye movement would be very different than two movements (horizontal, then vertical) to the same position, with the eye/retina being rotated 10 degrees. Donder\u2019s law states that for any one gaze direction the eye\u2019s 3D spatial orientation is unique and independent of how the eye reached that gaze direction.", "Listing\u2019s law states that all achieved eye orientations can be reached by starting from one specific \u201cprimary\u201d reference orientation and then rotating about an axis that lies within the plane orthogonal to the primary orientation\u2019s gaze direction. In other words, Donder\u2019s Law tells us that the final orientation of the eye is independent of the path of eye movements, and Listing Law tells us what that orientation is.", "To visualize these laws scientists built sophisticated physical models, to study rotations of the eye and the action of the ocular muscles. The inventor of the first such device, Christian Georg Theodor Ruete, called it an \u201cophthalmotrope\u201d (Fig. 1). Both Donder\u2019s and Listing\u2019s laws can be demonstrated on this model. The degree of muscle contraction or extension are measured on a scale at the back of the model. Other versions operated with suspended weights, to create muscle tension.", "A unifying figure in the field was the polymath, Hermann von Helmholtz. Today, he is perhaps more widely known for his studies of electromagnetism, the Helmholtz wave equation\u2076, and the Helmholtz theorems in fluid mechanics, but his comprehensive studies of physiological optics and ophthalmology had perhaps even greater impact\u2077.", "Helmholtz experimentally confirmed Listing\u2019s law, comparing visual afterimages at various eye positions to Listing\u2019s predictions. He invented of the ophthalmoscope, the familiar device doctors use to look into your eye. He was also the first to measure the speed of neural signals (which at the time, were thought to be instantaneous, like electricity).", "His students are perhaps even more famous, including Heinrich Hertz and Nobel Prize winners Albert Michelson and Max Plank. Another of his students was Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (1832\u20131920). While working in his lab, Wundt developed his skills in experimental methods and developed an advanced design of an ophthalmotrope. He established himself as a highly influential neurophysiologist. Wundt would go on to be the first person to call himself a \u201cpsychologist\u201d and is often referred to as the \u201cfather of experimental psychology.\u201d Wundt, in turn, trained a whopping 170 Ph.D. students over his career, intellectually colonizing two fields \u2014 neuroscience and psychology.", "Hering\u2019s Law of equal innervation states that eye movements are always equal in the two eyes, but not in direction. In conjugate eye movements (saccades and smooth pursuit), the eyes move equally together. For disjunctive movements (like vergence), the innervation is equal, but opposite. What this means is counterintuitive, but easy to demonstrate. Consider the task of refoveating both eyes on a new target (Fig. 5). The simplest solution would be to change the eye positions independently. But, the eyes instead move according to Hering\u2019s Law, where both eyes move to the new visual direction, then in the opposite direction (vergence) to re-establish binocular vision. This was a formalization of the observations by Ptolemy and Alhazen was further evidence that the eye movements were constrained by some kind of neural control logic. Perhaps surprisingly, Hering\u2019s law is violated during REM sleep, where most of the time the individual eye movements are more-or-less independent of each other. This contradicts the notion that dreams generate eye movements to visualize scenes, \u201cunless each eye is experiencing a different dream\u2078\u201d(Fig. 6).", "As with many great scientists, Hering and Helmholtz were both colleagues and rivals. Helmholtz thought Hering\u2019s Law was learned behaviour; Hering thought it was instinctual, or \u2018hard-wired.\u2019 Each independently derived the binocular horopter, the locus of points in space that have the same anatomical disparity on both retinas, or points of single vision (first described by Alhazen). Hering developed a theory of visual hyperacuity, showing how the resolution of an array of photoreceptors can exceed that of the size of an individual receptor. He also proposed the \u201copponent theory\u201d of color vision (Helmholtz advocated the alternative, three-color receptor theory of Thomas Young and James Clerk Maxwell).", "The last law of the 19th Century is Sherrington\u2019s Law of Reciprocal Innervation, whereby action of the antagonist muscle is accompanied by reciprocal relaxation of the antagonist muscle. This essentially is a restatement of Descartes\u2019 balloon theory in the context of modern neurobiology. He also introduced the term proprioception, to describe the sixth sense of kinaesthesia (\u201cmuscle sense\u201d), leading to the discovery of sensory neurons that detect muscle stretching, tension, and velocity, such as the Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles. Sherrington received the Nobel Prize for his work on neuron function, synaptic communication, and reflexes.", "Early 20th Century: Breakthroughs in Theoretical Biology", "More pieces of the puzzle came together in the mid-20th Century, with two crowning achievements of the physiology: (i) the Hodgkin-Huxley Model of nerve conduction (which, among other things, explains the biochemical process that governs the speed of neural signals measured by Helmholtz) and (ii) the Huxley Sliding Filament model of muscle contraction\u00b3, which also gives an explanation the force-velocity and length-tension relationships of muscle. The development of electrophysiological recording techniques allowed investigators to measure the signals generated by individual neurons.", "Meanwhile, McCulloch and Pitts\u2019 1943 paper showed how networks of neurons could perform the same logical and mathematical operations as a computer. In 1949, Donald Hebb proposed the first rule for synaptic modification, showing how simple processes could be responsible for re-wiring networks with experience \u2014 thus ushering in a new field of computational biology and neural networks.", "Electrophysiology, combined with models of all the components (the mechanical plant, muscles, and neurons) offered the unique opportunity to study neuromuscular control at \u201csystems\u201d level. This allowed researchers to look farther back into the neural circuitry to understand how eye movement commands are planned, coordinated, executed in the brain.", "In 1948, Norbert Weiner defined this emerging field as Cybernetics as \u201cthe scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine\u201d. His insight was that the huge arsenal of analytic methodologies developed for the analysis of signals and control systems (in electrical and mechanical engineering) could be applied to understand neurobiological control.", "One of the first important results in cybernetics was the work of none other than my advisor, Larry Stark. Of course, the work was related to eye movements. He measured the time delay of neural feedback in the pupillary reflex, by inducing oscillations applications of frequency analysis and control theory\u2079 \u00b9\u2070. Knowing the duration of the delay and the speed of neural signals helps pinpoint the location of the circuitry.", "More were to follow, as each of the four types of extraocular eye movements had different latencies, indicating different upstream neural processing and separate control systems (VOR 50\u2013100 ms, smooth pursuit 100\u2013130 ms, vergence 160\u2013180 ms, saccades 200 ms). Indeed, Hering\u2019s Law implicitly suggested this. For example, when eyes begin to follow a target, the smooth pursuit system kicks in first, tracking direction and speed, followed by a corrective (\u201ccatch-up\u201d) saccade to foveate on the target\u00b9\u00b9 (Fig. 7).", "Contemporaries (notably David Robinson at Johns Hopkins) began to combine electrophysiology with control theory, to study individual neurons involved in planning and executing eye movements. This allowed the creation of quantitative, testable circuit diagrams of the control systems involved in generating saccadic, smooth pursuit, VOR, and vergence eye movements.", "Robinson\u2019s landmark work on saccadic feedback control\u00b9\u00b2 was performed on macaque monkeys \u2014 the same species subjected to Galen\u2019s dissections. Another model he created (Figure 7) is one possible model of integrated smooth pursuit and VOR control, though it is by no means unique. These models suggest that eye movements are driven by feedback control systems, wherein the motor neurons are driven to minimize the error between the target velocity or position and the actual. Either this is a happy accident of using control theory to study the eyes, or testament to the efficiency of nature.", "Several years after my lab rotation, I worked with another Electrical Engineering professor (and colleague of Robinson), Edward Keller, who was conducting research on the population behaviour of monkey brainstem neurons involved in the planning and execution of saccades. One region of the brain, the Superior Colliculus, maintains a spatial map not of the visual disparity or the geometric location, but of the error signal between the eye\u2019s position and the target of interest (Fig. 9). Here, unlike with the motor neurons, it is the location of the neural activity, rather than its intensity, that determines the magnitude of the eye movement\u00b9\u00b3. The efferent pathways downstream transform this spatial signal into a temporal control signal, which is required for the motor neurons.", "Electrode recording of lower brain stem activity seemingly indicated that eye movements are executed before the subject\u2019s awareness, stirring up debates about free will. A more comforting explanation is that the brain is constantly engaged in contingency planning for motor control.", "Scores of genetic, medical, and psychological disorders can be diagnosed from irregularities in eye movements\u00b9\u2074. At my alma mater, ocular motility is a required course for first year optometry students, for their potential to diagnose unknown medical conditions, such as strokes or brain tumours. Since most people never visit a neurologist, often the only opportunity for early detection is with an optometrist. Simple eye movement testing is also part of a general physical.", "The use of psilocybin effectively lowers the \u2018gain\u2019 of the positional feedback system, so subjects will move their eyes only 20% as much when viewing a scene. 60% of schizophrenics demonstrate involuntary nystagmus, a rapid jerking back and forth of the eyes. With heavy alcohol consumption, the smooth pursuit system begins to fail, and the eyes track instead with jerky eye movements (as revealed in the standard field sobriety test). For the first 4\u20135 months, infants not able to produce tracking movements.", "Try it out yourself, next time there is a new addition to the family. Amuse your friends or disturb the in-laws by testing baby\u2019s eye movements. In the first six months, all you can elicit is saccadic eye movements. But, no matter how much alcohol you give the baby, he will probably still pass a field sobriety test, compared to sober babies.", "Do you still think eye movements are not interesting?", "I give up. You\u2019re just like my dad.", "Russell Anderson has published several pseudo-histories of Science on Medium. He has a Bachelor\u2019s in Electrical Engineering and Ph.D. in Bioengineering from the University of California. At least 5 of his professors conducted research on eye movements (Lawrence Stark, Ed Keller, Steve Lehman, Edwin Lewis, and Steven Heinen). He taught laboratory sessions to Larry Stark\u2019s course on \u201cOcular Motility,\u201d served as editor for Biological Cybernetics, and conducted postdoctoral research with Ed Keller at Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute. After leaving academia, he has worked over 20 years building commercial predictive solutions at HNC Software, J.P. Morgan, Halifax Bank of Scotland, Opera Solutions, KPMG, and IBM\u2026 always with eye movements always on his mind.", "1. Even for Berkeley, Dr. Stark was an eccentric. He was on the faculty in three, seemingly unrelated departments: Physiological Optics (School of Optometry), Neuroscience (UCSF), and Electrical Engineering (UCB). This, in spite of the fact that he did not have a Ph.D. himself. He got his MD at age 21, as part of a World War II acceleration program. He practiced medicine briefly in the Korean War, then landed in academia.", "5. Martin, G.R. (2017). What drives bird vision? Bill control and predator detection overshadow flight.
