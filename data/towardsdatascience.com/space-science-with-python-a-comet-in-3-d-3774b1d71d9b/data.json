So overwhelming that I did not have much sleep \u2026 now \u2026 I am waiting, sitting in front of screens with several other scientists to wait and witness a scientific and engineering milestone in human history: The landing of a spacecraft on the comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko. The lander\u2019s name: Philae; an essential part of ESA\u2019s mission Rosetta/Philae.", "Spacecraft missions are indeed generation projects. I have seen documents of the mission\u2019s ideas and objectives that were dated back when I was visiting elementary school. During secondary education the mission launched (2004), during by Bachelor\u2019s studies the mission was still flying in interplanetary space (2009\u20132012). Then, during my Master\u2019s in 2014, I was sitting now with scientists in the lander control centre in Cologne (Germany), working in the Dust Impact Monitor (DIM) team, as a part of the Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiment (SESAME) collaboration [1, 2, 3]. DIM was a rubric\u2019s cube sized and shaped instrument on the lander. It\u2019s objective was to measure impacts of millimetre sized dust particles during the landing (descent) phase and on the comet\u2019s surface itself. The measurement principle was simple: DIM analysed and derived the particles\u2019 properties from impacts on piezo-electric elements \u2026 these are the same electronic components that convert swinging guitar strings to electric signals \u2026 making it an electric guitar.", "The landing of Philae and months of close observations with the Rosetta orbiter revealed a ancient cosmic world formed at the very beginning of our Solar System: consisting of water ice, minerals and an abundance of organic compounds. Rosetta/Philae, and my personal story that is linked to it would probably be a nice addition for another less data scientific Medium article. For now, what matters is that the mission gathered a huge amount of data that is analysed or still waiting to be analysed and also published. All data are publicly available, either on NASA\u2019s Planetary Data System\u2019s site (PDS) and / or on ESA\u2019s Planetary Science Archive (PSA).", "In the last sessions, we learned a lot about comets, their origin, their relation to Jupiter and observational biases. Today, we will have a look at the shape of this exemplary comet core.", "Preusker et al. (2015) [1] used the image data from a camera system on board the orbiter Rosetta called Optical, Spectroscopic and Infrared Remote Imaging System (OSIRIS) to define a coordinate system for this weirdly formed comet as well as to derive a so called shape model. A shape model contains 3 dimensional information of an object that allows one to render, visualise and work with 3 D objects. Shape models contain so called vertices and additionally edge or face information:", "Shape models of the comet 67P have also been derived by the so-called Navigation Cameras (NAVCAM) that were used to determine the spacecraft\u2019s orientation in space. NAVCAM was intentionally an engineering device that allowed one however to derive scientific insights.", "NASA\u2019s mighty SPICE toolkit that we used in the previous tutorial session has some great functionalities to work with shape models. These models are abbreviated as so-called dsks (digital shape kernels). We will get back to the dsk functions in the future.", "Today, we will need to install a new package for 3 D rendering: visvis. visvis works with miscellaneous graphical backends like: FLTK, GTK, Wx and also PyQT5. For this tutorial we will be working with QT and install it via:", "Now we can install visvis via:", "Please note a few things: The installation and testing for this session has been done on Mac OS Catalina. If you face any issues with Linux or Windows, do not hesitate to ask here. We will try to figure it out.", "The creator of visvis provides a nice wiki page if you are interested in more examples. The creator also states that there are similar libraries out there like vispy.", "First, let\u2019s import the already known libraries (also imageio and tqdm as used in a supplementary article). We will also need our custom function func (line 10) to download the shape model. Due to its size of around 85 MB the shape model cannot be stored on the tutorial corresponding GitHub repository.", "An extra folder (line 2) shall be created for the shape model. The download link of the model is listed in line 3 and 4. You can see that the link contains the dsk SPICE notation. The file name of the shape model appears somehow cryptic so let\u2019s take a look at the folder\u2019s corresponding readme file. It states:", "In our case, we have a shape model of the comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko (CG) from the Rosetta mission (ROS). There are at least 1 million plates (faces) in the data set (M0001), derived from the OSIRIS camera (O) with a so-called Stereo Photo Clinometry (SPC) method by the Laboratoire d\u2019Astrophysique de Marseille + Planetary Science Institute (LPS): OSPCLPS. The object is named (N) and it is currently version 1 (V1). The data are stored in a so called OBJ file.", "After the download, we load the shape model with the pandas read_csv function. The file has 4 columns. The first one indicates the type with a v for vertex or f for face. The last three columns are the corresponding coordinates (vertex) or vertex indices (face). According to the printed results (see below) we have almost 600,000 vertices and over one million faces, as the file name already indicated.", "Now, we can take a look at the vertex (line 2 and 3) and face (line 4 and 5) data, by printing the first 5 rows with the pandas head function:", "We can see the coordinates for the vertices and the indices for the vertices (faces). The coordinates of the vertices are given in km and represent the actual physical 3 dimensional size of the comet\u2019s core!", "We can easily assign a Python list with the vertices (line 2 and 3), by converting the vertices sub-set to a list with tolist. The faces however (line 4), need some more data parsing. We will see it in the next code snippet.", "Let\u2019s print the minimum (line 2) and maximum (line 3) vertex index in the faces sub-set \u2026", "\u2026 We see, that the minimum index is 1; further, the index appears to be a float. For our Python routine, the indices start at 0. We need to subtract the indices by 1:", "The subtraction is simply done in line 2. Afterwards, we convert the floats to integers and convert the faces sub-set to a Python list.", "We are now ready to go! We should be able to adjust the resolution of the window, to change the settings according to the computer's performance. For this purpose, the creator of visvis provides a nice example for QT4. We need to change some imports for QT5:", "And we are ready to explore our comet! First, we create the visvis application (line 2 and 3). We create the main window that was defined before in line 6 and set a proper resolution in line 7. Now, with the function mesh the shape model is read. The vertices and faces are committed as well as a parameter that tells the function how many vertices define a face (here: 3). Line 14 gets the axes objects (similar as in matplotlib) that allows us to set a background colour (line 17) and to adjust some parameters (line 20 and 21). Now, we set a camera setting (3d) in line 26. Note: if you want to \u201cfly\u201d along the comet, like in a game (with w-a-s-d (translation) and i-j-k-l (tilt)), replace this parameter with \u201cfly\u201d. The field-of-view is defined in 29 as well as the initial camera\u2019s azimuth and elevations angle (line 32 and 33). And finally, we can run it (line 36).", "Below, you can see a short movie. Feel free to run the application locally on your computer, adjust the settings and explore this cosmic world. 67P is weirdly shaped. It consists much likely of a binary system that merged at some point in the past. The \u201crubber duck\u201d consists of two bodies with crater and basins, while the \u201cneck\u201d in between is much smoother. The object (486958) Arrokoth has a similar shape that was being visited by NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission.", "Finally, let\u2019s finish our exploration with the very first animation at the beginning of the tutorial. For this purpose, we set a smaller resolution, since the resulting GIF should not exceed 25 MB (Medium limit; line 9). We change the material properties of the comet in line 14 and 15; the resulting object is less shiny and appears more realistic. Further, per default, our camera view has an \u201cattached spotlight\u201d that illuminates the object. We turn this light source off (line 36 and 37) and add a fixed light source in line 38. Now, in line 44 to 57 we change the camera\u2019s azimuth angle dynamically in a for-loop (line 47) and re-draw the figure in each step (line 50 and 51). The resulting image is extracted in line 54 and line 57 converts the image data to an 8 bit matrix and appends the result to a list that was defined in line 41. Finally, in line 60, we create the animation as a GIF.", "Enjoy the 3 D power of Python and visvis! Scientists have worked hundreds of hours to derive this scientifically highly accurate shape model after waiting for years to reach the comet! It is now up to you to explore this world and compare the model with actual observations stored in the ESA image database. We will work with this model and derive some more parameters like the entire surface of the comet and we will also work with the coordinate system of 67P. What do we know about 67P?", "By the way. The methods that I am showing have actually been used for scientific insights and publications! Take a look at [2]: Link. In figure 3, you can see the recent model back then. With the Philae corresponding spk kernel you could try to reproduce this figure (without the lander)!", "Your home for data science.
