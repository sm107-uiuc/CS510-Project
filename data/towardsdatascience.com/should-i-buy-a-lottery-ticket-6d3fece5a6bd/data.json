The reason why I feel hesitant in those moments is my lack of trust in the randomness of the numbers picked. When you do a search on the manipulation of the lottery results, there are many resources explaining how this is system is open to fraud and manipulation. You can also encounter past events of how former employees of the lottery manipulated the results.", "Seeing the news about manipulation and fraud of past lottery results, I became more discomfort in trusting the results of the lottery. Having experience and background in data science, this year I decided to use statistics to prove that I have an equal chance of winning the lottery as anybody else. In this article, I am going to talk about how I leveraged statistics to analyze lottery results and come up with a decision to buy/not buy a lottery ticket.", "The lottery I am going to do analysis on is called \u201cSay\u0131sal Lotto\u201d, which is one of the national lottery types in Turkey. The game inner workings are as follows: 6 numbers are drawn from the range [1,49], where the prizes are distributed to those guessing 6, 5, 4, 3 numbers right in decreasing magnitude. Without going into too much detail, let\u2019s dive into mathematics and analyze the game from a statistics perspective.", "Deciding to Buy a Lottery Ticket", "From this section on, I am going to explain the approach I used and share the code snippets. However, in order for you to better understand the methodology used, I am going to define and use some terms such as random variables and probability along the way. Outline of the sections is as follows:", "Step1: What is a random variable?", "A random variable is a variable whose distribution function assigns values to different outcomes of an experiment. Random variables are often designated by letters. They are classified as discrete, which have specific values with finite or infinite ranges, or continuous, which can take any value in some interval on the real number line. In the lottery case, drawing a number from 49 numbers can only have integer numbers in the range [1,49]. Therefore, I am working with a discrete random variable in the lottery context.", "An event, on the other hand, is an outcome, to which a probability value is assigned. I am sure you can find more formal definitions on the web. But for our purposes, let\u2019s talk more about mathematics.", "Step2: The probability of winning the lotto", "The probability of an event tells you how likely it is that the event will occur given all possible consequences. For example, \u201cteam A has a 1 in 3 shot at winning\u201d means that the probability of team A winning is 1/3 = 0.33 considering all of the possible outcomes. A random event is likely to happen if the probability of the event is close to 1.", "In the lottery, the probability of winning is equal to the fraction of wining numbers to the total number of all possible lottery numbers. In other words, you try to get the right combination among all possible combinations of 6 numbers from a bag of 49 numbers.", "In order to find the probability of winning, I need to figure out all possible lottery outcomes. This is where I use a combination. I pick r items from a set of n items regardless of the order picked, where r is 6 and n is 49. Then the probability of winning the lottery becomes 1/13,983,816.", "You may say that \u201cwell, that is already reason not to play, as the odds of winning are very low\u201d. However, remember that I am after possible manipulation of the numbers drawn. So I am not going to talk about if it is rational to play. If I were to calculate the probability of getting 2 (not any 2 random numbers but the actual number 2) from 49 numbers in a draw, then I would set 1 position of all possible 6 positions to 2 and do the same calculation for the rest of the 5 positions, \u224a 0.12", "I now have the probability of getting a number (a specific number like 2,3,30,etc.) right in a lottery. The distribution of the probability is as follows:", "Having analyzed the last 1000 lotteries, I have the aggregated number frequency of each number drawn i.e I know if 2 appeared 150 times in the last 1000 lotteries. This is the observed number frequency distribution of the numbers drawn.", "In order to find the expected value for the number frequency of a specific number for the last 1000 lotteries (sample size=1000), I multiplied each k in the range [0,1000] with the respective probability of picking that number in a lottery (if k is 100, that specific number appeared 100 times out of 1000 lotteries). The formula is E(x) = x*P(x).", "I finally got 122 as the expected value for the number frequency of a specific number for a sample of 1000.", "Step4: Running chi2 goodness of fit test", "Chi-Square goodness of fit test is used to determine whether sample data distribution is consistent with an expected distribution. I set up the hypothesis for Chi-Square goodness of fit test and later calculated chi2 statistics with respective degree of freedom:", "A. Null hypothesis: There is no significant difference between the observed and the expected value.", "B. Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant difference between the observed and the expected value.", "After running the above code snippet I got 35.596 for the chi2 statistics. Having checked p values from the chi2 table, I conclude that there is no significant difference between the observed and expected value. Hence, I can assure myself that the data is not manipulated and can buy a lottery ticket.", "In this post, I shared how I analyzed the past lottery data statistically to decide to buy a lottery ticket. Although I didn\u2019t find any manipulation statistically, I don\u2019t claim that this is the final conclusion. You can analyze the same data using different methodologies and come up with a different result. The code, not structured, (link) may be helpful if you also want to give it a try.", "If you have any questions regarding the post or any questions about data science in general, you can find me on Linkedin.", "Enjoy reading and wish you a happy new year!", "Your home for data science.
