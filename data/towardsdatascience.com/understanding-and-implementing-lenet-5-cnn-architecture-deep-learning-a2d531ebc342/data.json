Many of the listed authors of the paper have gone on to provide several significant academic contributions to the field of deep learning.", "This article will introduce the LeNet-5 CNN architecture as described in the original paper, along with the implementation of the architecture using TensorFlow 2.0.", "This article will then conclude with the utilization of the implemented LeNet-5 CNN for the classification of images from the MNIST dataset.", "The content in this article is written for Deep learning and Machine Learning students of all levels.", "For those who are eager to get coding, scroll down to the \u2018LeNet-5 TensorFlow Implementation\u2019 section.", "Convolutional Neural Networks is the standard form of neural network architecture for solving tasks associated with images. Solutions for tasks such as object detection, face detection, pose estimation and more all have CNN architecture variants.", "A few characteristics of the CNN architecture makes them more favourable in several computer vision tasks. I have written previous articles that dive into each characteristic.", "LeNet-5 CNN architecture is made up of 7 layers. The layer composition consists of 3 convolutional layers, 2 subsampling layers and 2 fully connected layers.", "The diagram above shows a depiction of the LeNet-5 architecture, as illustrated in the original paper.", "The first layer is the input layer \u2014 this is generally not considered a layer of the network as nothing is learnt in this layer. The input layer is built to take in 32x32, and these are the dimensions of images that are passed into the next layer. Those who are familiar with the MNIST dataset will be aware that the MNIST dataset images have the dimensions 28x28. To get the MNIST images dimension to the meet the requirements of the input layer, the 28x28 images are padded.", "The grayscale images used in the research paper had their pixel values normalized from 0 to 255, to values between -0.1 and 1.175. The reason for normalization is to ensure that the batch of images have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, the benefits of this is seen in the reduction in the amount of training time. In the image classification with LeNet-5 example below, we\u2019ll be normalizing the pixel values of the images to take on values between 0 to 1.", "The LeNet-5 architecture utilizes two significant types of layer construct: convolutional layers and subsampling layers.", "Within the research paper and the image below, convolutional layers are identified with the \u2018Cx\u2019, and subsampling layers are identified with \u2018Sx\u2019, where \u2018x\u2019 is the sequential position of the layer within the architecture. \u2018Fx\u2019 is used to identify fully connected layers. This method of layer identification can be seen in the image above.", "The official first layer convolutional layer C1 produces as output 6 feature maps, and has a kernel size of 5x5. The kernel/filter is the name given to the window that contains the weight values that are utilized during the convolution of the weight values with the input values. 5x5 is also indicative of the local receptive field size each unit or neuron within a convolutional layer.

The reason we do this is that during the training and evaluation phases, the network expects the images to be presented within batches; the extra dimension is representative of the numbers of images in a batch.", "Keras provides tools required to implement the classification model. Keras presents a Sequential API for stacking layers of the neural network on top of each other.", "We first assign the variable\u2019lenet_5_model'to an instance of the tf.keras.Sequential class constructor.", "Within the class constructor, we then proceed to define the layers within our model.", "The C1 layer is defined by the linekeras.layers.Conv2D(6, kernel_size=5, strides=1, activation='tanh', input_shape=train_x[0].shape, padding='same').

We pass a couple of arguments which are described here.", "The rest of the convolutional layers follow the same layer definition as C1 with some different values entered for the arguments.", "In the original paper where the LeNet-5 architecture was introduced, subsampling layers were utilized. Within the subsampling layer the average of the pixel values that fall within the 2x2 pooling window was taken, after that, the value is multiplied with a coefficient value. A bias is added to the final result, and all this is done before the values are passed through the activation function.", "But in our implemented LeNet-5 neural network, we\u2019re utilizing the tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D constructor. We don\u2019 t pass any arguments into the constructor as some default values for the required arguments are initialized when the constructor is called. Remember that the pooling layer role within the network is to downsample the feature maps as they move through the network.", "There are two more types of layers within the network, the flatten layer and the dense layers.", "The flatten layer is created with the class constructor tf.keras.layers.Flatten.", "The purpose of this layer is to transform its input to a 1-dimensional array that can be fed into the subsequent dense layers.", "The dense layers have a specified number of units or neurons within each layer, F6 has 84, while the output layer has ten units.", "The last dense layer has ten units that correspond to the number of classes that are within the MNIST dataset.

Supporting factors such as momentum and learning rate schedule, provide the ideal environment to enable the network training to converge, herby getting the loss values as close to zero as possible.", "During training, we\u2019ll also validate our model after every epoch with the valuation dataset partition created earlier", "After training, you will notice that your model achieves a validation accuracy of over 90%.
