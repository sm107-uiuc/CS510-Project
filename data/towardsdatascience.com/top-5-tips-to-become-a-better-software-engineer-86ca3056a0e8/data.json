This article is intended for those of you just starting out, those of you who are curious, or those of you who are deciding to skill up, take the plunge, and dive into the surprising world of software!", "You don\u2019t just study it for 12 weeks, 6 months, or 2\u20134 years and then you\u2019re just \u201cdone.\u201d You\u2019re continually growing. Now, I\u2019ve been on a mission to emulate the human brain in machines since I was 7. Of course, I can\u2019t do this alone. We need to build an army of like-minded, hybrid technologists who are actively seeking to understand both the human brain and how machines compute information. One small step in this greater scheme is guiding my fellow builders, tinkerers, and dreamers to become better at their own craft as software engineers.", "Here are my top 5 tips that will help you become a better software engineer.", "It\u2019s more than knowing what they are, it\u2019s also knowing how to use them, why you use them, and what are the trade offs of one approach versus the other. For example, what is the difference between a linked list and an array? What are the advantages of binary search and when do you use it? Do you know how to recognize when a real world issue can be mapped as a dynamic programming problem, like the famous 0\u20131 knapsack problem, or the longest common subsequence?", "Something that\u2019s been pretty surprising to me is that a lot of people don\u2019t know how their code connects to the outside world. Some questions that you should ask yourself\u2026", "UNIX has been around for over 30 years at this point, and knowing how to work in the command line with either Linux or UNIX will help you become more effectively.", "While we don\u2019t expect you to be database experts, you should know how to write a simple SQL query in order to access data from a dataset. You\u2019ll be writing software that manipulates data in some way, so you should definitely understand how to at the very least, import that data.", "You should know that the alphabet soup of what is \u201cvogue\u201d in the time will always be changing. You should always be open to learning new languages, and as you learn more, you will realize that there is usually more in common than different, between languages.", "For example, Clojure and Haskell implementations are great for functional programming. In contrast, object oriented programming (OOP) paradigms are utilized across Python, Java, and Ruby.", "However, in 1990, FORTRAN, COBOL, and C++ were among the dominant players for languages that were \u201cin vogue.\u201d", "So whenever you think \u201cI could never learn that,\u201d STOP IT. Stop thinking that immediately.", "You aren\u2019t \u201cjust a webapp guy\u201d or \u201cjust a backend guy.\u201d You\u2019ll have your specialization, your favorite domain for sure. However, like my main man Darwin once said about organisms and survival of the fittest,", "It\u2019s never the most powerful organisms that win the game of evolution. It\u2019s always the ones that are the most adaptable, and most responsive to change.", "So, you\u2019ll also need to believe that you can learn anything and that you can always grow.", "Alright friends, these are my five tips that I think are the most important for a software engineer to know. Of course, I\u2019m also traveling along this continuous upward spiral. Sometimes I\u2019ll be rebuilding my knowledge from the ground-up. Other times, I can hit the ground running because I\u2019ve seen a similar problem or pattern before. And sometimes, I\u2019ll also hit a wall and have to go back to my first principles.", "What do you think is the most important software engineer skill, in your opinion?
