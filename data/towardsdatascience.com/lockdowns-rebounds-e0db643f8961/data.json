While approaches often begin with social distancing recommendations, and a preference for working-from-home, most governments have followed-up with more stringent lockdown measures, often closing non-essential services and sometimes instructing citizens to shelter-in-place while avoiding unnecessary travel. Some of the most extreme lockdowns have been implemented in Spain and Italy (10), with tens of millions of people ordered to stay in their homes for almost two months. In contrast, Sweden has chosen an alternative approach, avoiding a full lockdown in favour of strict social distancing measures while maintaining a working economy (11). So far, the Swedish health care system appears to be coping \u2014 it is bending but not yet breaking \u2014 but the Swedish death rate from the virus is among Europe\u2019s highest, and only time will tell whether this approach has been sagacious or foolish.", "To compare different lockdowns we present a model based on how they impact average mobility (11) and the effective reproduction number of the virus (3, 12, 13). For mobility data we used Apple\u2019s Mobility Trend Reports , which provide daily estimates of driving, walking and public transport use based on requests made to Apple Maps in various countries and regions. Each daily estimate is converted into a relative change in mobility with reference to a baseline mobility period (February 17 to March 1, 2020) and the resulting relative driving, walking and public transport data are averaged to produce a single daily, relative mobility level; a similar dataset is available from Google but it lags the Apple data by a number of days.", "To estimate the effective reproduction number of the virus at time t (Rt) we use a modified version of the approach described by (13) available as open-source code. The approach works by using Bayesian statistics to estimate the most-likely Rt from a progression of daily case numbers, using confirmed case data from the Johns Hopkins COVID- 19 Data Repository (14). The basic idea is that the relationship between the number of cases yesterday and the number of cases today tells us something about the current transmission rate of the virus, and each new day of information tells the algorithm more about what Rt might be. Since the Rt estimates are derived from observed case data, they are subject to the particulars of testing in a given country, but because the algorithm uses Bayesian statistics based on the relative differences between daily cases, it is expected to be less sensitive to the vagaries of local testing policies.", "The lockdown model assumes that mobility levels will transition through three distinct phases as a lockdown progresses. The first phase, the drop (D), begins when mobility levels have fallen below 90% of baseline levels. It corresponds to the early phase of a lockdown, when restrictions are beginning to be imposed. The drop can be short-lived and steep, if severe restrictions are quickly imposed, or it can be more gradual if restrictions are added to, incrementally, allowing people some time to adapt. Eventually falling mobility levels will reach a minimum and the drop ends on the day that levels reach within 10% of this minimum (the hold threshold), marking the start of the second, and most important, phase of the lockdown, the hold (H).", "The aim of the hold is to sustain minimum mobility levels for an extended period of time, to reduce the effective reproduction number of the virus by starving it of transmission opportunities. The hold ends when mobility levels rise again and remain above the hold threshold, and this signals the beginning of the final rebound (R) phase. The rebound sometimes coincides with a coordinated easing of restrictions, but it usually precedes a formal lifting of restrictions as mobility levels often rise when citizens become restless and start to move about more. If countries need to implement a sequence of lockdowns over an extended period of time, then each will have its own drop, hold, and rebound phases, depending on the approach taken.", "Figure 1 shows the model for Germany with its drop, hold, and rebound phases indicated and colour-coded. The model\u2019s Rt values are also shown and colour-coded as red (Rt > 2), yellow (2 \u2265 Rt \u2264 1), blue (Rt < 1); these are rolling 7-day averages of the individual daily Rt estimates. The mobility and Rt graphs are plotted against an x-axis based on the number of days since the country confirmed its 100th case; this makes it easier to compare the start of lockdowns, relative to outbreak maturity, even when they begin at different times. The appendix at the end of this post includes the corresponding models for all 57 countries analysed (see Figures A1\u2013A3); all of the models use mobility and confirmed case data up until May 9th 2020.", "Using this model, we can identify several important mobility and Rt features for the purpose of comparing lockdowns. We divide our countries into two groups \u2014 (1) those that have entered their rebound phase (Rebounders) with rising mobility levels for more than 7 days, and (2) those that remain in their hold phase (Holders) \u2014 as shown in Table 1. On average, countries in their rebound phase started their lockdowns approximately 4 days before countries still in their hold phase \u2014 3.45 days before the 100th case vs. 0.33 days after their 100th case, respectively \u2014 but this difference is not statistically significant based on a one-sided t test (P = 0.095, t = \u22121.33).", "The duration (days), depth (average drop in mobility), and degree (duration \u00d7 depth) of the drop and hold phases for Rebounders is less than it is for Holders. For example, the degree of the drop is significantly lower for Rebounders than for Holders, based on a one-sided t test (P = 0.0033, t = \u22122.6337) and likewise for the degree of the hold (P = 0.000, t =\u22125.2888). In other words, countries that have been easing restrictions are associated with less severe lockdowns than counties still in their hold phase. However, despite their less severe holds Rebounders exit their hold phase with a similar Rt to the Rt that Holders current have: 1.04 vs. 1.09, respectively (see Table 1), a marginal difference which is not statistically significant based on a one-sided t test (P = 0.3134, t = \u22120.4897).", "What will happen to Rt after mobility levens rise and restrictions are eased for the Holders? Will transmission rates rebound, resulting in a second surge of infections, or can we expect Rt to remain below the critical threshold of 1, even as mobility levels increase? We can gain some insight into this by looking at what happened to the Rebounders when their mobility levels started to rise. Figure 3 shows the differences between the Rt estimates at the end of the hold and the current rebound phases for the 38 countries now in rebound; the countries are sorted in descending order of the number of days since their rebound phase began.", "The data shows that 87% of Rebounders have been able to continue to reduce Rt even as mobility levels have been rising. The mean Rt for Rebounders is currently 0.89, compared with 1.04 when they exited their hold phase (Table 1), a difference that is statistically significant based on a one-sided t test (P = 0.0047, t = \u22122.6678).", "If we distinguish between risky and cautious Rebounders, based on whether they exited their hold phase with Rt > 1 (risky) or Rt \u2264 1 (cautious), then we can observe that all 18 of the cautious Rebounders currently have Rt \u2264 1, in comparison to just 11 (55%) of the risky rebounders; currently the mean Rt for cautious Rebounders is 0.70 compared with 1.06 for risky Rebounders, a difference that is statistically significant based on a one-tailed t test (P = 0.00, t = 5.5733).", "These results bode well for countries as they plan and implement their lockdown exit strategies. So far, the data for 38 rebounding countries does not show a material increase in transmission rates (7-day averages) even as mobility levels have increased. Instead, the data suggests that by carefully exiting the hold phase, countries can continue to lower Rt even as mobility levels increase. And by avoiding the temptation to rebound before Rt \u2264 1, countries can significantly improve the likelihood that they will preserve their Rt \u2264 1 status while they rebound, at least for the period of time covered by the data.", "This does not mean that countries can be blaise about lower restrictions. The fact that most countries have managed to control Rt as they have rebounded is a testament to the careful manner in which restrictions have been eased and how the public have responded. It remains to be seen how long this can be sustained; at the time of writing, there have been some reports of rising transmission rates in Germany, for example, which could translate into an increase the 7-day Rt averages in due course.", "One useful perspective is that the restrictions imposed during lockdowns serve two important purposes. On the one hand they eliminate many of the usual opportunities for virus transmission. On the other hand, lockdowns also create the time and space, and the impetuous, for people to assimilate a new set of behaviours and norms (15) \u2014 better social distancing (8), improved hand-hygiene (16), the proper use of facemasks (17) etc. \u2014 which are compatible with the need to co-exist with the coronavirus in our communities (18, 19). Perhaps the very nature of the lockdown, and the desire it creates in us all to return to some degree of normalcy, is in itself an effective social treatment to protect us as restrictions are eased, at least for now. We must remember, however, that even though mobility levels are rising they still remain far below pre-lockdown levels, and it seems unlikely that this protection, such as it is, will remain indefinitely, especially if mobility levels continue to rise or if we become too complacent.", "The following figures (Figure A1-A3) provide all of the 56 lockdown models for the countries considered in this analysis. These countries were selected because they are included in Apple\u2019s mobility reports.", "Your home for data science.
