an understanding of shortcomings is purely dependent not on the faults or flaws with a specific piece of technology, but rather how said piece of technology can alter the world, whether it be for good or for evil.", "In 2015, a company called OpenAI was founded and unveiled to the public by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and others. The founders, as well as major companies such as Microsoft and InfoSys, pledged a total of $1 billion towards the creation of the \u201cnon-profit venture\u201d.", "Originally, OpenAI was established as a non-profit, partly due to concerns with how artificial intelligence had been developing over recent years at the time. OpenAI\u2019s reasoning for starting as a non-profit had little to do with the concerns, but rather the following according to an introductory blog post:", "\u201cAs a non-profit, our aim is to build value for everyone rather than shareholders. Researchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog posts, or code, and our patents (if any) will be shared with the world. We\u2019ll freely collaborate with others across many institutions and expect to work with companies to research and deploy new technologies.\u201d", "In 2017, Stephen Hawking described the advent of artificial intelligence as quite possibly the \u201cworst event in the history of our civilization\u201d, highlighting the lack of oversight on its development by society overall. Musk himself argued that the growth of AI is humanity\u2019s \u201cbiggest existential threat\u201d when he spoke at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) back in 2014.", "Years later, in 2018, OpenAI unveiled the first paper dealing with generative pre-training, the beginning of what would eventually be known as GPT.", "The paper, written by Alec Radford and three other OpenAI colleagues, came to the conclusion that a generative model of language can actually acquire \u201csignificant world knowledge\u201d and the \u201cability to process long-range dependencies\u201d. From there, the model would also be able to solve tasks \u201csuch as question answering, semantic similarity assessment, entailment determination, and text classification\u201d.", "The research paper about GPT-2 was released in February 2019, but its fully functioning release was withheld for reasons surrounding potential utilization for abusive measures, specifically in regards to the construction and development of fake news, a theme that will be expanded upon below.", "The way the Transformer language model functions is through the active human-initiated input of at least a few words up to a page, and then the model proceeds with automatically predicting and generating what the next few artificially generated lines should be.", "The Guardian conducted an experiment of sorts that featured the beginning of George Orwell\u2019s novel, 1984. The line is as follows:", "\u201cIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen\u201d", "GPT-2 managed to use this line and this line only to produce the following generated piece of text, eerily following the \u201cvaguely futuristic tone and the novelistic style\u201d as per The Guardian and its article:", "\u201cI was in my car on my way to a new job in Seattle. I put the gas in, put the key in, and then I let it run. I just imagined what the day would be like. A hundred years from now. In 2045, I was a teacher in some school in a poor part of rural China. I started with Chinese history and history of science.\u201d", "Of course, the model does not repeat itself if the exact same text were to be inputted for a second, third, or fourth time. Interestingly enough, the text is notably different from other AI generative models, particularly in the area of comprehension.", "Dario Amodei, the current Vice President of Research at OpenAI, stated that the models used \u201cwere 12 times bigger, and the dataset was 15 times bigger and much broader\u201d than before. In essence, the multitude of data that was made available to GPT-2 is the primary reason behind its exceptional level of quality and comprehensibility.", "If interested in trying out GPT-2 for yourself, Adam King created a website that utilized the full, complete model of GPT-2 and called it Talk to Transformer.", "In May 2020, GPT-3 was released on GitHub and featured a growth in size that was astronomical in comparison to the development of GPT-2. The predecessor model was built with the utilization of 1.5 billion parameters in the full version. GPT-3, by comparison, was built with 175 billion parameters, an increase of over 115 times.", "While the model does perform at an even better level (pertaining natural language processing) than that of GPT-2 due to the increase in magnitude regarding GPT-3\u2019s dataset and model size, OpenAI has also openly stated that the model might be nearing its absolute limit.", "The paper detailing GPT-3\u2019s successes, limitations, broader impacts, and more dealt with, effectively, the confirmation that simply throwing more data at a model will not inherently yield better results on an infinite trajectory.", "It also centred around the potentiality for misuse, especially in regards to larger models being created:", "\u201cAny socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples include misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufficiently high quality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out these activities and increase their efficacy.\u201d", "The more a language-generating model has to grow from, specifically relevant to the amount of data and information it has at its disposal, the more applicable it may be to general-use applications, including but not limited to its usage for malicious actions.", "While OpenAI started off as a non-profit venture, the company shifted towards the for-profit model, or in their words, a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d model which would allow them to \u201ccuts returns from investments past a certain point\u201d according to their blog and TechCrunch, respectively.", "The rationale surrounding this move beyond just the acquisition of more investment capital was rooted in an understanding that amassing more computational power than they already have, \u201cbuilding AI supercomputers\u201d, and more, would require the investment of \u201cbillions of dollars in upcoming years\u201d.", "The move to a for-profit model is of course concerning with regards to the maintaining of transparency and accountability, but there are other issues as well with regards to OpenAI\u2019s production and development of models such as GPT.", "As mentioned earlier, in February 2019, OpenAI refused to release GPT-2, purely due to the possibility of its usage for malicious purposes. The advent of models like GPT-2 resulted in academics and journalists calling the generated text \u201cdeepfakes for text\u201d and the company took time to \u201cdiscuss the ramifications of the technological breakthrough\u201d.", "Examples of abuse include the aforementioned themes:", "\u201cmisinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting\u201d", "The company acknowledged that these fields require the ability to produce \u201chigh-quality text\u201d, but this is exactly why the development of so-called \u2018deepfakes for text\u2019 is worrisome, especially for fields such as journalism, academic research, and novelists.", "The current state of the technology, at least with regards to OpenAI\u2019s developments, is nowhere near the absolute removal and elimination of human-based input. This fact, coupled with the likely possibility that the development of a neural network dealing with predetermining language and text most definitely has it limitations, issues little cause for alarm.", "Despite this, concern should not be understated with regards to its growth, especially as technological developments proceed forward as time progresses.", "In addition to these improvements, OpenAI has also shifted from the mentality of the technology being \u2018too dangerous for active use\u2019 to the release of \u201cits first commercial product\u201d according to The Verge.", "The company eventually came to the conclusion that the concerns regarding GPT-2\u2019s malicious use were not warranted given the present state of the technology, but newer developments are much larger, even more accurate, and \u201cnow yours for a price\u201d.", "Examples of fields actively being impacted by the progression of artificially created text includes \u201cMicrosoft News and MSN organizations\u201d, in which \u201cdozens of journalists and editorial workers\u201d have been laid off as of May 2020. This is due to a \u201cbigger push by Microsoft to rely on artificial intelligence to pick news and content\u2026on MSN.com, inside Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser, and in the company\u2019s various Microsoft News apps\u201d as per an article by The Verge.", "The real-world ramifications are most definitely present and will only continue to grow as technology develops. Without any sort of oversight related to the increased production of such generative text models, entire fields of work are at risk of being shut down in the future.", "While a specific date can, of course, not be articulated, the move by Microsoft is part of the start towards the possible unfortunate future of journalism and content creation of all types."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
