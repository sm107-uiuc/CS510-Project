Check out my bracket for the 2021 season here and follow me and subscribe to get my bracket delivered directly to your inbox each year once ready.", "With the coronavirus causing the unprecedented cancellation of the 2020 NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament (not to mention all NCAA activities), its players and fans are left wondering what could have been of such a beloved annual ritual.", "On Thursday\u2019s CBS Sports\u2019 Eye on College Basketball podcast (starting at 1:06:30), hosts Matt Norlander and Gary Parrish paid tribute to the season with a hypothetical run-through of the tournament based on Jerry Palm\u2019s March 12th projected bracket. This got me thinking: could I actually simulate the tournament and identify the story lines of an alternate reality of March Madness 2020?", "There have already been some who have simulated the tournament (affectionately dubbed \u201cSimulation Sunday\u201d), but I wanted to run the simulation myself (and be able to run it multiple times) to get a sense of what the major story lines could have been. As a huge fan of March Madness myself (I\u2019ve extensively documented the model I\u2019ve used to pick the winner the last two years), I find myself at a bit of time on my hands and an itch to make something out of a lost year.", "So, using CBS Sports\u2019 Jerry Palm\u2019s March 12th projected bracket, I built a spreadsheet that allows you to simulate the entire tournament, using real probabilities reflecting each team\u2019s KenPom ranking:", "To try it out yourself, make a copy of this Google Sheet (Google account required) and simply check the \u201cSimulate Tournament\u201d checkbox on the \u201cBracket\u201d tab as shown above. The bracket will be filled out and a champion will be crowned. Scroll around the full bracket to see how the madness played out, or simply read the dynamically-generated top story lines for each simulation. Uncheck and re-check the checkbox to run the simulation again.", "Note: each simulation is generated using a unique set of random numbers and once erased cannot be re-created. Seems appropriate for a March Madness that didn\u2019t happen anyways! If there\u2019s a particular version of history you like, be sure to make a copy and avoid running the simulation again in the original copy.", "To simulate the tournament, I first started with CBS Sports\u2019 Jerry Palm\u2019s March 12th projected bracket to identify the positioning of the field of 68, including the First Four games.", "I then imported each team\u2019s KenPom rankings. From here, I calculated each game\u2019s win probability using this methodology, deriving a projected point spread and average game score, adjusted for the tempo of both teams.", "Note: I made a minor adjustment to the probabilities for 1-seed vs. 16-seed games after seeing that the probabilities derived from KenPom were generally quite bullish on the 16 seed relative to historical expected win probabilities generated by FiveThirtyEight. I revert any team with a 90% probability of winning based on KenPom evenly toward 100%, leading most 1-seeded teams to have a mid-90% win probability instead of low-90% win probability.", "To build the simulation spreadsheet, I used the RANDBETWEEN function to dynamically generate a random number between 1 and 9,999. This would determine who won the game at hand.", "For example, my model indicates that #1 Baylor would be projected to win its First Round matchup against #16 Boston University at a rate of 96.58% implied probability. Therefore, if the random number between 1 and 9,999 generated by the RANDBETWEEN function is 9,658 or less (matching the 96.58% implied win probability), I give the win to Baylor. If the random number is higher than that, I give the win to Boston University. This ensures that the likelihood of winning in the simulation matches the win probability implied by a team\u2019s KenPom ranking.", "From there, I take the implied spread and point total and adjust it to creatively show a hypothetical game score. Using the example above, Baylor would be a 16.4-point favorite over Boston University. If the random number generated is 4,829 (half of Baylor\u2019s 9,658 winning scenarios mentioned above), I calculate a game result of a ~16.4-point win for Baylor. However, the closer the random number comes to Boston University\u2019s winning magic number of 9,659 or above, the lower Baylor\u2019s margin of victory. Likewise, the closer the random number is to 1, the higher Baylor\u2019s margin of victory, up to a maximum of two times the spread.", "Each game of the tournament is then given a random number and the winner of each game, as determined by the probability-weighted result, proceeds to the next round, until only one champion remains.", "Note: This type of simulation is fairly simple and not as complex as what you might find elsewhere because it does not adjust team strength following a win, nor does it adjust based on the strength (or weakness) of a win in terms of point spread relative to expected. The team\u2019s KenPom scores are held static throughout the tournament.", "On the Bracket sheet, the simulation can be turned on and off using the \u201cSimulate Tournament\u201d checkbox, which then visualizes the results in bracket form, with seed-based upsets denoted in red:", "I also dynamically generate key story lines from the simulated tournament:", "Generally, I think the simulation does a pretty good job at realistically simulating the tournament. Most of the time the selected champion is believable, with an appropriate frequency of surprise winners to put the \u201cmadness\u201d in March Madness.", "Here\u2019s a full breakdown of likelihood of each team making it to a certain round after running and recording 500 simulations:", "Note: any team that does not have a 100% chance of making the First Round means they had to play in the First Four round to get to the First Round of 64.", "I was very surprised to see #1-overall Kansas with such a strong probability of winning the championship at 23%; it speaks to their strength and perhaps easier-than-expected path to the championship.", "Perhaps because they would run into such a strong Kansas team, #4 Kentucky fared poorly, reaching the Sweet 16 only 38% of the time.", "On any given simulation, there generally seems to be an appropriate number of upsets, although do this enough and you\u2019ll see your fair share of 16-seed upsets over 1 seeds, which goes to show how much more frequent these upsets should be than they actually are. A few years ago, when UMBC beat Virginia to become the first 16-seeded team to beat a 1 seed, FiveThirtyEight wrote that it had been quite unlikely that a 16 seed hadn\u2019t won earlier.", "A possible improvement would be to adjust the team\u2019s strength after each winning game, according to the margin of victory relative to expectations. I wonder if it would affect things all that much though\u2026the simulations I\u2019ve generated all seem reasonably calibrated, albeit that\u2019s just my untrained eye.", "That\u2019s it! To all the players (especially seniors) and fans who didn\u2019t get a chance experience this year\u2019s tournament, I hope this tool helps you dream about the tournament that could have been.", "If you liked this post, you may also like my other posts about sports and data \u2014 give me a follow to be notified when I post more:", "Your home for data science.
