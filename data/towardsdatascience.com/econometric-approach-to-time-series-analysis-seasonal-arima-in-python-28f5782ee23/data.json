An econometric approach will be followed to model the statistical properties of the data. The business objective here is forecasting. We attempted to explain various concepts involved in time series modelling, such as time series components, serial correlation, model fitting, metrics, etc. We will use SARIMAX model provided by statsmodels library to model both, seasonality and trend in the data. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) is capable of modelling seasonality and trend together, unlike ARIMA which can only model trend.", "Time series data is a sequence of data points measured over time intervals. In other words, data is a function of time f(t) = y.Data points can be measured hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and also with smaller or larger time scales such as seconds or decades.", "The data we are using in this article is a monthly home sales index for 20 major US cities between the years 2000 and 2019. (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SPCS20RPSNSA). You can freely download many different economic time series data representing the US economy from this source. You may see 2 different versions of the same data, seasonally-adjusted and non-seasonally-adjusted. The version used at this post is not seasonally adjusted as we want to model the seasonality as well as trend. You may ask why people want to use seasonally adjusted data in the industry. Well, sometimes businesses may want to know the true effect of economic events on a particular data, which may overlap with a season. In that case, seasonality may hide or underestimate/overestimate the effect of an economic event. For instance: Heating oil producers may want to study the impact of the declining petrol prices on heating oil prices. However, heating oil prices are increasing in winter, despite the fact that heating oil is a petrol substance. The decrease in petrol prices should be reflected in the decrease in heating oil prices. However, in winter there is a big demand for heating, which causes a slight increase in prices. By removing the seasonal effect from the time series data, you may see that heating oil price actually follows a decreasing trend. The slight increase in the price was the seasonal effect. In Section 3, we will talk about seasonal decomposition in more detail.", "If we look at the time series plot of the data we can observe an increasing trend in 2000\u20132006, a decreasing trend in home sales starting from 2007 till 2012 due to big financial crisis and increasing trend again till 2018. We can also observe seasonality in the data as usually the housing market is not active at the beginning of a year and sales usually go high in mid-year and again sales getting lower by the end of the year. Seems like warmer seasons, especially summer is the good season for the American housing market.", "Time series data Y is composed of a combination of Trend, Cycles, Seasonality and Residuals. Obviously, you may come across with time series where it doesn\u2019t have a Trend, Cycles or Seasonality. So, it is your task to identify the components of time series data. Definition of the terms are given below:", "Trend \u2014 long-term upward or downward movement. Cycle \u2014 periodic variation due to economic movements. It is different from seasonal variation. The cycle is the variation of autoregressive component of time series data. Cycles occur within longer time intervals such as every 6\u201310 years, whereas seasonal variation occurs in shorter time intervals. Seasonality \u2014 variation in data caused by seasonal effects. Ice cream sales are high in summer, heating oil sales are high in winter but low in summer.Residuals \u2014 a component that is left after other components have been calculated and removed from time series data. It is randomly, identiclly and independently distributed (i.i.d). Residuals, R~ N(0,1).", "Statsmodels library has a function called seasonal_decompose, which decomposes time series Y into Trend, Seasonality and Residuals. Although, it is a naive decomposition algorithm, in practice it is very intuitive and works well for time series data where T, S and R are obvious. Before explaining the below graphs I would like to talk about the interaction among these components. Time series data Y can take either an additive or a multiplicative form. In additive form, time series Y is formed by the sum of time series components, namely, T, S, C, R: Y = T + C + S + R", "In multiplicative form time series Y is formed by the product of time series components:Y = T * C * S * R", "So, is home sales index is multiplicative or additive? If you carefully look at the time series plot of Housing index you may notice that the seasonal variation (seasonality) gets smaller when the trend decreases (years 2008\u20132013) and gets bigger when the trend increases (years 2014\u20132019). This happens in multiplicative time series, where small value for trend T results in small S because we multiply S by T. You don\u2019t experience this phenomenon in additive time series.", "We decompose time series data into Trend, Seasonal component and Residuals using seasonal_decompose(original_data, \u2018multiplicative\u2019) function from statsmodels. Don\u2019t be surprised if the function returns all 3 components even though you assume that they do not exist for a particular time series data. In reality, these components are generated by a simple algorithm, that\u2019s why the decomposition function cannot say a component doesn\u2019t exist, despite the calculated value is not significant. So, you will see these three components for any time series data. You have to know how to read the results and decide which model (ARIMA or SARIMA) to fit the data.", "We will try to decompose the data into components ourselves to better understand their derivation and usage. The trend can be calculated taking moving average with window size= 12. The below plot is very similar to the Trend generated by stats model library.", "Remember the multiplicative model, Y = T *C* S* R ? Dividing Y by T may give you Y/T=C*S*R and we assume that Residuals are too small for this data as the time series plot looks smooth. We have a very small data, thus we cannot detect an economic cycle. We get a seasonal component when we divide time series by trend, S=Y/T.", "Graph of seasonality is a little bit harder to understand, however, the explanation given here is sufficient. y=1.2(red marker) means there were 20% more sales in July-2000. In other words, June has a seasonal effect of +20% or 1.2 *T. On the other hand, y=0.8(green marker) in Feb-2003 shows a 20% decrease in sales. So, for some time series data not at this particular case, you may see the seasonal effect is very small i.e y=0.0001. It shows a very small seasonal effect, which shouldn\u2019t even be considered significant.", "Residuals can be computed as R = Y/(S*T)", "There are some other ways to detect seasonality. In the below graph, monthly home sales for each year is plotted and as you can see every year follows pretty much the same pattern with a slight difference. House sales are high in summer, lower in winter months.", "When we have trend and/or seasonality in a time series data we call it non-staionary.", "Stationarity means the statistical properties of data, such as mean, variance and standard deviation remain constant over time.", "Why do we want the statistical properties to remain the same over time? Well, because we make statistical assumptions (a good example could be OLS assumptions) about the sample data in due course of model building and the model will only be capable of performing under those assumptions. When the statistical properties of the data changes, the model is no longer capable of representing the true nature of the data.", "That\u2019s why our forecasting/prediction results will no longer be valid. Changing mean/variance will require us to fit another model and this model may be valid for a short period of time and we have to abandon it again and fit a new model. See, how inefficient and unreliable this process looks like. We have to make time series data stationary before fitting a model. We can make time series stationary by transforming the data. Usually, differencing is used to make the data stationary. We will talk about it in Section 6, below.", "So, how can we test whether a time series data is stationary or not? The first is just eyeballing the time series plot and identify trend or seasonality. If at least one of them exists, then the time series data is not stationary. Secondly, you may divide the data into 3 different sets and calculate mean and variance for each set and confirm whether mean and variance for each set is substantially different or not. The third option is to use one of the statistical tests provided in statsmodels library.", "Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is the most popular amongst others, where the null hypothesis, H_0 = data is not stationary. ADF test result provides test statistic and P value. P value >= 0.05 means the data is not stationary, otherwise, we reject the null hypothesis and say data is stationary.", "We assume you know what hypothesis testing is and what P value means. If you are not quite familiar with these terms, then look at the p-value and if it is smaller than 0.05 (p-value < 0.05) then data is stationary if p-value >= 0.05 data is not stationary. ADF test confirms that the original time series data is not stationary with p-value ~ 0.08", "We have to take a look at ACF and PACF plots, before model building as we will use these plots a lot from now on.", "Autocorrelation plot shows the correlation of time series data with its own lagged values. For example, autocorrelation at lag=1 shows the correlation between y_t and y_t-1. At lag=2, corr(y_t, y_t-2). At lag=12 corr(y_t, y_t-12). Every data point at time t having a high correlation with a data point at time t-12, t-24, etc denotes seasonality at this particular example.", "The below code snippet and scatter plots may help you to better understand the correlation between lagged values, namely, autocorrelation.", "Back to ACF plot, blue shaded area at the autocorrelation plot shows significance level. So, correlation coefficients within the shaded area show weak correlation at those lags and we don\u2019t consider them significant in the analysis.The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) gives the partial correlation of a stationary time series with its own lagged values.", "PACF removes the correlation contribution of other lags and gives the pure correlation between two lags without the effect of others.", "We use ACF and PACF to choose a correct order for AR(p) and MA(q) components/features of an ARIMA model. For AR order p, look at PACF plot and choose a lag value which has a significant correlation factor before correlations get insignificant. For MA order q look at ACF plot and do the same. Don\u2019t forget you should only get these values from the ACF and PACF plots of stationary time series, not the above plots. The ACF and PACF plot given above are the plots of original data, which is non-stationary.", "So, let\u2019s transform the data to make it stationary, so we can start the model building phase. We split the original data into training and test data. Training data will contain US home sales data from 2000 to 2018 and test data will contain data from 2018 to 2019. Don\u2019t forget, you cannot do random sampling like you are doing for cross-sectional data. We have to keep the temporal behaviour (dependence on time) of time series data.", "Home sales index data can be formulated as a multiplicative model where Y= T*S*R. I am ignoring Cycles, as it is not actually present in this data. (S)ARIMA models are linear models, like Linear Regression. We can not fit a linear model SARIMA to data generated by a process Y = T*S*R. We have to make Y linear before fitting a linear model. As you are aware of from math Log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b). We have to log-transform the data to make it linear. log(Y) = log(T) + log(S) + log(R). Log transformation makes data linear and smoother.", "Sometimes, log transformation on itself can make data stationary, but it is not the case here.", "Differencing is a basic operation or data transformation. It is the difference between y at time=t and y at time=t-x. diff_1 = y_t \u2014 y_t-1", "Differencing makes the data stationary as it removes time series components from the data and you are left with changes between time periods. Notice, first order differencing took away only Trend, not Seasonality. Data is still not stationary as it contains seasonal effects.", "We have to take 12th order difference to remove seasonality. You may ask how we decided to take 12th order difference not 6th or 8th or other order. Usually, monthly data has seasonality at lag=12, weekly data has at lag=4 and daily has at lag=30. Or you can derive it from the ACF plot. The12th, 24th, 36th lags are highly correlated for this particular data.", "Data is stationary now. If you look at the histogram at the below graph, it looks like Normal bell curve. Stationary data is randomly i.i.d distributed and the plot looks like white noise. White noise is just an example of stationary time series data.", "As transformed data is stationary now we can proceed to model fitting phase. We had a brief chat about SARIMA before. I want to elaborate on this particular model. SARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA is a special member of ARIMA family which can model seasonal component of time series data. Just to recap what ARIMA means:", "AR \u2014 Auto-Regressive model means time series data is regressed on its lagged values. Lagged values become independent variables, whereas time series itself becomes the dependent variable.", "The main task here is to choose how many time steps to be used as independent variables. Do not let the word time series or lagged values to confuse you, they are just independent variables. In linear Regression, you could look at the correlation between independent and dependent variables and choose highly correlated variables as your features. Here you should do the same. But, you don\u2019t have to calculate the correlation between lagged values and target variable, because you can use PACF to determine how many lags to use. PACF of stationary data has significant autocorrelation at lag=1 and the next autocorrelation at Lag=2 becomes insignificant. Ideally, AR order p should be 1. Since AR(p) and MA(q) terms interact, the initial p and q values observed from autocorrelation plots are no longer reliable and should be used as a starting point. We have to do parameter search on p to find the optimal value. An initial guess will help to define which values to use for a grid search. In this case, p = [0\u20132] would be sufficient.", "I \u2014 order of integration: Basically, how many times you have differenced the data. We had it once d=1. Do not forget to fit the model to not differenced data when you set parameter d=1, as the algorithm will differentiate it. If you fit model to stationary data, thenyou don't need differencing anymore. You can leave d=0. We need differencing just to make the data stationary.", "MA \u2014 Moving Average model: Time series y is regressed on residuals w.", "Look at ACF plot to determine MA order (q) of the ARIMA model. ACF suggests order q=1 for MA part of the ARIMA model. However, we should do a grid search to find an optimal model. I suggest looking at values q=[0\u20132]", "Seasonal model \u2014 Seasonal features have to be added to the model together with AR and MA and it has 4 parameters (P, D, Q, s). Think of P, D and Q parameters being similar to AR, I and MA parameters, but only for a seasonal component of the series.", "Choose P by looking at PACF and Q by looking at ACF. The number of seasonal differences has been taken is D. Frequency of seasonal effect is defined by s.", "P = 1 \u2014 because we have significant correlation at lag=12, however, they are not strong enough and we may not need to have an AR variable in the model. That\u2019s why we should grid search on P = [0\u20132]", "D=1 \u2014 we differenced for seasonality once", "Q=1 \u2014 as we have strong correlation at lag=12 according to ACF plot. Let\u2019s perform grid search on parameter Q=[0\u20132], too.", "s=12 \u2014 seasonality frequency, every 12 months", "best_sarima_model function below performs grid search on (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,s) parameters and finds the best model taking statistical metrics AIC, BIC, HQIC as evaluation criteria. Lower AIC, BIC, HQIC means better model. These metrics reward goodness-of-fit (log-likelihood) and penalises overfitting. In our case having many lagged features leads to overfitting. AIC, BIC and HQIC balance the tradeoff between likelihood and degrees of freedom. You can see this property in their formula. I will not get into the details of other metrics, but will give an example below for supporting my point of using AIC:", "-k is number of estimated parameters in the model, in other words, number of features (lag terms). -L is the maximum of the likelihood function.AIC = 2k \u2014 2ln(L)", "I have seen many examples in the industry, using only one of those metrics as a model selection criteria, but you may come across the cases where AIC of a model can be lower than another, while BIC is higher. That\u2019s why try to choose a model over the other if 2 of the 3 metrics are lower.", "Note, we are fitting a model to log-transformed data and because of that. we have set d=1 and D=1 parameters so that the model to do differencing itself. If you are fitting a model to stationary data instead, you have to set order of integration (d, D) to 0. We evaluated SARIMA models with the parameters we have identified above. The summary below shows the best model or in other words lowest AIC, BIC, HQIC. The best model suggests that we don\u2019t need to have AR features, but only MA and seasonal MA features.", "ARIMA or SARIMA models are estimated by using MLE and OLS assumptions are applicable to this family of models. I don't want to elaborate on these assumptions here. It is a topic of another article. However, we have to confirm that our model aligns with those assumptions. P values of coefficients are <= 0.05. Residuals are stationary and homoscedastic. There is no serial correlation among residuals.", "We will predict home sales from 2018\u201301\u201301 to 2019\u201301\u201301. I will use MAPE \u2014 mean absolute percentage error to evaluate the model performance. Best model we have got is SARIMA(order=(0,1,2),seasonal_order=(0,1,1,12). I prefer MAPE error metric in time series analysis as it is more intuitive. Sklearn doesn\u2019t provide MAPE metric, that\u2019s why we have to code it ourselves. Formula:", "When you use predict function, there are some nuances to be careful about its parameters:", "We make approx. 6% error in our prediction. It doesn\u2019t mean the model will underperform at 6% of the time. Rather it translates as the predicted value will be offset from the real value 6% on average.", "Plot the predicted values with original data and see the results. What can we infer from the below plot? Well, a lot! The model can successfully capture the seasonal effect, however, cannot do the same with the trend. Home sales go downward trend, however, the model cannot capture it well. It knows that sales go down but due to seasonal effect, however, there is a downward trend after 2018 which it struggles to predict. This is due to small training data we have got.", "If we had a larger data set, we could identify an economic cycle, and model it. Possibly, every 6\u20137 years of housing sales follow a reduction. Or if this downward trend continues in 2019 our 2020 prediction would definitely capture the trend.", "Another option to capture trend quicker is to add an AR term to the model. If we add 1 or 2 AR terms to the model it could react to the trend quicker and have less MAPE. The below plot displays MAPE for each model. Models performing better than the best model in terms of test MAPE are in green.", "We have added AR terms to the model and we have got improvement in test metrics.", "Test MAPE now is 5.67%, improved from 6.05%, which is the test MAPE of the optimal model.", "However, if you look at AIC, BIC and HQIC we get higher values, which means we traded off the model generality. We know that we have few data points roughly 300 and having 6 features in a linear model may lead to overfitting.
