Still, blame them we will, since many of these posers grift their way from company to company despite having little or no practical experience and even less of a theoretical foundation. In my experiences interviewing and collaborating with current and prospective data scientists, I\u2019ve found a handful of tells that separate the posers from the genuine articles. I don\u2019t mean to belittle self-taught and aspiring data scientists \u2014 in fact, I think this field is especially appropriate for passionate self-learners \u2014but I definitely mean to belittle the sort of person who takes a single online course and ever after styles themselves an expert, despite having no knowledge of (or interest in) the fundamental theory of the field. I\u2019ve compiled this list of tells so that, if you\u2019re a hiring manager and don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for in a data scientist, you can filter out the slag, and if you\u2019re an aspiring data scientist and any of these resonate with you, you can fix them before you turn into a poser yourself. Here are three broad domains of data science faux pas with specific examples that will land your resume in the bin.", "Data exploration is the first step in any machine learning project. If you don\u2019t take the time to familiarize yourself with your data and get well-acquainted with its features and quirks, you\u2019re going to waste a significant amount of time barking up the wrong decision tree before arriving at a usable product \u2014 if you even make it there.", "Exploratory data visualization is the best way to start any data-related project. If you\u2019re applying machine learning, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re working with a high volume of high-dimensional data; perusing a .csv in Excel or running a df.describe() is not a suitable alternative to proper data visualization. Francis Anscombe illustrated the importance of data visualization with his famous quartet:", "The datasets in each panel all have essentially identical summary statistics: the x and y means, x and y sample variances, correlation coefficients, R-squared values, and lines of best fit are all (nearly) identical. If you don\u2019t visualize your data and rely on summary stats, you might think these four datasets have the same distribution, when a cursory glance shows that this is obviously not the case.", "Data visualization allows you to identify trends, artifacts, outliers, and distributions in your data; if you skip this step, you might as well do the rest of the project blindfolded, too.", "Data is messy: values get entered wrong; conversions run awry; sensors go spastic. It\u2019s important that you resolve these issues before you waste months and months on a dead-end project, and it\u2019s mission critical that you resolve them before pushing your models to production. Remember: garbage in \u21d2 garbage out.", "There are lots of good ways to identify problems with your data and no good ways to identify them all. Data visualization is a good first step (have I mentioned this?), and although it can be a tedious and manual process it pays for itself many times over. Other methods include automatic outlier detection and conditional summary stats.", "For an example, consider this histogram of human heights:", "Training a model with this data would doubtless lead to poor results. But, by inspecting the data, we find that the 100 \u201coutliers\u201d in fact had their height entered in metres rather than centimetres. This can be correcting by multiplying these values by 100. Properly cleaning the data not only prevents the model from being trained on bad data, but, in this case, let us salvage 100 data points that might otherwise have been thrown out. If you don\u2019t clean your data properly, you\u2019re leaving money on the table at best and building a defective model at worst.", "One of the cool things about neural networks is that you can often throw all your raw data at it and it will learn some approximation of your target function. Sorry, typo, I meant one of the worst things. It\u2019s convenient, sure, but inefficient and brittle. Worst of all, it makes beginner data scientists reliant on deep learning when it\u2019s often the case that a more traditional machine learning approach would be appropriate, sending them on a slow descent to poserdom. There\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d way to do feature selection and engineering, but there are a few key outcomes to strive for:", "Most laypeople think that machine learning is all about black boxes that magically churn out results from raw data; please don\u2019t contribute to this misconception.", "Machine learning is a broad field with a rich history, and for much of that history it went by the name \u201cstatistical learning\u201d. With the advent of easy-to-use open source machine learning tools like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, combined with the deluge of data we now collect and a ubiquity of fast computers, it\u2019s never been easier to experiment with different ML model types. However, it\u2019s not a coincidence that removing the requirement that ML practitioners actually understand how different model types work has led to many ML practitioners not understanding how different model types work.", "The github repos of aspiring data scientists are littered with Kaggle projects and online course assignments-come-portfolios that look like this:", "This is an obvious giveaway that you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s a damned shame that so many online courses recommend this course of action. It\u2019s a waste of time and easily leads to inappropriate model types being selected because they happened to work well on the validation data (you remembered to hold out a validation set, right? Right?). The type of model used should be selected based on the underlying data and the needs of the application, and the data should be engineered to match the chosen model. Selecting a model type is an important part of the data science process, and direct comparison between a handful of appropriate models may be warranted, but blindly applying every tool you can in order to find the one with \u201cthe best number\u201d is a major red flag. In particular, this belies an underlying problem which is that\u2026", "Why might a KNN classifier not work so well if your inputs are \u201ccar age in years\u201d and \u201ckilometres traveled\u201d? What\u2019s the problem with applying linear regression to predict global population growth? Why isn\u2019t my random forest classifier working on my dataset with a 1000-category one-hot-encoded variable? If you can\u2019t answer those questions, that\u2019s okay! There are lots of great resources to learn how each of these techniques work; just be sure to read and understand them before you apply for a job in the field.", "The bigger problem here isn\u2019t that people don\u2019t know how different ML models work, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t care and aren\u2019t interested in the underlying math. If you like machine learning but don\u2019t like math, you don\u2019t really like machine learning; you have a crush on what you think it is. If you don\u2019t care to learn how models work or are fit to data, then you\u2019ll have no hope of troubleshooting them when they inevitably go awry. The problem is only exacerbated when\u2026", "All model types have their pros and cons. An important trade-off in machine learning is that between accuracy and interpretability. You can have a model that does a poor job of making predictions but is easy to understand and effectively explains the process, you can have a black box which is very accurate but whose inner workings are an enigma, or you can land somewhere in the middle.", "Which type of model you choose should be informed by which of these two traits is more important for your application. If the intent is to model the data and gain actionable insights, then an interpretable model, such as a decision tree or linear regression, is the obvious choice. If the application is production-level prediction such as image annotation, then interpretability takes a backseat to accuracy and a random forest or neural network is likely more appropriate.", "In my experience, data scientists who don\u2019t understand this trade-off and those who beeline for accuracy without even considering why interpretability matters are not the sort you want training models for you.", "Despite making up 50% of the words and 64% of the letters, the \u201cscience\u201d component of data science is often ignored. It\u2019s not uncommon for poser data scientists to blindly apply a single metric in a vacuum as their model evaluation. Unwitting stakeholders are easily wowed by bold claims like \u201c90% accuracy\u201d which are technically correct but wildly inappropriate for the task at hand.", "I have a test for pancreatic cancer which is over 99% accurate. Incredible, right? Well, it\u2019s true, and you can try it for yourself by clicking this link.", "If you saw a red circle with a line through it, you\u2019ve tested negative. If you saw a green check mark, you\u2019re lying. The point is, 99% of people don\u2019t have pancreatic cancer (more, actually, but let\u2019s just assume it\u2019s 99% for the sake of this example), so my silly little \u201ctest\u201d is accurate 99% of the time. Therefore, if accuracy is what we care about, any machine learning model used for diagnosing pancreatic cancer should perform at least as well as this uninformative, baseline model. If the hotshot you\u2019ve hired fresh out of college claims he\u2019s developed a tool with 95% accuracy, compare those results to a baseline model and make sure his model is performing better than chance.", "Continuing the diagnostic example above, it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re using the right metric. For cancer diagnosis, accuracy is actually a bad metric; it\u2019s often preferable to decrease your accuracy if it means an increase in sensitivity. What\u2019s the cost associated with a false positive? Patient stress, as well as wasted time and resources. What\u2019s the cost of a false negative? Death. An understanding of the real-world implications of your model and an appreciation of how those implications govern metric selection clearly delineate real data scientists from their script-kiddie lookalikes.", "This is a big one, and it\u2019s far too common. Properly testing a model is absolutely essential to the data science process. There are many ways this can go awry: not understanding the difference between validation and test data, performing data augmentation before splitting, not plugging data leaks, ignoring data splitting altogether\u2026 There\u2019s not much to say about this other than that if you don\u2019t know or care how to create a proper holdout set, all your work has been a waste of time.", "These are only a handful of tells that give up the game. With enough experience, they\u2019re easy to spot, but if you\u2019re just starting out in the field it can be hard to separate the Siraj Ravals of the world from the Andrew Ngs. Now, I don\u2019t mean to gatekeep the field to aspiring data scientists; if you feel attacked by any of the above examples, I\u2019m glad to hear it because it means you care about getting things right.
