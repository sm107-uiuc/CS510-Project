This long-horizon objective fuels people\u2019s passions by managing to always feel just barely out of reach, yet paradoxically ungraspable for deeply fundamental reasons. The possibility that someone may create a completely new form of sentience has led some to elevate the quest for AGI to a quasi-religious purpose \u2014 I was recently told un-ironically \u2018I am willing to give up my life to solve AGI.\u2019 It is fascinating to contrast such passionate fervor with the deep-seated fear of AGI which, if popular culture is an accurate reflection of the world\u2019s inner neuroses, the general public seems to share equally broadly.", "It may surprise some that I find myself relatively uninterested in partaking in this quest for AGI. To be clear, I can not \u2018not care\u2019 about AGI, in part because there appears to be a number of people who actually believe that bringing about the Terminator is my literal job description (spoiler: it is not). I do take very seriously the responsibility to make sure my work and actions, as someone working on AI and robotics, address the concerns that arise from that line of research, irrespective of the fear \u2014 or enthusiasm \u2014 they elicit in others.", "But the main reason that I have an ambivalent relationship with the quest for AGI is that I think we\u2019re on a trajectory to get to \u2018functional AGI\u2019 much sooner than we\u2019ll ever get to \u2018true AGI,\u2019 and that the former is likely to end up filling the ecological niche of the latter in the decades to come. Much like the invention of the airplane put a severe damper on the quest for building artificial bird wings, or that the quest for artificial legged locomotion was never humanity\u2019s most pressing concern given the existence of the wheel, today\u2019s Machine Learning progress is bringing about capabilities that may look, feel, and act like true AI for all intents and purposes, yet significantly diverge from the path to true AGI, while functionally filling its technological role.", "As an illustration, I have recently had conversations with \u2018AIs\u2019 that were more engaging, more elevated and more useful than I\u2019ve had with many human beings (not you, of course \u2026 you are much more interesting to talk to, pinky swear \u2026) Yet these neural networks (because that\u2019s all they are) are merely slightly complicated, but fixed mathematical functions y=f(x), with no state, no permanent memory and no adaptability. These AIs are frozen in time. They are input-output mappings, with no mechanism to evolve or form long-term beliefs. But they display many of the functional properties that would enable a system to sneak past a Turing Test: they act as if they understand cultural references, they make jokes, they can carry context through a conversation and make inferences about grounded facts. They are also extremely useful if your goal is to have automated interactive agents that help people accomplish tasks.", "The irony isn\u2019t lost on me that, if having an intelligent conversation is about to become a warning sign that you may be talking to a bot, we have a whole new set of issues to concern ourselves with.", "In short, the \u2018fake it till you make it\u2019 path to AGI is actually getting us much further than I ever thought, which makes me wonder if much of the value of AGI can be realized without any of the evolving, self-optimizing mechanics that underpin many of the fears behind AGI. To be clear, there is nothing fundamental preventing us from creating AIs that are stateful and interact with long-term memory, but it remains a little appreciated fact that, today, all the biggest feats that AI has managed required none of that machinery, and yet are pushing the boundaries of \u2018feeling\u2019 intelligent and generally useful all the same. Time will tell how far we will get with that paradigm, which has the benefit of being much simpler to reason about, train and deploy in a practical setting.", "Assume I am widely wrong: these \u2018fake\u2019 functional AIs fail to fill the ecological niche for intelligent agents, and strong AI is indeed at our doorstep. A major existential concern is the fear of unleashing non-human, exceedingly smart, very powerful entities upon the world. These could be agents with virtually unbounded lifespans, objectives that are not always aligned with ours, having the ability to marshal vast amounts of resources, and the power to compel humans into serving their purpose.", "Scary enough? If that\u2019s what truly defines an AGI, then these very entities already roam the Earth today: they\u2019re called corporations and governments. The fact that corporations and governments are made of people does not make them any less artificial, powerful, or any better aligned with human preferences. (For the record, this corporation-as-AGI analogy is not something I invented, though I haven\u2019t been able to track down where I encountered it first. Pointers welcomed.)", "Corporations and governments are constructs which have demonstrated over and over how their objectives can diverge widely from what any individual would reasonably desire: the dynamics of these systems are intrinsically nonhuman, and obey objectives such as profit maximization or social control which are often only tangentially related to the individual\u2019s benefit. They \u2018speak\u2019 with an approximation of the human language which is not exactly human speech: they use advertising, press releases or propaganda to talk to us. Talking back to them can be a strange experience, as anyone who\u2019s ever interacted with customer service or stood in line at the DMV can attest. Their processes are designed and evolved by people, yes, but so is AI.", "Corporations and governments are AGIs for all intents and purposes. They can be big and scary, and rule your day-to-day in a very direct manner. But we\u2019ve accepted that those are ok for humanity to coexist with, and in fact we\u2019ve developed a more-or-less symbiotic relationship with them. So why does it feel (to myself included) a lot scarier when a hypothetical AGI is made of silicon than one made of people and processes? Are there reasons to believe that, were strong AGI to become a reality, the evolution of its relationship to humanity would be at all significantly different from its relationship to corporate entities? Daniel Gilbert, in his book \u2018Stumbling on Happiness\u2019, argues (with data) that the best way to predict one\u2019s future is not to imagine oneself in that future, but to look around in the present at relevant proxies. I wonder if looking at the rise of the modern corporation during the industrial revolution is the better proxy to use than the common science fiction tropes and narratives when it comes to reasoning about the possible advent of strong AGI: it has not been a straightforward and painless development for the human condition by any stretch, but humanity adapted to it with new social constructs, new laws and new oversight mechanisms, which thus far have carried us through the disruption in an overall beneficial manner.", "In all fairness, I can indeed picture a few ways where the analogy may break down. First, the time scales involved, if such a breakthrough were to take place in the span of years, not decades. The dynamics of a disruption that happens within a generation look very different from transgenerational changes. Second, there is also a genuine risk with introducing any new participant into an existing ecosystem, whether biological, social or technological. Third, the one issue that the modern state and corporations have failed to address is how to incorporate the management of externalities (in particular Earth\u2019s resources and environment) into their \u2018intelligence.\u2019 One may rightfully argue that AGI\u2019s biggest externality \u2026 is us. A sobering thought, though if we don\u2019t solve that issue of managing externalities in our ecosystem today, we may never have a chance to actually face that issue.", "I personally find the questions around machine learning as a human augmentation tool much more engaging, actionable and compelling than the quest for a higher form of intelligence. In fact, my ultimate goal is less to chase AGI than to address the rise of its older idiot cousin: Artificial Special Idiocy (ASI), the accidental or intentional misuse of today\u2019s not-so-general AIs. The issues relating to the ersatz of AGI we have access to today and how those can have a material impact, positive or negative, on the world we live in are deep and fascinating.", "Because ASIs are specialized, they tend to have blind spots in their understanding of the world. Actually, their understanding of the world may be better described as a tiny island in the vast sea of their ignorance. You can\u2019t build a dog-vs-cat image recognition system by just showing it dog and cat pictures, otherwise it will reason about everything it sees in terms of dog-ness or cat-ness, and will not know what it doesn\u2019t know, namely that most things in the world aren\u2019t either. Yes, I know. Bayesians will tell you that you can using proper probabilistic inference. Try. When it doesn\u2019t work they\u2019ll probably tell you that you are using the wrong prior. Congratulations, you have won Bayesian bingo, and merely traded an intractable problem for another. If you\u2019ve been following the recent flurry of interest around energy-based models, you know that there may be changes afoot in that space, and eschewing probabilities might just be the ticket.", "I remember my days working on speech recognition, where by far the most important thing you could do to improve the accuracy of your speech-to-text model was to improve your modeling of everything that was not speech, from doors slamming to background music to babies crying, which encompasses a much larger auditory landscape than speech itself. Understanding what you don\u2019t know is one of the most interesting pursuits in AI today: we struggle with modeling \u2018known unknowns,\u2019 let alone \u2018unknown unknowns.\u2019 There is much fascinating work to do in that space \u2014 and yes, the answer may still be Bayesian, but then again, what isn\u2019t?", "Yet what\u2019s even more interesting to me is addressing the problem that\u2019s one step removed from ASIs: the very human problem of helping practitioners understand that there is a problem in the first place, and one that has established solutions and best practices. Whether it\u2019s about fairness, trust and explainability, testing and validation, there are many practical ways, once one has done away with our very human blind spots that may give rise to ASI, to deal with the issues.", "The world of AI and robotics that I work in today is absolutely ruthless to ASIs. Working with physical systems elevates the stakes: physical safety is always front and center in robotics, and introducing learning in its critical path means building safety from within. It also suggests new solutions to the problem, by helping to ground AI in the physical world and make it embodied as a participant in human society. Our ongoing collaboration with the Everyday Robot Project exemplifies many of these characteristics: robots in a human world need deep situational awareness, both in its physical and social interactions. The answer to brittle AI may very well be to confront it with the physical world in all its messy complexity.", "I am a Distinguished Scientist at Google, working on Machine Learning and Robotics."],
