This is the fifth part of the new Django series I have started writing on, which is Building a Job Search Portal with Django. I hope every one of you has already read the first four parts of the tutorial series.", "If you have not yet read the first four parts of this series, I would strongly recommend reading the first four parts first and then coming back to this one. Here I am linking the first four parts:-", "So, in this part of the series, we will be discussing the backend part of the Recruiters app, which consists of the forms, models, views and URLs of this section.", "In the recruiters part, we will mostly discuss all the things which are relevant to the recruiters and hiring companies which will consist of the job posting, getting candidates applying on job posts, selecting these candidates and also viewing the resumes of all the candidates on the database. It also shows the current status of the job post, like how many have applied and can see the applicants list and then select or reject them based on their profile and resume. Also, there is an intelligence search feature built-in which shows you the candidates who are the best fit for you based on your skills and job requirements to save time.", "So, let\u2019s understand how each segment works one by one:-", "So, we are starting with the models.py file. This file contains all the parameters every object will have in our Django app relevant to the recruiting side. This tells the database what features would be there in each model class relevant to recruiters.", "To learn more about models in Django and how they work, Django's official documentation is a great place.", "So, we have three classes in our models\u2019 file. We first define a CHOICES variable which consists of four choices which we would be using in the Job class.", "So, let\u2019s deal with all four classes one by one:-", "Now let\u2019s have a look at the source code of the models.py file:", "So, that wraps up the models part of the Recruiters App. These models will be used to store all data relevant to the recruiters.", "The forms part will consist of two forms which we will be using for the candidates part of the website \u2014 NewJobForm and JobUpdateForm. Let\u2019s go through them one by one:-", "These have the same parameters but are kept separate for some reasons, which we will see later on. Both of these have help texts to enable us to present more information on the form template page.", "Below is the source code for the forms.py file:-", "Now we will deal with the views.py file, which contains all the views related to the recruiters part of our app.", "It is the longest part of the backend section of the Recruiters app since many things are working in this part, and almost all the app's logic is being written here. So, we will try to break these into small parts, taking a single function at a time and discussing it.", "First, we must import various things, all of which have separate functions. We will discuss them when they are being used.", "This is a very simple function which has simple work \u2014 to serve the recruiters' details page.", "This function is used to add a new job post. It requires a user to be logged in to perform this function. It displays the NewJobForm and then parses details from the form and saves it into the database. It then redirects it to the job list page.", "This function is used to update an existing job post. It requires a user to be logged in to perform this function. It displays the NewJobForm with an instance with the already existing details and then parses details from the form and saves it into the database. It then redirects it to the job detail page.", "This function is used to display the details of a particular job post. It is used to display the full information of the job post.", "This function is used to get and display all the jobs posted by a recruiter. It also uses a paginator to restrict the job posts to 20 per page.", "This function lets a recruiter search for candidates based on location and the job type they are looking for. This is like access to the resume database, and the recruiter can scan through the resumes of all the candidates. Location and job type help us provide more relevant candidates for recruiters.", "This function is very similar to the intelligent search feature we had in the candidate's section of our App. Now, we have a similar function that does the opposite work.", "This function allows the recruiter to see candidates which are perfect matches for a particular job post. It works similarly and matches the skill set required for the job with the skill set of candidates. It also filters out candidates based on the job type.", "Then it displays a list of candidates who are perfect matches for the job post to the recruiter in order of most perfect being first up.", "This function displays the candidates who have applied for a particular job post. It first gets the applicants, and then it gets the profile of all the applicants by filtering based on the applicant\u2019s username.", "This function is similar to the Applicants list but contains the applicant\u2019s profile who have been selected from the applicant\u2019s list by the recruiter.", "This function is used to select an applicant from the Applicant\u2019s list. It creates an object for that candidate in the selected list. It then deletes the candidate from the Applicants list after adding it to the Selected list.", "This function is used to reject an applicant who has applied to a particular job post. It deletes the candidate from the Applicants list.", "So, that sums up the views.py file of the Recruiters App. Here\u2019s a look at the complete code:-", "This file stores all the URLs of the Recruiters App. This helps us to get URLs for all our view functions. It allows users to navigate our website through these URLs. We give each URL path a name to remember it and use it within templates for linking.", "This is the urls.py file we are talking about:-", "So, we have finished all the backend stuff related to the Recruiters App. In the next part, we will deal with all the templates part for the Recruiters App.", "Hopefully, you enjoyed this one! Also, here is the GitHub Repository for this project which you can star and fork if you like and test it out on your own.", "So, this is all for this article. Hopefully, you enjoyed reading this article. The next part of this tutorial series are:-", "If you want to learn about Django Rest Framework, there is a new and exciting series I am working on, which you can have a look on:", "Also, you can check out the five-part Social Media Website with Django series, which was quite well received. It is a different project based on Django, and you will surely love it.", "Here are some more good articles to read after this one:-", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Upcoming SDE @ Wells Fargo | Ex-SWE Intern @ ByteLearn | Student @ IIT BHU | Web Dev | DSA | https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham1710"],
