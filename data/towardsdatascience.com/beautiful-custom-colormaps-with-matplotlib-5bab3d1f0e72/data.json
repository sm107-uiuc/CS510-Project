I used to dread editing colormaps in Python. Every help thread I looked at showed a different approach, and none of them quite matched my situation. This was always disappointing because colormaps can vastly change the message you\u2019re sending with your data visualisation, and can even go so far as to make your chart un-useable.", "Don\u2019t believe me? Check this out.", "Each of these visualisations show identical data (estimated population of local government areas in Australia), but with different colormaps. The data is continuous and positive, which is shown by carefully examining the legend for each. However, the colormaps tell a different story, one that\u2019s a bit like the tale of Goldilocks:", "These are just a few examples of the colormaps you can use, for more details and options, check out this guide from Matplotlib.", "Designing and creating a colormap gets even harder if you are attempting to make it fit in with a theme. For example, a visualisation embedded within a dashboard or website with an existing color scheme. It\u2019s worth putting in the extra work for a thoroughly professional end product, and this guide will help you get there.", "Let\u2019s create a test image to work with, and turn off the axis ticks to make it look a bit nicer.", "Now let\u2019s edit the image, and test out 4 different inbuilt Matplotlib colormaps.", "If the Matplotlib default colormaps don\u2019t suit your need, you can always create your own. For this tutorial I\u2019m going to assume you have some colors you\u2019d like to use in a colormap. If not, scroll down to the bottom for some resources to help choose your colors.", "If you have a specific set of colors to use based on a brand or website theme, chances are they\u2019ll be in HEX format. So first up let\u2019s define some functions to convert HEX to RGB, and RGB to Decimal (value between 0 and 1 for each of RBG channels).", "My HEX colors are shown below, along with their RGB equivalents (the code I used to generate this image is here).", "Let\u2019s create a continuous colormap containing all of the colors above. We\u2019ll be using the matplotlib.colors function called LinearSegmentedColormap. This function accepts a dictionary with a red, green and blue entries. Each entry should be a list of x, y0, y1 tuples, forming rows in a table. So, if you want red to increase from 0 to 1 over the bottom half, green to do the same over the middle half, and blue over the top half. Then you would use:", "Confused? I was too. So I wrote some code (below) to wrap this function and make it more manageable. The code below can be used to map between an arbitrary number of hex colors in a list, it uses the functions we defined earlier to convert from hex to decimal.", "By providing a list of floats from 0 to 1 we can also map the colors to specific locations on the colorbar, in order to stretch the representations of certain parts of the map.", "We can also use this code to create a diverging colormap, which is useful if our data is to be displayed about some midpoint, like zero. If the data is not equally centred about the midpoint, for example if it ranges from -2 to 5, we need to shift the centre of the colormap to the midpoint of our data. The code below shows how to do this by using TwoSlopeNorm to create a norm, which is then used within imshow to scale the data to the [0, 1] range before mapping to colors.", "Keep in mind that, while I won\u2019t go in to detail in this post, your choice of colors goes beyond mere aesthetics, there is a whole field dedicated to to understanding the effect of different colors and combinations on human understanding. There is also the consideration of how your colormap would look to people with color blindness. You should consider both of these things when choosing your colors.", "If you\u2019re in need of some inspiration in choosing your colors, here are some sources I find helpful.", "Checkout my GitHub for the code for this tutorial.", "Your home for data science.
