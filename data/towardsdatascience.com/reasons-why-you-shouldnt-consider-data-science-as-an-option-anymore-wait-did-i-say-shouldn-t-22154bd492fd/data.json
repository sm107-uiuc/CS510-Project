Since the time we have entered the era of big data, data science has become one of the fastest-growing, multi-million dollar companies. Nowadays everything has been inundated with data. Data is present in every digital and electronic device. Be it a computer, mobile phone, laptop, camera or even watch for that matter.", "Companies are gathering data to analyze it and draw insights from it.", "When you shop from a mall or any store or you visit a restaurant, they give you a feedback form to fill. Or they ask for your feedback on the products and services provided by them.The feedback that you provide or the one which is collected by them is nothing but data.", "Hence, Data Science is the process of collection of data, analyzing it and making decisions with the help of it. It is an area of study which involves extracting meaningful insights from raw data with the help of scientific methods and algorithms and then effectively communicating those insights so that value is generated.", "Data is just like ice, just like three forms of Ice it has three states( A bad joke, but will help you to understand). :P", "Data can be Structured, Unstructured and Semi-structured :", "It is an organized data for the process of analysis. It is processed data. Example: Relational data.", "It has some organizational properties but doesn\u2019t fit into a database system. Example: XML/RDF data.", "It is the data that is not organized in any manner and is the most flexible form of data. Example: Word, PDF, Text.", "The image is so apt and self-explanatory I guess. Data science is a mix of computer science, maths and statistics. A strong foundation in mathematics, computer programming, and statistics is required in the skills of a person who is willing to pursue a career in Data Science. An excellent educational background, knowledge in various programming languages like R or Python and most importantly time and effort are required to become a data scientist.", "With the increasing demands of data insights, data science is necessary for each and every area. Here are some key components that are part of a data science role:", "1)Collect and query data: Data scientists collect, query and consume data during the analysis of the process. They focus on analysis, prediction, and visualization of data. A data scientist has to query the data, no matter how or where it is stored. Querying data includes writing commands to extract information from data storage systems. Most of the time, SQL ( Structured Query Language) is used to do this.", "2)Generating insights from mathematical models: The work of data scientist requires math skills because it is needed to understand the data. These are the skills used to carry out forecasting and decision making. Mathematical methods are also used to build models and generate approximations.", "3)Applying some skills and some statistical methods to data science tasks: Statistical skills and methods are useful and necessary to validate the hypothesis and predict forecasts of future events. Knowledge of a few basic statistical methods like linear regression, correlation, Bayes theorem and time series analysis is essential and helps to generate possible outcomes of data.", "4)Coding is part of the game: While using data science, coding is unavoidable. You need to be able to write code that you instruct and guide the computer how you want it to analyze and visualize your data. While SQL is necessary for querying the data, programming languages such as Python, R are useful for analysis and visualization of data.", "5)Applying data science to a subject area: Data scientists are required to have a subject matter expertise in the area in which they are working. They generate deep insights from the given data and then understand what those insights mean with respect to the area they are working in. Data science is being used by subject matter expertise to enhance their performance in their respective industries:", "a)IT industry- Engineers use machine learning in modern building design.", "b)Medical industry- Clinical data scientists work on treatment plans and also use healthcare information to predict future health problems of patients at-risk.", "c)E-commerce- Marketing data scientists use regression and correlation to predict changing consumer preferences or the loss of consumers from a product or service to that of competitors.", "6)Communicating data insights: As a data scientist, you must have strong oral and written communication skills and also be able to communicate them otherwise all the knowledge and insights drawn will prove no benefit for your organization. Data scientists need to be creative and practical in their means and methods of communication.", "1) It can never bore you \u2014 While learning data science, you are assigned a lot of tasks and keeps you engaged in your work and it will be difficult to get bored with all these projects.", "2) You have many career options to choose from \u2014 Data management is important in all organizations, at all levels. It\u2019s not just huge IT software companies that need data science but is also required in the banking and finance sector, retail industry, healthcare sector, etc. The various job titles can be an analytics engineer, analytics manager, big data engineer, business analyst, data architect, data analyst, data engineer, data scientists, data visualization specialist, a statistician.", "3)Helps improve communication \u2014 Learning data science is also learning how to communicate results and insights to 3rd parties. Communication is something that you need to work on and it is a great quality to have not just in the field of data science but also everywhere!", "4)A huge demand \u2014 Data science is a field that requires a lot of skills, so it is difficult to find people who possess all these skills. The data science professionals are valuable and so is their demand high.", "5)Great pay \u2014 With the increasing demand, this is a profession which is one of the highest-paid jobs in almost all countries. The salary range (US) for this career is between $65,000 to $150,000.", "Wait! Do you know the salary of a data scientist?", "All the companies have data, they just need to figure out how to use this data for their benefits. Those who utilize this data is growing because today everything revolves around customers and making content available to them is the most important thing.", "Data scientists use their skills in math, statistics, programming, and different subject areas to organize large data sets. They apply their knowledge and expertise to uncover solutions hidden in the data to take on business challenges and achieve goals.", "Your home for data science.
