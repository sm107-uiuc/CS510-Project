So let\u2019s talk about it.", "Suppose we have 1000 new customers as warm leads in our funnel. We know that some customers are more likely to stay with us than others. In other words, some customers fit our profile better or require less energy from us to close the deal. We want to identify who they are.", "And since this is a mutually exclusive event, the more likely that a customer will stay with us, the less likely a customer will leave us. So let\u2019s state our goal here: we want a model, such that if Customer A is likely to stay with us, it will tell us the probability for the event \u201cstay\u201d is very high or the probability of \u201cnot stay\u201d (1-stay) is low and vice versa. (Remember this, we will come back to this later!)", "We have three variables, they are the size of the contracts ($ value), the type of the customers (B2C vs. B2C), and the channels of how they got to know us. It is very intuitive for us to start thinking that we need to look at our previous customers and see what\u2019s the relationship between these three variables and the outcome. This is the right direction except we have a problem here.", "In the traditional linear equation which we learned back in middle school or high school, it doesn\u2019t represent probability; it gives us a definite answer. To show you what I mean, in Image 3 equation 1) we can use some previous data and have a function that calculates the percentage of \u201cstay\u201d for A, or B, or C \u2026 and we will need another function to calculate the percentage of \u201cnot stay\u201d for A, or B, or C. These two percentages will not necessarily add up to 1 because they do not represent probabilities.", "Therefore, some smart guys start thinking, what if, I upgrade the Y so that it directly produces an outcome that compares the probability of the event \u201cstay\u201d and the probability of the event \u201cnot stay\u201d, in other words, it tells me which event is likely to happen than the other (Image 4). And that\u2019s how we go from function 1) to function 2)! Function 2) directly gives us the ratio of the probability of \u201cstay\u201d and the probability of \u201cnot stay\u201d", "The reason is very simple. It is because when we are comparing how much time A is more than B, the number can range from 0 to infinity. Think about it, you are 100, 1000, 10000\u2026 times more awesome than the person you don\u2019t like. There is NO LIMIT to how big the \u201ctimes\u201d can be (of course!). On the other hand, if we want to express less likely, we don\u2019t have a way to do it because the minimum of the numerator of our equation 2), the probability of event A is 0. There is no negative probability.", "To solve this problem, we move from equation 2) to equation 3) by logging the Y. If you need some reminders on how a logarithm works, I attached an image of a logarithm scale based on 10 vs. a linear scale below. Simply put, it is just a different way to measure things, like feet to cm. Now we are ready to use our data and solve those coefficients!", "I believe not many people back in school liked the homework of solving those coefficients. So that\u2019s why we want to use an algorithm!! There is nothing fancy. In the context of logistic regression, after you input your data, your computer tells you the coefficients, rather than a magic answer.", "Our computer will get the best coefficients for us by trying a bunch of different lines! How do we define the best one? Remember what\u2019s our goal?", "we want a model, such that if Customer A is very likely to stay with us, it will tell us the probability for the event \u201cstay\u201d is very high or the probability of \u201cnot stay\u201d (1-stay) is low and vice versa.", "Thus, the definition of best coefficients is the ones that enable the most amount of cases to satisfy our defined goal.", "So now, the computer has given us the coefficients. We have solved the relationship between the three variables and the outcome! Now we want to get insights from our function. However, remember we changed our Y, so it is a bit tricky to interpret. Let\u2019s give make up some accurate numbers to walk through the process.", "The first coefficient means that 1 unit of increase in x1 (everything else doesn\u2019t change), will increase the ratio of probability x to probability (1-x) by 0.005 on a logarithm scale; on the other hand,1 unit of increase of x2, will decrease the ratio by 0.65 on a logarithm scale.", "Since in life, we use a linear scale instead of a logarithm scale, we can convert it back to a linear scale using e. In the example of x2, before, the likelihood of event \u201cstay\u201d will happen is 1.17 times more likely than the event \u201cnot stay\u201d. However, after 1 unit of change in x2, though \u201cstay\u201d is still more likely to occur, the ratio decreased to only 0.52 times more likely now.", "Not only that you know who is likely to stay and where you should put your energy, but among those who are likely to stay, you even know who\u2019s the most likely to stay! So now, you can rank your customers or have different expected timelines for different customers!!", "For example, for less-likely customers, reserve more time because it\u2019s gonna be a long battle, and don\u2019t feel bad about yourself if you didn\u2019t get it at the first attempt :) And for those who have are a lot more likely to be \u201cnot stay\u201d then stay, we don\u2019t even need to bother now!!", "There are many angles we can (and probably should) use to address this question, but I only want to give the most intuitive answer here.", "Imagine your roommate asks you to divide the pizza evenly into 2 and because you like pepperoni, you are thinking about how you can cut it so that you can maximize the pepperoni you get. In Logistic regression, you can only pick a line to cut, though you still have many options, whereas, in a decision tree, there\u2019s no such rule.", "The reason for this difference is that in a tree model, we use a set of logical statements (Yes or No questions) to draw our conclusions whereas, for logistical regression, we define a set of numeric relationships. When we are using a set of numbers to express a relationship, we have already pre-determined an equation, a pre-determined structure to express the relation. For example, we have equation 1), 2), and 3), and we only want to find the coefficients. When we are using a set of logical statements, we don\u2019t specify what kinds of structure the relationship will be like.", "Keep in mind that \u201cif a model is good?\u201d or \u201cwhich model should be used?\u201d can expand into a huge topic of model evaluation, something I plan to write a separate blog. It is crucial for everyone to understand how we should or can evaluate a model because many times, which model to use in production is not just decided by people with a solid tech background. For now, let\u2019s just discuss the basics.", "Continuing with the pizza analogy, the first method is to count which one gives us the most pepperonis. However, most of the times things are not so clear. If you look at the pizza carefully, by using the logistical regression divide, we can get 7\u20137.5 pepperonis, and the tree model gives us 8 pepperonis. There\u2019s not an obvious difference. Taking into account that the pepperonis\u2019 positions are slightly different for every pizza, a logistical regression might outperform the tree model sometimes. That\u2019s why you see a data scientist uses 2 or 3 models sometimes and see which one does the best job.", "Another approach to thinking about this, is to ask: other than the model accuracy, what kind of information will help you to address your business problem the most? Like I mentioned in my previous article, the best part of a tree model (including random forest) is that it tells you which logical statement matters the most. In our pizza example, if each rectangle is a logical statement, it would be the one on the most left because gives us three pepperonis. For a logistical regression, the best part is that it not only gives us pepperonis, but it also tells us which pepperoni is the biggest and ranks it for us.", "Therefore, in the context of business, if I am developing a product and want to improve features, tree model will help us to determine which feature is most important to improve because that feature will bring us most customers, but if I want to close as many contracts as possible by the end of the month, a logistical regression will tell us which customers to target first because they are most likely to stay with us to start with.", "Weekly update!! Last week, was not the most productive week.", "From Monday to Tuesday, after I posted my previous article on Monday night, I experienced almost a panic attack because I realized some mistakes that I made in the article (fixed already). Though I understand this is the process of learning and I know as a new writer, probably no one even read that article carefully, I still felt extremely embarrassed. So I spend those two days making sure I understand the model inside out.", "Wednesday and Thursday, I was preparing for two job applications and I had one first-round interview on Thursday. Unfortunately, my referral told me though the HR who interviewed gave me a pass, my potential boss failed me because I didn\u2019t have any relevant job experience before\u00a0\u2639", "After these emotional intense days, I started to feel slightly burnout and I felt like I didn\u2019t accomplish anything this week. I also started to question my ability to find a job in the data field (I have been looking at different job posts for a while). So I slowed down myself a bit, went out for a walk, did some baking, and spent some time reading a book called: Data Science for Business. Reading is one of my self-care activities. Also, it was an amazing book and I plan to share some insights after I am done reading it.", "Other than these, I did make some progress in these areas:", "That\u2019s all. I want to end this post with a cheerful quote to remind myself and everyone else who\u2019s feeling a little burnout.", "\u201cThe big things in life will only be possible if you take the time to do small acts of self-care. \u201d \u2014 Chanel Miller", "Your home for data science.
