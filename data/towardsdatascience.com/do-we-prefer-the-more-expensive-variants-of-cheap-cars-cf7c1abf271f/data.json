There were some new cars I\u2019m not going to buy anytime soon. Nevertheless, I went there with my dad.", "There were a lot of cars there, obviously. But I particularly focused on not-so-expensive cars, such as LCGCs (Low Cost Green Cars), small hatchbacks, medium sized MPVs (such as Toyota Avanza), and SUVs (the famed Wuling Almaz). They are cars that a regular salaryman have a decent chance of owning over the course of one lifetime.", "I just looked at whatever cars that were there. I noticed each car model often comes with many variants. For example, if I say I want a Daihatsu Ayla pictured below.", "Take a look at the price list from their website and you can see the variants they sell, offering different accessories features and\u2026an optional airbag (I haven\u2019t found any statute that says an airbag is mandatory in Indonesia). The variants with an \u201cAB\u201d in their name means that particular variant\u2019s got airbags, and the ones that don\u2019t\u2026\u2026 might don\u2019t, you gotta check the spec details.", "I frequently hear relatives saying that it\u2019d be better to buy the highest model of the car. Citing reasons that it\u2019s a big one-time purchase so might as well spend more (the same argument for lavish wedding ceremonies, but that is an entirely different discussion). So that would mean, when buying a Daihatsu Ayla, they\u2019ll prefer to buy the \u201c1.2 R AT DLX\u201d instead of the \u201c1.0 X AB AT\u201d costing about IDR 16 million less.", "However, I figure, people who buys cheap cars surely would have price as one of the most important factor when buying because they are budget conscious. When we are going to buy a cheap car, I reason that getting the cheapest one would be the best option.", "Is that really the case\u00a0with\u00a0everyone? The economics law of demand dictates that higher price will result in fewer demand for the good. Perhaps car buying is one instance where the law does not hold.", "I\u2019m going to see if the statement in italic above is true or not. I\u2019ll be:", "This time, I\u2019ll try to see if people really prefer to buy the most expensive variant of a Low Cost Green Car (LCGC).", "Or put another way: if the price point really affects buying decision of a Low Cost Green Car. So here is my hypothesis:", "h0: For LCGC, Price (P) do not affect Sales Quantity (Qs)", "h1: For LCGC, Price (P) affect Sales Quantity (Qs). This is what I\u2019m trying to prove here!", "For the uninitiated, LCGC is a class of relatively cheaper cars with small engine/displacement not more than 1,200 cc. One example is the Daihatsu Ayla I showed earlier.", "Why am I sticking to LCGC? I assumed that each type of car has a different target market, and hence would behave differently. For example, people who buy cheap cars (below IDR 200 million) might behave differently than those who buy expensive SUVs (above IDR 300 million, like a Mitsubishi Pajero Sport). My initial assumption is people who buy cheaper cars will be more cost conscious and hence would more likely to pick the cheaper variants. While people who buy more expensive vehicles will be wealthier and can afford the best variant. I\u2019ll do other segments later on.", "(if you are not into R or data related stuff, you can just skip to part 3. Analyzing the Data)", "Here, I have wholesales data from Gaikindo\u2019s website for the period of January to June 2019. Wholesales data refers to sales made by manufacturer to the dealers (not dealers to end customers), but this data is better than nothing.", "The data is in pdf format so I had it converted into an excel file a free tool on the internet, ilovepdf.com. There are a lot of free tools on the internet to do this if you just google it. You upload the pdf file you want to convert to the website, and it will convert it into an excel file for you. Please take care to not process any confidential data using free web tools.", "Even then the data is still very messy so I just cleaned it a bit using Microsoft Excel (I know, please don\u2019t judge). We need to clean the data so we can run a proper analysis of it.", "The data also didn\u2019t include the vehicle price so I manually scoured the web to put them there. I\u2019m doing this because I\u2019m trying to prove Price\u2019s effect on Sales Quantity, so it is obvious that I\u2019ll need the Price data (we already have the Sales Quantity in the original data). So the data would be something like this.", "You gotta zoom in, but if you just download the original file you can see that it\u2019s actually pretty nifty. It includes the vehicle model, the displacement (cc), fuel tank capacity, the gross vehicle weight, dimension, seats, doors, sales per month, and much more.", "The purpose of this test is to see whether the price point actually affects the sales quantity. So I stripped down the data into just the: 1) price point, and 2) total sales 2019 per June (I\u2019m not going to need the other columns for now).", "I got 57 rows, each representing a particular variant of each model. 6 of which do not have the price since\u2026I didn\u2019t find them. But that\u2019s okay.", "After the data is ready, it is time to actually do the regression. I\u2019m doing the regression using RStudio, with the help of the \u201cpsych\u201d (for statistics), \u201ctidyverse\u201d (for manipulating data and visualizing), and \u201cggthemes\u201d (for adding additional themes to visualization) package.", "It is very simple to do a regression using R (if you are not into R you can just skip to part 3):", "I\u2019m using the lm() function, with TOTAL (the Sales Quantity) as the dependent variable, and PRICE as the independent variable. You can read \u201cTOTAL ~ PRICE\u201d as \u201cTOTAL is affected by PRICE\u201d. I stored the result in a variable named \u201clin.regress\u201d so I can call it anytime.", "Next is to visualize the regression in a scatter plot plus a regression line. I\u2019m using a scatter plot because I\u2019m trying to compare Price against Sales Quantity here. Both are numerical (continuous) data. The \u201cregression line\u201d is just a line that can approximates all the available data point into a line, with the least amount of error that is possible.", "In a glance, we can see that at least in the cheap cars (LCGC) segment, the regression line shows that an increase in price would also increase the number of sales quantity. Albeit somewhat loosely. You can see that most data points are concentrated near the origin (zero) line and seemed to be pulled upwards by several data points with high sales and price.", "That was just the visual interpretation. To gain a better understanding, we need to see the regression table containing many useful information such as:", "In R, you just need to call the code below plus the variable where you stored the regression model, which I named \u201clin.regress\u201d earlier on.", "Look at the first column named \u201cestimate\u201d. The two values in here are the coefficients. If you still remember your algebra:", "You are trying to find the value of y given a certain value of x. It\u2019s kind of the same thing with regression! We are trying to find the Sales Quantity (Qs) given a certain Price point (P):", "The two values in the Estimate column are the coefficients, the a and b. The \u201cintercept\u201d is the value given the predictor (the Price) is 0. Which, according to the regression table, for a car at IDR 0 Price point, there will be\u2026. -9,514 sales. Which doesn\u2019t make sense at all. But we shall continue.", "The Estimate value in \u201cPrice\u201d shows the power of Price increase towards the Sales Quantity. Which, according to the regression table, for an increase in vehicle price of IDR 1, we\u2019ll see an increase of 0,0000882 sales. For a better perspective, multiply that by several. For an increase in price of IDR 10 million, we\u2019ll get additional 882 sales. Which I also think don\u2019t make sense, how come people?", "Anyways, now we have this formula:", "And now we get to the interesting part. Let\u2019s assume a significance level of 5%, a common standard. We are accepting 5% risk of rejecting h0 when it is true. In this context, we are accepting a 5% risk of believing that Price affects Sales Quantity when it doesn\u2019t really affect anything.", "Take a look at the right-most column for the \u201cPrice\u201d row. That is the P-Value.", "Simply put in this context, the P-Value answers the question, \u201cin a world where Price do not affect Sales Quantity, how odd would it be if I manage to predict Sales Quantity using the earlier regression?\u201d", "Well, in this case the answer is it would be 2,41% kind of odd.", "Combining a significance level of 5%, and a P-Value of 2,41%, we can safely reject the h0 or the null hypothesis at 5% significance level. Meaning we reject the hypothesis that the Price do not affect the Sales Quantity.", "The next step would be, to examine how good is the model actually is. At a glance, we know that it won\u2019t be that good. Take a look at the regression line.", "I may rephrase the question to \u201chow bad is my model?\u201d", "For this, we look at the \u201cadjusted R-Squared\u201d. This value shows how much of the variability of the Sales Quantity can be explained by Price.", "My model is bad, like 8.1% bad. Generally the accepted R-Squared for social studies is about 20%.", "There are lots of other factors explaining the rest of a whopping 91.9%.", "At least now we know that at 5% level of significance, for the Indonesian LCGC market, the Price point does have an effect on Sales Quantity. The relationship is positive (high Price lead to higher Sales Quantity), and that the model is\u2026.not so good at 8.1% Adjusted R-Squared.", "Meaning it is not wrong to say that we prefer the more expensive version of cheap cars\u2026 but it is not the single determinant.
