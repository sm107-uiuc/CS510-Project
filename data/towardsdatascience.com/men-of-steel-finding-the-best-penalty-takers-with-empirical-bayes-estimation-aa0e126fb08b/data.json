A penalty is supposed to be finished at the professional level: period. Anything else is a failure.", "Such a task should only be required of players made with the iciest of veins.", "There are great penalty-takers, those we can always count on to deliver the ball to the back of the net with a staggering metronomic efficiency. And there are those whose dismal effort, trademarked tip-toe run up or near-orbital strikes are only source for our deep regrets or relentless ridicule.", "You would think taking penalties is easy. Well, maybe spend 5 minutes on this video.", "You would imagine that this would be a simple secondary Math problems. We collect the records of all spot kicks, calculate the corresponding ratios of conversion for all these players, and TADA!", "But let us look at real examples and see how this simple logic falls through !!!", "On one hand, we have Cristiano Ronaldo, five Ballons d\u2019Or under his belt, whose nickname \u2018Penaldo\u2019 stands for his unwavering self-composure in front of the goal with an impressive records of 85 goals out of 98 penalty kicks (86.7%). On the other hand, we have a young talent, Nicolas Pepe at Arsenal, whose recent goal against Aston Villa made his tally totaling 10 successes out of 11 (90.9%). Is Pepe better/more reliable at penalties than Ronaldo?", "Of course, saying anything like that would be ridiculous !!!", "While the young player has slightly higher proportions of scoring, it\u2019s not a lot of evidence: a typical player would score almost 80% of the time, and Pepe\u2019s 90.9% success rate could be due to luck. Ronaldo, on the other hand, has a lot of evidence to show that he is above an average player.", "How do we systematically compare and make meaningful judgement about ratios like 85/98 vs 10/11?", "And it\u2019s not in just football that we find this dilemma. We are bound to get tripped up working with successes/totals ratios due to the uncertainty in low counts. The simple solution is to set some thresholds and filter out those players who do not meet the minimum requirement. But it is far from ideal: we are throwing away what could be useful information.", "Let me take a step back and re-frame the questions: we want to somewhat gauge the innate penalty-taking ability of a player. His historical record is a mere estimate of this ability. The task is to more accurately estimate his ability given his historical record.", "I hope you can see how this naturally leads us to a classic Bayesian setting: we can start off with some prior expectation of the player\u2019s ability, and by updating it with new evidence \u2014 that is, with his actual scoring record, we get arrive at a more practical estimation of his true ability.", "For a good review of the Bayesian framework, you can have a look at my other articles:", "I\u2019m stepping on a landmine right here. Although the Bayesian setting makes intuitive sense, it is almost impossible to get people agree on a reasonable prior to use for each setting.", "How might one go about specifying their prior belief? Especially if you don\u2019t have an informed guess? One way might be to assign a \u201cflat prior\u201d \u2014 a prior where you specify that every value of your parameter is equally likely. Another way is to use Empirical Bayes, where your data is used to estimate the prior. Here\u2019s the kicker: instead of having a fixed notion of the prior ahead of time, I will save myself from all the trouble by taking a look at the data after collection and estimate the prior distributions accordingly.", "There are advantages from this approach. It is simple, and it takes away (well, sort of) the subjectivity that can creeps in should I have to choose my own priors. Personally, I found that this approach helps me achieve a degree of stabilization of results. A flat prior or something out of line with the data could lead to strange results, e.g negative posterior probabilities. And believe me, this is not uncommon. I\u2019m more likely to get sane answers with empirical Bayes.", "Listen to what famous statistician Bradley Efron has to say about this method:", "Ever since my first exposure in the 1970\u2019s, via Robbins and Stein, empirical Bayes has been the most riveting topic for me. It still seems like magic sometimes. [1]", "David Robinson \u2014 chief Data Scientist at DataCamp, also offers some good insights here:", "It basically comes down to how many observations we have: if we have a lot, we can get a good estimate that doesn\u2019t depend much on any one individual. Empirical Bayes is an approximation to more exact Bayesian methods- and with the amount of data we have, it\u2019s a very good approximation.[2]", "I know, it feels like cheating, and rightly so. Using actual data to estimate the prior on top of subsequent use for the inference is criticized by many who consider the prior information exogenous to observations, as it can underestimate modeling errors. Any data is going to be complacent with a model which used the same data to specify some of its features.", "Let us take a look at the data.", "I have scraped 13 year-worth of penalty kicks data from 6 different leagues across Europe. This is how it looks:", "As explained earlier, to come up with a good approximation for the priors for the success ratio, we will take a look at its actual distributions.", "Here, our task is to find a distribution that characterizes our empirical penalties conversion rate: that is, (1) it takes in a domain from 0 to 1 (no negative probability), (2) it needs to be flexible, in the sense that it could represent what we see in our histogram, and (3) if it makes our Bayesian calculation easier when we combine with the likelihood from the binomial distribution \u2014 which describes the number of successes within n trials (i.e: number of goals out of many penalties kicks), all the better.", "Lo and behold, the Beta distribution.", "The Beta distribution takes on the domain [0,1], so we know it cannot do worse than the flat prior. It is highly flexible within the domain, being characterized by two positive shape parameters, denoted by \u03b1 and \u03b2 (see figure above).", "The best part about the Beta distribution is that it is a conjugate prior to the binomial distribution, and this works wonder to our calculation. We can start off with Beta distribution B(\u03b1 , \u03b2) as our prior, updates with information from the Binomial distribution with s successes (scores) and f failures (misses), and arrive at the posterior distribution which is also a Beta distribution of a precise form B(\u03b1 + s, \u03b2 + f). The mean of such distribution is (\u03b1 + s)/(\u03b1 + \u03b2 +s+ f)", "I include some math at the end of this post just in case you are not convinced !", "Now that we have a clear framework for our analysis, it\u2019s time to apply it to our real dataset.", "First, let\u2019s fit a Beta distribution to our conversion rate dataset. This could be done quite simply with R.", "Using this method, I get an estimation of \u03b1 = 9.29 and \u03b2 = 2.93. Let see how well this estimation fits our data.", "Obviously, it is not perfect, but something we can work with for now.", "We can now go on and find the posterior distributions for each player\u2019s conversion rate using the formula I mentioned. That is, a Beta distribution of the form B(\u03b1 + s, \u03b2 + f), where s and f are the numbers of successes and failures, respectively. The posterior mean will be (\u03b1 + s)/ (\u03b1 + \u03b2 +s+ f).", "For example, the posterior distribution mean for Ronaldo and Pepe\u2019s penalty conversion rate will be:", "We can plot their posteriors distributions (with some other players\u2019 ) as follows:", "We can see that Ronaldo\u2019s strong records results in very high posterior mean and a narrow credible interval, while Pepe\u2019s posterior mean conversion has a much larger credible intervals, as he has less data to stand for. Meanwhile, Griezmann and Sanchez are just not that good when it comes to penalty.", "After applying the empirical Bayes estimate and beta-binomial posterior calculation, let me introduce the top 10 penalty takers over the last 13 years.", "So it turns out that the best penalty takers, at least by this method, are Salihovic, and G.Rossi, followed very closely by Boudebouz, Mark Noble and Lewandowski. The famous penalty takers: Lampard, Gerrard, Harry Kane are not as good as they are claimed to be. Interestingly, we can see that for these players, their conversion rates shrink after we apply this procedure. We can plot the original and the adjusted ratios on a plot to assess the adjustment. This section is inspired by an amazing great article by David Robinson [2].", "The horizontal dashed line shows the mean of the prior distribution \u2014 what we should guess a player\u2019s success rate is if we don\u2019t have any information about the player. Then, we have the diagonal line y = x, showing the data points in which the actual goal scoring average equals the posterior adjustment.", "There are two interesting observations. First, we can see that the points above the prior mean tend to shrink down, while the points below get inflated up towards the mean. Second, the points that was least affected by the shrinkage are points associated with a lot of observations. And when you think about, it makes perfect sense: if we have a lot of evidence through observation, we can rely on the actual estimation; otherwise, there is a lot of value in believing that our data tends towards the population mean.", "So there you go, I have just introduced the concept of empirical Bayesian estimation: we can leverage the overall distribution of our data as a prior to arrive at a more realistic estimate of each average. Then, we use the powerful concept of conjugate priors to bypass the complications of calculating the posterior distributions in our procedure. The beta-binomial combination are so popular that you can apply it to a host of scenarios: basketball, A/B testing with clickthrough, school canteen rating, etc.", "For the purpose of this article, I have conveniently ignored many complications. For one, we can tell that a beta distribution for our prior is barely a great fit. In fact, we can fit a bimodal distribution with 2 Beta distributions, assigning every player in two different groups according to the likelihood that they belong to each distribution.", "You can checkout my code that address this issue.", "Another complication is that the penalty conversion rate changes over time and differ across different leagues. As far as we consider all these different factors, we take many steps away from our simple Beta-Binomial distribution and enter the realm of Bayesian hierarchical model. And that\u2019s where the fun begins !!!", "The code for this article and more can be found here.", "This is a short proof for the Beta-Binomial conjugate pairing.", "The setting is simple: we observe a number of success counts s that we believe follows a Binomial distribution with sample size n and success rate r. Our job is to find the posterior distribution of r given s.", "Time for us to call upon the famous Bayesian formula \u2014 only for continuous variable:", "The likelihood function p(s|r) and the prior p(r) follow well-defined Binomial and Beta distributions.", "Then, our job is just plugging in and finding the posterior distribution.", "The result is a Beta distribution of the form B(\u03b1 + s, \u03b2 + f)", "[1] Statistic View.
