Sometimes the number of features could extend to a few hundreds to even thousands leading us to lose track of features. In fact a lot of them could actually be highly correlated to each other, and hence could be done away with!", "Dimensionality reduction not only allows us to compress the data, but also helps to speed up the machine learning process. Converting a 3 dimensional globe to a 2 dimensional map is the easiest example of dimensionality reduction.", "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique and also an unsupervised learning algorithm, which means that it only takes the explanatory variables into consideration and not the target variable. It helps to visualise high dimensional data, reduces noise and helps other algorithms to work better.", "In the below diagram, we have two explanatory variables X1 and X2, plotted in X and Y axes respectively. The variance (V1 and V2) or spread of the data across both axes is significant. Hence we cannot drop either of the features.", "But if we still had to drop one of the features, we could transform the axes to P1 and P2 instead. Now the variance across P1 is much higher than variance across P2, hence we could now keep P1 and discard P2.", "In this process we could lose some percentage of the information or variance contributed by a particular variable. However the objective is to reach a trade off between processing cost and variance. P1 and P2 are the principal components and they are nothing but axis transformations of X1 and X2.", "We will check the effect of using PCA on an MNIST dataset of digits. The dataset contains pixel values of hand drawn digits, from 0 to 9. Each image is 28 pixels in height and width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. The pixel value is an integer from 0 to 255, inclusive.", "The training dataset contains 784 columns, denoting the 784 values of pixels. The \u201clabel\u201d column is our target column, with values from 0 to 9. The pixel values populated from pixel0 to pixel783 contain integer values from 0 to 255, inclusive.", "The values in the label column are almost evenly distributed:", "We will separate the data into training set and labels before proceeding with the rest of the processing.", "Next, the data is standardised using Standard Scalar", "We split the data into training and test set:", "Next we run Logistic Regression to classify the data and also calculate the time elapsed to fit the model to 784 columns:", "The Logistic Regression took about 455 seconds to fit the data and gave us an average accuracy of 92%.", "We will check if we can get better results with PCA. We will select 30% of the data for PCA, so that we don\u2019t spend a lot of time to fit PCA. Depending on our goals we will specify how much variance we want to explain through our model. Here we choose 0.98 to denote we would like a maximum of 98% variance to be explained.", "We will now draw an elbow plot to check the optimal number of features that can explain 98% of the variance in data", "The \u201celbow plot\u201d indicates the optimal number of principal components we need to achieve the intended percentage of explained variance. Beyond those components the increment in explained variance is negligible, hence those features can be dropped. This concept is explained in the below graph.", "406 principal components explain 98% of the variance in data. So roughly just about 50% of total features explain most of the variance in data.", "We will now run Logistic Regression again on the PCA reduced dataset.", "So Logistic Regression fit the reduced dataset in 242 seconds while keeping the average accuracy intact at 92%! Hence PCA helped Logistic Regression to achieve the same accuracy with almost half the computing time.", "This becomes more significant when we are dealing with even bigger datasets, where reducing computing time is a necessity that cannot be avoided.", "PCA is used widely for face and image recognition, because such data usually has a large number of features and dimensionality reduction can help in trimming down the number of features required to make a prediction.", "The entire code is available here.", "Your home for data science.
