Our eyes are naturally drawn to bright colors and movement. A good visualization captures the interest of the audience and makes an impression. Fortunately, making such displays has become quite simple with a few easy to use R packages. All of the visualization examples in this article can be forked from this Github repo. I do assume you have some familiarity with basic plotting.", "Before you start making your charts dance around, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a motion graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.", "When creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.", "The more subsets, the smoother your plot will be. This is an important consideration for your animation. If your data is too thin you will only have a few frames, which may not be compelling. In this case, you may be better off using a static panel plot instead of an animation. These can be created in ggplot, for example, using facets. Another option is to expand your dataset using interpolation and the tweener package.", "The great benefit of animation is that it allows for the expansion of the number of variables you can visualize. The motion of an animated plot is \u2018driven\u2019 by a variable in the data set. The plot above was built using a dataset with six variables. The animation manages to capture all six of them very well! Here is a sample of the data:", "We could have animated over any one of these six values. However, this is dangerous! Some variables lend themselves to better animations than others. For example, animating changes over time is a no-brainer; however, the same approach across categorical variables creates a confusing mess.", "Good Animation of GDP: Slow your roll China! \ud83d\ude2f", "Bad Animation of GDP: I have no idea what\u2019s going on\u2026\ud83d\ude44", "Here are a few times when animation creates valuable insights:", "The key point here is to highlight important changes in the data over the variable which is driving the animation. Enough said- let\u2019s build some animated visualizations! Again all the source code to create these visualizations can be found in the Github repo here.", "There are four package options I typically use for animating data in R:", "Generally speaking, the animate package provides the most control and is great for base plots but can be verbose. On the other hand, the gganimate package is limited to one plotting library but makes building motion into ggplot extremely easy (one or two extra lines of code in your plot). Similar to gganimate, plotly can only animate visualizations from its own library. Googlevis is the most limited only offering one type of motion plot which requires flash, something less and less common. For this reason, I will not do an example of this library, take a look here if you have flash installed.", "With the animate package, you have five options of exporting, assuming you have the proper dependencies installed (see documentation).", "This package is great, in part, because it has some amazing statistical graphics built in as examples. Here is one that animates gradient descent and creates an HTML page with controls:", "Sometimes you want your users to have control over the animation. With this example, the last frame is a 3D image of the surface which you might want to pause on. A live version of this animation, with such controls, is in the Github repo linked here.", "The most powerful thing about this package is that you can build your frames with any visualization tool. For example, the good and bad animations above where built using this library and ggplot (see the Github repo).", "With gganimate, the default export is a GIF (using gifski, you must have rust installed) but there are also other options depending on your specific requirements. The first animation example in this article is built using the gganimate package (indeed it is the only complete real data example in the package\u2019s README). Here is another example from the packages wiki (Author Tom Westlake) rendered as a video file. A fun take on Anscombe\u2019s Quartet, this animation is of a series of plots that all have the same summary statistics, and one of them is a dinosaur! All this with only a few lines of additional code to a basic ggplot.", "The last package covered here is plotly. There is something of a love/hate relationship with many visualization practitioners and this package. It allows for simple creation of beautiful interactive plots. However, with the ease comes some loss in flexibility and style. You also have to deal with the plotly logo on everything. However, I personally think the trade-off is usually worth it. Here is an example animation from the plotly docs (using the frame argument) of the same gapminder dataset we saw with the gganimate package:", "Once you have the plot you can push it to the plotly service for hosting. This will allow you to embed the plot with all its components, including a play button. This is actually one of the only ways to get interactive graphics on Medium! One drawback is that the plotly hosting service has a limit of 25 plots on the free tier.", "Now you have everything you need in order to build your own awesome animated visualizations in R. You can incorporate these products into your presentations, websites, and blogs. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Don\u2019t let me catch you animating over a categorical variable \ud83e\udd28.", "Your home for data science.
