Citizen Data Science, is an interesting (often controversial) aspect of Data Science (DS) that aims to automate the design of Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) models, making it more accessible to people without the specialized skills of a Data Scientist.", "In this article, we will try to understand AutoML, its promise, what is possible today?, where AutoML fails (today)?, is it meant only for Citizen Data Scientists, or does it hold some value for skilled Data Scientists as well?", "Let us start with a very high-level primer on Machine Learning (ML). Most of today\u2019s ML models are supervised and applied on a prediction/classification task. Given a dataset, the Data Scientist has to go through a laborious process called feature extraction and the model\u2019s accuracy depends entirely upon the Data Scientist\u2019s ability to pick the right feature set. For simplicity, each feature can be considered a column of a dataset provided as a CSV file.", "Even if the dataset has only one feature, the model selection process still plays a vital part as different algorithms need to be tried to find the best fit depending on the dataset distribution. For example, let us consider a dataset consisting of two columns: \u2018Salary\u2019 and \u2018Years of Experience\u2019. The goal is to predict the salary based on the experience level. Fig. 1 shows a Linear Regression illustration of the problem scenario.", "However, Linear Regression is often inefficient and other regression techniques, e.g. Polynomial, Support Vector, Regression Trees, etc. need to be tried to find the best fit. The best fit in this case corresponds to a minimal prediction error (model accuracy) measured in terms of different metrics, e.g. Mean-Squared-Error (MSE); an example of which would be the mean of squares of the lengths of lines connecting the data points to the (regression) line in Fig. 1.", "Given this dataset and knowledge, a Data Scientist would proceed by writing programs to apply the different regression models on the dataset. Using a ML framework, e.g. scikit-learn, this translates to writing/modifying a few lines of code to implement the models and then analyzing the model accuracy in terms of different error metrics.", "I guess by now you get the picture that the process so far in terms of feature extraction and model selection can be automated. And, this is precisely what an AutoML tool does.", "Given a dataset, an AutoML tool would apply known ML algorithms using different feature sets and data distributions \u2014 displaying the results on a leaderboard sorted by different error metrics (prediction/classification accuracy).", "Let us now consider AutoML in a Deep Learning (DL) context. The advantage of DL is that the program selects the feature set by itself without supervision, i.e. feature extraction is automated. This is achieved by training large-scale neural networks, referred to as Deep Neural Nets (DNNs) over large labeled datasets.", "Training a DNN occurs over multiple iterations (epochs). Each forward run is coupled with a feedback loop, where the classification errors identified at the end of a run with respect to the ground truth (training dataset) is fed back to the previous (hidden) layers to adapt their parameter weights \u2014 \u2018backpropagation\u2019. A sample DNN architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2.", "From an implementation perspective, if we want to write a Neural Network (NN) to solve the previous \u2018Employee Salary\u2019 prediction problem; a Data Scientist would write something like the below code using a DL framework, e.g. TensorFlow.", "DNNs are, however, very tricky to develop and train. Typically, DL models are painstakingly designed by a team of Data Scientists. This process of manually designing DNNs is difficult because the search space of all possible models can be combinatorially large \u2014 a typical 10-layer network can have ~1010 candidate networks! For this reason, the process of designing networks often takes a significant amount of time and experimentation even by those with significant DL expertise.", "In practice, this translates to a trial and error process, trying out different combinations of some of the above configurable hyperparameters (in bold), e.g. number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, the activation function, optimizer, batch size, number of training epochs, etc. There are some known architectures, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks \u2014 ANNs (Prediction), Convolutional Neural Networks \u2014 CNNs (Image Classification), Recurrent Neural Networks \u2014 RNNs/Long Short-term Memory Networks \u2014 LSTMs (Time Series Forecasting); that have been shown to work well for specific types of problems (in brackets). However, beyond this knowledge and the availability of some pre-trained NNs (e.g. ImageNet for Image Classification); the process of developing and training a NN for a new problem \u2014 Neural Architecture Search (NAS) [1] \u2014 very much remains an open problem.", "And, this is where AutoML has the potential to automate Neural Architecture Search (NAS), by covering the search space in an accelerated fashion with efficient heuristics and distributed computation.", "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be promising approach for NAS [2], where a controller neural net proposes a \u201cchild\u201d model architecture, which is then trained and evaluated for quality on a particular task. That feedback is then used to inform the controller how to improve its proposals for the next round. This process is repeated thousands of times \u2014 generating new architectures, testing them, and giving that feedback to the controller to learn from. Eventually the controller net learns to assign high probability to areas of architecture space that achieve better accuracy on a held-out validation dataset.", "Having gone through a bit of AutoML internals, and having a better understanding of the ML/DL pipelines; let us have a look at the maturity of current AutoML tools.", "It would be fair to say that AutoML is at a stage where DL was a couple of years back \u2014 riding very high on expectations.", "Gartner expects that \u201cby 2020, more than 40% of data science tasks will be automated\u201d (link).", "Forrester analysts in their May 2019 Wave report [3] said that \u201cjust about every company will have a stand-alone AutoML tool. We expect this market to grow substantially as products get better and awareness increases of how these tools fit in the broader data science, ML, and AI landscape\u201d. In the same report, they ranked DataRobot, H2O.ai, and dotData as the three leading providers of AutoML.", "CB Insights [4] lists over 40 AutoML companies today. Here, it is important to mention that while labeling a tool as AutoML has become \u2018cool\u2019 these days, there is not much difference in the AutoML capabilities (in terms of the ML/DL algorithms) that they offer.", "The \u2018automated\u2019 part of today\u2019s AutoML tools lies in their ability to provide an end-to-end Data Science/Machine Learning platform \u2014 allowing you to do everything from developing models to deploying them at scale on the same platform.", "AI/ML practitioners would be aware of the challenges when a ML/DL model is trained and deployed by different teams on different platforms. So the AutoML tools today primarily help in resolving the end-to-end training-deployment issues for a number of known ML algorithms.", "Also, while mature AutoML tools, e.g. DataRobot, can be quite expensive; AutoML has recently become quite accessible with the more pervasive cloud platforms providing integrated AutoML capabilities: Google Cloud\u2019s AutoML, Microsoft Azure\u2019s Machine Learning Service and AWS Sagemaker AutoPilot. It is only fair to say that these tools are quite limited at this stage, supporting only the basic Regression based Forecasting and Text Classification. For instance, none of them support Deep Learning (or NAS) at this stage, which is most likely due to the very high computational overhead of running NAS.", "To conclude, let us come back to our original question: \u201cDoes AutoML mean the end of Data Scientists, basically the need for specialized Data Science skills?\u201d", "To answer this, let us start with the user interface. If by AutoML, we mean a tool which given an excel/csv as input data, is able to output a trained model with reasonable accuracy. Yes, current AutoML tools can do it today.", "The challenge arises when the model needs to be improved. Remember, DS/ML is an iterative process. The problem is that you will rarely encounter a scenario where you get a very high accuracy on the first dataset that you provide. There is something wrong if you do, or your problem is too trivial -:) So the problem with AutoML starts when it needs to improve a model.", "The same reasoning that makes \u2018Explainable AI\u2019 so difficult [5], applies here as well. The AutoML tool has very limited understanding of why a model behaves as it does. It can explore the input data distribution to point out certain data characteristics that can be improved. However, it will never be able to recommend that adding new data, e.g. weather, location, etc. will improve the model accuracy. This is because it lacks the business/domain knowledge. On the same limes, it lacks the technical knowhow currently to discover a completely new neural network architecture. For example, while it can recommend the right number of hidden layers for an ANN, its NAS will not be able to recommend that adding \u2018memory\u2019 will solve the vanishing gradient problem of RNNs \u2014 leading to the discovery of LSTMs.", "AutoML tools today are not ready for your strategic use-cases. However, they can provide significant value during your prototyping/MVP and exploratory phases of enterprise data science model development.", "To summarize, AutoML tools today are far from replacing your skilled Data Scientists \u2014 you still need them. However, they can act as a complementary or standalone DS/ML platform for Data Scientists, significantly accelerating their work by automating many of the exploratory stages that form part of any new DS use-case.", "[1] Neural Architecture Search literature survey, (link)", "[2] Google AI: Using Machine Learning to Explore Neural Network Architecture, (link)", "[3] Forrester New Wave: Automation-Focused Machine Learning Solutions, Q2 2019, (link)", "[4] CB Insights: Artificial Intelligence Trends To Watch In 2020, (link)", "[5] D.
