And countless Scrum coaches and consultants look and speak as cultists.", "When a team decides to adopt Agile, and Scrum in particular, too often they have that attitude \u2014 that once they perform all the magic rituals everything will magically work. All the problems will disappear. And if they keep repeating the spells, performance will go through the roof as well.", "Then it doesn\u2019t happen. People become disillusioned and disappointed. They go and write countless articles on the Internet arguing that Scrum is a fraud and simply doesn\u2019t work.", "Well, Scrum is no magic. Despite all the terrifying words and charming coaches, Scrum itself has no power. It cannot solve any problems by itself.", "I\u2019m not a Scrum expert. I\u2019m a software engineer. You don\u2019t have to listen to me. But when I started having an interest in Agile, I became amazed at how many people only imitate Scrum, without any particular requirements or goals.", "There\u2019s a whole universe of Scrum: millions of articles, courses and books, thousands of talks, certifications and trainers. So many words \u2014 but so little action.", "Let\u2019s talk like engineers. Scrum is called \u201cframework\u201d for a reason. Like many frameworks, it doesn\u2019t give you the code to solve your problem, it only gives you a structure. Then it is your task \u2014 as a Scrum Master, Team Leader or an engineer \u2014 to fill in the blanks.", "How do you write that code? I have an idea. It may sound strange to many people, but here it is: instead of all the talking, do things. It really doesn\u2019t matter how you call this or that or how beautiful your Burndown Chart is. What matters is if your input gives you the right output.", "Sprint is the cornerstone of Agile. The most important function. It\u2019s not just a word, or a ritual, or a mere two weeks period. Many teams just shove some tasks in the beginning, then, at the end of the two weeks, they pass what\u2019s not finished to the next \u201cSprint\u201d. This is not a Sprint, it\u2019s only an imitation.", "Every Sprint is supposed to start from a blank page. A good function is idempotent.", "Also, Sprint doesn\u2019t serve as a metric tool for a manager. A Sprint is only measured by results, by its output.", "Sprint is a function, an action that should produce an Iteration \u2014 something that works that didn\u2019t exist before. Something you can demonstrate.", "If your work is not iterative \u2014 maybe you only solve unsorted bugs, or you\u2019re building a satellite \u2014 then you shouldn\u2019t attempt to divide your process into sprints.", "They may be called ceremonies, but don\u2019t be confused \u2014 in the end, they\u2019re just meetings that, if run efficiently, can be functions and produce results.", "If a meeting doesn\u2019t produce output then it should be run differently or removed from people\u2019s calendars. If a meeting is a ritual it\u2019s just a waste of everybody\u2019s time.", "Usually, engineers don\u2019t like too many meetings. Almost nobody likes a long meeting. If a meeting doesn\u2019t have a clear goal it becomes a torture. If a meeting doesn\u2019t produce any result, it feels pointless. If a pointless meeting repeats regularly, it feels like a ritual.", "If your Scrum is made of rituals it is an imitation \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone when people start complaining that it doesn\u2019t work.", "Millions of words are written about standups. They usually focus on the \u201cpeople\u201d side of things \u2014 report to each other, don\u2019t get distracted, stay within the timeframe. All these points are valid. But why exactly do we do that? So \u201ceveryone knows what everyone\u2019s doing\u201d. But why?", "They should know in order to plan their day.", "Output: Clearly defined tasks, all written down", "The Backlog Refinement takes raw requirements and converts them to clearly defined tasks.", "Clearly defined \u2014 this is important. No questions should be needed after the meeting. Remember these tasks will go further through the pipeline and get back to you during the Sprint Planning.", "It the Refinement is unproductive it will make the Planning unproductive.", "Also, Planning Poker is not just a boring game. The \u201chow\u201d is not important. What is important is if you can quickly decide collectively how difficult the task\u00a0is.", "Estimations define the sprint, the sprint defines what you will be working on and how hard. If the Poker actually makes a difference, then everyone will be interested.", "The Sprint Planning takes what\u2019s Backlog Refinement produced, divides it and converts to a Sprint.", "The main thing about the Sprint Planning that it should be serious. When you plan the sprint and \u201ccommit\u201d, it shouldn\u2019t be just a symbolic gesture \u2014 you decide what you\u2019re going to work on. This will be an increment you\u2019re going to have to show to your co-workers.", "Input: Team members\u2019 thoughts about the sprint", "Output: List of actions to implement", "Once I worked in a team where Retro was a time when everyone shouted at one another and complained. In another team, Retro was always quiet as everything was apparently great for everyone.", "In many teams, Retro is just for managers \u2014 the engineers just wait to go back to work.", "The Retrospective should collect everyone\u2019s opinion about the work process and produce a list of actions. And then these actions should be acted upon.", "If the Retrospective doesn\u2019t produce any improvement then it feels like a waste of time.", "Sprint Demo exists to make sure you\u2019ve produced an Iteration. If you don\u2019t have anything to demonstrate, maybe it wasn\u2019t a Sprint?", "Think of Scrum as a flowchart of Lambda functions. As the process is iterative, they inevitably form a circle.", "\u2026 Improvements -> Backlog Refinement -> Backlog -> Sprint Planning -> Sprint -> Standup -> -> Demo -> Retrospective -> Improvements \u2026", "Scrum doesn\u2019t create a process for a team. As a framework, it can only help with the structure. It is on the team to write the \u201ccode\u201d.", "To make it work, we shouldn\u2019t care about being cool or doing things right. We should care about the results.", "Although there\u2019s a lot of talk about how cool and fun it is to be agile, Agile really is about discipline. It was created as a framework to navigate through the chaos of ever-changing requirements.", "Scrum doesn\u2019t have to be fun. Well, it doesn\u2019t have to be boring either. Best if it is just invisible. Most importantly, it should not distract people from working and should not add more chaos than there already is.", "And yes, sometimes Scrum is just not the right choice for a team.", "Your home for data science.
