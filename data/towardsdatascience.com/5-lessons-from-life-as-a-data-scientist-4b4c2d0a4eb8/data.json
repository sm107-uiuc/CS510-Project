Recently, I decided to change things up and join a fast-growing startup called Hugo to work on all things Growth.", "This detour away from further specialization in data science surprised a lot of people. It still surprises me a little bit. I learned a ton as a first-time data scientist from both a technical and a functional perspective.", "This post is my attempt at preserving a few of those ideas, while hopefully providing you with some valuable takeaways from my first role as a data scientist.", "When I played baseball growing up, I was always focused on doing what I could to help us win, rather than putting up numbers for myself. Sometimes, this was even to my detriment.", "I never really carried that thinking over to my career until this past year. At internships and early on at Squarespace, I was laser-focused on proving myself and establishing credibility. It wasn\u2019t until I had settled into my role and felt vetted as a data scientist that I was able to shift my thinking to where I wanted the team to go and how I could help us get there.", "Working at a startup, I\u2019ve noticed this mindset carries over nicely. At the end of the day, organizations aren\u2019t that different from sports teams. You can still focus on personal improvement while working to bring the team closer to some goal. Often, they turn out to be one and the same.", "Surprisingly, planning out projects that would drive impact was the most difficult thing about being a data scientist. I started out taking a top-down approach. I would pay attention to the questions that stakeholders were asking, and then try to come up with ideas for potential answers. This was somewhat effective, but I often ended up getting stuck trying to untangle the messiness of a vague question without immediate actionability.", "As I progressed, my process became more and more bottoms-up. I would look at what I could do today that would drive smaller but more relevant impact. I still think that I naturally lean towards top-down thinking, but I now see the benefits of approaching problems bottoms-up in organizations. This might differ depending on your particular situation. Try both approaches and see what moves the needle.", "There\u2019s a classic line, \u201cdon\u2019t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.\u201d This is a bit extreme in most cases, but there is some truth here. If you have an idea that you think is really important, it\u2019s not always best for you to take the time to try and get buy-in from stakeholders. Just show them.", "Find the least amount of viable work that you could do to prove the project out and start there. This could be a proof of concept or something as simple as a 1-pager project brief. Just the act of getting your thoughts laid out clearly in a short document goes a long way.", "There\u2019s also an added bonus here that once you do a little work and the project has some promise, others will be much less inclined to push back on the next steps. I\u2019ve found that this is the quickest way to drive impact on larger teams.", "It\u2019s difficult to avoid group-think while making decisions in organizations. Things get complex awful quickly, especially when you take into account variables like company politics and history. The reality is that you can\u2019t control everything, but you can be helpful by doing one simple thing: Have an opinion.", "This doesn\u2019t mean to be the loudest person in the room or give unsolicited \u201chot takes\u201d even when you don\u2019t know what is going on. Instead, this means that when you\u2019re informed about something, have a strong point of view and share it. Most discussions end up with everyone sitting somewhere in the soft \u201cmaybe\u201d range. Anecdotes get thrown out and information is shared, but the team doesn\u2019t get any closer to making a decision.", "Even if others don\u2019t agree with your perspective, you\u2019re still helping move the conversation closer to a decision. It may be a little uncomfortable, but others will appreciate the contribution. Faster, more comprehensive decisions are good for everyone.", "Lastly, this one isn\u2019t rocket science but turns out to be pretty important. Assign an owner to literally everything. Everyone has a million balls in the air. Everyone is understaffed. Everyone has different incentives and projects that matter to them. If you make the assumption that someone else will pick a project up, you\u2019re making a mistake.", "The key is to be explicit. The workplace gods punish the vague wish and reward the specific ask. If you want someone to do something, ask them. If you want to automate that ask, assign an owner. Keep these two things in mind and your life will be much easier.", "I have no complaints about working as a data scientist. In fact, I loved it. Data science is a rapidly growing field with high-leverage that has the added benefit of being really fucking cool. It was incredibly fun to go into work every day where I could perform in-depth analysis, build cool things, and inform product decisions.", "With this being said, many of the counterpoints about working in data are true. When working as an analytics data scientist for a larger team, you are rarely the primary decision maker and things are often out of your hands. You will be in the room for lots of decisions, but in the best case, you serve the role as the right-hand man or woman.", "Ultimately, I decided to go to the other side of the spectrum by joining a startup where I couldn\u2019t avoid being a primary decision maker if I tried. As someone who likes to move fast, is a self-proclaimed generalist, and wants to be a founder someday, this feels right.", "I\u2019m still a data scientist at heart, but I have a lot of other interests that I want to explore as well. Besides, I\u2019ll always be a data scientist at heart. I won\u2019t leave you quite yet, Jupyter Notebooks.", "Thanks for reading!
