By many measures the 4th industrial revolution is here. The World Economic Forum describes it as the advent of cyber-physical systems involving entirely new capabilities for people and machines, and new ways in which technology is becoming embedded within our society. Data science is a great example where entirely new communities are forming with very different but efficient processes for learning and re-learning, innovation, information exchange, and having environment that provides incentives for the efficient use of existing and new knowledge and the flourishing of entrepreneurship. There is, however, a significant challenge well captured by World Economic Forum:", "\u201cWe should therefore remember that all industrial revolutions are ultimately driven by the individual and collective choices of people. And it is not just the choices of the researchers, inventors and designers developing the underlying technologies that matter, but even more importantly those of investors, consumers, regulators and citizens who adopt and employ these technologies in daily life.\u201d", "Thus, as data science community is flourishing, it is important that researchers, inventors, and designers are aware of common struggles, and opportunities of embedding their novel discoveries of value into existing commercial landscapes. And more generally this extends across other fields of technology where often the problem is not in organisation\u2019s failure to understand new technologies or capabilities that leads to lack of funding or support, but instead it has to do with culture and general approach to innovation. And understanding this is the key.", "Consider this short example. Kodak had been in the market for over 130 years and was considered one of the most innovative companies of its time before they filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Everyone knows that they failed to respond to the shift in demand from film to digital cameras. But perhaps not everyone knows that Kodak was the first company to build a working digital camera in the late 70\u2019s, and even when Apple released its first digital camera in the 90\u2019s it was actually designed by Kodak. Don Strickland, a former vice-president, left the company in early 90's because he couldn\u2019t persuade it to pursue digital camera market, he said: \u201cWe developed the world\u2019s first consumer digital camera but we could not get approval to launch or sell it because of fear of the effects on the film market.\u201d There is, as Don said a fear when market conditions are shaken by new technologies or capabilities and companies are defending their existing position. However, it is not fear, but rather a sequence of perfectly rational decisions that are embedded in organisational culture and general approach to innovation. Come back to this paragraph when you finish reading this article and reflect on this \u2014 Kodak was swimming in red oceans just the way many other companies do today. And data science discoveries are received by many organisations in the same way as digital cameras were received by Kodak. In this article you will learn why this happens, and how to address it.", "In literature there is little and hard to find practical and clear guidance on how to look for and discover new value. Check out in the end of this article the list of people I\u2019ve focused on who are the world\u2019s most influential thinkers in their disciplines. I have studied their work to great depths and noticed that their methodologies are mostly servicing the needs of executives or high level management where learning feeds directly into strategy and company growth impact is clearly communicated. All case studies, theories, observations are built around this executive culture. This is perfectly rational because executives set the direction and execute company growth strategies, then allocate resources and approve new projects. However, once programmes are approved, or a general direction is set, significantly more decisions and prioritisations are made lower in a hierarchy and almost on a day-by-day basis when teams develop technologies. And these dynamics of technology delivery are getting more vibrant as we transition into the knowledge-society where the appetite for innovation is growing unprecedentedly. In response to the growing innovation demand established organisations are shifting from slower-moving hierarchies to flexible, more collaborative, and agile structures. McKinsey & Company defines this shift as moving from machine-like into organism-like structures giving companies increased ability to renew itself, adapt, change, and succeed in rapidly changing and ambiguous market environments. As such, boxes and lines that traditionally drew boundaries between teams and departments are now less important allowing collaboration across functional lines with less hierarchy, which is reported to significantly boost productivity and innovation. Thus, there is a degree of growing autonomy in this dynamic environment and this is where company\u2019s effectiveness for delivering on innovation targets is mostly defined. Put differently, better effectiveness allows executing on more demanding targets and allows organisations to pursue more demanding growth strategies. Thus, there are two elements contributing to organisational\u2019s ability to unlock new value \u2014 successful strategy created and delivered by executives, and delivery on this strategy by its employees. And while all practical guidance I\u2019ve seen is aimed at the former, the latter is often not given as much attention as it should receive. Consider for a moment what Henry Ford famously said of his industry \u201cif I asked customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse\u201d. While his problem was to unlock new value on an executive level, the same model of reasoning can be applied to other problems that arise in every other level of organisational hierarchy. And while current and common methods for discovering value-maximising and risk-minimising solutions to our daily problems in innovation are cumbersome and often lack clear definition and systematic procedure,", "my question is this: how can a strategy for discovery and execution of new markets by most successful executives in the world be formulated into a systematic framework that can be also applied by every one else lower in the hierarchy who carry important responsibility to deliver on innovation targets set by their executives?", "In this context, this is a much wider philosophy \u2014 not only as discovery of new markets and creating strategies that can lead to long term profitable growth, but also more generally as I call it the discovery of value that can lead to more effective delivery on innovation targets and push the boundaries of organisational understanding of what is possible.", "My point is that not only executives but also everyone else working in innovation, on any level, in any role should be aware of the opportunities, challenges and struggles behind discovery of value and executing on its strategies. Interestingly there are a lot of lessons to be learned from world\u2019s top thinkers and entrepreneurs building most successful companies. Whether you are a university student eager to start a meaningful side project, an entrepreneur taking your venture into the skies, an employee preparing a pitch, a professor pursuing new research agendas, or an established leader looking for new growth opportunities \u2014 there are great lessons here for everyone.", "Many of the world\u2019s top thinkers have given us ways to clearly understand fundamental differences between types of innovation and how the choices made can impact business growth in the long term. These innovation strategies have been popularised under different names such as competition vs. monopoly by Peter Thiel of Silicon Valley, sustaining vs. disruptive innovation by Clay Christensen of Harvard, red oceans vs. blue oceans by Chan Kim et al. of INSEAD, or glocalisation vs. reverse innovation by Jeff Immelt et al. of General Electric. However, they all deliver the same message. Companies sometimes get caught up in a red ocean of competition which eats away their profits, prevents them from creating meaningful differentiation, and immobilises them from investing in disruptive products that can create new markets and unlock new value. The most successful companies in the world manage to escape competition and make it irrelevant by investing in technologies that are focused, differentiated, and create new markets. They manage to create blue oceans and use innovative technologies to disrupt their market which lead to new trajectories of strong and profitable growth.", "In his bestselling book, Zero to One, Peter Thiel wrote that \u201cits competition [\u2026] that is like war: allegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive\u201d. Overwhelming value can be created by companies that discover new markets and create monopoly. \u201cBy monopoly we mean the kind of company that\u2019s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. [\u2026] Monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximises its profits.\u201d However, according to Clay Christensen, managers of well-run companies usually fail consciously or subconsciously to pursue disruptive innovations, which Thiel refers to as a monopoly. This is because it fundamentally challenges their supply chains, cost structures, processes, values, and culture that have been developed over longer time periods while tuning in to the needs of their most powerful customers in markets that are known and well understood. A fundamentally different strategy is required to address disruptive innovations that create new markets, new competition, new demand, new groups of customers, or aim at existing established groups of customers with new products attributes and business models. Chan Kim et al. investigated what are the commonalities in strategies that world\u2019s most successful, lasting and visionary companies follow to continuously outperform the market and repeatedly create blue oceans. What they found out is that the cornerstone of a successful strategy to discover blue oceans is value innovation where instead of focusing on beating the competition the focus should be on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for clients, and therefore opening up new and uncontested market space. \u201dCompetition-based red ocean strategy assumes that an industry\u2019s structural conditions are given and that firms are forced to compete within them. [\u2026] In contrast, value innovation is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players.\u201d However, Chan Kim et al. believe that \u201cat present the playing field is dramatically unbalanced in favour of tools and analytical frameworks to succeed in red oceans. As long as this remains true, red oceans will continue to dominate companies\u2019 strategic agendas even as the business imperative for creating blue oceans takes on new urgency. Perhaps this explains why, despite prior calls for companies to go beyond existing industry space, companies have yet to act seriously on these recommendations.\u201d", "The impact of pursing blue oceans and the practical challenge of adapting its strategies within an established organisation has been well documented by Jeff Immelt et al., ex CEO of General Electric. Jeff et al., wrote for Harvard Business Review that \u201cGE badly needs innovation [\u2026] not only to expand beyond high end segments [\u2026] but also to pre-empt [other] companies from creating similar products and then using them to disrupt GE. To put it bluntly, if GE\u2019s businesses are to survive and prosper in the next decade, they must become as adept at [pursuing blue oceans] as they are at [competing in red oceans].\u201d However, discovery and execution of a blue ocean strategy is far from straight forward. A good example was given by Jeff who described the extraordinary challenges of taking blue ocean through various stages of delivery at General Electric. He wrote that as a GE leader you are usually rigidly accountable to deliver on growth plans addressing needs of existing customers in existing markets \u2014 in other words the focus is on sustaining or incremental improvements in red oceans. You will have very little time for an extracurricular activity like discovering blue oceans and creating new strategies. But these challenges of getting your strategy on the paper are nothing compared to selling blue ocean proposals internally. Doing so requires getting attention of multiple other leaders in the company hierarchy, e.g. head of manufacturing, head of marketing, head of finance, head of global R&D, who all have their own agendas and very little time to make the case. And even if the proposal goes off the ground, you would need to compete for capital year after year against more certain projects with shorter-term-pay-offs. Meanwhile, you would still have to worry about making your quarterly numbers for your day job. It is little wonder that successful efforts to develop radically new products were extremely rare according to Jeff.", "The mechanics behind the organisational challenges in the example described by Jeff Immelt et al. can be well explained using Christensen\u2019s logic. In the core of the problem are the commonly accepted and practiced methods to measure growth. It is easier to compare opportunity when growth is measured in relative rather than absolute terms. As the result, ratios are used to measure and compare growth across proposals, project, portfolios, or companies. Most commonly used are the return on assets (ROA), and gross margin. The third one is the internal rate of return (IRR), which estimates profitability of potential investment by evaluating a discount rate at which net present value of all cash flows equals zero and can be understood as investment over time. Good managers do what makes sense, and what makes sense is to focus on and invest in projects that maximise ROA, gross margins and IRR. This can either be done by rising net income, revenue, or investment, or reducing number of assets, costs of manufacturing, or investing in shorter projects that provide higher net cash flow back to investor. The former is usually much more difficult to accomplish, thus the latter is where most intention and focus behind growth is. Thus, according to this logic the red ocean culture is one that listens to their most-powerful customers, invests aggressively in near-term technologies that give those customers what they say they want, seeks higher margins, and targets large enough markets that are needed to sustain growth expectations. If you look closely, the paradox here is that these are perfectly rational behaviours, but they go against pursuing blue oceans \u2014 which provide the largest value. This is exactly the challenge behind Jeff Immelt et al. story, and perhaps many more of other people trying to pitch ideas to their managers. As a manager looking at blue ocean proposals you will conclude that these are typically the ones that your most powerful customers reject, offer lower profits, underperform existing technologies, have longer return on investment and potentially have insignificant initial market size. Thus, the value of blue oceans should not be expressed and compared as a ratio, but rather in absolute terms. And given remarkable success of blue oceans in creating incomparable value, we should give it the attention and patience it deserves.", "The reason behind this difficulty of focusing on discovery and execution of blue oceans has been very well investigated by Christensen and Thiel. And it goes to the core of the individual and organisational behaviour. Organisations develop processes and values that are in line with its major business needs. These processes and values are elements which constitute organisational capabilities and determine company\u2019s capability to succeed in building market leading position. Employees learn what can be defined as best problem-solving methods and criteria for decision making, and as they successfully use these methods and make decisions to address recurrent tasks, processes become defined. Processes can include product development, procurement, market research, budgeting, planning, employee development and compensation, and resource allocation. The criteria by which decisions are made can either be ethical in nature which for example align with company vision and mission, but also as Resource-Process-Values, which are the standards by which employees make prioritisation decisions and judge whether certain actions are more or less attractive, certain customers are less or more important, or certain ideas are less or more appealing. The larger and more complex the organisation becomes the more important it becomes to have processes in place and train employees to make independent decisions about priorities. Once employees begin to use processes and values by assumption rather than conscious decision, then organisational culture is established which makes employees to act autonomously and consistently. It is often the culture that defines a direction a company will pursue, and ultimately define their long term growth trajectory. Christensen believed that it is the culture in the core of a reason of why we see great well-run companies eventually lose their market position and fail to respond to the changes in the basis of competition. Company doesn\u2019t have a culture, a company is a culture. Culture makes employees to act autonomously and consistently, defines what decisions employees will make, determine the path of resource allocation, and determine the cost structures. A growth culture is built by individual people who are on a mission and driven by their own understanding of where the value is. Some cultures value competition and addressing needs of their most powerful customers, while other drive growth through differentiation and creation of new markets. Put differently, the culture will ultimately determine the ability for an organisation to break away from the competition and create a new value. And when organisational capabilities have become embedded in culture, such as in the case of GE detailed by Jeff Immelt et al., change can be extraordinarily difficult.", "A way forward to overcome this difficulty is to create a separate growth team that resembles almost a start-up environment with autonomy in decision making and potential to create its own culture aimed at creation of new markets. Jeff Immelt et al. wrote that GE responded to their organisational challenges of pursuing blue oceans by creating separate local growth teams (LGT), with their own processes, values and culture separated from the rest of the business making the process of discovery a lot more effective than it was previously possible while mainstream organisation\u2019s focus is on red oceans. In the midst of a severe 2008 global recession some main GE businesses grew 25% largely because of new technological innovations explored by their LGT units created for their clients a leap in value and opened up new market spaces. There are similar strategic efforts by others, too. Between years 1998 and 2007 NASA\u2019s Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) was operating with a budget of circa $4M annually, and a community of entrepreneurs, researchers and inventors was tasked with discovery of blue oceans. They were effectively separated from the hurdles imposed by mainstream organisation. The institute over its 9-year lifetime evaluated about 1309 proposals with 10 to 40 years planning horizon and 5\u201310% of selected concepts were later infused into mainstream NASA\u2019s long range plans. In parallel European Space Agency created its own Advanced Concepts Team (ACT) with a budget of \u20ac1M annually, and mission to monitor, perform and foster progress of innovative concepts and working methods. The success of NIAC and ACT was evaluated as taking the selected high-risk, high-return concepts, technologies, ideas and methods and proving them and transferring over to the mainstream organisation, and the success rates were in the area of 10\u201330%. Without their advanced concepts units it would have been impossible to evaluate blue ocean proposals on that scale and with such a high success rate. Similarly in recent years across aerospace industry we can see creations of specialist business units/groups/teams with autonomy and a set strategy to explore advanced concepts and new markets. For example Airbus created A3 labs, R-R created R2 labs, GKN created Global Technology Centre. This is where advanced concepts in artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, internet of things, novel propulsion technologies, additive manufacturing etc. are evaluated to create a leap in value for their clients and set a trajectory for new profitable growth.", "Finally, to reiterate on the Chan Kim et al. observation \u2014 while we see companies taking action to enable them to capture blue oceans, there are still significantly more companies that are yet to do something about it. Those that wont act, sooner or later will see emergence of new unfamiliar competition, loss of market share, or fail to retain their customers.", "Strive to be authentic and original, don\u2019t benchmark your actions against others, and create solutions that are focused, differentiated, and create a leap in value for whomever you are targeting. Be aware of the characteristics of a culture that surrounds you \u2014 this will ultimately define your ability to convey and receive support for your various visions. And if you struggle, surround yourself with people who see value in absolute terms. Then when you will pitch ideas to people who swim in red oceans, be aware of how you approach them and how information is presented. And finally build your emotional courage to accept potential feelings of discomfort, uncertainty, rejection, failure, or insecurity. These are the risks of committing to something bigger and beyond convention, and if you want to accomplish anything worthwhile these are the feelings you may have to feel.", "However you decide to approach this, pursuing blue oceans is definitely worth it! Good luck in getting through various waves of challenges, which I hope I have helped you to anticipate what these could be.", "But how to actually discover value?
