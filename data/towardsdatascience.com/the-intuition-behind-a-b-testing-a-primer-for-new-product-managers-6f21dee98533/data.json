For that matter, why do we test new things? What are the results of the A/B Tests telling us? How confident should you feel about the result of the A/B Test? How do you really understand what is happening in an A/B Test? How do product managers avoid many of the mistakes common to people who are just starting on that journey?", "The goal of this article to speak to many of these questions.", "When there is change in what is being offered (whether that change is a new drug being introduced, or a change made to an website), we want to know", "For example: In the case of a new diabetes drug, you want to know to whether this drug has a pre-estimated impact vs. not giving the drug. In the case of an online website that is trying to sell something, you want to know whether the new idea you have to improve the % of people who end up doing a certain action (or whatever your metric might be) increases by X% from its current state as a result of your new idea.", "Imagine that you currently have a website PostersRCheap.com that sells posters. A user adds the poster to his cart and checks out. On the shopping cart page, the user currently sees a button with the text \u201cCheck Out\u201d. Let\u2019s imagine the following conversation take place between you (the product manager), Anna (an engineer on your team), and Victor (a tester on your team).", "Background: One of your team member Anna observes a competitor\u2019s website and notices that on their website, the shopping cart page says \u201cSend Me My Posters\u201d. [We call this an \u201cObservation\u201d] Anna thinks to herself, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. I think that a button text that is telling people to send the posters is more inviting, and will cause more people to checkout.\u201d \u2014 We call this an alternative hypothesis.", "Anna: I saw this interesting thing that PostersRUs.com is doing. On their shopping cart page, the button says \u201cSend Me My Posters\u201d I think we should do that on our website, it will increase our check-out rate.", "Victor: Victor is a skeptic. Victor doesn\u2019t think that making this change will have any impact. We call this a \u201cnull hypothesis.", "You: As a product manager, you have to decide how to proceed. You choices are a) Believe the Victor and do nothing b) Believe Anna and just make this change c) Be scientific and test this hypothesis. You have just learned about A/B testing, and you think this would be a good place to try this out.", "You: \u201cSo Anna, we will test your hypothesis. How much do you think it will change the check-out rate?\u201d", "Anna: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Isn\u2019t that the point of the test to find out?\u201d", "You: \u201cWell.. Not really. The point of the test is to determine whether improvement you claim exists or not. Plus, I need that number to design my test. For example, if you say, this test will double our check out rate from 20% (We call this the base rate) to 40% of all users who go to the cart, then since this is such a big change, intuitively it should be much easier (faster) to observe. If you say, that this test will increase the check out rate from 20% to 20.4% (2% relative change), then that its such a small change, it may be hard to find that change.\u201d Intuitively you know that makes sense.", "Anna: Ok, It can\u2019t be as drastic as 100% because otherwise every other company would be doing so. So I would imagine it is smallish effect. Let\u2019s test whether its at least 10%. So i think given our last week\u2019s check-out rate of 20%, the new conversion rate would be 22%. I\u2019ve calculated that change will make us an additional $85,000 over the course of this year.", "You: Ok. Let\u2019s try this. Let\u2019s plug these number\u2019s into Evan Miller\u2019s A/B Sample Size estimator. I see it will take 6,347 samples per variation (or a total of approximately 12,700) to detect an effect of at least 10%. We typically get 800 customers on your shopping cart page, so it will take you approximately 16 days for the test to complete.", "You: Anna, can we implement the A/B test with half of the people who end up in the shopping cart seeing \u201cCheck-out\u201d and the other half seeing \u201cSend Me My Posters.\u201d And then lets wait for 16 days. [You\u2019ve also read Evan Miller\u2019s article How Not To Run an A/B test (even through you don\u2019t really understand it fully.) and so you don\u2019t look at the results for the next 16 days.]", "To understand what is happening and how these calculations work and what they mean, it is very important to first understand two basic concepts: population and samples.", "Finally, you use use statistics to make inference about the whole population by observing the results on the samples.", "There are 4 possible outcomes here (two are good outcomes, and 2 are undesirable outcomes for your).", "This discrepancy exists because we are using samples to estimate populations. (the technical term for this is sampling errors) For example if you run this test from Jan 3 to Jan 19th, 2019 \u2014 then you are making the assertion that this sample set represents the population.", "And that will never be entirely true, but the process of statistics (and careful test design and implementation) ensures that the sample is representative to the extent you want, so that you can rely on the test results.", "You will never eliminate undesirable effects or guarantee desired outcomes, but what you can do is manage them.", "If you remember using the sample size calculator, remember you had to specify something called significance and power. Those numbers (along with the base rate and minimum detectable effect) ensure that the size of the samples you use in your experiment limit the undesirable effects to a manageable range.", "Significance (or p-value): This is a number you specify that limits the size of false positives. That is, it ensures that if the 10% difference (you specified in your test calculations) between the control and variant does not exist, then you will not detect it mistakenly. When you specify a p-value of 0.05, it means that if you run this test 100 times and a real difference does not exist, 95 times out of 100 you will not detect a false positive. This gives a certain level of confidence that the test is not misleading you.", "Power (an alpha): This is a number you specify that when a difference really exists, your test is able detect it to a certain degree. When you specify an alpha value of 0.80, you are saying that if you run this 100 times and a real difference exists, 80 times out of 100, you will detect that change.", "When you specify the significance and power for your test, along side the base rate and the estimate change, it determines the size of the sample set you need. (which then determines the test duration given the rate of users visiting your test) This ensures that you don\u2019t end a test too soon. It also ensures that you don\u2019t end up with a lot of false negatives (i.e. there was a difference between the variant and control but you didn\u2019t detect it and therefore marked the test as negative test.)", "Alternatively, if you have a pre-determined test duration (such as \u201cWe want to know something in 2 weeks.\u201d) and therefore your sample size, the power, significance and the base rate will determine the minimal effect your test can determine within the constraints of the power and significance specified.", "If you are thinking \u201cLets just ramp up the power and the significance\u201d, remember that comes at the cost of the size of the sample set you\u2019ll need to detect your minimal detectable effect.", "Changing Statistical Power to 90% from 80%, Changing Significance Level from 5% to 1% \u2192 Test sample size per variation doubles from 6,347 to 12,046.", "When I did my first A/B as a product manager, my understanding of these concepts was very superficial level. As a result, we ended up designing and running tests that, in hindsight, were flawed (most of the times, we stopped the tests too soon). We spent a lot of time and effort implementing and reimplementing those tests, and learnt very little (let alone have plenty of winners) from it, until we understood the concepts behind them better.", "What I found was that most of the education material on this topic is written by statisticians. Nothing wrong about that except that they used technical terms and a manner for explaining, that in my opinion, was suited for other technical people. This made it very hard for a product manager with no background in statistics to understand and put these concepts in practice.", "My goal with this article is to make this topic accessible, in layman terms, without making simplifications that are inaccurate or misleading.", "If you found this article useful, wrong, misleading or incomplete, please leave your comments.", "Your home for data science.
