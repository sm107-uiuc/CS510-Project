As a longtime basketball fan, this was a fun and rewarding problem to dive into and explore.", "This article will cover various data scraping techniques I used to construct the historical dataset needed to tackle this problem.", "If you want to cut to the chase and skip the data collection process, head over to Part 2: Modelling to see the predictions!", "Click here to see the full repo (with readme) on my Github!", "The NBA All-Star game is an annual exhibition game that showcases 24 of the league\u2019s premier players. Glitzy and glamorous, the event is the marquee highlight of All-Star Weekend, with A-list celebrities often coming out in droves to watch the event.", "Seeing as the league consists of the top 450 players on the planet, being selected among them as an All-Star is a momentous accolade \u2014 an ambitious goal that many players set for themselves even before being drafted. When we evaluate a player\u2019s legacy at the end of their career, we often bring their All-Star selections into the conversation as a way to benchmark their greatness.", "Considering this, in addition to potential salary bonus implications, one would hope that the selection system is fair, unbiased, and rooted in some sort of objectivity. Sadly, however, that isn\u2019t quite the case.", "Starters are determined by a mix of fan, player, and media voting, while head coaches select the reserves. This subjective process does its best to select candidates with a track record of elite individual performance in the current season, but it\u2019s not without its flaws. Things like team record and social media presence leak into this decision process, and there is an inevitable outcry following the roster announcements each year from fans complaining that their favorite player has been wrongfully snubbed.", "At its core, we might expect selected players to simply be the consensus \u201c24 best players in the league\u201d \u2026 but how exactly do we define \u201cbest\u201d? Obviously, game stats like points and rebounds are important, but the playing field isn\u2019t always level. To any longtime NBA fan, it\u2019s no secret that team rank plays a big role in how we evaluate players individually; it is significantly harder to garner respect and acknowledgement from fans and peers if your team finds itself sitting near the bottom of the standings.", "This negative bias against losing teams has kept many would-be All-Stars from being selected, such as Karl-Anthony Towns in 2016\u20132017, but this effect is difficult to quantitatively describe. How much narrower are the goal posts for a player on a bad team versus a good one? The same concern arises with injuries, too. Players who miss extended time will find it harder to get a spot, even if they put up big numbers when they actually play. But what qualifies as \u201cextended time\u201d? Where exactly is the imposed cutoff that we use to make this decision?", "In an attempt to lift some of the fog and get an objective grip on what it takes to be an NBA All-Star, I went digging for the relevant data and applied machine learning techniques to concretely model this selection process.", "In machine learning, there is a concept known as \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d \u2014 meaning a model\u2019s output will only be as good as the data that drives it. If we want predictions that are accurate and insightful, we must ensure we provide a dataset that is consistent, useful, and from a trusted source.", "We\u2019re going to need to scrape several seasons\u2019 worth of historical data, but before we break out any Jupyter notebooks, we need to sit back and think about all the possible features that get taken into consideration for an All-Star selection. For a given player, what information helps us make our decision?", "To start, we\u2019ll need traditional stat averages, like points, rebounds, assists, etc. We can augment these with some advanced statistics, including usage rate, true shooting percentage, defensive win shares, and PIE. PIE stands for Player Impact Estimator, nba.com\u2019s version of PER (Player Efficiency Rating) that serves as a catch-all metric for player performance.", "Team ranking at time of voting is also important, so we\u2019ll use that too. For injuries and missed time, we can compare the individual\u2019s number of games played versus the team\u2019s and extract the appropriate percentage.", "It\u2019s crucial that we only consider the first half of the season.", "Reputation and fan favoritism are important factors to consider, but difficult to implement here. Scraping a player\u2019s social media presence on platforms like Instagram and Twitter is (a) a very involved data wrangling challenge and (b) impossible to reliably scale backwards due to the frenetically changing landscape of social media \u2014 plus it didn\u2019t really exist until ~2010.", "In place of this, we can use a cheap proxy for reputation: how many prior All-Star Games this player has been selected for in their career. It will struggle with young and unproven players, but it\u2019s plausible that this feature could do an adequate job of capturing long-term popularity among fans and media.", "We will aim to construct a dataset containing all of these features for every NBA player for each season since 1996, (the earliest season tracked on stats.nba.com). It\u2019s crucial that we only consider the first half of the season, since that\u2019s when the rosters get picked and everything thereafter is irrelevant. I chose a cutoff date of January 21 for each year, since this is roughly when selection decisions begin to be made.", "Our output label will simply denote whether that player got selected (1) for that year\u2019s All-Star Game or not (0). This is our ground truth. Even though the 2020 ASG has already happened and the rosters have long been determined, I\u2019ll omit the current season (2019\u201320) from the labelled dataset so we can run the model later and compare predictions to the known outcome.", "Once we have a model that we\u2019re happy with, we can peer into the blackbox and quantitatively explore the inner workings of All-Star criteria and how exactly they interact with each other, hopefully putting our curiosity to rest.", "Stats.nba.com will be our primary resource to satisfy our requirements. It supports functionality to query statistics over custom date ranges, which is imperative for what we want to do. Their webpages are dynamic in nature (AJAX), so scraping from them isn\u2019t trivial \u2014 more on this later.", "Data from this resource stretches back to the 1996\u201397 season, giving us a decent pool of training data for our model to work with.", "Note: data going back further than this cutoff point definitely exists, and while more data generally produces more accurate models, patterns between a player\u2019s attributes and their selection decision may not be completely time invariant. NBA audiences from two different eras may place different emphases on defense, for example. So, the 1996\u201397 cutoff is more than admissible here.", "Between the Traditional, Advanced, and Defense tables, we can get most of what we need. Next up are team rankings and team games played (which we will need to engineer play percentage). I decided to use team conference rank instead of overall rank since, for discussion purposes, intra-conference standings are generally what people care about the most. All of this can be found in the Teams table.", "Note that in the player table, teams are listed by their shorthand symbol\u00a0(e.g.\u00a0CHI), but full names are used in the team table (e.g. Chicago\u00a0Bulls). When we get to merging these together, we\u2019ll need to create some sort of lookup structure to link them.", "All that\u2019s left is the player\u2019s All-Star selection history, which we need for our output label and our \u201cnumber of prior All-Star selections\u201d feature. Luckily, this doesn\u2019t depend on any date filter within the season \u2014 so we can use another great resource for basketball statistics: Basketball Reference. These webpages are static HTML, meaning scraping from them will be more lightweight and straightforward.", "Something of note here is that we shouldn\u2019t neglect players who were selected as All-Stars but couldn\u2019t participate due to injury. Even though they didn\u2019t officially occupy a roster spot, they were chosen initially and will be treated as All-Stars throughout this analysis, along with their replacements.", "League pace has increased pretty steadily over the years as the game has evolved, so we will normalize applicable game statistics by dividing by pace. Average league pace by year is something we can easily get from Basketball Reference.", "Since there was no All-Star Game in 1999 due to the lockout, we will skip over the 1998\u20131999 season completely when constructing our dataset.", "Since the webpages at Basketball Reference are static (meaning the content is embedded directly in its HTML) we can simply use the requests library to load the HTML document.", "Then we will use BeautifulSoup to parse the document and selectively pull out the data we\u2019re interested in. Using the pd.read_html( \u2026 ) method, we can load the data into a familiar Pandas DataFrame, and we\u2019re off to the races.", "Even though our labelled dataset is going to start with the 1996\u20131997 season, we are going to need All-Star roster data stretching a lot further back than this. For example, Hakeem Olajuwon was an active player in \u201996, but his first All-Star selection was all the way back in \u201985. We initialize our ASG scrape with the year 1970 to ensure there\u2019s absolutely no chance we miss anybody.", "The data structure we build here will be a dictionary of sets, mapping player names to a set of all the years in which they were selected as an All-Star. We pickle this dictionary (serialize it) and export it for future recall.", "For those who are curious, here is the code to make it all happen:", "For the next step, we need to scrape tabular data from stats.nba.com, and this is where things get a little more complicated. These webpages have a dynamic implementation using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), so the displayed tables are nowhere to be found in the HTML document.", "Instead, the webpage will send a request (with accompanying data filters) to an API endpoint and get back a JSON response. We would have to go through the process of identifying the relevant endpoints and then manually curate the data ourselves. This would get incredibly tedious since now we\u2019re talking about deriving advanced statistics for every single player over a date range given nothing but a whole bunch of box scores.", "So we have two real options:", "Despite being the more brute-force approach, I opted to use Selenium for the sake of time.", "Selenium is a framework that allows us invoke an automated browser (WebDriver), and using the API in Python we can control this browser to navigate to the relevant webpage. After a delay period, once the response has been received from the backend, we can finally load the HTML document (containing the important data) and use BeautifulSoup and Pandas as before.", "There are a few more hurdles I encountered during this scraping, but most of these issues were custodial in nature (like the Charlotte Hornets being referred to as CHH in the pre-Bobcats era and CHA afterwards) and are explained via comments.", "The script will scrape stats.nba.com for every NBA player for each season from 1996 to today. Datasets are processed and merged appropriately, then augmented using the All-Star lookup dictionary we created before. Two datasets are exported as csv\u2019s, one with all the labelled data spanning from the 1996\u201397 season to 2018\u201319, and the other with unlabelled data for the current season.", "Being over 200 lines, the script is a little too lengthy to post here, but can be found here in the repo.", "Here\u2019s a peek at the first few rows of the two datasets \u2014 with many features hidden from view:", "Formal definitions of these game statistics can be found at https://stats.nba.com/help/glossary/.", "In Part 2 of this deep dive, we will be looking at modelling the NBA all-star selection process using the dataset we constructed here.
