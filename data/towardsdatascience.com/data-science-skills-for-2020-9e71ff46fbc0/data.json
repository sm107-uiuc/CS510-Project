However, many people find the learning process overwhelming. Our jobs are expected to require a great deal of in-depth knowledge of technical data science areas.", "If you\u2019re thinking about honing your data science skills you should think about communication first.", "Communication is critical. Communication is a skill that is difficult to learn and become proficient in.", "Communicating clearly, concisely and persuasively helps the user understand what you are trying to say. It also gives others a chance to explain their point of view and offer their opinion. Being thoughtful about the ways you communicate will help the audience have the best experience possible with your project.", "Encouraging third party involvement, building relationships with your community is a valuable skill.", "In my opinion, the first two are more important for identifying potential problems, while the third is of utmost importance if you want to create great products.", "To facilitate the developers, we also suggest to come up with an idea of how your visualization can be used to enhance your products. Often, it will lead to the development of a new tool, which can then be used on every step of the way.", "Try to build helpful dashboards, explain, annotate and document well your projects! This way others can also use them to their benefit.", "Given that \u201cdata science\u201d refers to numerous general topics (e.g. machine learning, recommendation, infrastructure, predictive analytics, etc.), let\u2019s give some examples. I\u2019m going to take a narrow view, and look at most in terms of leveraging data science.", "The most basic data science concepts are:", "Then comes probably the most important feat \u2014 you have to know statistics really well. Data Science is based on statistics and only then computer science. Without mastering probability theory and linear algebra you\u2019ll struggle to produce interesting results.", "So I would advise you to start with statistics before diving into advanced subjects like machine learning.", "Then comes Python. You really have to program efficiently and quickly to do Data Science at levels higher than the most basic ones. And that\u2019s because Data Science is about testing, playing with data and experimenting.", "You tend to have new datasets often and you need to be able to build a prototype quickly to at least research possible directions of where your work might be going. Without well learned Python you will lose hundreds of hours each time on simple implementation instead of thinking about algorithms.", "The requirements are on the table:", "Wish you all the best for 2020!", "Finally, if you want to have an overview of what it means to be a Data Scientist, then have a look at my book Data Science Job: How to become a Data Scientist which will guide you through the process.", "Your home for data science.
