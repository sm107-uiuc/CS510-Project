But in the same breath, the odds of successful project delivery are not in your favour. Estimates of project failure in the field start at 80% and go downhill, with a July 2019 VentureBeat AI report estimating that 87% of data science projects never make it into production.", "This is not for a lack of trying. On the topic of managing data science and AI projects, we have reputable university courses, published research, specialised tools and full blown professional certifications. But despite this effort, we seem to be no closer to success besides learning that deploying more people and money may \u2014 surprisingly \u2014 not be the answer.", "And this is because resources are like computation. Throwing more resources at a problem does not get to the right answer \u2014 it just gets to the wrong answer more quickly.", "Throwing more resources at a problem does not get to the right answer \u2014 it just gets to the wrong answer more quickly.", "We have been analysing data to support decisions since the early days of modern computation. And we have been implementing systems to help those decisions for almost as long. Why then, is bringing them together, so. darn. hard?", "Project managers have a terrific skill set. Most fundamentally, they manage uncertainty through dealing with risks, issues, requests and offers \u2014 often racking them up by the dozens (or even hundreds) in a single project. In addition, they have intuition and stakeholder management skills that increase with experience, enabling them to grease the grooves of project execution processes and making them masters of going from requirements to solution.", "And ironically it is this mastery in planning in an \u2018end-to-end\u2019 way from requirements to solution that is the downfall of many data science and AI projects. Because unless you have accounted for data uncertainty, starting with requirements is a trap.", "Unless you have accounted for data uncertainty, starting with requirements is a trap.", "The distinctive risk of data science projects is data uncertainty. This is the question asking:", "\u201cIs there enough information in the data to develop models that are sufficiently useful?\u201d", "Without answering this question, there is a real danger of developing and scaling up a solution that does not deliver business value because model performance has not crossed a threshold that makes it worth using. If this sounds abstract, examples may include:", "In each case, the project is ultimately infeasible due to limitations of the data at hand. And when even the feasibility of a project has not been established, conversations around architecture, automated pipelines and operations are meaningless. If a project is destined to fail due to the data, wouldn\u2019t it be better to find out by committing one data scientist for two weeks rather than finding out six months later with a team of ten?", "Expressed in a different way, a data science or AI project is only valuable if you have a high predictive signal, or useful information in the data. If that is not present, the project is a lost cause regardless of the business value of the use case and the quality of the data available.", "How then should we structure data science projects?", "The mess is at its heart, a tangle that comes from taking a shortcut in thinking about disciplines in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). The acronym rolls off the tongue so easily that it tempting to treat STEM professionals as a homogeneous group. But they are anything but that.", "Referencing Eric Drexler\u2019s explanation on science and engineering, not only are the two \u2018not quite the same\u2019, but seen through the lens of information flows, they are completely opposite. Science starts from reality, gathers data, then \u2014 looking at the problem through the lens of inquiry \u2014 ends with a new useful model. Engineering starts at the opposite endpoint. It starts with a model, adds detail through specification, then \u2014 looking at the problem through the lens of design \u2014 ends with a new useful reality.", "This is relevant because data science and AI projects are effectively managed in exactly these two phases, broadly corresponding to the lenses of science and engineering:", "A major cause of data science project failure is this mashup of science and engineering, with long term architectural and operations considerations being discussed before the project is even deemed feasible and valuable. This dysfunction also extends to teams, where the idea of \u2018maturing\u2019 a data science team equates to making it \u2018more engineering\u2019, or vice versa.", "Both are needed, but each is relevant in different parts of a data science project. Each also requires distinctly different management paradigms and skill sets to thrive. Doing core research when there are available engineering solutions is unnecessary, while tighter engineering controls do not make science labs more creative.", "Both science and engineering have to be done right for data science magic to happen.", "In light of this perspective, there are a few implications worth noting:", "In summary, we should think of data science or AI projects in two phases. The first has a clear focus on dealing with data uncertainty by sending a small data science focused team to model with the data at hand to see if there is sufficient predictive signal for the use case to be feasible. If we fail here, we fail well.", "The place for project management to lead then kicks in if and only if data uncertainty has been dealt with and a scalable IT solution is now the clear order of the day. This is where teams grow and and the full range of IT competencies become crucial.", "Data science and AI magic happens here.", "Or at least assuming that our application of data science and AI is responsible and ethical.
