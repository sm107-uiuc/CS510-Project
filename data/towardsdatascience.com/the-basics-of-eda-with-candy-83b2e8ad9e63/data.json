Therefore, as tedious as it may seem, it is a good idea to master the process before moving on to the fun stuff. The process which includes cleaning, sorting, and checking feature correlations to weed out the noise and hopefully gain some insight to what pieces are most useful.", "The dataset for this example is the candy hierarchy for 2017 from the Science Creative Quarterly website. You can find and download the csv here if you want to follow along. I\u2019m using Python 3.7 in Jupyter notebook.", "Some of the steps I share here will be personal preference and you can modify as you like, however, these first few steps are pretty important to ALWAYS do.", "Using pandas pd.read_csv function, enter your data source as a string and save it as a variable which will be the name of your DataFrame going forward. Many people use df, I like to use something more descriptive so i\u2019ll go with candy this time.", "Next you\u2019ll want to check the first few rows of the data to get a peak at what you\u2019ll be working with.", "candy.head( ) is a method that will return the first 5 rows of data. If you want more or less, simply enter the number in the parentheses like .head(10), for example.", "candy.shape is an attribute that tells you the number of rows and columns in the dataframe. As you can see above, candy has 2460 rows and 120 columns.", "After checking the data dictionary, which can be found here, I figured out each row is an individual person surveyed. A data dictionary provides a bit more detail about what information is provided in the dataset. It is always a good idea to review if available.", "with candy.isnull( ) . There are many variations of this method. Adding .sum() to the end will give you the total NaNs for each column and .mean( ) will tell you the percent of missing values from each column. I like to add .sort_values(ascending=False) additionally to show the columns in order from most missing to least.", "At this point you\u2019ll want to check the data dictionary and determine if the missing data means something? Or is it just unknown? Decide if you can drop the missing cells with .dropna( ) or if you should replace them with .fillna( ).", "For this example, we can see the [\u2018Unnamed: 113\u2019] and [\u2018Click Coordinates (x, y)\u2019] columns have no information and are useless, so we can drop them using .drop(columns=[\u2018insert column names\u2019], inplace=True). Prior to that I used .value_counts(dropna=False) to look at the values contained in those columns including NaNs and confirm there was nothing important there.", "The data dictionary does state that survey takers are allowed to skip any questions that make them uncomfortable so we can assume that some of the missing data is for that reason. Most of the questions are asking for a candy rating on a level of joy to neutral to despair. There is no box to choose if you\u2019ve never had the candy though. Therefore another assumption we can make is that NaNs in those columns fall into that category. In that case they can be filled with something like \u201cunknown\u201d or a string your choice. It really doesn\u2019t matter because in order to make the ratings more useful for measuring or predicting something, we\u2019ll need to change them to numbers eventually.", "Before I fill NaNs, I usually use the .dtypes attribute to see the data type for each column and look for anything strange.", "As expected, most columns are object type which means string.", "Q3 is Age which should be an integer.", "Q12 is the only float type. It had four answers and was automatically broken into dummy columns where 1.0 is a yes and NaN is a no. So we know we can fill those with 0.0.", "Once I\u2019ve figured out all the types, I like to create a for loop that will take care of all my missing values at the same time. I fill any column that is an integer or a float with 0 and any object columns with the string \u2018unknown\u2019. Then check to see if there are any nulls left.", "Next I like to revise the column names to be lowercase and void of special characters. This typically makes them easier to read and understand. You can use the .columns attribute to check the current names of the columns. Then I used list comprehension with .lower( ) and .str.replace( ) to make the changes I wanted. These names need a lot more work, but this is just to get an idea of how you could start.", "If there were fewer columns and you wanted to rewrite the names entirely, you could use the dictionary method.", "Lastly, I start using .value_counts( ) on individual columns to dig deeper and explore their usefulness. This is the part where I would probably change the ratings to numeric values and binarize features such as gender and going out if those seemed important to my problem statement.", "In the above clip I created a map in which all cells with JOY would change to a 3, all MEH cells would change to a 2 rating, and DESPAIR goes to a 1. Then I used .applymap( ) on a lambda function which basically loops through the cells of the dataframe, and if it finds a value listed in the map, it will replace it with the designated replacement value, or else if it is not in the map, it will stay the same.", "If I only want to look at Q6, regarding people\u2019s candy ratings, can set those rows equal to a new variable like candy_only.", "candy.describe( )will show us descriptive statistics like mean, standard deviation and min/max values.", "Since we don\u2019t have a target variable, i.e. something we\u2019re trying to predict, I will use this data to figure out the top 10 most popular candies.", "First, I found the mean of each column with .mean( ), then I sorted the value from largest to smallest and only showed the top 10. Finally I use .plot(kind= \u201cbar\u201d) to plot the bar graph. Besides, any full size candy bars which came in at #1, people most like Kit Kats, Reeses and cash!", "Your home for data science.
