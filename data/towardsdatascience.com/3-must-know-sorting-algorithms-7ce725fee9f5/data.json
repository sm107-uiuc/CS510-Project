Algorithms along with data structures are the building blocks of programming languages.", "An algorithm is not only supposed to perform a task, but also do it efficiently. The time and space complexity are two critical measures when evaluating an algorithm.", "Let\u2019s say you need to implement an algorithm to perform a task. You cannot just look it up like syntax of a programming language. You need to think analytically and computationally. Thus, designing an algorithm is not a skill that can be learned by reading documentation.", "However, learning and understanding the common algorithms definitely help to grow an analytical mindset. I think of it as mind exercise. Just like we play football to learn and get better at it, practice on solving algorithms improves our ability to design new ones.", "In this post, I will try to explain 3 different types of sorting algorithms. We use them a lot in data analysis but don\u2019t know what is going on under the hood. For instance, we just call the sort method in Python to sort a list.", "The algorithms we will cover are:", "In bubble sort algorithm, we go over a sequence of numbers by comparing consecutive numbers. If a number is smaller than its previous number, we swap them. We keep going over the list until all numbers are sorted.", "The following figure shows how the bubble sort algorithm works. We start with the list [3,2,8,4,1,5]. After the forth iteration, the list sorted in ascending order. I also put a note showing that how many swaps are done during each iteration.", "As you might expect, the program that executes this algorithm includes while and for loops. We also need an if statement for comparison.", "Here is the python code for the bubble sort algorithm.", "We need the swap variable to stop the algorithm when the sorting is completed. The while loop is executed as long as the swap variable is False.", "For loop iterates over the numbers in the list. We compare each number with its previous number. If it is smaller than the previous one, we swap them. As soon as the condition to swap is met and we get in the if statement, the swap variable is change to False so that we can start over.", "The complexity of an algorithm is very important. It\u2019s not enough just to do a task. We should design algorithms as simple as possible.", "The complexity of bubble sort algorithm is proportional to the square of the length of a list. Thus, the length of a list increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to sort the list increase quadratically.", "At worst case, we do n-1 comparisons and n-1 passes where n is the length of the list. With big-O notation, the time complexity of bubble sort algorithm is O(n\u00b2).", "The selection sort algorithm takes the first number and starting from the second one, all other numbers are compared with the first number. If a number is smaller than the first number, they are swapped.", "When the first iteration is complete, we make sure the smallest number is at the beginning of the list. Then, we take the second number and repeat the same process.", "After the execution is completed, the list is sorted in ascending order.", "The following figure shows how the selection sort algorithm works. As we just mentioned, after the first iteration, the smallest number is in the first position. After the second iteration, the second smallest number is in the second position and so on.", "Here is the python code for the selection sort algorithm.", "If you want to see the current version of the list after each iteration and count the number of swaps at each iteration, you can use the following code. It will be helpful in understanding how the algorithm works.", "For each number in the list, we iterate over the entire list. Thus, the time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is also O(n\u00b2) where n is the length of the list.", "The merge sort algorithm is a little more complicated to grasp but it is more efficient than the previous two algorithms. It performs better in terms of time complexity.", "This algorithm has two parts. First part is the merge function that merges two sorted lists in a way that the resulting list is sorted. Please note that the lists must be sorted for the merge function to work.", "The merge function first compares the smallest numbers of two lists. Then, it takes the smaller of the two and appends to a new list. The next step is to compare the second smallest from this list to the smallest in the other list. The process continues until all numbers are appended to a new list in ascending order.", "The following figure shows how the merge function works.", "The first part which consists of the merge function does not actually serve for our purpose by itself. We are trying to sort a list but the merge function takes merged lists as arguments. We will solve this issue with the second part.", "The second part is to split a list. It keeps splitting a list into two until all the parts have a length of 1. We will do that recursively. Once we get lists of length 1, we call the merge function explained in the previous step.", "We can now build our way towards the top by merging sorted lists. The end result is the original list sorted in ascending order.", "The following figure illustrates how merge sort algorithm works.", "To be more accurate, it is better to show merge function calls from down to bottom because it is called recursively. I have created the figure in this way for demonstration purposes.", "Here is the python code for merge sort algorithm.", "The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log(n)). The n comes from the merging part and log(b) comes from the splitting in half part.", "We have covered three essential sorting algorithms used in computer science. The merge sort is a better choice in term of the time complexity.", "When designing an algorithm, one should consider both time and space complexities as well as successively completing the given task.", "Practicing and learning the commonly used algorithms will definitely help you gain experience in designing algorithms. You will also have a chance to have a mind exercise.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
