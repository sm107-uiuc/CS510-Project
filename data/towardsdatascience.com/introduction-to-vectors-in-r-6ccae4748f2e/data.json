They are a simple tool to store data. For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.", "In R, you create a vector with the combine function c() . You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses. For example:", "Once you have created these vectors in R, you can use them to do calculations.", "Create a vector that contains the three elements: TRUE , FALSE , and TRUE (in that order)", "After a week in Vegas, you still aren\u2019t rolling in dough. So, you decide to start using your new data analysis skills.", "Before doing an analysis first, you decide to collect the outcomes for the last week:", "You only played poker and roulette. Assign the winnings/losses to variables.", "As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data being used. Thus, understanding what each element refers to is essential.", "In the previous exercise, we created a vector with your winnings over the week. Each vector element refers to a day of the week, but it is hard to tell which element belongs to which day.", "To show that in the vector itself by giving a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function. Here\u2019s an example:", "This code first creates a vector some_vector and then gives the two elements a name. The first element is assigned the name Name , while the second element is labeled Profession . Printing the contents to the console yields the following output:", "Name the elements of your poker and roulette vector from the previous exercise with the days of the week.", "In the previous exercise, it may have been boring and frustrating to type and retype information such as the days of the week. There is a more efficient way to do this, namely, to assign the days of the week vector to a variable.", "Just like you did with the poker and roulette returns, you can also create a variable that contains the days of the week. This way, you can use and re-use it.", "Create a vector that contains the days of the week. Use this vector to set the names of your poker and roulette vectors. You will get the same output as you did from the previous exercise.", "Now that you have the poker and roulette returns names, you can starting some data analysis.", "You want to find out the following type of information:", "To get the answers, you have to do arithmetic calculations on vectors.", "If you sum two vectors in R, it takes the element-wise sum. For example, the following three statements are completely equivalent:", "You can also do the calculations with variables that represent vectors:", "The overall daily profit is the sum of the profit/loss realized on poker per day, and the profit/loss realized on roulette per day.", "Assign to a variable how much you won/lost on each day in total (poker and roulette combined).", "Based on the previous analysis, it looks like you had a mix of good and bad days. Is there a change you may have lost money over the week in total?", "To answer this question, use the function sum() . It calculates the sum of all elements of a vector. For example, to calculate the total amount of money you have lost/won with poker:", "Calculate the total amount of money you have won/lost with roulette.", "After you have the totals for roulette and poker, calculate the sum of all gains/losses of the week.", "It looks like you are losing money.

You did have a couple of \u201cvacation\u201d drinks at the end of the week\u2026", "To investigate this, you will only focus on a selection of the total_vector . In other words, our goal is to select specific elements of the vector. To select elements of the vector, you can use square brackets (the same is true for matrices, data frames, \u2026). Between the square brackets, indicate what element to select. For example, to select the first element of the vector, you use poker_vector[1] . To select the second element, use poker_vector[2] , and so on for the remaining elements. Notice that the first element has index 1, not 0 (as in many other programming languages).", "To select multiple elements from a vector, indicate which elements should be selected using a vector within the square brackets. For example, to select the first and fifth day of the week, use the vector c(1,5) between the square brackets. poker_vector[c(1,5)] will give the first and fifth element of poker_vector .", "Another way to do this is the define the selection vector as a range. That is, c(2,3,4) can be abbreviated to 2:4 . We can then use poker_vector[2:4] to find the mid-week results.", "You can also select elements using the names of the vector elements (e.g. Monday, Tuesday,\u2026) instead of their numeric positions. For example, poker_vector[\"Monday\"] will select the element with the name \"Monday\" . This is the first element of poker_vector since \"Monday\" is the name of the first element.", "Assign the poker results of Wednesday to a variable.", "Assign the poker results of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to a variable.", "The (logical) comparison operators known to R are:", "We can use these comparison operators on vectors. For example,", "This command tests for every element of the vector if the condition stated by the comparison operators is TRUE or FALSE . In the example, this checks if each element of the vector is greater than 5.", "Check which elements in the poker vector are positive (i.e. >0) .", "Working with comparisons will make your data analysis easier. Instead of selecting a subset of days to investigate yourself (like before, where you selected between Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday), you can simply ask R to return only those days where you realized a positive return for poker.", "Using selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0 , you can find the days on which you had a positive poker return. Suppose you would like to know not only the days on which you won, but also how much you won on those days.", "You can select the desired elements, by putting selection_vector between the square brackets that follow poker_vector :", "R knows what to do when you pass a logical vector in square brackets: it will only select the elements that correspond to TRUE in selection_vector .", "Assign the amounts that you won on the profitable poker days to a variable.", "Just like you did for poker, determine which days you realized a positive return for roulette.
