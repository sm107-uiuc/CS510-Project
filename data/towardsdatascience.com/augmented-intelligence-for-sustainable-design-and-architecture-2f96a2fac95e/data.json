It is one of the least digitized industries and the world\u2019s leading producer of C02 emissions. With rising temperatures around the globe and mass migration to urban centers, there is a dire need for a digital disruption that will enable more sustainable ways of working.", "We as architects can learn from other fields that have made rapid strides in developing synergistic human-machine systems which exploit the positive aspects of human and AI-generated reasoning.", "Over the past year, a number of AI tools have been developed that provide new insights into the environmental impact and performance of a design. Despite their great potential, several barriers to widespread adoption exist:", "At Digital Blue Foam (DBF) we develop new solutions to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to better and more sustainable cities. We are designers and technologists with a strong sense of responsibility to drive a desperately needed revolution in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries towards carbon-negative projects.", "At the dawn of a new age of design, several fundamental questions remain:", "2019 was a prolific year for new Machine Learning (ML) applications . ML, the machine\u2019s ability to infer outputs from structured, or, in the case of Deep Learning, unstructured data, has garnered massive hype and hysteria. This has led to the common misconception that if we collect and process enough data using the latest algorithms and computing power, intelligence will simply emerge. This is simply not the case.", "Using a strategy of correlation rather than causation, ML identifies patterns incredibly fast, especially when the input data is well-structured. This is why it is so effective at playing video games like Flappy Bird. In most video games, rules and goals are consistent; unlike the real world, where the pattern will always stay the same. But what happens when the situation changes?", "\u2018Causal\u2019 intelligence is the basis of human smarts. While humans recognize patterns comparatively poorly, we excel at reapplying our past knowledge to new situations. So when Flappy Bird 2 gets released, we know it will have mostly the same rules and goals as the original, and we adapt quickly. Our AI, on the other hand, did not understand anything; it only followed a pattern. When the pattern is altered, the AI becomes useless.", "Digital Blue Foam has developed a tool that can steer the AEC industry around a major bottleneck. Architects spend a lot of time learning and using inefficient drafting tools that actually distract them from their essential role of creating and experimenting with design options that cater to the plethora of needs of the site and project, be they social, environmental, or economic. Our tool uses augmented intelligence to free architects from this hassle and aid them in generating design, through the augmentation of the time-tested method of sketching.", "We at DBF are major proponents of augmented intelligence\u2019 as opposed to black-box AI. In this paradigm, AI becomes a tool to enhance human intelligence rather than replace it. While sophisticated AI systems are able to make decisions after analyzing patterns in \u2018big data,\u2019 they are only as good as the data humans give them.", "Augmented intelligence is already embedded within many well-known products. It is particularly evident in word-processing applications: MS Word\u2019s spell-checker, the Hemmingway Editor, and Grammarly (an online grammar checker) are a few everyday examples of augmented intelligence. The \u2018design ideas\u2019 feature in Powerpoint, which uses augmented intelligence to help non-designers improve their layouts, is another example.", "In our software, the user designs with the computer, using a pen interface. What ensues is something others have described as human-in-the-loop augmented intelligence with human-computer collaboration (Zheng, 2017).", "The manual design approach stems from intuition, experience and logic. It is able to suggest solutions to complex problems, such as fitting different types of buildings in different parts of oddly-shaped plots.", "A computational strategy has the ability to quickly generate solutions that follow a predefined logic. The nature of this approach is perfect for iterative tasks such as generating rule-based solutions and performing calculations and analysis.", "An augmented intelligence (AI) approach combines the merits of the previous two strategies. It comprehends the designer intent, in this case through lines or nodes and applies rule-sets to generate highly- nuanced solutions", "In less technical terms this means that as the designer sketches and the computer interprets the drawing as an input to constrain the generation of a new design. In turn, the designer observes what the computer generates. They can then sketch over top to edit the result, providing new input. By repeating this process, new solutions emerge which neither machine nor human could have imagined.", "Steve Jobs was a huge advocate of augmented intelligence and this approach is responsible for much of the success of Apple products. In a 1994 Rolling Stone article, the visionary Jobs remarked: \u201cTechnology is nothing. What\u2019s important is that you have a faith in people, that they\u2019re basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they\u2019ll do wonderful things with them\u201d.", "Augmented intelligence is not a new concept but deserves more attention as we work out how to apply all of the amazing capabilities AI affords us. To address the existential crisis of the AEC industry, we must extend our definition of augmented intelligence and harness the true potential of AI: the sensitivity of designer intuition and the brute force of machine intelligence, combined.", "Your home for data science.
