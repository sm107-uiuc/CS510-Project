Unless the project is yours, you won\u2019t ever know about its existence. Research is not only about having ideas and writing scientific articles. Research is about sharing those ideas, is about solving the everyday problems and aiming towards a better world and an inspiring future.", "Over the past two weeks, I embraced this mission of putting a Deep Learning project into production and share it with the world. This project is a model to map regions affected by wildfires on a daily basis, using satellite images. How difficult can it be to put in production? Well, there are some considerations to keep in mind.", "As I mentioned above, this project consists of a model to generate daily maps of regions burned by wildfires using satellite images as inputs. The research led to the publication of a scientific paper that I describe in the following two stories in case you are interested to find more details about the topic.", "Any model needs some input data to generate the outputs. In my case, the input data \u2014 the daily satellite images \u2014 need to be downloaded from a web server. This consists of using an API to make requests, wait for the requests to be processed and finally download the images. It\u2019s very easy when everything goes well but often there are unexpected problems.", "To make the request/download process work robustly I had to write a Python package to manage the download process with features including:", "It is time-consuming to test and debug all this code but a necessity when moving to production. The process needs to be as reliable as possible and requiring the least human intervention.", "Fortunately, this step is more straight forward as the preprocessing functions used during research to prepare the data can be used. However, there are often some modifications required:", "After the preprocessing of the data, it\u2019s time to load the model, generate the predictions and save the results. The results, however, need to be saved in a format that is friendly to the website. In my case this led to some additional steps:", "The data can then be added to a database. I opted for using PostGIS that can handle geographical data types such as polygons and rasters.", "In practice, I\u2019m running the download and preprocessing steps on a Google Cloud Platform virtual machine. To reduce costs the instance is only turned on once every day to compute the outputs and send them to the server where the website is hosted.", "Django is a web framework for rapid development using Python. The problem is, two weeks ago I didn\u2019t know how to use it. I read about it before but I never found the right opportunity to use it. I figured it could be a good and useful challenge. After all, learning is fun! Or at least it is fun after you finally understand how things work. The learning process was something like this:", "This is a process characterized by a lot of Google searches, an unreasonable amount of open tabs in the browser, and patience \u2014 a lot of it.", "The good thing is that the most I learn the more I realise the potential Django brings. Over time, the progress starts to accelerate \u2014 climbing the learning curve!", "After having a working example I decided it was time to deploy it. I found this process quite more challenging than anticipated. Often, tutorials on YouTube only cover the development part and lack an explanation about the deploying process. It took me about three days just to make this step work. I had to figure out what are Nginx and Gunicorn and how to make everything work. But well, like in everything, when the task is more challenging is when we learn the most.", "Enough talk! Let me show you the webpage (meteo-ai.com) and describe the main functionality.", "Being able to aggregate all this information in a visual and dynamical form is quite useful for monitoring and studying the fires.", "There are webpages showing a similar type of information, however, the burned areas produced by this Deep Learning model are state-of-the-art for this type of product. By analysing the spatio-temporal correlations in sequences of input images with 3D convolutions and an LSTM layer, the trained model is very good at identifying burned regions and determining at which day the pixel burned \u2014 with particular emphasis for the latter.", "Not at all. There are many aspects to improve in the current state of the website. Furthermore, there are many more research paths to further explore in the burned areas field. One hot topic is higher resolution (30m pixel size or less) burned area maps using publicly available satellite images. The high spatial resolution trades off with less frequent images. This is a problem I\u2019m working on. Working with such big volumes of data is a challenge by itself! I will make sure to write about the results in the future.", "Maybe this is just the beginning.", "Thanks for reading! Have a great day!", "Your home for data science.
