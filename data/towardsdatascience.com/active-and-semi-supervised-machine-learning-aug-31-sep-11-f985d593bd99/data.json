What follows are some personal favourites rather than an exhaustive list, separated into two parts: Active Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning.", "Explainable AI is a big thing nowadays. In ALEX: Active Learning based Enhancement of a Model\u2019s Explainability, the authors use a novel kind of query strategy: prioritization of instances that are \u201cdifficult to explain\u201d. (They use the SHAP framework to determine the latter.) Their goal is to arrive at a classifier that is optimized for both its performance and the model\u2019s explainability, and at least on MNIST, the authors manage to succeed on both accounts:", "Now, this is not a criticism by any means, but unlike the majority of preprints on machine learning topics that I see, this paper was written in full-on academic style. Kind of like back when I was a physicist, when everything that could have been turned into a mathematical statement, was. To give you a small example of what I mean:", "\u201cThe error in this parametric approximation, \u03b8 (of the true functional dependence, \u03b8), is expected to be smaller with increasing number of pairs in the training set, M, i.e., \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 as M \u2192 \u221e.\u201d", "Or in other words: the more training samples, the better the model generalizes. Anyway, I just found it funny that when I first started reading ML papers instead of physics ones, what I perceived as their lack of rigour used to frustrate me, whereas now I am more likely to take note of the opposite. How people change!", "Let us say that instead of simply querying you to label the data of its choice, an active learning system asks you to either validate or correct the model\u2019s predictions. Which AI would you, as a subjective human being, trust more, the one that you had no say in, or the one that got your feedback throughout its training? According to the study presented in Soliciting Human-in-the-Loop User Feedback for Interactive Machine Learning Reduces User Trust and Impressions of Model Accuracy (I suppose the title already gave the answer away), a typical human-in-the-loop places less trust in the performance of the model, regardless of whether their feedback improved its performance or not.", "Come to think of it, this makes sense: the person that gets to correct the model\u2019s predictions (especially ones with low confidence scores) sees the model at its worse, hence the loss of faith.", "The problem of needing large quantities of training data is even more acute in hyperspectral imaging. To put it simply, the higher the dimensionality of the inputs, the larger the model, the more data you need to train it. An interesting active learning method is proposed in Active Deep Densely Connected Convolutional Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification:", "Here the query strategy is based on the predicted loss value.", "Lifelong, or continual, learning is not just something that we should all be doing in some shape or form, but also a subfield of AI. The idea is that a model in production will likely need to be kept up-to-date by being fine-tuned on new data \u2014 continuously, as the latter becomes available. However, accumulating all of the training data from the start and constantly re-training on the whole set is not the most practical thing to do. The challenge is to adjust to the new reality (where reality=data) without forgetting what has been learned before. If you are used to the standard model training protocols, you can probably see why this would pose a problem: once you re-train your network on a new dataset, its memories of the old one are worth as much as the goldfish\u2019s. A few of the techniques to combat what is known as \u201ccatastrophic forgetting\u201d are reviewed in the recent preprint A Wholistic View of Continual Learning with Deep Neural Networks: Forgotten Lessons and the Bridge to Active and Open World Learning:", "The authors argue that, although active learning can be seen as aiming to do the reverse of continual learning (choosing data for future inclusion as opposed to preserving the learned representations in the face of new data), there are bridges to be built between the two fields.", "Here is a fun one, Accelerating engineering design by automatic selection of simulation cases through Pool-Based Active Learning:", "Apparently, the design process of off-shore oil risers involves running a ton of simulations of sea currents and waves. And, to quote the preprint\u2019s authors,", "Many of these combinations may be redundant because the mechanical tensions in the riser of many of these simulations can be estimated from the results of other simulations. ... The challenge here lies in finding the most informative cases \u2026 .", "Naturally, this makes oil riser design a great candidate for active learning! Unlike the more familiar applications in computer vision and NLP, here the unlabelled data corresponds to the pool of simulations yet-to-be run, whereas labelling a training instance amounts to running a simulation (an expensive operation that engineers would like to avoid, if possible).", "Some other honorable mentions go out to:", "One of the fields where data annotation comes at great expense is medicine. The next preprint on our list focuses on Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Unlabeled Data and Knowledge Distillation.", "Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition caused by diabetes, but the ideas in the paper readily apply to any image classification problem. Knowledge distillation is an approach that involves transferring, well, knowledge from one model (the teacher) to another (the student, often a smaller network). The teacher is trained in a regular supervised fashion, and afterwards the soft labels (the teacher\u2019s outputs for the training set) are used as labels to train the student on. The gist of the preprint is that in addition to the labeled set, you can also use the teacher\u2019s soft labels for the unlabelled images in the distillation process, and end up with a better model as a result.", "Before you go, here are two more preprints on the applications of semi-supervised deep learning to the medical domain:", "See you in a week (or two)!", "Your home for data science.
