But we don\u2019t want to waste time exploring every separate piece of info such as release dates, popularity, reviews or the average ratings on Google, IMDb, TMDb, or Rotten Tomatoes.", "For hotheads who want to get this info ASAP, I wrote some code to load movie info which can give a quick analysis of its reviews just by inputting the title. FYI, I used TMDb\u2019s API for writing code.", "You MUST examine the site\u2019s \u2018robots.txt\u2019 file to determine whether or not the site allows its content to be scraped. To find the robots.txt file for a given web site, type in the base URL and add \u201c/robots.txt\u201d.", "For example, if we wanted to scrape some data from google.com, type in https://www.google.com/robots.txt in the URL box.", "For example, I typed https://www.imdb.com/robots.txt to check API availability from IMDb, but it seemed to be unavailable.", "Luckily, The Movie Database (TMDb) offers open API on their website, so I chose TMDb API in order to write the code.", "First, I installed all modules for writing the code including tmdbsimple module to use TMDb data. This module is a wrapper for TMDb API.", "Set tmdb.Search() module and then input whatever movie title you want to search.", "I searched for \u201cParasite\u201d and left the year blank.", "I extracted title, id, popularity, release date data and inputted these data into Moive_info list. After that, I converted Movie_info list into Pandas DataFrame.", "Among the data, id is a unique value, so it can distinguish data from the same or similar ones. For example, there are so many titles that contain \u201cparasite\u201d in the table above. Even though these movies were released on different dates, people might be confused if they only have the title information. However, if they have the movie id, it means they have unique information about each movie. Therefore, they can get only the information that they want to get. If they use titles to search movie reviews, the results would be messed up with reviews from other movies that have the same or similar titles.", "Since URLs generally contain the id number to create web address for each movie, we need this unique value to get the movie reviews page. For example, I used the id \u2018496243\u2019, from the table above, to get the web page of Parasite on TMDb.", "After getting the API link, I used the requests.get module to request the HTTP. <Response [200]> means it worked well. And then I got a data frame that contains the \u201cParasite\u201d movie review by parsing the API URL. It seems like there are five reviews for \u201cParasite\u201d on TMDb.", "After that, I extracted the \u201cresults\u201d column which contains the reviews, author, content, and so on.", "Tokenization is a way of text cleaning. Split a segment of text into smaller sub-segments \u2014 Oftentimes, it\u2019s down to the level of individual words, i.e., each distinct word becomes a \u2018token\u2019, and all further instances of a word or phrase are assigned the same token value.", "Input reviews into the word_tokenize module from the NLTK library to tokenize sentences, and then print the tokens created by the tokenizer.", "Stopwords are commonly occurring words that usually do not convey substantive meaning as a noun or verb. Some examples: \u2018a\u2019, \u2018an\u2019, \u2018the\u2019, \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, etc. Stop words are often discarded / ignored during text mining.", "Get words from the list \u2018tokens\u2019 which are not included in English stopwords, and then put the extracted words into the list \u2018word_list\u2019.", "I used the Afinn library which is the emotion analysis library showing positive and negative levels of English words as integers from -5 to +5. When scoring sentences, all the words in the sentence are calculated. This is a really simple library, but it is used most for sentiment analysis.", "I converted the list form as string by using the join function. The join function converts a list to a string containing specific delimiters. After that, put the strings into the Afinn library to get sentiment scores.", "As for the results, each review has 7.0, 30.0, 1.0, 26.0, 41.0 as its total scores. For example, the first review has many words from the whole sentences \u2014 [\u2018What, makes, Parasite, satisfying, commits, neither, error, \u2026\u2026.. It, Film, Festival, reviews\u2019]. The final score of 7.0 is the sum of the scores of each word.", "This time, I tried to analyze the same strings in a different way: Using the EmoLex library with the NRC dictionary. The NRC data is available here for non-commercial research use.", "After that, I converted all text to lower case for consistency.", "And then, I matched strings from \u201cParasite\u201d movie reviews with the emotional texts from the NRC dictionary to get sentiment scores.", "Now we found the reviews of \u201cParasite\u201d are positive overall. I generated very simple code for emotion analysis, and in the next post I will analyze more reviews through data cleansing and regular expressions.", "In general, the goal of sentiment analysis is to analyze the opinions of news reports, movies, social media postings such as Tweets, Instagram posts, and etc to lead consumers to make rational decisions. For example, the results from analyzing reviews of \u201cParasite\u201d can make people decide whether they are going to watch this movie.", "Sentiment analysis is a topic that everybody currently wants to talk about since people know that feelings always precede decisions. In other words, an immersion into the sentiment analysis has kicked off with people who want to see contemporary trends easily.", "Analyze sentiment from the topics that you are eager to know more. If you do so, you will get the latest trends about your interests before anyone else.", "Your home for data science.
