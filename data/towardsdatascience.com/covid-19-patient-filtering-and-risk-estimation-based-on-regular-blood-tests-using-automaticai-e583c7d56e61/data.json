Finding new habitable planets and leaving Earth is not a solution, but its just a coward act of survival. We have plenty of more practical problems that needs to be solved, like hunger, pollution, global warming and now COVID-19. We should focus on helping our people, people living in the present who needs help now. Start locally, don\u2019t rush to change the whole world if you cannot even help yourself or your family.", "In these hard days, there are lots of local heroes, who are doing their best in order to fight against COVID-19, to help doctors in their daily job and to save as many lives as possible, by offering free services like grocery shopping for the elders, transporting goods, or even tailoring home made masks. We should thank them for their efforts in these dangerous days.", "I would like to emphasize one particular story of altruism shown by a team of developers from Cluj-Napoca. Its the story of a start-up, a little company called Spectro.Life, a company dedicated to help people suffering of diabetes by using IoT solutions combined with Artificial Intelligence.", "Small rain lays great dust, even if this is a start-up with very little income, in no time they\u2019ve change their solution of diabetes monitoring into a COVID-19 monitoring app, this way helping doctors to monitor infected people, 24/7, remotely. The app is totally free, further more, they are offering free sensors and smart watches to people who cannot afford those kind of gadgets. Actually they emptied their pockets to help us, to help fighting this pandemic. They are real life heroes, we should follow their lead, everybody can be a hero, everybody can help, heroism is a choice not a privilege. You can find more information about this project in the international press release and on their home page.", "To contribute to the fight against the Coronavirus, in this article I would like to present a possible way of using Artificial Intelligence to fight against COVID-19. This is just an idea, a starting point and not a final solution, but it can be further developed in order to create a more reliable solution.", "To control the spread of the Coronavirus it is very important to identify those who has been already infected by this new type of virus. In order to detect this virus, the golden standard is the rRT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) testing. But there is a catch, this kind of test is time consuming, laborious manual process and it is very short in supply. So the question is, can we come up with an alternative way to filter out healthy people and evaluate the risk of infection, this way reducing the number of COVID-19 tests required. Furthermore, we would like to create an automatic filtering algorithm, so doctors won\u2019t waste their time in evaluating and choosing the patients who need to be further tested and evaluated.", "In the next sections we will present a preliminary patient filtering algorithm based on regular blood test results. To select the best matching AI model and tune its hyperparameters we used AutomaticAI.", "AutomaticAI is a general purpose algorithm, which can be used in any kind of classification or prediction problem and it will automatically adjust itself and select the best matching algorithm based on the input data. By combining this algorithm with some preprocessing and maybe some feature extraction steps, we can solve almost any kind of classification (or regression) problem with fairly high scores (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).", "Its similar to Auto-Sklearn or Auto-Weka, the main difference is that AutomaticAI uses Swarm Intelligence combined with Simulated Annealing to find the best matching model and to tune its hyperparameters as fast as possible.", "The PyPi library can be installed from here, using the pip install AutomaticAI command. The source code of the algorithm can be found here.", "This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at Sao Paulo, Brazil. All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation. Dates have been omitted and the information on the patient\u2019s sex has been coded.", "This contains data about more than 5000 patients and it has over 100 features for each patient. Between features it contains the results of regular blood tests, with attributes like Leukocytes, Mematocrit, Hemoglobin, Platelets, Mean platelet volume, etc. Besides the regular blood test values, it also contains the results of different tests for viruses (different than Coronavirus) like Respiratory Syncytial Virus, InfluenzaA, Influenza B, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, etc.", "The only problem with this dataset is that it contains lots of missing data. So the first preprocessing step is to remove all the rows where the blood tests are completely missing. There are multiple columns which are not relevant for our problem, so we will also remove the irrelevant columns. Furthermore, will will keep only the columns with no more than 70% of missing data.", "The resulted dataset is highly imbalanced, with more than 500 negative examples and only a few positive examples, as you can see in the following diagram:", "To handle this problem, we used the XAI library from the EthicalML for oversampling. After running the oversampling algorithm with a rate of 0.4 we got the following result:", "We don\u2019t want to run the oversampling with a higher rate, because that would lead to overfitting.", "The next step is to separate the independent and the dependent variable, so separate the labels from the features. Because the AutomaticAI cannot work with strings as a label, we transformed the \u201cpositive\u201d values to 1 and the \u201cnegative\u201d values to 0.", "Before running the AutomaticAI algorithm we wanted to be sure that there are no more missing data in the training data, so we ran over the data once again and filled in all the missing data with the mean value of that specific feature.", "The next step is to split the data into training and test set.", "The next step is to run the AutomaticAI algorithm to find the best model for our data and to automatically tune its hyperparameters.", "After running this algorithm, the selected model is the RandomForestClassifier with an f1-score of 95%, which is a really impressive result.", "To evaluate our model, we plotted the confusion matrix.", "The resulted confusion matrix can be seen in the following picture. As we can clearly see, the results are very good, the model made only 6 mistakes compared to the 213 correct results.", "Besides the classification result (0 for negative and 1 for positive) the model also returns a value between 0 and 1, which represents the confidence of the classification result. This confidence value can be used for risk estimation. If the classification result is positive and the confidence is high, this means that there is a high chance that the patient is infected by the Coronavirus so further investigation is necessary. If the result is negative, than the patient is healthy so we don\u2019t need to waste COVID-19 tests on healthy patients. This can reduce the number of the required COVID-19 tests and help doctors to automatically filter out the patients that are in danger and needs medical attention.", "The medical field, requires high level of accountability, and thus transparency, which means we need to be able to explain machine decisions, predictions and justify their reliability.", "In order to explain the results of the best model, which is the RandomForestClassifier, we used feature importance. Feature importance can be calculated using the XAI library as follows:", "This will generate a diagram like in the following picture:", "As we expected the most important feature is the Leukocytes or or white blood cells (WBC) count. Having a higher or lower number of WBCs than normal may indicate an underlying condition. A WBC count can detect hidden infections within your body and alert doctors to undiagnosed medical conditions. There are five major types of white blood cells: neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, onocytes and basophils. Because high basophilis is not related to virus, bacteria or other type of infections, but it is a usual sign of Hypothyroidism, in the feature importance diagram it appears very low. A high number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytesor eosinophils it\u2019s a usual sign of viral infections, so, as we may expect, they have a much higher importance value in the diagram.", "The second most important feature is the Platelets. Platelets are the cells that circulate within our blood and bind together when they recognize damaged blood vessels. Excess platelets are due to an infection or other condition. Usually the platelets count is evaluated in combination with the mean platelet volume (MPV), which is also an important feature as shown in the picture. A low platelet count along with high MPV occurs when platelets are destroyed, usually by antibodies, an infection, or toxins.", "Even if the patient has symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, high blood pressure, confusion or vomiting, if the level of Creatine is high, it\u2019s the sign of kidney failure or diabetes, so it is not caused by Coronavirus. This is the reason why Creatine has also a high score in the feature importance diagram (it is used to exclude Coronavirus).", "The other features like Direct of Indirect Bilirubin, Potassium, etc. are also used by the model to exclude COVID-19 infections, so these features will decrease the risk of Coronavirus infections.", "In this article we presented a possible solution for COVID-19 preliminary patient filtering and risk estimation using Artificial Intelligence.", "The best AI model was automatically chosen by the AutomaticAI library and by using some preprocessing steps like handling missing and imbalanced data, the selected model has obtained really impressive results.", "In order to increase the trustworthiness of this algorithm we used the XAI library to explain the results using a feature importance diagram.", "The dataset and the whole code can be found in the following git repository: COVID-19-patient-filtering-using-AutomaticAI.", "Thank you for reading this article!
