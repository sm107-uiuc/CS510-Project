We quit a well-paying consulting job to pursue a career in the field of data science. When we started our journey as students, we were honestly overwhelmed and unsure of how to kick start the learning process. As a continually evolving field, there are a lot of many contents/platforms available on the internet. When there are so many things possible already, a person would naturally find it hard to find a perfect start, and we faced the same issue for the first 2 months of our first quarter.", "When we look for content online, most of them focused on Machine Learning algorithms, NLP concepts, and it seemed super exciting in the beginning. Besides, when we got to know about the significance of Python and its in-built libraries, we were super fascinated about our career choice. However, as a beginner, we faced so much confusion, which we will be discussing in this blog. This post is intentionally targeted towards novice candidates, and we shall try to detail every single point that should be taken care of, to build a solid foundation in this stream.", "It\u2019s an incredibly challenging field and requires sheer knowledge of Statistics, to understand the underlying concepts. ML seems fascinating, and Python does most of your job right, then why learn Statistics? This is where our first myth about the data science got busted. We came across various posts/projects targeting to tackle problems by focusing most of their energies towards building models and conclude that it performs accurately for the given use cases!! This is where most of us go wrong. Are you still confused, don\u2019t worry! Allow us to elaborate this by considering a classic text classification problem; our first data science project, taught us a lot about the things that we never anticipated to encounter during our learning phase.", "PREDICTING MISINFORMATION ON TWITTER DURING THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC", "Ah! The Twitter, infamously known as the goldmine for data science projects. But what projects should we take up with Twitter? When we looked for a couple of projects on GitHub to get an idea, we found most of them inclined towards sentiment analysis. Wait, are we gonna perform sentiment analysis? Choosing a project topic to work on was the first and foremost challenge that we faced as a starter.", "TIP 1 : A complicated project to work on in the beginning is a serious no no. Keep yourselves grounded! one baby step at a time!", "Like others, we were too driven in the beginning and wanted to do a complicated project. However, we realized this is not the right approach. We wanted to first get our basics right, and after days of brainstorming, we finalized a couple of interesting topics. Finally, we decided to go with misinformation analysis on twitter related to antiviral medications, disinfectants, and coronavirus precautions. Moreover, the motive behind the selection of this subject matter was to understand the math behind implementing solutions, to diminish harmful content on Twitter.", "HOW DID WE APPROACH THE PROBLEM?", "The major mistake most newcomers like us make during the project is jumping straight away to the type of ML algorithms to be used for the project!", "TIP 2: Control your adrenaline rush! Look at the problem first. Please do not overlook the data engineering part. Analyze the problem statement and see if it\u2019s still doable at your current knowledge level.", "Thanks for making this far. From here on, we will explain the step-by-step approach, which we took to tackle this problem.", "STEP 1: GET THE TWITTER DEVELOPER ACCOUNT ACCESS", "In order to work with twitter data, we need a twitter developer account. This will provide us the authorization to fetch tweets through TweePy. But, how did we create a twitter developer account?", "a. Login to the developer account and click \u201cCreate an app\u201d .", "b. A pop up will appear. Click \u2018Apply\u2019 and choose the relevant option from the below dashboard.", "c. Fill required details and get the access keys and tokens", "Woohoo!!! the first step is now complete. Once you get the access make sure to click on \u201cKeys and tokens\u201d tab and copy the tokens provided. It will be further used to access the REST API through TweePy.", "STEP 2: DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE", "We are scraping the tweets using the REST API through TweePy. Going forward in the post, we assume all of our readers already have good hands-on experience in Python. If not, we highly recommend visiting any free online classes for Python to get yourself familiar with the syntax of the language.", "Once you\u2019ve received your tokens and keys from Twitter and installed TweePy, you can begin pulling data through Twitter API. You can find the different data fields available through Twitter Standard API search fields .", "Tip 3: Never ever aim to write a script to simply accomplish your task. Optimize it to perform multiple operations. The below snippet does both fetching and cleaning part of the pipeline in one shot. Coding is an art! Practice Until you get it right!", "First and foremost, let us import the required libraries:", "Use the below script to add your own personalized tokes, once your application is approved.", "As discussed earlier, now its time for us to start pulling the data from the Twitter API.", "We are using the query string to add whatever hashtag, keyword, key phrase, or handle we are looking for (for example query = \u201c#hydroxychloroquine\u201d ) and then add number of tweets you want to fetch using the .items() feature.", "In the script above, Text Blob will categorize our texts to positive, negative, and neutral labels (based on polarity). But, why are we using NLTK then? The sole purpose of using both the libraries is to understand how each of the package contributes to text processing in its own ways. Furthermore, we also highly recommend to browse through SpaCy, which is an open-source software library for advanced NLP.", "In addition, we can set the custom date filter (since and until parameters) to query the tweets within the given date range. Before executing this script, make sure to add your file path to store the raw and clean datasets.", "However, please keep in mind that the Twitter Standard API search only goes back until 7 days from the current date. In addition, count parameter refers to rate limit and please keep it as is which is 450.", "Apart from downloading the historical tweets, which we implemented above, we can also download real time tweets using the streaming API. Please check out the Twitter developer handbook for more information.", "STEP 3: ANALYZE AND UNDERSTAND HOW CAN WE APPLY THE CLASSIFICATION APPROACH", "Text classification is a supervised learning problem, which categorizes text/tokens into the organized groups, with the help of Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing. Click here for more details. In addition, the basics of sentiment analysis can be found here.", "Below is the snapshot of our clean dataset post-processing:", "If you carefully observe the dataset, 2 new attributes are being added, which includes Sentiment and Polarity. What do they indicate? Well, we are assuming that you have already gone through the links that I have attached above, which helps you understand the classification approach basics.", "How do we use Machine Learning to classify these texts into positive, negative, and neutral labels? Before that, why are we even ranking them to the above-said labels? Since the TextBlob has already categorized the data as per the polarity, we will use this as a training dataset for our Machine Learning Classifier. The job of NLTK here is to remove stop words and break the sentence into tokens. These tokens will then go through the process of stemming or lemmatization.", "Tip 4: Please go through the links above, before reading below to get a good clarity about the subject matter.", "The first approach here is to find the tweets containing false claims/information and tag them to the negative label. But, isn\u2019t the TextBlob already doing that? Why go so far and use ML Classifier? This is a kind of introspection we were talking about in the beginning. Data science is just not about modeling and accuracy! There are so many aspects to it, which is unfortunately underplayed most of the time.", "Consider the example \u201cSun kills COVID-19\u201d. What do you think should be the label for this text? TextBlob will identify it as neutral, which is absolutely correct as it is predicting the sentiment here. However, our problem statement states that misinformation should be recognized as a negative label. Please don\u2019t get confused :) we are using TextBlob to reduce the burden of preparing the train datasets with tags. TextBlob, however, might not identify the labels rightly. That\u2019s totally okay for now, as we all are just stepping into the world of data science! So, as we go forward, we can create our own train data with the desired labels and test it for the various use cases!", "STEP 4: LETS APPLY THE MUCH AWAITED ML CLASSIFIERS TO TRAIN THE DATESET !", "Before applying the models, we are using the TF-IDF technique to assign weighting factor to the extracted tokens. The below snippet also splits the data into train and test. Moreover, we have about 76000 tweets in our train dataset.", "Don\u2019t you guys worry! we will also attach link to our GitHub repository, which will contain all the Python notebooks used in this project. Please focus now on getting the concepts right!", "Which ML model should we consider applying? We are using the popular Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression for classification. Please follow the link for more detail regarding the difference between these models.", "Post Training the dataset generated by TextBlob, we achieved 70% accuracy for the LR model and 66% accuracy for the NB model.", "When we feed the test dataset into the LR model, we found some very interesting insights!!", "Woah! Did you guys see that \u201cSun kills COVID-19\u201d has been correctly identified as negative?? While training the dataset, we had included the additional 300 data points, apart from the TextBlob generated data! This way, it has rightly labeled some misinformation texts as negative. However, the tweet \u201cLet\u2019s drink bleach\u201d is still neutral. This is interesting how our trained model has mismarked a few texts. This is where we have to start thinking as a data scientist. As highlighted earlier, we have just begun our journey. Accomplishing these steps as beginners is a commendable job in itself. Therefore, we highly recommend getting these concepts right. Plus, the scope for advanced thinking is always there once the foundations are strengthened!", "As discussed, here is the GitHub repository link for your reference!", "You can also email us for any questions or concerns:", "Your home for data science.
