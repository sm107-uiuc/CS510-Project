They give a numeric measure to the basic question of how \u201cclose\u201d or \u201cfar\u201d things are. There are many different methods to compute similarities such as cosine similarity, Pearson correlation coefficient and many more. In this article, I will discuss semantic similarity and its application in recommendation algorithms.", "Classic Collaboration Filtering (CF) recommenders are based on behavioral data. We collect user rating or usage behavior and create a \u201crating matrix\u201d from which we identify statistical patterns and compute behavioral similarity. Based on that similarity, the recommender predicts user behavior -> that is the recommendation.", "Behavioral similarity can result in surprising yet refreshing recommendations. An example of a real behavioral pattern that was identified by retailers showed that people that buy diapers often buy also beer. Now we need to ask: Do we want to recommend a beer to a customer that just ordered diapers? Does it align with the business\u2019s best interests? Does it \u201cMake sense\u201d?", "Complementing semantic similarity with the behavioral one can ensure that the CF recommender will produce recommendations that are aligned with the business's best interests and strategy. In a way, we can look at it as an ensemble of feature-based similarity which is used by content-based filtering recommendation and the behavioral similarity we compute in the item-item collaborative filtering algorithm, but with higher accuracy. The similarity computed in content-based filtering is based on a flat long list of features, yet semantic similarity is based on a much richer hierarchical data model (i.e., graph and ontology), so we can compute a much more sophisticated and accurate similarity that better aligns with the business strategies and interests.", "In this post, I will show how semantic similarity can be used in the context of recommendation by augmenting behavioral similarity with semantic so the recommendations will be better aligned with the business and the client's best interests.", "Semantic similarity is simple to explain but much more difficult to compute. Intuitively people think in terms of symbols and concepts, so when you ask someone how two real-life objects compare, the answer you get is conceptually a semantic similarity.", "Semantic similarity has context. When you ask if two objects are similar, you have to define the aspects of the objects you want to look at. For example, two products can be similar in price but very different in their features-set. Neighbors are similar in the geography of their home but might be very different with respect to their cultural background. With the context in mind, we can discuss \u201ceffective similarity\u201d which defines the context that is most effective for measuring similarity for a particular problem. An ontology that defines a data model for a specific domain is a great tool to look at objects with respect to a certain context. From a knowledge graph that contains the two objects we are interested in and that was designed based on the domain\u2019s ontology, we can compute the effective distance/similarity between two concepts for a particular use case.", "There is a lot of research in that domain of semantic similarity and many different approaches to how to compute it. The paper \u201cA Framework for Semantic Similarity Measures to enhance Knowledge Graph Quality\u201d has a summary of the most popular ones. For best performance in terms of accuracy and recall, it is best to combine multiple resource characteristics such as the hierarchy, neighbors, data attributes and specificity of shared information.  GADES, a neiGhborhood-bAseD graph Entity Similarity, is a semantic similarity computation method that combines several resource characteristics of entities from a knowledge graph.", "The first and most popular resource characteristic used to compute semantic similarity is a hierarchical similarity which measures how far are the object in the ontology hierarchical tree and how deep is their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) is. The intuition is that similar entities have a deep and close lowest common ancestor. There are two common methods to compute hierarchical distance. Both use the LCA and distance \u2018d\u2019 which is the number of hops between two nodes taking into account only rdfs:subClassOf and rdf:type relations (i.e. edges).", "There is no clear advantage to using one or the other and both are equally popular in semantic similarity frameworks.", "The similarity is simply the inverse of the distance or in other words:", "\u201cTell me your neighbors and I will tell you who you are\u201d. Neighborhood similarity measures the similarity between two entities based on the relations that define their neighborhoods.", "The neighborhood is the set of relation-entity pairs N(e) whose entities are at a one-hop distance of the source entity (e).", "For each neighbor, we need to consider both the neighbor entity (e) and the relation type of the edge (r) using the knowledge encoded in the relation and class hierarchies of the knowledge graph (i.e. the ontology)", "Let's call that a \u201cneighborhood-pair\u201d. p = (r ; e). As the neighborhood of an entity is a collection of neighborhood pairs, to compute the similarity of the neighborhoods of entities e1, and e2 we first need to know how to compare the similarity of two individual pairs: p1 = (r1; e1) and p2 = (r2; e2).", "Now that we know how to compute the similarity of neighborhood-pairs we can compute the similarity between the whole neighborhoods of two entities.  In order to aggregate the similarity between two neighborhoods, GADES combines pair comparisons using the metric.", "An alternative way to write the same computation is:", "The intuition here is that the more specific information is shared by two entities, the more similar we will consider them to be. Also, the more rare occurrence of a concept is the more specific it is considered to be.  Two entities are considered to share a lot of information if they are similarly used in a corpus. Considering the knowledge graph as a corpus, the information shared by two entities x and y is directly proportional to the number of entities that have x and y together in their neighborhood, i.e., the co-occurrences of x and y in the neighborhoods of the entities.", "Let's put that into a formula: First let's define: Incident(e) as the set of entities that have e in their neighborhood.", "With that we can compute the similarity:", "The denominator of this formula helps to decrease the similarity with respect to abstract or not informative entities that are common in the corpus and therefore are not considered specific.", "Entities in knowledge graphs are not only related to other entities but also with attributes through datatype properties, e.g., temperature, dates, etc. Those attributes can tell us a lot about the similarity of entities in a given context. For example, looking at the date of birth attribute can drive the similarity computation in the context of a long term investment recommendation.", "GADES considers only shared attributes, i.e., attributes connected to entities through the same datatype property (e.g., DateOfBirth is a shared attribute of all instances of entities of rdfs:subClassOf and rdf:type human).  Given that attributes can be compared with domain similarity measures, (e.g. cosine, manhattan, euclidean distance for vectors), GADES does not describe a specific measure to compare all kinds of attributes. Depending on the domain, experts will choose a similarity measure for each type of attribute.", "Each similarity described above is valuable on its own, but the power of GADES comes from combining all similarities into a single measure \u03b1.  GADES combines individual similarity measures to produce a similarity value using a combination of aggregation functions. The detailed definition of the different aggregation functions \u03b2 and \u03b3, and the triangular norm T that combines them are domain-specific.", "For example, in the context of the long term investment recommendation use case the domain expert might decide to amplify the attribute similarity as the age of the customer is the number one factor to consider so the coefficients of T express that.", "GADES is an academic paper which unfortunately does not have a commercial implementation. the following repository contains a java implementation.", "Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation algorithms use some sort of similarity function to predict the user behavior i.e. the recommendation. That can be a similarity between users\u2019 behavior or similarity between items in that they are liked or disliked in a similar pattern. Because the similarity is computed from the rating matrix it is behavioral by design and does not reflect the semantics of the items involved. Sometimes it is exactly what the business expects from the algorithm but in other cases ignoring semantics produces results that do not make sense or do not reflect the business's best interests. Complementing the behavioral similarity with semantic similarity and plugging it into the recommendation engine can improve its performance in that it will produce more effective results for the business and the customers.", "Item-Item CF looks for items that are similar to the ones that the user has already rated and recommend most similar items. Item-Item CR similarity (S) is behavioral i.e., is how people treat two items the same in terms of like and dislike. The prediction (i.e., the recommendation) is computed by taking a weighted average of the target user\u2019s ratings (V) on these similar items. In other words, to compute the prediction on item i for a user u we compute the sum of the ratings given by the user on the items similar to i. Each rating is weighted by the corresponding similarity si, j between items i and j. The prediction is calculated using the following formula:", "To learn more about the algorithm I recommend reading the original paper which is clear and easy to follow.  One of the benefits of the algorithm is that similarity computation is pluggable. The original paper suggests using Pearson-r correlation or Cosine similarity but it is open to any other similarity computation that makes sense. We propose using a combination of behavioral similarity extracted from the rating matrix together with semantic similarity extracted from a knowledge graph using GADES.", "User-User Collaborative filtering is maybe the most popular CF recommendation algorithm, maybe because its trivial to comprehend.  From the rating matrix, we find users that behave similarly to the target user in terms of likes and dislikes, then we take a weighted average of their ratings, sort them and use the top list as a recommendation.", "The issue here regarding semantic is that similarity is between user behavior and not between concepts that belong to the target domain, so out of the box, we cannot plug-in semantic similarity into the algorithm. To solve this problem we have to map the rating matrix into something which belongs to the target domain but still preserve user behavior. The paper Semantic-based Collaborative Filtering for Enhancing Recommendation suggests an approach for doing that. From the rating matrix, we create an interests matrix (IS) based on the semantic similarity and Spreading Activation Algorithm. IS(C j,u) and IS(C j,v) are the interest scores associated with the concept j in the profile of the user u and v, respectively. Now we cab compute similarity (or distance) and plug it in the user-user algorithm.", "I would like to highlight two results from several relevant academic papers.", "The following tables show Pearson\u2019s coefficient between state-of-the-art similarity measures and GADES with the gold standards ECC, Pfam, and SeqSim on CESSM 2008 and 2014.  We observe that GADES is the most correlated measure with respect to the three gold-standard measures in both versions of the knowledge graph, 2008 and 2014.", "The first step was to implement a python jupyter notebook of the item-item CF algorithm. The dataset we used for a sanity test was a collection of user ratings of movies from iMDB database. We implemented a simple semantic similarity based on genres, actors and directors and combined it with the behavioral similarity described above with a weight of 20%.", "We saw improvement in performance average precision: 0.935897, recall: 0.941935 but most importantly we saw that the recommended results shared a genres. In real-life this might not be what the business wants for movie recommendation engine but for other use cases such as product recommendation, such behavior is desired.", "Semantic similarity can be calculated efficiently from a knowledge graph using methods like GADES. Once computed, it can be used in many data science tasks. In this article, we showed how semantic similarity can be used in the context of recommendation by augmenting behavioral similarity with semantic so the recommendations will be better aligned with the business and the client's best interests.", "A Framework for Semantic Similarity Measures to enhance KnowledgeGraph Quality", "Your home for data science.
