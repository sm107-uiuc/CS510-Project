You shouldn\u2019t walk about without wearing a mask. You\u2019d better go home, and don\u2019t forget to wash your hands,\u201d the drone lectures her, according to a translation by China\u2019s state-owned Global Times.", "Facial recognition cameras are widely used in China, reports Aljazeera: an estimated 350 million surveillance devices are used at airports, underground train stations and in the streets. New technologies \u2014 including infrared temperature scanners that are used to help contain the spread of coronavirus \u2014 allow authorities to track, store and analyze citizens\u2019 travel histories as well as their medical condition.", "The noble goal, to fight the spread of the virus, makes government surveillance feel legitimate but concerns human rights activists.", "Some mobile apps that use data from the country\u2019s health and transport authorities can provide a list of people sitting near a patient suffering, or soon to be suffering, from the virus. Tell me who you are sitting with and I will tell you if you are about to get sick.", "Interestingly enough, in South Korea, the apps that help track cases and show where contaminated people have been were not created by the government, but by private software developers. Click a button labeled, \u201cSee whether I am safe\u201d at Coronamap.live, and you can see if there are any known cases of the fast-spreading virus in your vicinity.", "A friend of mine from Seoul told me that authorities use these apps to trace and disinfect the places where the virus could be caught by many people.", "There are also text messages alerting residents about confirmed cases in their area, telling them where suspected infected people have been, and when.", "AI health prediction has some history: in 2008, Google launched a service that tried to spot flu outbreaks using people\u2019s search queries. It was discovered later they actually did flag the 2009 swine flu pandemic about two weeks before US health officials did, although their approach was found to consistently overestimate the number of people who had caught the disease.", "Nowadays a lot of researchers and companies try to use AI to accurately predict the spread of disease. A Canadian firm, BlueDot, currently seems to be the most successful. According to information published in Vox, it uses tons of data to evaluate public health risks. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), it surfs through and analyzes about 100,000 articles in 65 languages daily to track over 100 infectious diseases. They were first \u2014 ahead of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 to notify their clients about the coronavirus outbreak, back in December 2019. For predicting the spread of disease, they also use data like traveler itinerary information, social media, and news reports.", "Johns Hopkins University has been using Twitter to gather real-time information about where illnesses occur. But this type of data is quite noisy.", "Other types of data that can be gathered and analyzed for predicting the spread of diseases are retail purchases, browsing patterns, and keywords in private messages.", "In comparison to doctors who can judge only by concrete symptoms, the machines are able to pick up signs that are hidden and that a human would not be able to notice.", "Other AI applications could be used for the purpose. The Telegraph UK reports, \u201cOne study found that Facebook statuses, analyzed by AI, were a \u201csignificant\u201d clue to individual people\u2019s medical conditions, finding that aggressive language (such as \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201cbitches\u201d helped predict drug addiction) and, oddly, that religious language (such as \u201cgod\u201d and \u201cpray\u201d) helped predict diabetes.\u201d", "I would not know what keywords in a Facebook status could point to the coronavirus, but it\u2019s easy to imagine that AI can at least analyze the number of mentions of coronaviruses to let the researchers know what and where a panic may occur.", "Deep learning \u2014 the same technology that powers face recognition and autonomous driving \u2014 can help to diagnose infected people faster. Beijing-based Infervision uses it for CT scan analysis. Usually, it takes a few hours for patients and doctors to get CT result, but AI helps to speed up the process of detection, and to monitor the disease more efficiently and effectively. Doctors still need to follow up with lab tests and other examinations, but saving time is crucial when a virus spreads so fast.", "The other use of AI is for drug discovery, which is proving to be very promising. With coronavirus, the researchers were able to sequence the gene of the new virus within weeks. Companies like Exscientia Ltd. work on creating drugs much faster than before. If previously it took years to develop a medicine, the algorithms can reduce the time to 12\u201318 months. It still might be too long for dealing with such pandemic as coronavirus, but it\u2019s worth trying.", "Startup Healx uses machine learning to find new uses for existing drugs. It doesn\u2019t tackle the coronavirus now but the ability of algorithms to search for compounds and predict new drugs will be definitely used for future outbreaks.", "There is a problem though: AI can\u2019t speed up clinical testing. It still might take years to prove the efficiency and safety of a drug, and for regulators to review the results of using it. So there is a new task for AI-based drug designers: to think ahead of time and predict the viruses that might cause the havoc of the world in the future.", "After he experienced the devastating earthquake that hit Japan on 11 March 2011, Akemi Tsunaga was inspired to create a chatbot called Bespoke: \u201cFrom my personal experiences of that disaster, I wanted to create a service that can assist people in the middle of any emergency. I empathize with people\u2019s fears and the need to receive immediate and accurate information wherever they are.\u201d", "Today, the chatbot\u2019s multilingual adviser informs people about the latest news on the coronavirus outbreak, shares statistics, transmission rates, and government contact information. It also provides information on different health and virus-related queries, including symptoms, preventative measures and treatment procedures.", "Facebook, on the contrary, filters the information to prevent false hopes and fraud. Both on Facebook and Instagram, they ban ads for products that \u201crefer to the coronavirus and create a sense of urgency, like implying a limited supply or guaranteeing a cure or prevention. For example, ads with claims like face masks are 100% guaranteed to prevent the spread of the virus will not be allowed.\u201d This is their way to support the World Health Organization\u2019s efforts.", "There is still no consensus about how to marry people\u2019s right to privacy with the government\u2019s responsibility to stop the spread of deadly diseases. A huge amount of data that is available now because of government surveillance and tracking of so many apps, feeds artificial intelligence and lets it develop with a speed almost comparable to virus dissemination.", "AI allows integrating all data sources, and the amount of data being produced all over the world will let data scientists experiment and test their models. The hope is that in the future if not now, the trained models will reveal signs on epidemics earlier, and help to prevent their spread \u2014 -and maybe even a faster cure.", "The virus is helping to push AI development and legitimize some of the questionable applications. And this is an important question of how we are going to deal with this in the future.", "Your home for data science.
