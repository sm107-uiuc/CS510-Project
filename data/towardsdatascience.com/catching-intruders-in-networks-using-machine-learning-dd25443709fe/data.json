Nation-states use cyber-attacks to gain an upper hand. Criminals use cyber-attacks to make a profit. Cybersecurity is essential for businesses and individuals to protect their data and computer systems. Detecting attacks is an important objective in cybersecurity, since it raises a red flag and enables rapid response.", "Intrusion detection is one method to detect attacks against computer networks. Intrusion detection systems monitor information from networks or from individual computers to alert responders to cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection systems are generally divided into the categories of network-based and host-based, but network-based systems are most common.", "As cyber-adversaries adapt their attacks, it is challenging to produce signatures to detect them.", "Intrusion detection can also be categorized into signature-based and anomaly-based systems. Signature-based systems rely on a catalog of known patterns that represent attacks. Anomaly-based detection systems, on the other hand, look for patterns that are inconsistent with normal activity.", "Traditional intrusion detection systems are signature-based and rely on people to create rules, generally based on attacks that they have experienced. As cyber-adversaries adapt their attacks, it is challenging to produce signatures to detect them. These systems will rarely find a novel attack, since they are built upon predefined rules.", "Machine learning research for intrusion detection began around 1987 [1]. It has been a topic of research ever since. A properly fitted machine learning algorithm may be able to detect not only known attack patterns, but also novel attacks.", "As machine learning approaches have evolved over time, different algorithms have been applied to intrusion detection. Successful approaches have included decision trees, neural networks, Bayesian algorithms, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. In addition, unsupervised approaches have applied graph theory, clustering, and ensemble methods for detecting intrusions.", "Machine learning has extraordinary potential for intrusion detection, since it is especially good at spotting patterns in data. In most cases, there is too much data for human analysts to process. They must comb through large log files to search for indicators of an attack. This is what machine learning algorithms do best.", "Despite all of this research, machine learning applications for intrusion detection have not been widely adopted in practice [2]. This is because of a number of challenges. First, the datasets used on networks are very large and are continuing to increase in size. This makes it challenging for resource-hungry algorithms to keep up. Second, intrusion detection systems often produce high false-positive rates. Third, unlike many applications of machine learning, there is an adversary who tries to tamper with the algorithms to evade detection. Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to tampering, which makes them less accurate for intrusion detection.", "Intrusion data is very small compared to the volume of normal data. As a result, these datasets are highly imbalanced. For example, only 3.2% of one file in the UNSW-NB15 data set includes attack examples. When machine learning is applied to these imbalanced datasets, it is not sufficient to look at accuracy alone.", "Accuracy is calculated as the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by the sum of all outcomes.", "If a data set has 1,000 records and three records are attacks, then an algorithm that simply predicts that none of the records are attacks, f(X) = 0, will result in 99.7% accuracy.", "Instead of measuring accuracy in imbalanced datasets, it is more important to look at the true positive rate, also called recall. The true positive rate is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.", "In the example where f(X) = 0, the true positive rate is 0%, which means none of the attacks were detected. This is not acceptable for an algorithm that is supposed to detect attacks, even though it has a high accuracy score.", "Another important measurement for imbalanced datasets is the false positive rate. The false positive rate is calculated as the number of false positives divided by the sum of false positives and true negatives.", "In another example, suppose in a data set of 1,000 records, where three records are attacks, the algorithm finds all three of the attack records but also incorrectly predicts 100 attacks that were actually normal. In this case, the accuracy score of 90% is not too bad, but the false positive rate is 10%, which means that human analysts will need to spend time reviewing false alarms.", "One of the biggest challenges in machine learning for intrusion detection is finding a good data set for testing. Supervised learning requires labeled data, but because of the volume of network data and because of confidentiality requirements, most datasets contain simulated data. To label attacks, many datasets use red teaming to create attack streams within the normal data.", "The earliest data set, KDD Cup 1999, was created as part of the Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition [3]. The goal of the competition was to build a network intrusion detection system. The data set was based on nine weeks of network data that was captured from a simulated Air Force local area network. The raw network data was processed to create a CSV data set. It included four main types of attacks: denial of service; unauthorized access from a remote computer; unauthorized access to a local privileged account; and probing.", "One of the biggest challenges in machine learning for intrusion detection is finding a good data set for testing.", "Although the KDD Cup 1999 data set was useful for the initial competition and for subsequent research, it was nearly the only data set used for intrusion detection research for more than 15 years. Over time, the data set was criticized for containing duplicate records and for being representative of obsolescent technologies. Computers and networks have changed significantly in 15 years.", "Since then, many researchers have created more modern datasets to address the weaknesses of KDD Cup 1999. Most notably, the UNSW-NB15 data set was created in 2015 and represented a more modern network [4]. It was created in a simulator and included labeled data as well as IP addresses of the computer systems.", "UNSW-NB15 is more imbalanced than the KDD Cup 1999 data set, with far fewer attack records compared to normal records. At the time of this writing, the UNSW-NB15 data set is five years old. It is not clear how long it will be useful for research, but newer approaches for generating datasets are enabling them to be created with far less effort [5].", "Intrusion detection remains an open research problem in machine learning. It is likely to remain interesting, since technologies change at a rapid pace, requiring research to keep up with the latest trends. It is also interesting because adversaries adapt and use new methods to attack networks on a regular basis. Machine learning algorithms that can identify novel types of attacks will be especially important to successfully defend computer networks.", "[2] R. Sommer and V.
