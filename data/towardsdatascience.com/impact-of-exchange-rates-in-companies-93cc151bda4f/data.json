In this post, we will first understand how exchange rates affect company profits. Then, we will analyse and plot multiple currency exchange rates with Python.", "Exchange rates are an important factor to take into account when analysing a company. A company may have USD as functional currency (i.e. currency that a company prepares financial results) but have operations (e.g. sales, loans, suppliers, etc.) in a different currency.", "When presenting financial results, firms must distinguish between monetary and non-monetary assets/liabilities:", "Account Payables are amounts that companies own to their creditors or suppliers. To understand the impact of exchange rates in a company accounts payables, let's use company ABCD as an example.", "Imagine that company ABCD, which reports their numbers in USD is:", "Suppose that three months later, when company ABCD is preparing the financial statements, the exchange rate EURUSD has gone down from 1.10 to 0.90. Meaning that we only need $0.90 to buy 1\u20ac. Due to the exchange rate change, company ABCD bottom line will be impacted. Now, it only requires $9,000 (10,000\u20ac *0.90) to pay back the initial 10,000\u20ac.", "Therefore, company ABCD will reduce the liability account payables in the balance sheet by $2,000 and show a $2,000 increase in profits through an unrealised gain.", "Similarly, if a company has a loan denominated in foreign currency and the exchange rates fluctuates, there will be an impact on the company profit and loss.", "Suppose that company ABCD has a 10,000\u20ac loan. When the EURUSD exchange rates were 1.10, the company was showing $11,000 as loan in the Balance Sheet. However, when the EURUSD moves from 1.10 to 0.90, company ABCD will report a loan of only 9,000$ in the balance sheet. At the same time, it will report an unrealised gain of $2,000 in profit and losses.", "The gain will be realised once the loan is paid back to the bank.", "Interesting, right? Based on the previous two examples, it seems that a company reporting in USD will always benefit when the USD appreciates against other currencies.", "Well, this is not always true. Companies selling to countries where currencies are losing value (i.e. depreciating) makes them less competitive. The impact of a firm losing competitive power may be translated into a significant drop in sales volumes.", "Imagine company ABCD in the scenario where the USD has appreciated against the EUR. Now a European company will need to pay a higher price in euros to buy 1 product from ABCD. This may lead to the European firm to stop buying from company ABCD and find an alternative supplier in Europe.", "Now we understand why exchange rates are so important when analysing a company. Next, let\u2019s learn how to calculate and plot exchange rates with Python.", "We will build a Python script to retrieve historical forex data from multiple currencies and plot them using matplotlib. I will be using a free financial API, financialmodelingprep, offering a great variety of free financial data.", "In the following link is possible to find all currencies for which data is available. For our example, we will extract exchange rates for below four currencies:", "First, we import all require packages and make a get request to the API end point returning historical exchange rates for the last few years. Note that we loop through each of the currencies. In each loop, we get the historical prices for a single currency pair.", "The response contains a dictionary with historical prices. Note that the key historical includes a list with all closing prices from the last few years. Therefore, we can loop through it in order to parse the date and the adj. close for each of the currency pairs. We store the values in an empty dictionary called exchange_rates_Python:", "Finally, we convert the dictionary into a Pandas DataFrame so that is easy to plot the data using matplotlib. In addition, we convert the index (i.e. dates) into a datetime object:", "Now that we have the exchange rates in a nice Pandas DataFrame, we are ready to plot them. We will use the library matplotlib to create a subplot for each of the currencies.", "We will only plot the exchange rate for the last 90 days:", "Just with a few lines of code, we are able to retrieve and plot exchange rates with Python.", "We can see that for the last three months, USD is much stronger than for example GBP. In December 2019, we needed around $1.33 to buy 1\u00a3, however, in April of 2020, we only needed 1.22$ to buy 1\u00a3.", "That means that companies having large amounts of open payables or loan in \u00a3 are in a much better position to repay the amounts than 4 months ago. However, sales may be affected if British companies decide not to buy products in USD due to the appreciation of the currency.", "As we have seen during the post, it is very important to understand a firm\u2019s currency exposure before making investment decisions. I recommend you to analyse company sales, loans and payables in terms of currency exposure.", "If you have liked the article, feel free to have a look at my other posts on Python for Finance.", "Your home for data science.
