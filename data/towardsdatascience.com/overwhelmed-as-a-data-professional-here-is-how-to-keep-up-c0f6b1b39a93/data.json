Technical concepts, databases, cloud services, open-source frameworks, and tools for data science, visualizations, and ETL processes \u2014 it seems impossible to keep up. We consume so much content these days that we shouldn\u2019t blame ourselves for not being able to manage this information overload. In this article, I share several techniques and an actionable template to organize the content that we consume and make room for new creative ideas in our busy lives as data professionals.", "In the constantly evolving world of technology, it\u2019s hard to stay up-to-date with recent developments. Luckily, we don\u2019t have to know everything, but rather know where to find the information we are looking for.", "I encountered many software engineers who don\u2019t write anything down and rely solely on a Google search (or rather Stack Overflow search) for information retrieval. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Stack Overflow, but I hate solving the same problem twice only because I forgot how I previously arrived at the solution.", "Therefore, I developed a Getting-Things-Done system that I can rely upon, and that let me store and later find everything I need. The basic principle is that:", "\u201cYour mind is for having ideas, not (for) holding them.\u201c", "If you can capture things you\u2019ve learned to some external system (your \u201csecond brain\u201d) and rely on it to quickly find the relevant information, you don\u2019t need to store everything in your head. It gives you more space for new ideas and to focus on things that are most important.", "The implementation details, such as which app you end up using to take notes (such as Notion, Evernote, Roam, RemNote, OneNote, etc.), don\u2019t matter as long as it lets you capture, organize and retrieve everything. Many still prefer to take physical notes, and that\u2019s fine if it works for you.", "In the past, I used to read blog posts, watch videos or read a book about something, and it made me believe that I got the gist of it, and I will remember it. But when I had to apply that information months later, it turned out that I forgot most of it, and I couldn\u2019t find the resources I was using.", "What I learned from it is that:", "the amount of information we come across in technical jobs is overwhelming and we can\u2019t rely on remembering everything.", "Things change so quickly these days that it often may not be the best use of our time to know the details about them. Very often, it\u2019s good enough to have a big-picture perspective and dive deeper into our captured notes when needed.", "Without capturing, we rely solely on our fallible memory, which puts a lot of pressure on ourselves. If we don\u2019t capture what we\u2019ve learned, we might need to entirely relearn it later because we forgot nearly everything after several months or years.", "As an ambitious person, you may be setting goals for yourself. But when you achieve your goals, what\u2019s next? Goals seem to be useful in showing the direction. However, organizing our work around them can be counterproductive, as goals focus on a destination rather than on the process. It may help to have a vision and plans with achievable, measurable milestones written down, but eventually:", "\u201cYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\u201d \u2014 James Clear [2]", "Systems give us a framework to break down our ambitious goals into small manageable steps and see a bigger picture as the results compound over time. A robust system allows capturing, organizing, reviewing, and finally finding and applying the relevant information.", "After we captured any information into a reliable system, we should be able to easily organize it into groups (ex. work projects, personal projects, or even ideas on how to spend time with friends and family) and prioritize everything according to what is essential. This categorization has plenty of benefits:", "Finally, we can sleep better by knowing that we have everything (or at least some of it) under control, as all \u201clife categories\u201d are taken care of within our system.", "Establishing any reliable system is challenging. You can use e.g. Notion to keep track of projects, work tasks, and anything that you\u2019re learning along the way. The actual tool matters less than the way it is used.", "The ideal Getting-Things-Done system will let you:", "The last point is critical: if you summarize and structure any captured information so that it makes sense to you, you will make it easier for your \u201cfuture self\u201d to understand what you meant. On top of that, it will make it more manageable to extend and share with others.", "We are all humans, and we like to do easy things: watching Netflix, eating ice cream, or merely consuming information by watching YouTube videos or browsing through Reddit. However, purely passive consumption of content doesn\u2019t stick. For instance, let\u2019s imagine two scenarios:", "You probably can recall more from the second scenario. A simple act of actively engaging with the content makes any information stick longer. For instance, back in school and university, I often took notes with pen and paper because it allowed me not to be bored by the lecture. At the same time, when taking notes, I was always able to recall this information much easier later.", "This distinction between active and passive learning is likely why we learn better by doing rather than just watching somebody else doing something.", "Knowledge without application is like knowing an entire vocabulary of a foreign language but still not being able to speak it. Without application, this knowledge doesn\u2019t have connections within our brain to remember it long-term. I found that even writing the shortest code examples makes it easier to understand and remember any programming concept. The same applies to the process of learning foreign languages \u2014 creating a simple sentence with the new word that we just learned puts it in the context of how it\u2019s used, which makes it much easier to remember it.", "In this article, we discussed components of a Getting-Things-Done system that can help us consume content more actively by capturing information that we learn to our \u201csecond brain\u201d, i.e. an external system that allows us to store and organize things we work on. If used properly, such a system will reduce our stress levels and free up our mental resources, as we no longer need to store everything in our mental \u201cRAM\u201d, but we can move some part of it to some \u201cexternal drive\u201d.", "I encourage you to give it a try. Creating a system for organizing projects, capturing things you learn, and regularly updating your knowledge base will likely pay off exponentially in the future. It will make work and learning much more enjoyable, as you will have a system that will free up your mental resources to focus on critical things. In the end, we never stop learning, especially in the technology space, so it\u2019s better to approach it with a system.", "[1] \u201cGetting Things Done\u201d \u2014 book by David Allen and David Kelvin Allen", "[2] \u201cAtomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones\u201d \u2014 book by James Clear", "Your home for data science.
