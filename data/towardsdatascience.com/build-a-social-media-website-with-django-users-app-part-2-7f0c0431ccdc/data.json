I cannot talk about those in detail because our focus is not to teach you basic concepts but to build a social media website. So, I would link to good resources for you to refer to those specific topics and then continue with this tutorial.", "So, let\u2019s go ahead and build the Users app we created in the last tutorial. We will start by creating the models first.", "In this python file, we will define our models. As you might already know, models are defined to tell Django what to save in the database and to define the relationship between different models and what characteristics they have.", "To learn more about Django models, do visit this amazing tutorial on models by Mozilla Developers. It talks about models in depth.", "After you are comfortable with how models work, you can proceed to make models for our social media website.", "So, we will have two models \u2014 one for the user\u2019s profile and the other for Friend Requests.", "We will need to import many things before we begin writing the models. We will be using the Default User model of Django to have One to One Relationship with our Profile Model i.e. each user will have one profile.", "We are also using autoslug to produce slugs for the URLs based on the username automatically.", "E.g., A user with the name Tom would have slug as tom. This will help us make meaningful URLs as users/tom will lead to Tom\u2019s profile rather than numbers.", "So, to use autoslug, we need to install it first. It can be done via a simple pip install. Refer below:", "Also, we will need to install the pillow library to handle the images in the Profile model.", "After installing it, we can import it into models.py by using the line:", "After finishing off all the required imports, we can begin writing the models.", "So, our first model is the Profile model. It has five parameters:-", "Next, we describe the __str__, which decides how Django will show our model in the admin panel. We have set it to show the username as the Query object.", "We also define the get_absolute_url to get the absolute URL for that profile.", "Next, we define a function to make a profile as soon as we create the user so that the user doesn't have to create a profile manually.", "Next, we define our Friends Model. It will have three parameters:-", "As you can notice, both to_user and from_user use the same ForeignKey, so to differentiate, we need to use the related_name field.", "So, that finishes our models.py file. Have a look at the code below, which shows the models.py file.", "After the models.py file, we move forward to the admin.py file.", "It will be short, and it will consist of a few lines only. It denotes the models which we will be registering to our admin panel. We will be registering both our models here.", "To know more about the working of forms in Django, visit this official tutorial by Django itself. Then proceed to the tutorial.", "We define three forms in our forms.py file.", "So, adding these three forms would complete our forms.py file. Look at the code below:", "So, after this, we have our forms.py file created. Next, we would see the views.py file.", "Now, we will define the views.py file. It would contain all our views (how to render the files in the web browser). It directly passes data to the templates.", "Read this official tutorial by Django to understand views in a better way. After reading the tutorial, we move forward.", "Since the views file is too large, we can make it as we like, so I would give a simple overview of what each view does, and you can read the code below for a better understanding. So, let\u2019s go through them one by one:", "Go through the code below for a better understanding.", "It sums up our Users app. We are left with the urls.py, which we won\u2019t include in users app. We will add it directly to our photoshare app.", "You can view this simple tutorial to understand more about URLs in Django.", "This file contains all the URLs for the website. It has an include(\u2018feed.urls\u2019) which includes all URLs from the Feed app, which we will build in the next tutorial.", "And we include all the URLs for the photoshare app directly in the main urls.py file. Have a look at the file below:", "If you want to see the complete code, view the project\u2019s GitHub Repo. Also, you can try out this app by visiting this link. It is hosted on Heroku, and the media and static files are on Google Cloud Storage.", "A similar Django-focused series (Building a Job Search Portal) which will teach you some amazing new concepts, is:", "If you want to get a step further with Django and learn the Django Rest Framework, this new series should excite you:", "The next part of this tutorial is:", "Some more articles to read after this series are:", "Your home for data science.
