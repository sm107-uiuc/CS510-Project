Now you regret not speaking up before giving them control of the music, and the road trip just started.", "I\u2019ve been in these situations several times. My partner and I have drastically different tastes in music. He mostly likes rap, but also listens to ska and punk from time to time. I like a little of everything but what I listen to heavily depends on my mood. Our tastes overlap on a very specific subset of alternative/indie music. While on a four-hour drive, we took turns adding songs to a Spotify queue, but we were still stuck suffering through the other person\u2019s songs.", "Situations like these made me wish there was a way we could only play songs that we both like. I built Friendshipify save us all from being stuck in these situations again.", "Friendshipify generates a playlist based on the intersection of two user\u2019s tastes. Each user supplies three songs that the app will use as their \u201cmusic taste,\u201d and curates a playlist of songs that both users will like. Try it out here!", "About 40,000 songs were collected using data collection pipelines scripted in Python. These pipelines leveraged the Spotify API (via Spotipy, a Python wrapper) to gather songs, metadata such as artist information and genre, and Spotify-specific audio features like danceability, tempo, and instrumentalness. Additional audio features (e.g. zero crossing rate, Mel Cepstral Coefficients) were extracted from raw audio files using LibROSA. Feature vectors were constructed using Pandas and Numpy, and stored in a PostgreSQL database. The Friendshipify web app was developed using Flask and deployed via Google Cloud Platform. Accompanying visualizations were scripted using Plotly.", "The Friendshipify database stores several thousand song feature vectors that span 11 genres. When a user inputs a song, Friendshipify checks if the song\u2019s feature vector is already stored in the database. If it isn\u2019t, the track goes through the data collection and feature extraction pipelines to generate a feature vector.", "The data collection pipeline leveraged the Spotify API to gather songs and their metadata such as track name, artist name, and genre. Audio features such as tempo, danceability, and energy were retrieved using the Audio Features endpoint. Below are sample distributions for the 9 Spotify features I chose to include, definitions of these features can be found in the Spotify API Docs.", "I could\u2019ve stopped here and built a simple recommender based on Spotify\u2019s provided features but I had two concerns: whether the 9 Spotify features I chose would be enough to make quality recommendations, and how I would be able to validate my results. While doing some research, I came across several blog posts about music information retrieval (genre classification, important audio features) where the author used LibROSA, a Python library for audio analysis, to extract audio features from raw audio files.", "The Spotify API provides links to a song\u2019s 30 second preview in the song object metadata. I figured I could use LibROSA to extract latent features from song previews, thus expanding the features in my data set. I built a feature extraction pipeline to do exactly this. Below are some sample distributions of the features I chose to extract based on my research. See this notebook for more information on spectral features (centroid, bandwidth, rolloff) and this notebook on zero crossing rate.", "Once all the data was collected and processed, I stored it in a PostgreSQL database. The combined Spotify and LibROSA features would be used to make recommendations.", "Deciding how matches were going to be made was probably the most difficult part of this process. Not only did I need to decide how I was going to assess similarity between songs, but I also had to figure out how to recommend songs that would cater to both users. While collaborative filtering methods are widely used in building recommender systems, it wasn\u2019t the right method for the problem I was looking to solve. Collaborative filtering attempts to find similar users based on rating history. In my case, I wanted to find the similarities between two users\u2019 songs.", "The first step I took in assessing the similarity between songs was to try clustering. I figured that clustering songs would give me distinct groups I could eventually draw from to make recommendations. I fed the feature vectors of all the collected tracks into the K-Means Clustering algorithm. This resulted in some interesting clusters but didn\u2019t give me a clear idea into how or why the songs were being clustered the way they were. When I listened to songs in each cluster, I could audibly identify similarities, but there was no way for me to quantify these similarities for validating results.", "In the end, I decided to group songs by genre, which was a feature that was included during data collection. Using genres as a grouping criterion would mean that if a user submits a rock song, the app will only recommend other rock songs.", "Once the tracks that both users submit go through the data collection and feature extraction pipelines, the app has all the criteria needed to start making recommendations. The graphic below shows this process. The tables \u201cUser A\u2019s Picks\u201d and \u201cUser B\u2019s Picks\u201d represent two users and the songs they submitted to Friendshipify. Genres are represented in different colors using the legend on the left.", "First, cosine similarity is calculated between the songs and all other songs in the database that belong to the same genre. For example, User A\u2019s first song is \u201cZombie\u201d by The Cranberries. This is a rock song, so Friendshipify calculates the cosine similarity between the feature vector for \u201cZombie\u201d, and all other song feature vectors that belong to the rock genre. The top two most similar songs (with the highest cosine similarity value) become recommendations for that song. In the graphic, each song has an arrow pointing to its most similar songs; \u201cSomething Changed\u201d and \u201cAmerican Dreams\u201d are the top two most similar songs to \u201cZombie\u201d in the Friendshipify database.", "Once Friendshipify has the 6 recommended songs for each user, they are used to construct a 6x6 cosine similarity matrix, where a user\u2019s recommended songs are either row or column indices. The cells of the matrix contain the pairwise cosine similarity values of all possible pairings of songs between each user. For example, the similarity score between User A\u2019s recommendation \u201cBoyfriend\u201d and User B\u2019s recommendation \u201cNice to Meet Ya\u201d is 0.9798.", "Pairs of songs with the highest cosine similarity value are used as final recommendations. In the table above, \u201cStar76\u201d and \u201cSomething Changed\u201d have the highest similarity score, so these two songs will be included in the results. However, \u201cUprising\u201d and \u201cParadise Lost\u201d have the lowest similarity score so these songs may not be included in the final results unless they have a high similarity score with a different song.", "While Friendshipify will always recommend songs that are the most similar to both users, there will be some cases that work well and others that don\u2019t work as well.", "Two friends, Donna and Jackie, both like different music. Jackie loves 2000s pop and Mariah Carey\u2019s early music. Donna prefers rock from the \u201990s to early 2000s. Jackie picks the following pop songs:", "Donna picks the following rock songs:", "Friendshipify recommends these songs for Jackie and Donna\u2019s playlist:", "To verify whether these recommended songs cater to both friends\u2019 taste, I decided to examine the distributions of four audio features, danceability, energy, tempo, and valence.", "Here is the definition of these features from the Spotify API docs:", "Danceability: how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable, and 1.0 is most danceable.", "Energy: a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.", "Tempo: the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.", "Valence: a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).", "From the violin plot, we can see Jackie\u2019s pop songs have a lower tempo, are moderately danceable, have varied energy, and are moderately positive (valence). All Donna\u2019s rock songs appear to have the same low tempo, are less danceable than Jackie\u2019s pop songs, have high energy and are moderately positive. The value distributions for the \u201cRecommended Songs\u201d visually match the distributions of Jackie and Donna\u2019s songs. The recommended songs have the same low tempo and varied valence.", "The energy of the recommendations overlap with the range of values seen in both friends\u2019 songs. However, the shape of the violin shows there is a higher probability of Friendshipify recommending high energy songs like Donna\u2019s. The danceability values of the recommendations are interesting due to the inclusion of two extreme values of 0.88 and 0.51, despite the rest of the songs falling within the mean danceability values for both Jackie and Donna. Friendshipify could be including these extreme values to address the 50% probability of Jackie\u2019s next song having a danceability value of 0.88 or the fact that one of Donna\u2019s songs has a danceability value of 0.51.", "Despite the differences in danceability, the results seem to be good ones based on the plotted features. I feel that the songs audibly match and cater to both friends\u2019 tastes. Lenny Kravitz\u2019s \u201cThe Chamber\u201d sounds very pop/rock, so I feel that it\u2019s a song that would appeal to both Jackie and Donna. \u201cMMMBop\u201d matches the era of both Jackie and Donna\u2019s picks and sounds similar to Third Eye Blind\u2019s \u201cNever Let You Go\u201d and \u201cSemi-Charmed Life\u201d, the latter being recommended from Donna\u2019s songs. \u201cGood In Goodbye\u201d is being recommended from Jackie\u2019s picks and sounds very similar to Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201cCry Me A River.\u201d", "Donna and Jackie\u2019s friend Hyde likes the same kind of rock music as Donna. He picks the following songs:", "They ask their friend Fez what kind of music he likes. He likes hip hop and his two favorite groups are OutKast and TLC. His favorite Drake song is \u201cIn My Feelings\u201d. Fez picks the following songs:", "The following recommendations are made by Friendshipify:", "Hyde\u2019s rock songs are moderately to not danceable and have high energy. This makes sense since \u201cThe Middle\u201d and \u201cMr. Brightside\u201d sound fast and energetic. Despite the high energy, Hyde\u2019s danceability and tempo distributions are both being skewed by Californication, a more mellow song compared to his other two picks. Fez\u2019s songs show opposite characteristics compared to Hyde\u2019s songs. Fez\u2019s danceability violin is centered close to 0.8, which means his songs are highly danceable. Despite being danceable, the energy and tempo of Fez\u2019s songs are variable. OutKast\u2019s \u201cHey Ya\u201d is very energetic, \u201cIn My Feelings\u201d is less energetic, and \u201cWaterfalls\u201d is the slowest of Fez\u2019s picks. Both Hyde and Fez\u2019s songs have varied valence, which makes sense considering their picks.", "The distribution of features for the \u201cRecommended Songs\u201d seem to favor either Hyde or Fez\u2019s songs. The danceability of the recommendations is being skewed possibly by one or two songs that have a value around 0.9. The energy and tempo distributions both contain outliers. The songs that contain these outliers could be recommended due to Hyde having one low tempo, low energy song among high energy rock songs, and Fez including one high energy, high tempo song among more mellow hip hop songs. Valence seems to be the one feature where the recommendations capture both friends\u2019 tastes; the songs recommended show the same variability in valence.", "The songs recommended to Hyde and Fez don\u2019t seem to cater to both of their tastes. Run-D.M.C\u2019s \u201cSucker M.C.\u2019s\u201d comes the closest due to the percussive nature of the song, despite being a hip hop song. Recommending another mellow Drake song to Fez makes sense since he included a Drake song. The two Blind Melon songs are mellow as well and Friendshipify could be attempting to match them on the characteristics of \u201cIn My Feelings\u2019\u2019 and \u201cOne Dance\u201d.", "If the purpose of Friendshipify was to make separate recommendations then these results would be good ones, however it seems that rock and hip hop may be too different to recommend songs that capture both users\u2019 tastes. However, genres are not 100% one genre or another. If Fez and Hyde picked different songs the results may be more cohesive, especially if the both friends pick songs that are not so variable.", "Spotify contains over 4,000 different genres, some have even been made up. At first I was skeptical of restricting the initial recommendation step by genre. Even using broad umbrella genres like pop and rock felt like it would still give final results that weren\u2019t cohesive. The beauty of music is that it isn\u2019t black and white. An artist can incorporate different sounds and styles into a song. For example, a hip hop or rap song may have funk, classical, or R&B melodies in the background (see Tyler, the Creator), but still be considered hip hop/rap. Extracting the latent features of each song allows the app to pick up on these subtle patterns and recommend similar sounding songs. Several times I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by the results given. So if a result \u201cseems wrong,\u201d I encourage you to take a listen.", "If I had more time to work on this app I would improve the recommendations by changing how genres are handled. Instead of mapping Spotify\u2019s unique subgenres to more general ones (e.g. afrofuturism becomes R&B), I would keep the unique genres and expand the data set to have a good amount of songs that belong to each of the unique genres. Changing this part of the matching algorithm would increase the quality of the recommendations and most likely decrease the runtime of the app. I would also implement a Spotify authorization flow so users could add the playlist directly to their Spotify library.", "[1] Get Audio Features for a Track (2020) Spotify API Documentation", "[2] Parul Pandey, Music Genre Classification with Python (2018), Towards Data Science", "[3] Joel Jogy, How I Understood: What features to consider while training audio files?
