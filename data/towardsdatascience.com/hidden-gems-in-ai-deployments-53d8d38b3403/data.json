While the technology has evolved significantly, the recipe for delivery has largely remained the same. I want to share some best practices and critical aspects that are often underestimated or overlooked. These are the \u201chidden gems\u201d that I have found to be critical to the success of a production deployment.", "The first thing both you and your customer need to understand and have complete clarity on is the purpose of the project. Yes, you need to define the use case, scenarios, personas, and more. But you need to answer several questions, such as: What are the actual outcomes the customer is looking to achieve? How will this help improve the customer\u2019s business?", "I have seen many AI deployments where the outcome was a technical success but a business failure. Hence, those projects were not successful. The technical aspects of the solution were working correctly but there was no quantifiable business value. The ROI could not be proven, for example, no additional revenue generated or little to no cost savings.", "That is why it is critical to understand and define success criteria for any project. This should be created and agreed to, by both parties, before you start. This helps ensure that the outcome is quantifiable and you can definitively state if the project was a success, or not. Here are some examples of success criteria statements:", "This is another item that needs to be clearly defined and documented. Every project needs a scope \u2014 that is, what is supposed to be implemented during the actual delivery of the project. This captures what is \u201cin bounds\u201d and also should outline some related or common \u201cout of scope\u201d items. Here are some examples:", "Documenting your scope will help you avoid chasing a moving target. This allows you to state that you have implemented everything promised in the original scope of work. This also will help identify and avoid scope creep \u2014 where new items are added to the project during delivery.", "This is another very critical part of the process. You must listen to your customer, listen to their challenges, listen to where they want to be. Not all customers are knowledgeable in the AI space. Their experience can range from having some hands-on experience to knowing nothing at all. That is why you are in the picture \u2014 to help guide them along this journey!", "Document your requirements. Mutually agree to those requirements. Show how those requirements map to the solution\u2019s use case, scope and success criteria. You can partition the requirements into two main types, functional and non-functional. Below are some examples.", "Without clearly defined requirements, you risk misalignment with your customer. You risk having a lack of clarity, both internally and externally. You need to understand the requirements to generate epics, stories and tasks to assign the work to your teams and to track progress.", "ROI, success criteria, scope and requirements can be discussed and vetted via design thinking sessions (or other focused sessions). But they do not end there. They need to be formalized into mutually agreed upon documentation.", "In order to properly solution any AI-powered deployment, you need to see and understand the data that you will be working with. Always ask for samples of the actual data that will be used as early as you can. Assess the data. There are many questions you need to answer, such as:", "I\u2019ve seen many projects that have been delayed, failed or never took off due to data issues. This is definitively a showstopper so make sure you have assessed the data!", "A common mistake when starting a project, is automatically assuming the technology to be used. Do not do this. Do not go into a project with any firm assumptions of which technology you want to use. First, you need to completely understand what the customer is looking to achieve (all the things I have discuss above). Then, you can identify the appropriate technology in your architecture to meet the project\u2019s needs.", "The technology you propose should be used for its intended purpose. Most products are designed with specific use cases and certain data in mind. This can also affect what type of product support you receive. Make sure to understand the product limitations before incorporating it into the overall architecture. A deciding factor is, does the technology produce results that directly map to what my customer has asked for?", "Put something in front of your customer early and often. Even if its just wireframes or very early development work. This will help save lots of time and can be the difference between a failed or successful project. The sooner you put something in front of your customer, the better. This will confirm your understanding of what you need to be building. It confirms if you\u2018re on the right, or wrong, path. Playbacks can be at held at whatever interval you choose. Two weeks is a typical interval most of my teams have used successfully.", "You want to test your solution as early as possible. You also want to ensure that the people testing your solution are the real end users (or the closest thing to it). For example, let\u2019s say your end user persona is targeted to be new employees only. Do not have SMEs or seasoned employees be the primary testers of your solution. It is not representative and will not be providing you contextual feedback. While it is important for those experts to test and provide their feedback, they will not be the ones using the solution. At the end of the day, it is the new employee persona that will be using this solution. Their opinion should carry more weight.", "The number of test cycles you go through will depend on various factors such as project timeline, quality of results, scope, etc. In my teams\u2019 experience, we have found that on average, three full test cycles (no less) are both effective and realistic with all things considered. The more you test, the more you can enhance the solution. You will eventually hit a point of diminishing return.", "There are many different aspects to making an AI project a reality and success. I did not discuss every single aspect above but I have shared my experience and lessons learned for some of the most critical activities. These are the areas that I have seen to be the most common places where teams have struggled and succeeded. Ultimately, how you approach and complete these activities will dictate the level of success of your projects.", "Marc is the CTO for the IBM Watson AI Strategic Partnerships organization. When not leading the technology strategy and vision for IBM Partnerships, Marc enjoys DJing, playing video games and wrestling.", "Your home for data science.
