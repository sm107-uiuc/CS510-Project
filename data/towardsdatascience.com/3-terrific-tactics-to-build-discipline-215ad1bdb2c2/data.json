An often cited quote by the well-known war tactician and philosopher, Sun Tzu, who stated:", "Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.", "But what does this actually mean? You can think of strategy as anything that involves the big picture and informs a decision \u201cI am going to Point B.\u201d In contrast, tactics are the specific actions that get you from point A to point B.", "It\u2019s important to distinguish this because what comes below is a quick review of some tactics that you can incorporate into nearly any mission, agenda, or strategy that you have set for yourself. The target audience below is for fellow software engineers, but these fundamental tactics can be applied to anyone. So enough theory. Let\u2019s keep it short, sweet, and to the point.", "Now, I\u2019ve been in this place and I\u2019m still even guilty of it at times. But the truth of the matter is: You don\u2019t know everything.", "You may be a software engineer. An electrical engineer. A computer engineer, bioengineer, or nuclear engineer. And what is in common across all forms of engineering? Well, for all different flavors of engineer, these involve working with other people. The beauty of working with other people, and with teams, is that each person comes together to contribute their own unique gift to the cluster. And when that happens, you have to realize that what you might expect is not the reality of what you need to build.", "So, before you even begin to speak, always make sure that you are listening to those around you. And if you don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s okay to ask questions. Did you hear me?", "In fact, the more questions you ask, especially if you work with a team, the better you will be as an engineer.", "Make sure that you actually understand why you\u2019re writing that code. Why you\u2019re doing whatever you\u2019re doing. And always sync up with either your project manager, your team manager, your tech lead, or yourself, depending on your role.", "It\u2019s oK to ask questions. If act, the more questions you ask, especially if you work with a team, the better you will be as an engineer.", "Sometimes, especially if you\u2019re at a F500 company, you might start forgetting some of your CS fundamentals. I mean, when was the last time I had to check if a given subsequence existed in a binary search tree?", "No worries! You can address this by performing a code kata. These time-enclosed coding exercises are known as \u201ckatas,\u201d a term originally used in Japanese martial arts and even among training samurai. It simply refers to training fundamental positions or poses. In the context of software engineering, you perform a kata by completing time-enclosed coding exercises and reviewing them. By doing so, you\u2019ll accomplish these three steps in your personal evolution as an engineer:", "If you\u2019re still confused, feel free to check out a code kata I wrote earlier this year. ( https://towardsdatascience.com/code-kata-robot-sensing-reduce-branching-and-cyclomatic-complexity-fe290b3050d1 )", "Now, I know that this sounds really weird, but eating your frog isn\u2019t about literally eating your frog. The truth is, we want to explore this concept of addressing the problem or task that you LOATHE. And doing it first thing in the morning. To eat your frog, just follow this one instruction.", "Schedule a 90 minute window at the beginning of your work-day to finish your hardest task.", "By doing so, you strengthen your ability to convert your goals you wish into habits you complete. Otherwise, if you keep just holding off until the last minute, or until the last moment of the day, then you\u2019re just going to end up needing to do that task the next day. There\u2019s a truth to the saying by former CEO of AOL, Stephen Case:", "A vision without execution is hallucination.", "In the best case scenario, in those 90 minutes, you will have solved this task that you\u2019ve been loathing the entire time. You will have completed everything that you needed to do. How awesome is that?", "In the worst case scenario, you\u2019ll probably generate more questions and run into more walls. But, if you do it first thing in the day, especially if you work with a team, then you can ask those questions. Isn\u2019t that profound? Yes, it might sound pretty basic. Still, many of us ( myself included), can have inclinations to laziness and procrastination. I too, have to eat my frog.", "Hey, remember how I mentioned earlier that you strengthen your ability to convert your goals you wish into habits you complete when you set aside 90 minutes of dedicated time and eat your frog? Curious to know the details of how this is done?", "A recent publication came out, that revealed this is done by literally strengthening the connection between the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) to the dorsal striatum, which is necessary for goal directed action control.
