I hear them. Well, not directly, but using JukeBox.", "JukeBox is a Neural Network that generates music, a project, realized by the OpenAI team. They developed the neural framework and trained it on 1.2 million songs and music pieces by various musicians, composers, and bands.", "There are already various approaches and AI-driven models generating music out there, but till now they were rather capable of creating some melodies in a MIDI quality.", "This music piece, for example, I created using Piano Transformer from TensorFlow powered Magenta Framework (try it out: Colab Notebook)", "Piano Transformer uses, like a transformer in GPT-3 the self-attention, which brings some inner coherence into the melody, with rather algorithmic tension (well, JS Bach created his Fugues also with algorithms).", "JukeBox uses a transformer but has another approach: sampling \u2014 and upsampling \u2014 of audio data. It does mean, this music model \u201cknows\u201d how various styles and voices sound \u2014 and writes its interpretations. As audio files.", "I wrote about JukeBox and other music models in my tutorial about making podcasts using AI:", "In this article, I want to share with you some astonishing discoveries I made.", "There is a breathtaking moment in the Series \u201cDEVS\u201d, as the scientists get a clearer and clearer vision of the Impossible \u2014 with every iteration they can see better and better the Unbelievable.", "Using JukeBox you can experience a similar sensation. There is an official Colab Notebook you can use.", "But there is also a Colab Notebook, enhanced by SMarioMan, (GitHub). It allows you to store your data on your Google Drive \u2014 in case your Notebook might crash. Because you need time for generating music \u2014 up to 8\u201310 hours.", "Here is a very useful video tutorial by Broccaloo about using JukeBox:", "First, you need to define an artist and genre. You can find all artists and genres JukeBox was trained on in the huge Playlist of AI-generated music by OpenAI here:", "Second, a couple of samples are generated (3 items per default), within 10\u201330 minutes (Level 2). If you don\u2019t like it, you can rerun it.", "Third, the samples you\u2019re OK with are generated \u2014 upscaled (Level 1 and Level 0). It takes time, sometimes half of a day. Sometimes Notebook crashes (connection interruptions, Google Server issues, etc. etc.). But if you use the Notebook by SMarioMan, all your progress is stored in your mounted GoogleDrive \u2014 and you can continue with the checkpoints saved there.", "What can you do with Colab Notebook else? You can\u2026", "Meanwhile, we can observe very interesting results. Follow Leonardo Guti\u00e9rrez, who experiments a lot with JukeBox. Using our common re-writing of the AC/DC lyrics he generated a new version of \u201cShot in the Dark\u201d:", "Brocalloo (who did a very helpful video tutorial above) does also interesting experiments:", "There is even a fan community of JukeBox users on Discord:", "What fascinates me the most on JukeBox? Not quite the imitation of existing performers or interpretation of famous pieces \u2014 but the discovery of hidden gems. The musical hallucination of the machine. Unique soundscapes.", "Uncanny Valley is a pass\u00e9. It isn\u2019t a weird or creepy feeling anymore \u2014 it\u2019s the bliss of encountering artificial aesthetics.", "Indeed, the works are unique: every time a new never before existed music piece is generated \u2014 and you can be sure (like in the case of GPT-3) that this sequence will never be repeated. It\u2019s just for you. Only now and here.", "My first experiment brought me goosebumps. Already the 2nd level was something special, not really in a way of music pieces. And the more upsampling it did, the more fascinating and clear it became:", "It sounds\u2026 weird. Like a soundtrack to documentation about an unknown country with an unknown culture.", "Indeed, JukeBox mimes language perfectly. It can interpret text you pre-set, but it also generates a musical interpretation of a language.", "You can compare it with StyleGAN2 interpreting visuals of writing instead of its semantics:", "Call it Brut Art, call it Glitch Art, but some of the audio samples generated by JukeBox are unbelievably intense. Here are just some of my favorites \u2014 and I am very eager to know your opinion about it?", "Along with the cineast soundtrack above, I have several music pieces especially impacting my interest. Forget for a moment Machine Learning and theory. Just close your eyes, listen to music, and keep attention to various audio phenomena. I recommend using headphones for the best experience.", "JukeBox is great for Jazz. Especially freestyle or experimental pieces full of syncopes and modulations. The first piece above is also delivered with a voice \u2014 you can recognize words, you also hear its imitation of English, but that is the only imitation. The second recording has an inspiring Big Band vibe as well \u2014 the sound quality of instruments is overwhelming.", "Phenomenon: Another exciting phenomenon you observe here \u2014 most of the generated music pieces have finished composition. They don\u2019t just end abruptly on the second you\u2019ve set up for the music lengths (not all of them at least). The same Music Transformer making melody coherent work often enables the elegant music ending.", "Listen to this acoustic guitar \u2014 you even can hear guitar string scratches, as if not only music is generated here, but also a musician.", "Phenomenon: In the sample above you will observe (0:27 min) some sharp tone as if somebody is clapping. Just two times \u2014 and the melody rhythms are aligned from now to this clapping. The transformer transforms the music without disrupting its acoustical esthetics.", "This is something special: close your eyes, and you will imagine a stage with actors, their performance, and even the audience\u2019s reaction.", "Phenomenon: what do you imagine listening to this piece? I almost see a hilarious King entering with fanfares (accompanied to audience\u2019s laughter), then after some Tchaikovsky\u2019s samples a love song follows (the ending with the protagonist singing \u201cto you!..\u201d [he probably kneels before his Lady]) \u2014 and the public cannot hide its emotions with enthusiastic applause, laughter, whistling. A very organic and realistic vision of a non-existent theater performance.", "This piece was trained on Marissa Nadler, but at the beginning, a girl's voice sings in a non-existent language. After the solo, the powerful music begins, and the fragile voice becomes vigorous.", "Phenomenon: the intensity, echo, and atmosphere were overwhelming. I used TokkingHeads service by RoseBud.AI (which implements i.a. First Order Motion Model) to visualize this performance:", "Observation: JukeBox generates unique styles and languages, which can help with new surprising ideas and inspiration for musicians and composers.", "In these two versions, I have chosen Tracy Chapman as a performer. The text was written for me by GPT-3:", "And it works \u2014 distinctive voice by Tracy singing AI-generated lyrics (and I am in love with this GPT-3 poem).", "Phenomenon: Like in other AI-generated songs, even if you specify lyrics for singing, it isn\u2019t obvious that AI will obey and use your text for its song. Sometimes \u2014 even often \u2014 it augments the text with additional language glitches. Such unexpected and individual randomness proves again, that AI as a creative instance is certainly capable of more than just some algorithmic music prediction methods.", "For this song, I trained JukeBox on the Nursery Rhyme \u201cRow Row Row your Boat\u201d and Jamie Cullum as a performer. Again, you can not only hear the text of the famous rhymes, but also some language glitches.", "Phenomenon: not only the jazzy soundtrack and powerful miasma of the voice impressed me in this case. But also non-intended, but perfectly realized ellipsis: \u201cmerely, merely, merely, merely\u201d\u2026 and the boat is floating into a sea of light.", "Observation: Jukebox can give us interesting ideas of musical metaphors.", "Btw. this is another version of \u201cRow your boat\u201d, which sounds rather like a jazzy Cold War love song in the meaning of \u201cFrom Russia with Love\u201d:", "This musical piece sounds astonishing \u2014 it begins with experimental orchestra sounds, brutal and sharp shakuhachi or saxophone tones, other instruments take part in the cacophony, but then a harmonical chorus emerges.", "If I hadn\u2019t got this music delivered by JukeBox Notebook, I\u2019d assume it was some music masterpiece from the Audio section of UbuWeb.", "Phenomenon: Trained on Jamie Cullum, but in the \u201cClassic Music\u201d genre brings interesting and unique results \u2014 the training base is not recognizable anymore. Mixing aspects can cause surprising effects.", "If you want to hear more: tune in to my daily #LatentVoices channel \u2014 or check out my #JukeBoxed-Playlist on Soundcloud.", "Or generate your music and share it with us here.", "Your home for data science.
