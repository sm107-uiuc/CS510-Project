Both feature extractors and transformers should structured with composition and re-usability in mind.", "Selecting the features can be left to the caller, or can be automated e.g. apply a chi-squared statistical test to rank the impact of each feature on the concept label and discard the less impactful features prior to model training. A series of selector APIs can be defined to enable this. Either way, to ensure consistency on the features used as model inputs and at scoring, a unique id is assigned to each feature set.", "Broadly speaking, a data preparation pipeline should be assembled into a series of immutable transformations, that can easily be combined. This is where the significance of testing and high code coverage becomes an important factor for the project\u2019s success.", "In the offline layer, the Data Preparation Service, is triggered by the completion of the ingestion service.

For instance select a random 70% of the source data for training and the complement of this random subset for testing.\u2022 Use either of the methods above (sequential vs. random) but also shuffle the records within each dataset.\u2022 Use a custom injected strategy to split the data, when an explicit control over the separation is needed.", "The data segregation is not a separate ML pipeline as such, but an API or service must be available to facilitate this task. The next two pipelines (model training and evaluation) must be able to call this API to get back the requested datasets. In terms of code organisation, a strategy pattern is necessary so the caller service can select the right algorithm at run time, and obviously the ability to inject the ratio or random seed is needed. Additionally, the API must be able to return the data with or without labels/traits \u2014 for training and evaluation respectively.", "To protect the caller from specifying parameters that cause an uneven data distribution, a warning should be raised and returned along with the dataset.", "Use the training subset of data to let the ML algorithm recognise the patterns in it.", "The model training pipeline is offline only and its schedule varies depending on the criticality of the application, from every couple of hours to once a day. Apart from schedulers, the service is also time and event triggered.", "It consists of a library of training model algorithms (linear regression, ARIMA, k-means, decision trees etc), which is built in a SOLID way to make provision for continuous development of new model types as well as making them interchangeable. Also containment, using the facade pattern, is a crucial technique for integrating third-party APIs (this is where your Python Jupyter notebook can be wrapped and called too).", "There are a few options for parallelisation:", "\u2022 The simplest form is to have a dedicated pipeline for each model, i.e. all models run concurrently.\u2022 Another idea is to parallelise the training data i.e. the data is partitioned and each partition has a replica of the model. This is preferred for those models that they need all fields of an instance to perform the computation (e.g. LDA, MF).\u2022 A third option is to parallelise the model itself i.e. the model is partitioned and each partition is responsible for the updates of a portion of parameters. It is ideal for Linear models, such as LR, SVM.\u2022 Finally, a hybrid approach can be used, combining one or more options. (For more info I recommend you read this publication).", "Model training must be implemented with error tolerance in mind and also data checkpoints and failover on training partitions should be enabled \u2014 e.g. each partition can be retrained if the previous attempt fails due to some transient issue (e.g. timeout).", "Since we covered the capabilities of this pipeline, let\u2019s unpack the workflow: The Model Training Service gets the training configuration parameters (e.g. model type, hyper-parameters, features to be used etc) from the Configuration Service and will then request the training dataset from the Data Segregation API. This dataset is sent to all the models in parallel and once complete, the models, the original configuration, the learned parameters, plus metadata on the training set and timings, will be saved in the Model Candidate Data Store.", "Assess the performance of the model using the test subset of data to understand how accurate the prediction is.", "This pipeline is also offline. The predictive performance of a model is evaluated by comparing predictions on the evaluation dataset with true values using a variety of metrics. The \u201cbest\u201d model on the evaluation subset is selected to make predictions on future/new instances. A library of several evaluators is designed to provide a model\u2019s accuracy metrics (e.g. ROC curve, PR curve), which are also saved against the model in the data store. Again, same patterns are applicable here to allow flexibility on combining and switching between evaluators.", "In terms of orchestration, the Model Evaluation Service requests the evaluation dataset from the Data Segregation API, and for each model sourced from the Model Candidate repository, it applies the relevant evaluators. The evaluation results are saved back to the repository. This is an iterative process and hyperparameter optimisation as well as regularisation techniques are also applied to come up with the final model. The best model is marked for deployment. Finally, the notification service broadcasts that a model is ready for deployment.", "This pipeline also needs to live up to all the reactive traits.", "Once the chosen model is produced, it is typically deployed and embedded in decision-making frameworks.", "Model deployment is not the end; it is just the beginning!", "The best model selected is deployed for offline (asynchronous) and online (synchronous) predictions. More than one models can be deployed at any time to enable safe transition between old and new models \u2014 i.e. whendeploying a new model, the services need to keep serving prediction requests.", "Traditionally, a challenge in deployment has been that the programming languages needed to operationalise models have been different from those that have been used to develop them. Porting a Python or R model into a production language like C++, C# or Java is challenging, and often results in reduced performance (speed & accuracy) of the original model. There are a few ways to address this issue.

Once a batch prediction request is made, you can load it dynamically into memory as a separate process, call the prediction functions, unload it from memory and free up the resources (native handles).\u2022 Finally another approach is to wrap the library into an API and let the caller invoke it directly or wrap it around their service to fully take over the reins of the prediction instrumentation.", "In terms of scalability, multiple parallel pipelines can be created to accommodate the load. This involves inconsiderable effort, as the ML models are stateless.", "\u2022 Here the prediction model can be deployed in a container to a service cluster, generally distributed in many servers behind a queue for load balancing to assure scalability, low latency and high throughput. The clients can send prediction requests as network remote procedure calls (RPC).\u2022 Alternatively, key-value stores (e.g Redis) support the storage of a model and its parameters, which gives a big boost on performance.", "\u2733\ufe0f With regards to the actual model deployment activity, it can be automated via a continuous delivery implementation: The required files are packaged, the model is validated by a reliable testing suite and is finally deployed into a running container.The tests are executed by an automated build pipeline: Short, self-contained, stateless unit tests are evaluated first.

Models should behave the same in both offline and online modes when serving predictions.", "In the offline layer, the Scoring Service is optimised for high throughput, fire-and-forget predictions for a large collection of data. An application can send an asynchronous request to kick off the scoring process, but needs to wait until the batch scoring process completes before it can access the prediction results. The service prepares the data, generates the features, but also fetches extra features from the Feature Data Store. Once scoring takes place, the results are saved in the Score Data Store. A message is sent to the broker to notify that the scoring has completed. The application is listening to this event and when notified it fetches the scores.", "A client sends a request to the Online Scoring Service. It can optionally specify the version of the model to be invoked, so the Model Router inspects the request and sends it to the respective model. Based on the request, similarly to the offline layer, the service prepares the data, generates the features, and optionally fetches extra features from the Feature Data Store. Once scoring takes place, the results are saved in the Score Data Store and then sent back to the client over the network.", "Depending on the use-case, scores can also be delivered to the client asynchronously i.e. independently of the request:\u2022 Push: Once the scores are generated, they are pushed to the caller as a notification.\u2022 Poll: Once the scores are generated, they are stored in a low read-latency database; the caller periodically polls the database for available predictions.", "In order to minimise the time the system takes to serve the scoring when it receives the request, two methods are employed:\u2022 the input features are stored in a low-read latency in-memory data store,\u2022 predictions precomputed in an offline batch-scoring job are cached for easy access [this is depending on the use-case, as offline predictions might not be relevant].", "The model is continuously monitored to observe how it behaved in the real world and calibrated accordingly.", "Any ML solution requires a well-defined performance monitoring solution.

The Performance Monitoring Service, is notified when a new prediction is served, executes the performance evaluation, persists the results and the relevant notifications are raised. The evaluation itself takes place by comparing the scores to the observed outcomes generated by the data pipeline (training set). The basic implementation for monitoring can follow different approaches with the most popular being logging analytics (Kibana, Grafana, Splunk etc).", "To ensure built-in resilience of the ML system, a poor speed performance of the new model triggers the scores to be generated by the previous model. A \u201cbetter wrong than late\u201d philosophy is adopted: if a term in the model takes too long to be computed, the model is substituted by a previously deployed model, rather than blocking.", "Additionally, the scores are joined to the observed outcomes when they become available \u2014 that means that continuous accuracy measurements of the model are generated, and along the same lines with speed performance, any sign of degradation can be dealt with by reverting to the previous model.", "A chain of responsibility pattern can be used to chain the different versions together.", "Model monitoring is a continuous process: a shift in prediction might result in restructuring the model design.
