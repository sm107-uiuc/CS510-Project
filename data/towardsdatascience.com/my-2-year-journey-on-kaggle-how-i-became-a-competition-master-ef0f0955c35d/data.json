In that story, I very briefly described my journey on Kaggle. In this story, I will describe in more detail the 3 competitions that marked my journey the most. I will then write several topics on how to approach any competition.", "Salt deposits below the Earth surface occur in several areas of the planet. Seismic imaging allows experts to identify such salt bodies. This is a very time-consuming task and leads to subjective results. In this competition, kagglers were asked to build a segmentation algorithm to identify automatically and accurately the bodies of salt in the seismic images.", "This was the first competition I participated in which I already had a basic idea of how to train a model and make some experiments to improve my score \u2014 mostly thanks to fastai course \u201cPractical Deep Learning for Coders\u201d by Jeremy Howard.", "I started with a public kernel. Over the 3 months of competition, I kept trying more and more ideas, most of which I found in Kaggle discussions. Back then, I didn\u2019t really have any strategy defined other than trying as many ideas as I could. And mostly, the ideas other competitors claimed to help in their models.", "In the end, I\u2019ve been able to get a bronze medal (top 10%) scoring 186th place out of 3229, not far away from the silver range (top 5%). I was really happy with my achievement! But most importantly, by working on this competition and trying a lot of ideas, I improved my skills as a Deep Learning practitioner.", "There\u2019s really no course or book to make you an expert in practical Deep Learning. It\u2019s like learning to play a musical instrument. You can learn all about the instrument but if you want to be good at it you will need many many hours of practice.", "Scientists use photo surveillance systems to monitor the whale population in an effort to preserve and protect these magnificent giants of the ocean. The shape and markings of whales\u2019 tails are like fingerprints that allow to uniquely identify each individual. Over the past decades, this time-consuming identification work has been done manually by scientists. In this competition, kagglers were asked to build an algorithm to identify the individual whales based on pictures of the tails.", "This competition is perhaps the most interesting case study for me. When I joined the competition I was thinking it\u2019s just one more image classification competition. Nothing to worry about, right? Wrong. I soon realised that using the basic image classification techniques resulted in very poor performance. The problem is that for some of the whales there are just a few samples on the dataset. Sometimes only one! There are also many whales in the dataset that haven't been identified before and should be labelled as new whales. I had no idea how to even get started on such a problem.", "During the first month of the competition, I spend time reading scientific articles about few-shot learning, person re-identification and so on. There were a lot of new concepts to learn such as training by episodes. That\u2019s why it took me a while just to understand the concepts to a point that I could implement them in code and start making progress on the competition.", "Even after understanding the basic concepts and terminology, this was not a walk in the park but more like climbing the Everest. I tracked my progress over time with some annotations that I plotted in the image below.", "As you can see, it took me about two weeks to get close to the score of the best public kernel. This means that all that time I kept working and trying new ideas but my ranking in the leaderboard was practically unchanged as it is usual for many kagglers to submit the best publicly available solution. I do that myself sometimes, but this competition was not the case.", "One of the articles that made a big impact in my solution was \u201cIn Defense of the Triplet Loss for Person Re-Identification\u201d. I found it very well written and convincing. So much so that I decided to move forward and implement the idea. That idea together with the idea of sampling the most difficult examples as training progresses made a big impact on my result. As I implemented the new ideas and debugged my code I was able to gradually move up on the leaderboard ending up in 57th place of 2129 with a final score of 0.92988. Still far from the top score of 0.97309 but, nevertheless, I never expected to be able to get up to 0.9 until the last two weeks of competition.", "Overall, this was by far the competition where I learned the most. It was proof that, after knowing the basics, 3 months of work are enough to approach any new Deep Learning project. Even if it requires learning completely new concepts.", "Being able to automatically and accurately recognize sounds in a noisy environment is a difficult challenge. In this competition, kagglers were asked to develop an algorithm to attribute one or multiple tags to audio data of a set of 80 categories.", "This competition was quite different for me. I\u2019m used to working with spectrograms in my music projects and therefore I started with good motivation. I was able to get up to the top places of the leaderboard at the beginning. That gave me more motivation to keep working and improving my models. Indeed this strategy was successful and I was able to keep a position near the top for the 2 months of the competition and get 6th place of 880 as a final result. Of course, this wasn\u2019t an easy task, the competition was very strong as it is usual in Kaggle. In this competition, I really felt the anxiety of being close to the top and fighting every day to keep that position for 2 months. I had a good rest after the competition ended!", "After the end of the competition, I wrote a Medium story describing my solution. You can find it in the link below.", "Let\u2019s now move on to, perhaps, the most important section of this story!", "If you combine all these ideas with experience of working in several competitions, you will be ready to face any Deep Learning problem successfully. Most of the times it won\u2019t be easy. It will require time and effort. But it will lead you to good results and a great learning journey.", "Pro tip: If you are struggling to get a solo gold medal (a requirement for the ranking of competition grand-master) try the following: choose a competition that is more aligned with your personal interest, preferably a research competition, and work hard on it. Usually, research competitions propose problems that require new ideas and creative thinking. If you understand the topic and you put the hours of work, it is more likely that you will get a top score. In the more traditional competitions with thousands of participants sometimes the difference among top-scoring teams is almost residual. Finishing in the top positions may require some luck. Also, be aware of your constraints. If you have GPU constraints choose a competition with a smaller dataset to make sure you are not in a disadvantage.", "I hope you enjoyed this story and that it can help and inspire you in your Kaggle journey! I\u2019m planning to write a series of stories about getting started with Deep Learning using Pytorch, please consider subscribing to my mailing list in this link, in case you don\u2019t want to miss any future updates!", "Thanks for reading!
