In this study, I worked with a team of researchers and created a difficulty translation model for histopathology images. In other words, given some image of cancer, we modified it into an image that was harder to classify. This is based on the motivation that these images have a range of features that determines how they would be classified, which differs from general computer vision datasets like ImageNet (e.g. there is no range of cats and dogs).", "If you\u2019d like a more technical description of our work, the full paper can be found here.", "The Dataset. The dataset is made of colorectal cancer images from the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center \u2014 it has been split into a training set of 2,051 images and a testing set of 1,101 images. Each of these images were labeled as either a hyper-plastic polyp (HP) or a sessile serrated adenoma (SSA).", "The Model. Our module consists of a scorer, which predicts the difficulty of a given image, and a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) image translator, which translates images that are easy to classify into images that are harder to classify. With this configuration, the module is able to translate a given image into a similar example that would be classified with the same label but would be harder to classify.", "Generating Harder Training Data. In the module, we have set the image translator\u2019s source domain as easy HP images and set the target domain to be hard HP images. By doing so, the image translator learns to convert easy HP images into hard HP images.", "To evaluate the difficulty of the translated images, we performed a Turing Test with three expert pathologists. Each pathologist was given 75 randomly sampled real easy HP images, 75 randomly sampled real hard HP images, 75 generated HP images that were translated from the selected easy HP images, and 75 SSA images. The pathologists were asked to classify each image as HP or SSA. We found that pathologists disagreed more on generated images than their real counterparts, meaning that the generated images were indeed harder to classify. The full results can be seen below.", "Improving the Performance of Classifiers. The generated images can also be used as additional data to better train deep learning classifiers. To test this, we first added generated HP images back into the original training dataset. Then, we trained a new classifier on this new training dataset and compared its performance with our previous classifier. We compared our method with a more simple method of data augmentation where easy and hard images are spliced together, finding that we outperformed the baseline augmentation and that using generated images as augmented data consistently improved performance. The full results can be seen below.", "Summary. In our study, we demonstrated that changing the difficulty of images and using the difficult examples as additional data is a promising method of improving the performance of deep learning classifiers. On our dataset, our method was able to improve performance by about 2%, a significant improvement. We hope that these results encourage others to explore the use of changing image difficulty in other contexts such as curriculum learning or adversarial attacks.", "If you would like to read our full paper, it can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
