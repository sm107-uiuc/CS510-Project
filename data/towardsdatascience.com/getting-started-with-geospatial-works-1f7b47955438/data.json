Data which contains geographic content in it is classified as geospatial data. This includes coordinates, postal codes, city, or address. But only coordinates are not enough to understand the whole dataset. There must be some notation about that coordinates, for example, the name of the location which the coordinates represent. We call it attribute data.", "Still not sure? Have a look at the data below.", "Here, the number and name of the volcanoes are attribute data and the location, latitude, and longitude are geospatial data. Examples make things a thousand times easier, don\u2019t they?", "As we already discussed, GIS data can be primarily separated into two categories \u2014 Spatially referenced and attribute data. The spatially referenced data can be further classified into two dissimilar types \u2014 Vector and Raster. Let\u2019s dig what vector and raster data types are.", "Vector data consists of individual points which are stored as pairs of (x,y) coordinates. These points further can be joined in a particular order to create lines or joined in closed rings to create polygons. Let\u2019s understand all three different types \u2014 Point, Line (or arc), and Polygon.", "Point data is commonly used to represent separate data points and nonadjacent (not next to each other) features. To represent point data we can use the radius and different colors to differentiate features from each other. Examples would be, pointing out volcanoes (banner image of this article), locating government offices, schools, and shopping malls in a particular city.", "Line data is, of course, used to represent linear features. These features have both starting and ending points. We commonly use solid lines versus dotted lines or a combination of colors or even line thickness to distinguish features from one another. Primary examples would be roads, rivers or metro lines.", "Polygon data is used to represent boundaries of lakes, cities, or even forest. These features are two dimensional and can be used to measure the area of the desired geographic feature. This map below shows unemployment in the US which describes polygon data perfectly.", "Both \u2014 vector and raster \u2014 data have different file formats. It would be really difficult for any GIS analyst to process an unknown GIS file, therefore it\u2019s good to know what type of file format you are going to work on. There are some common and uncommon formats, let\u2019s understand what they are and how they work.", "The other type, raster data, is used to represent surfaces. It is cell-based data which consists of a matrix of cells (or pixels) organized into columns and rows (or grid) where each cell represent information. Simplifying it a bit, a digital photo is an example of raster data where each pixel value represent a particular color. Other examples of raster data would be aerial photographs, digital elevation model, or even scanned maps.", "Raster data too have specific file types. As they are made up of grid, they are, in most cases, regularly spaces and squared but not always. Here are some of them.", "We now know what type of files are there in geospatial works. But where do we get them? We must get the data from reliable sources so that the data files we fetch have less uncommon formats.", "With the help of dedicated analysis packages, we can easily visualize small as well as large scale data. Even if you have zero experience dealing with packages, it comes with a minimal learning curve. So don\u2019t worry just dive in.", "With these free GIS software, you have to power to get the job done as if you are you are working with proprietary GIS software.", "Learning something new sometimes could be a tedious task without apt resources. That\u2019s why we decided to put together pieces and create an ultimate article to get you started with geospatial works. We would love to know if this guide helped you in any way \u2014 especially getting started with geospatial works.", "About Locale: We started Locale with a personal problem. As data scientists working with geospatial data, the existing analytics products were futile in our daily workflows. Hence, we had to build our own tools for our everyday workflows.", "We then realized data scientists around the globe face similar problems. As a result, businesses are struggling to attain operational efficiency using their location data. We intend to solve this pain once and for all. Thus, we are building a tool completely from scratch to deal with real-time geospatial data at scale. Learn more here.", "If you want to know more about what we do, shoot us an email with all your questions at aditi@locale.ai.
