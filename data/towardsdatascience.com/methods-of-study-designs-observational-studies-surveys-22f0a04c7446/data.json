So we should take care to record data in the correct manner so as to avoid getting the wrong result/inference. Also, we should do the correct study/experiment with that data to draw the right inference from them. We will discuss here those methods briefly.", "Studies can be done particularly in 3 ways, of which we will discuss only two here:", "In both cases, we are recording the natural behavior/tendency of a student while he is studying and we are not interfering with their behavior in any way like forcing them to listen to music, etc. So we can call this study Observational Study.", "Again note, in the first scenario we are recording past events. So we call it Retrospective Observational Study. In the second scenario, we are recording events in the future so we call them Prospective Observational Study.", "In Observational studies, there can be the effect of one or more external variables that we do not take into account but can affect our results badly. Such a variable is also called Lurking Variable. For example, suppose we want to observe which method is ideal for citizens to quit drugs- a.) taking some medicines/anti-drugs after consulting a doctor or b.) simply doing nothing or not taking any doctor\u2019s advice.", "Let surprisingly our results show that, doing nothing gives a better result. It might be because those who do nothing and not go to the doctor have a stronger desire/willpower to quit drugs. So desire becomes a lurking variable here.", "2. Sample Surveys: Here, individuals report their values for the variable being tested themselves to the researcher through some means. These means include persons visiting from house to house and recording observations, sending questionnaires through email, telephonic interviews, internet surveys, etc.", "Bias is a big issue in the case of surveys. Unfairness in the methodology in which collecting data/records is called bias. It is a serious problem in surveys and results in the deduction of wrong inference from collected data.", "Let us first discuss some common type of biases we come across in surveys:", "Convenience Bias or Convenience Sample: Chosen solely in accordance with the convenience of the person conducting the survey. Suppose you want to take feedback on a particular product from the customers who bought it. But you only ask feedback from the first 50 buyers for your convenience. Now it is wrong because it might be the case that the last few buyers have got defective products. So we are neglecting them. The best way is to choose people at random.", "Volunteer/ self-selected Bias: Here individuals themselves choose to be part of the survey. Suppose, a survey is going on to calculate the average income of a particular place. The participants have to come to the survey center and record their income. Obviously successful and higher-income people will go spontaneously to record their income but lower-income people may feel shy to disclose their income. Here only higher-income people are volunteering to participate in the survey so we won\u2019t get the real estimate of the average income of the particular place.", "Non-response Bias: Where individuals fail to complete or return their survey response form or refuse to answer. In the above example, lower-income people refuse to be part of the survey causing non-response bias.", "Response Bias: Individuals take the survey but don\u2019t answer the questions correctly. Suppose after an election, a survey is done to call the people and ask if they have cast their votes. Now, after the survey, it was found that the number of people who said yes is much more than the public record. Clearly here many participants have lied i.e, said yes in spite of not casting their vote because they want to be deemed as a responsible citizen of the country as all responsible citizens cast votes.", "Undercoverage Bias: The survey doesn\u2019t include appropriate representation from certain groups in a target population. Eg: Suppose the authority of a school is conducting a survey for assessing the quality of the teacher for each grade. But they forget to include 7th and 8th Grade. So not all grades of a school are included in the survey. This is undercoverage bias.", "While forming questions for the survey, it should be remembered that:", "a. Open questions are less restrictive but the answers/responses can be difficult to summarize.", "b. Closed question has a high chance of being bias.", "c. Questions should be neutral, and it should not influence the answer to any upcoming question, easy to understand and should be able to extract honest responses from participants.", "Note: Sometimes in the options provided for the questions we often see options like \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cchoose not to answer\u201d. The former is used when the participant is unaware of the topic or has forgotten about the topic.", "\u201cchoose not to answer\u201d is used when a sensitive/offensive/embarrassing question is asked. Eg: For any medical-related or AIDS-related survey, they ask What protective measure you take while having intercourse? Many may find it embarrassing to answer the question.", "What is wrong with the question \u201cDo you go to Amazom.com frequently and do you indulge in online shopping frequently?\u201d", "It has two questions in one so it might confuse participants to choose their answer as many participants would use Amazon.com but do online shopping rarely while others do frequent online shopping but from other sites like Snapdeal etc.", "Your home for data science.
