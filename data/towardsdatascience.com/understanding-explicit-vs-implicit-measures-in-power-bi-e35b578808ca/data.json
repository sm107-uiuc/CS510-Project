Or, to be more specific, the concept itself is not a big issue, but the most daunting thing for Power BI rookies is to understand when to use which.", "Since I\u2019ve already written about the use-cases for both Calculated Columns and Measures, and briefly explained different scenarios when you want to use each of those, while recently presenting at the New Stars of Data conference, I\u2019ve got a question to explain the difference between explicit and implicit measures. I\u2019ve already answered here shortly, but I promised to dedicate a separate article to this topic.", "So, in this article, I will focus solely on Measures, and try to explain in-depth the difference between explicit and implicit measures.", "Ok, you\u2019ve heard about Measures in Power BI, and that\u2019s it. What on Earth are now implicit measures?! Or explicit? Don\u2019t panic, keep reading and I promise you that by the end of this article, you will have a good understanding of those two and what are their main advantages and downsides.", "Implicit measures \u2014 \u201cThank you\u201d Power BI", "First of all, I know that we all like things that are automatically created for us, and Power BI does pretty well in that regard. One of the things Power BI performs for us is creating of implicit measures.", "As you can notice in the illustration above, Power BI identified numeric fields in our data model and automatically marked them with the Sigma sign. That means that these column values will be summarized, once you drag them to a report visual.", "Let\u2019s check how this works in reality:", "I\u2019ve dragged my productID column into the table visual and I see that Power BI automatically applied some kind of aggregation. Now, you can define what type of aggregation you want to apply to a specific column, or not to aggregate at all (hint: choose Don\u2019t Summarize option):", "Here, Power BI performed the Count aggregate function over my productID column. Looking at the picture above, one can (too) easily conclude that there is a lot of flexibility when working with implicit measures \u2014 you can choose between a bunch of predefined aggregations, including even fancy statistics\u2019 calculations, such as Standard Deviation, Variance, or Median\u2026All of that, with just one single click!", "So, why should someone bother writing DAX, when (almost) everything is already pre-baked for us?", "Before I show you why using implicit measures can come back to haunt you, let me just shortly overview how implicit measures work with non-numeric fields in your data model.", "My text field InteractionType can be summarized in four different ways: First, Last, Count (Distinct), and Count. Of course, it can be also non-summarized, like in the example above.", "Similar, Date columns offer their own set of predefined aggregations:", "No matter how appealing looks the possibility to save time and effort by using automatically created measures, you should try to avoid that, as it comes with some obvious downsides.", "Imagine that you have a non-additive or semi-additive measure, such as the Unit price of the product, or bank account balance. You don\u2019t want these values to be simply summed in your report, as that is not expected behavior for those measures. Therefore, it can easily happen that your report produces unexpected incorrect outcomes if implicit measures are being used.", "Another limitation of implicit measures is that you can\u2019t use them in multiple different aggregation types. Let\u2019s say that I want to know both the total number of my customers, but also the total number of unique (distinct) customers. By using implicit measure, I can choose only one of those options\u2026", "Writing measures in an explicit way, using DAX language, requires more time and effort in the beginning since you need to do some manual work. But, you will bear the fruits later, believe me.", "Back to our previous challenge \u2014 to display both the total number of customers and the total number of unique (distinct) customer in our report can be easily solved using explicit measures:", "So, as you can notice, we used the same column as a reference to multiple different measures, to produce the desired outcome.", "While implicit measures can support some really basic scenarios, as soon as your report needs more complex calculations, you\u2019ll have to switch to explicit measures.", "However, the main advantage of using explicit measures instead of implicit ones is their reusability. You define measure once and you can refer to it as many times as you need.", "The other obvious benefit is the easier maintenance of the data model. If you create a base explicit measure, such as:", "You can use this measure as a reference in 20 other different measures (for example, to calculate gross margin, YoY, etc.)! If any background logic needs to be changed, you will change it at only one single place (in the base measure), and all referring measures will automatically apply the new logic.", "Now, as you learned the difference between implicit and explicit measures and obvious benefits from using the latter, let me wrap-up with some best practices regarding working with measures in your reports:", "In this example, I defined both Total Customers and Total Unique Customers measures, so I don\u2019t want someone to perform a SUM of customerID. Therefore, I will hide the customerID column in the Fields list.", "However, this will just move the measure from one table to another, which doesn\u2019t solve the problem. In order to tackle this, I need to create a brand new table which will hold my measures only.", "Under the Home tab, select Enter Data and create a plain empty table called RepMeasures:", "Click Load and you will see a new table in your model. After that, click on your measure, and under the Home table, select RepMeasures.", "Finally, just simply delete Column 1 and you are good to go.", "This way, you can separate and group your measures. Trust me, it will make your life much easier, especially once you create multiple measures in your report.", "As I\u2019ve already said: we all prefer to take an easier path to meet our goals. That\u2019s completely legitimate, and Power BI is your \u201cbest friend\u201d when it comes to supporting you on that path.", "However, there are many important considerations to take into account when choosing which path to take. I don\u2019t want to say: never use implicit measures! By writing this article, I just wanted to point out some possible pitfalls and limitations when using them, and why you should still prefer writing explicit measures instead.", "Become a member and read every story on Medium!", "Subscribe here to get more insightful data articles!", "Your home for data science.
