That is why predictable sources of energy like fossil fuels, or nuclear power, is still favorable. However, the risk of energy shortfall will continually exist, driving us to use finance \u2014 to predict and avoid shortages in energy production that possibly cause power outages in the future. One can consider harnessing renewable energy to confront this challenge.", "Among those renewable energy sources to date, some are dependent on the environment, such as wind energy. As the name implies, the energy will be produced by the wind blows varying in speed and direction. Unfortunately, being the only trigger of producing power, the wind blows are a clear objection in utilizing this alternative energy.", "In short, we have three parties that take part in this energy-matter \u2014 Grid Operators, Energy Producers, and Energy Traders. Grid operators are responsible for providing society with a steady supply of electrical energy. Otherwise, the government will fine them if there are power outages. Next, the suppliers will manage the risk of energy shortfall, wind energy producers. Typically, energy traders will help suppliers forecast energy production for sale to the grid beforehand. In other words, energy traders serve to maximize profits on behalf of their clients.", "We will play the role of an energy trader. The goal is to get a T+18 hour energy forecast every hour! Using our energy forecasting model and the given trading algorithm, we will maximize profits for our client, which is wind energy producers. We will build the forecast model based on time-series datasets using deep learning (neural network) \u2014 specifically the difference network architecture.", "source: Deep Learning Datathon 2020 (by ai4impact)", "We will work with two different datasets as follows:", "1. Wind Energy ProductionSource: R\u00e9seau de Transport d\u2019\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 (RTE), the French energy transmission authority", "This dataset, named energy-ile-de-france, contains the consolidated near-realtime wind energy production (in kWh) for \u00cele-de-France region surrounding Paris that have been averaged and standardized to a time base of 1 hour. The data is provided from 01 January 2017 to the present.", "The data is not really regular, but we can still see some trends. For example, the spikes of energy are most common in the winter, and the transition between seasons. So far, the largest energy produced occurred in the winter 2019\u20132020 which is up to 89000 kWh. The basic statistics of the data are presented below.", "2. Wind ForecastsSource: Terra WeatherThe data comes with 2 different wind forecast models (A and B), for 8 location wind farms in the \u00cele-de-France region. Hence, there are 16 forecasts where each has 2 variables: wind speed (m/s) and wind direction as a bearing (degrees North \u2014 ie. 45 degrees means the wind blows from the northeast). The forecasts are updated daily every 6 hours and have been interpolated to the time base of 1 hour.", "The wind speed graph has a similar trend to the energy one, indicating that this forecast data can be useful to our model as input features. Referring to this, the strongest wind occurs in the winter which is up to 12 m/s. The basic statistics of wind data are presented below.", "Compared to the wind speed forecasts, the wind direction pattern is tough to decipher. But we will see that even for such data can still bring benefit to our forecast model.", "In the end, our raw data is arranged as follows:", "To speed up the training process, we will normalize our data to have zero mean and variance 1 using the formula below.", "Now we have each feature on the same scale. Note that we only normalize energy and wind speed. The wind direction values will have special treatment later.", "Next, we will obtain the baseline based on persistence risk. We extract the baseline risk using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).", "Using the difference network architecture, we fit the training and test set well on risk function (MSE and MAE). The difference network helps us achieve better learning to beat this baseline. As a reminder, the objective is to get energy forecasts with a lead time of 18 hours.", "The followings are a few hyperparameters we can turn on:", "Indeed, the lists are quite overwhelming :). But bear with us, as you will know what each will contribute to the model we build. Since we have experimented many times, we will only show you the settings that improve our goal.", "Note: Each experiment uses 10000 max iterations and the early stopping method.", "Input Scaling Subnet + 4 Hidden Layers (with Dropout)", "In the first experiment, we try to create a low MAE (and MSE) that will beat the baseline. Therefore, we want our network to be deep and big enough without overfitting. As a result, we use Adam to achieve better learning and add a regularization method called the dropout layer to prevent overfitting. We use a 4-layer network with the multi-configuration as follows:", "Windowing is a basic operation for time-series data. Thus, for the input features, we use a window consisting of 60 hours of past energy produced (T-60). Then we turn the window into DIFF-momentum-force inputs with a lead time of 18 hours. It will result in 72 features. This adjustment helps the model detect movement and its rate to perform better clustering.", "We also add an average of 60 hours of past wind speed forecasted and the wind speed forecast at T+18h from each wind model. This generates 4 more features. Thus, we have 76 input features in total ready to feed to the input scaling subnet. Since we use relatively large inputs, this subnet reduces unwanted features before supplying it to the main network.", "In summary, these are the list of our input features:", "Input Scaling Subnet + 4 Hidden Layers (with Dropout + L2 Regularization)", "With the same model as before, we add the L2 regularization into our model. We also run multiconfiguration while taking the best hyperparameters into account.", "We add new input features from the wind direction forecast. Although it\u2019s a bit nonsense to add direction data as our input, a steady wind direction does help. Thus, we do not want to normalize direction naively, yet we will use trigonometric functions to \u2018normalize\u2019 it. In addition to the previous one, now we have 84 input features in total.", "In summary, these are the addition to our input features:", "Input Scaling Subnet + 4 Hidden Layers (with Dropout + L2 Regularization)", "By setting the best hyperparameters fixed, the followings are our network configuration:", "We include new statistic features as the new additional inputs, taken from energy and wind speed data. In the end, we have 88 input features in total.", "Previously, the final model above has been done 40 repeats of training where each takes a maximum of 10000 iterations. Note that we use MAE for the loss function as it gives a higher profit to the clients. The statistics of the test losses are shown below.", "This article is part of the project documentation during the Deep Learning Datathon 2020 organized by ai4impact.Team: AvektiveMember: Diardano Raihan, Mitchell Edbert, M.
