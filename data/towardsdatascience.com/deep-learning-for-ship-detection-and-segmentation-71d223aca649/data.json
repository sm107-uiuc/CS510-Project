Click here to read the full story with my Friend Link!", "Ship detection from remote sensing imagery is a crucial application for maritime security which includes among others traffic surveillance, protection against illegal fisheries, oil discharge control and sea pollution monitoring. This is typically done through the use of an Automated Identification System (AIS), which uses VHF radio frequencies to wirelessly broadcast the ships location, destination and identity to nearby receiver devices on other ships and land-based systems.", "AIS are very effective at monitoring ships which are legally required to install a VHF transponder, but fail to detect those which are not, and those which disconnect their transponder. So how do you detect these uncooperative ships? This is where satellite imagery can help. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery uses radio waves to image the Earth\u2019s surface. Unlike optical imagery, the wavelengths which the instruments use are not affected by the time of day or meteorological conditions, enabling imagery to be obtained day or night, with cloudy, or clear skies. Satellites are collecting these images which could be used to make algorithms for ship detection and segmentation.", "This project is a part of the Airbus Ship Detection Challenge held on Kaggle.", "Build an algorithm to automatically identify whether a remotely sensed target is a ship or not. The algorithm had to be extremely accurate because lives and billions of dollars in energy infrastructure is at stake.", "The dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle website which can be found here.", "This is a typical instance segmentation problem. I have used Mask-R-CNN in this project.", "Without much ado, let\u2019s get started with the code. The complete project on github can be found here.", "I started with loading all the libraries and dependencies required.", "Next I set up the working directory and files.", "I continued with defining functions for showing some sample images with a ship mask and an encoded and decoded mask. Here masks are used as ground truth images.", "Next I split the images into two sets that is training and validation sets.", "After that I loaded Mask-R-CNN model from my forked repository. The original repository can be found here.", "Then I created a class with three functions for loading dataset, loading masks and taking images as a reference.", "I also created another class for similar work with gpu enabled. Because of the huge dataset size working with gpu is a must in this case. As an additional piece of information, google colab and kaggle kernels are currently free cloud based gpu providers.", "I continued with writing scripts to load the training dataset.", "Let\u2019s visualize what we have got till now.", "So far so good. I continued with loading the pre trained coco weights from my forked github repository.", "Next I trained the model. I trained for only two epochs for faster results. For proper convergence and good results, it would take much more than that. Feel free to play with the hyper-parameters here.", "In some cases, the model failed when it detected a small island or coastal rocks as ship. In other words the model is generating false positives.", "While at other times the model failed to detect a ship as shown in the image below. In other words the model is generating false negatives.", "Although this project is far from complete but it is remarkable to see the success of deep learning in such varied real world problems. If we are able to detect and segment ships in an image, it would be of great help to the logistics and transportation team in northern countries like Sweden, Norway and Canada. It could bring a whole new dimension of transport for container ships and vessels by tracking ships from satellite images in real time.", "The corresponding source code can be found here.", "Happy reading, happy learning and happy coding.", "If you want to keep updated with my latest articles and projects follow me on Medium.
