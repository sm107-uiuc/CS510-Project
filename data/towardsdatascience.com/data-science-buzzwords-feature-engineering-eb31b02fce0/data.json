I\u2019m just going to cover some of the main ones to give you an idea of the sort of thing Feature Engineering contains, with some indication of widely used methods.", "Encoding \u2014 I think this is one of the most simple and commonly used aspects of Feature Engineering. In fact, I was doing this long before I realised Feature Engineering as a whole existed! Encoding is used to transform your categorical data into numerical data. This is necessary as computational algorithms deal with numbers, not words. A couple of the more simple methods are Label Encoder and One Hot Encoder.", "Feature Generation \u2014 Feature Generation or Feature Construction is where you manually create new features from the ones that you have already got in your data. This might be something as simple as joining two columns together or something that takes a bit more code and calculating how many entries there have been in a certain time period before the one in question. Again, you might do stuff like this anyway, just because it makes your life a bit easier. There are several benefits of Feature Generation:", "Feature Extraction \u2014 This is where you create features automatically directly from the raw data. Normally used for image, audio or text data (though it\u2019s possible to use it for numerical data when there\u2019s loads of it!) You use Feature Extraction to reduce the complexity of the data for analysis, reducing the dimensions of the data, which allows for your model to run more quickly. Common methods to do this are Principle Component Analysis or Unsupervised Clustering algorithms. Points 2 and 3 from the list above are also relevant for this.", "Feature Selection \u2014 This is a super important part of Feature Engineering: once you\u2019ve made a whole load of new features you need to work out which ones are actually useful for you. Now, you can do this with some trial and error, but it is probably more efficient to use a build in function to be able to do that. A simple example of this is Univariate Feature Selection, e.g. SelectKBest, which selects the given number of features (you can decide how many) that have the strongest relationship with the dependent variable. There are lots of options you can use to make sure you\u2019re using the right algorithm for your data.", "There are lots of ways you can manipulate your data to a format that the computer is happy with, simplify it or even create new variables for analysis. There is no \u201cright way\u201d and a lot of it can be an art form and down to experience. Different solutions will work more effectively for different data sets.", "I have linked to Python documentation throughout the article so you can have a look at the parts of interest in more detail, perhaps with a view of implementing the methods in your code.", "Kaggle \u2014 Feature Engineering Short Course. This course isn\u2019t for beginners to programming or Machine Learning. It briefly covers 3 aspects of Feature Engineering. Personally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best course for details and learning in-depth, but it\u2019s a good place to start if you want to dip your toe into the area.", "Your home for data science.
