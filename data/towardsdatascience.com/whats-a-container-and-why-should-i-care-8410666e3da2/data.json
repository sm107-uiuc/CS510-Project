If you follow American sports in any capacity, you likely know enough about Lebron James to hold a meaningful conversation with someone about him. If you don\u2019t keep up with any sports, however, you still likely know his name at the very least given his ever-present image on entertainment and news media, but might find yourself in an uncomfortable situation where someone mentions \u201cThe King\u201d and expects you to simply jump in and know what\u2019s the latest and how many points he dropped last night.", "The same can be said about containers in the technology world. Everywhere we look, someone is writing yet another story about containerizing their gizmo, or that container orchestration is crucial for your business, or that you need to move to a cloud provider which deploys and maintains your containers for you. If you are already privy to containers, these articles are valuable in helping you learn more about how you can further exploit the technology to gain more value. If, however, you don\u2019t fall into this category, the only thing you likely know about containers is that you should know more about containers. This article aims to answer some basic questions on what containers are and how and why you should use them in your work. I will start with the basics using a silly analogy, and eventually progress into more technical descriptions of how containers actually function.", "Before I dive into the tech, let\u2019s start with a simple analogy to explain the purpose of containers and why they are useful. For this example, say that I own a personal cupcake business where I bake and sell cupcakes from my home. I know where everything is in my kitchen, I know how to use my oven and mixers, I have the baking pans I need, know which aisle the sugar is in at my local grocery store, and which brand has the right consistency for my perfect cupcakes. Everything is exactly the way I need it, and I am able to make delicious cupcakes which are all identical and can easily sell them from my home.", "Now, say my cupcakes go viral in central Europe, and potential customers beg me to open a shop in the Alps. What could go wrong? There is an obvious demand, and I am an expert at making my cupcakes, so why not open up a new store to increase my revenue? After moving to Switzerland and renting a new bakery for my business, I quickly run into some issues. Where is the grocery store, and what brand of sugar do I use? Why can\u2019t I find a similar-sized baking pan to what I\u2019m used to? Why does the oven measure in Celsius, and how do I turn on the timer? Where\u2019s the electric mixer I\u2019m used to which mixes the batter consistently every time? I even have to worry about cooking at a different elevation and temperature which changes how items bake. On top of this, I don\u2019t speak Swiss German and can\u2019t ask for help.", "After struggling to make my first batch, the cupcakes sink into themselves and taste bitter and slightly burnt. My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined. What went wrong, and how could this have gone better? Enter the magical shipping container.", "Let\u2019s start from the beginning but make a few changes this time. Instead of running my original business directly out of my house, let\u2019s imagine that I plopped a magical shipping container on my front lawn and worked from there. Now, I mention this is a magical shipping container as I am able to put an infinite supply of everything I need inside this structure and it has plenty of interior space. I design the container exactly how I like it, with my favorite oven, mixer, and pans, plenty of counter space, and all of the ingredients I need for my delicious cupcakes. I even set the container to the perfect temperature, pressure, and humidity so everything will be the same. Since my ingredients never run out, I can work exclusively in this container and sell the cupcakes out of a window I made in the front of the unit (I also conveniently have no other hobbies, obligations, or other human needs to take me away from my work).", "When the cupcakes go viral this time around, instead of dropping everything and trying to start fresh again in Switzerland, I send my magical shipping container overseas and open up again in the mountains. This time, everything in my container is exactly the way I want it. I have all of the materials I need, and can reproduce my cupcakes so they look and taste exactly the same as they did back home, despite being in a completely different environment.", "With this container, when my cupcakes undoubtedly become popular in Beijing, Johannesburg, Rio de Janiero, or even on the moon, I can move my container, or better yet, simply create a duplicate one, and immediately start sharing my wonderful cupcakes with the local clientele. Thanks to my magical container, I no longer have to worry about the underlying environment that I will be working in, and instead can just happily focus on the task at hand.", "As much as we all love cupcakes and magical shipping containers, let\u2019s jump back to reality and see how this correlates with the real world and what makes containers useful.", "Chances are, you\u2019ve either heard or delivered the phrase \u201cstrange, it works for me\u201d at some point in your life. If you\u2019re like a vast majority of the world (myself included), you hate hearing this, but use it as a safety net when you are the one saying it. In the tech world, this little situation occurs more than most would like to admit as hardware, networking, software environments, and even documentation practices vary greatly from person to person and machine to machine, throwing a plethora of random variables into the mix, preventing applications or use-cases from being replicated reliably.", "Even if the dependencies, settings, and other tools are all documented precisely, it can take a very long time to replicate a working setup, and there\u2019s still a possibility that one of the steps could be performed incorrectly. Going back to the cupcake analogy, even if I knew how to find all of the tools and ingredients required for my cupcakes, it would\u2019ve taken me a long time to get everything I needed in a new location instead of bringing my container where I had everything already. With my shipping container, I could start baking immediately instead of wasting days, weeks, or even months to get everything ready.", "Thanks to containers, much of the randomness and wasted time can be eliminated as a standardized image containing only necessary packages, settings, and utilities can be created to ensure a common operating environment, regardless of where an application is being run. With that said, what exactly is a container and how does it work?", "A standard description of a container typically goes along the lines of calling it a \u201clightweight virtual machine (VM)\u201d, or a \u201cnamespace isolator.\u201d While these are both accurate descriptions, they aren\u2019t exactly accessible for all users, and don\u2019t do a reliable job of explaining what they do and how they work. Let\u2019s break them down further for a better understanding.", "For those that don\u2019t know, a VM is, as its name implies, a virtualized computer that runs on a host. In other words, it is an emulated computer system that shares physical resources (memory, CPUs, storage, etc.) with the machine that is running the VM. Virtual machines allow you to run different Operating Systems (OS) on a physical device, without the need to dual-boot into a different OS. The VMs are referred to as \u201cguests,\u201d and every VM runs a unique Guest OS on top of something known as a Hypervisor (which we won\u2019t get into here). As the number of VMs on a single machine scale up, the amount of space and resources to run all of the guests likewise grows, and the host can get bogged down given all of the constraints.", "On the contrary, containers run on top of the host OS, and don\u2019t require a secondary guest OS to function. Each container shares the host\u2019s kernel, and has the potential to share libraries and binaries as necessary. Since these containers don\u2019t require their own independent resources, they end up being much smaller in size than their VM-based peers, hence being referred to as a \u201clightweight VM.\u201d Any particular VM can be several gigabytes in size and take a few minutes to start, while a nearly identical container takes up a few megabytes and can be started in seconds.", "Linux has a special feature known as namespaces which is a way of partitioning or \u201cisolating\u201d between different resources. These namespaces range from lists of users, to process IDs, and networking resources. Any process which uses a different namespace from the host is isolated from the host\u2019s resource. For example, an application with a different user namespace will have a unique set of user ID\u2019s, all with their own permissions as necessary for the specific application. This is useful if you want a specific user to be privileged for an application, but not for the greater host.", "The process of isolating namespaces is the foundation of containers, as by default, all containers use their own unique namespaces apart from the host. This allows greater control and specificity of all applications running inside a container.", "Note, however, that containers aren\u2019t required to be completely isolated from their host. The figure above shows a container sharing the IPC and network namespaces with the host, allowing the container to use the same network interfaces as the host, as well as shared memory. Sharing namespaces is only useful if the application requires it, such as using the same hostname, network interfaces, and IP addresses as the host when sharing the network namespace for a web application.", "Why is all of this important? Given the partitioning of these namespaces, containers become replicable and are more immune to running into various dependency, configuration, or resource issues which prevent applications from reliably running on different machines. As a result, a container can easily be replicated on a completely different system and function as expected as there are no other processes, packages, and settings getting in the way. This also has the added benefit that more complex operations can be completed inside a container without interfering with the host.", "You now hopefully have a decent understanding of what a container is, and what some of the key principles are. Leveraging containers is a great practice to certify your applications are fast, lightweight, and most importantly, reproducible. Even running simple applications in containers can bring massive benefits to your development and deployment of software.", "While you might still be lost on which record \u201cThe King\u201d is chasing next, you are now poised to be the king or queen of containers for your work and understand how they can play crucial a role in achieving your software dreams. Stay tuned for future articles on how to build, run, and deploy containers in practice so you can truly begin ruling your containerized kingdom.", "Your home for data science.
