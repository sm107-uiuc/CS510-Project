It has dramatically increased over the last decades and has become deeply entrenched in our societies.", "Today, the figures are alarming: according to the OECD, the average income of the richest 10% of the population is about 9x that of the poorest 10% across the OECD. This is 7x higher than 25 years ago! The situation is even more worrying in the United State where the richest 1 percent concentrate more on national wealth and income than in any country.", "Faced with this situation, what actions should countries be taking to ensure a fair redistribution of wealth?", "As Amitabh Behar, the CEO of Oxfam India, puts it:", "\u201cThe gap between rich and poor can\u2019t be resolved without deliberate inequality-busting policies\u201d.", "Therefore, despite the critics, tax policy is an indispensable tool for governments. It enables them to redistribute wealth through the services and the benefits they provide and thus reduce inequality.", "And yet, finding the optimal tax policy can be very challenging. Why?", "The main reason is that it has found a comprise of two opposing objectives: equality and productivity. In order words, tax policies must improve equality without undermining people's willingness to work, which would lead to lower productivity.", "Even with these two objectives in mind, it is still hard to determine the most effective tax policy, as it is difficult to carry out real-life experiments. Therefore, it is common to rely on economic theory. But the latter often makes simplifying assumptions that are hard to validate.", "So, how can Artificial Intelligence be used for tax policy design?", "AI and more precisely the field of Reinforcement Learning provides tools to simulate an artificial economy and observe and explore quantitatively the consequences of different policy scenarios.", "It consists of modeling multiple agents. These agents are immersed in a certain environment, which is here a simulated economy with a specific tax policy. For every action they choose to take, they receive rewards or penalties. After many iterations, they eventually learn the optimal decision-making strategy that will allow them to maximize the rewards accumulated over time.", "By observing the behaviors of these agents, it is possible to quantitative measure the efficiency of the tax policy both in terms of agents\u2019 productivity and overall equality.", "How can it be implemented in practice?", "This is exactly what you will discover in my article.", "To go beyond the conceptual framework, I have simulated a simple world in which economic actors interact with each other according to the fiscal constraints set by a social planner. Both the economic actors and the government learn and adapt progressively. They do not use any economic modeling and rely only on observational data.", "In this article, I will describe the methodology I used, and I will share with you my key findings.", "This work is inspired by the research paper The AI Economist: Improving Equality and Productivity with AI-Driven Tax Policies written by S. Zheng & al. in April 2020[1].", "The environment consists of a 2-dimensional grid word where agents are free to move, collect resources (stone or wood), and build houses at each step of an episode. They can also trade the resources they gather for a pre-defined price.", "Over the course of an episode, agents\u2019 earnings evolve depending on the actions they take. More specifically, each action is associated with a labor cost while the action of building houses and trading is a source of income. Moreover, to account for the inequality of competences, their earnings depend on their skills: the higher the agent\u2019s skill is, the higher the cost of his work is.", "At the beginning of the simulation, agents are given the same initial wealth to ensure a sort of equality of opportunity.", "At the end of an episode, each agent receives a reward that reflects the utility he has acquired from the natural and financial resources he has earned, and from the work he has accomplished.", "The utility function used it the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function [2] defined as follows:", "The figure synthesizes the interactions between the agents and the environment.", "Each episode is split into 10 tax periods. At the beginning of each tax period, the social planner chooses the amount of taxes agents must pay depending on their income. These taxes are then evenly redistributed to agents at the end of the tax period. For comparison purposes, the tax policy is specified as a set of tax rates for 3 cut-off income levels. These levels are defined uniformly using on maximum and minimum earning of the agents during the episode.", "The objective of the social planner is to reach the optimal tax policy. But what is the optimal tax policy? The efficiency of a tax policy can be measured through the social welfare function swf which can be expressed as a trade-off between income equality eq and productivity prod.", "Where is the complement of the normalized Gini index on the distribution of agents\u2019 income I", "Therefore, perfect equality is reached when eq = 1.", "Regarding productivity, it can be simply expressed as the sum of all incomes. It is analogous to GDP.", "The figure synthesizes the interactions between the Social Planner and the environment.", "The interactions between the environment agents can be depicted through the following graph:", "The simulation involves the interaction of 9 agents: 3 low skilled (earning 20% less than the average), 3 highly-skilled (earning 20% more than the average), and 3 medium-skilled. The risk aversion coefficient \u03b7 chosen is 0.5. The learning algorithm chosen for both the agents and the social planner is a Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm based on 3 fully connected layers. For more information, you can read this article. The simulation includes 150 episodes, each episode consisting of 100 steps.", "The training of the agents requires long computational times. It\u2019s even longer in the AI-Driven tax policy case, as the Social Planner has also to learn and adapt to the behavior of the economic agents' of the environment. Therefore, the comparison below, which is based on the 50 last episodes, might be biased by the fact that agents in the Free Market scenario and Flat Tax scenario converge sooner.", "Overall, the AI-Driven leads to slightly higher equality than the other scenarios at the expense of productivity. Social welfare is the lowest among the 3 scenarios as the agents learn faster how to adapt to a non-changing tax schedule.", "Beyond the overall results obtained (which would be more telling with computation times longer than the 2 or 3 hours I used), what surprised me the most is the taxes paid by the middle class. As shown in the graph below, agents in this class have the highest rate and pay the most taxes. The research paper [1] also leads to this result (cf. next section). A way of boosting their productivity so that they can access the upper class while providing the lower class with subsidies to help them?", "The environment I designed is intentionally very simplistic: the social planner chooses only 3 tax rates, prices of commodities are fixed, and the value of the house does not depend on the agent skills. This allows stakeholders to learn and adapt more quickly and effectively compared to an environment with more parameters and degrees of freedom.", "In this section, I will present to you the results obtained when the model is more complex. They are taken from the paper [1] which conducted more thorough experimentation and deeper analysis.", "More specifically, the paper compares the AI-driven tax policy (referred to as AI Economist) to the US federal tax schedule (US Federal). This involves cutting out the revenue intervals accordingly and keeping the same breakdown for all tax models. The paper also compares these scenarios to the free-market (no taxes) case (Free Market) and the Saez tax formula (Saez Formula).", "In the paper Using Elasticities to Derive Optimal Income Tax Rates (2001), Saez establishes a formula that aims at reallocating resources where they are needed most.", "More specially, he decomposes the marginal effects of a tax change into 3 effects:", "- Mechanical effect: it refers to the impact on government revenue if no individuals changed their behavior in response. If tax increases, this effect is positive.", "- Behavioral effect: it designates the impact on government revenue caused by a change in people behavioral followed by a tax modification. For instance, if tax increases, people will be discouraged to work harder, and tax revenue would drop. Thus, if tax increase, this effect is negative.", "- Welfare effect: it represents the impact of a tax change on the social welfare through people\u2019s utility. If tax increases, this effect is negative.", "At the optimum, the sum of these effect should be zero. This ultimately leads to the final formula.", "In order to get a sense of Saez tax formula without dwelling on mathematical calculation, let\u2019s suppose that the income distribution follows a Pareto distribution. The probability density of this distribution is represented in the graph below for various parameter \u03b1. The higher is, the thinner the tail of income becomes.", "In this case, Saez formula can be written as:", "This formula has the advantage of being dependent not on an individual\u2019s utility function but on the income distribution. However, tax elasticities of income are difficult to estimate in the real world.", "Other differences between the paper implementation and my experimentation include the training algorithm (Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO vs. DQN), and the type of layers (LSTM vs. Layers), the number of agents (4 vs. 9), and the simulation parameters (in the paper, each episode contains 1000 steps and the simulation consists of 50M steps before convergence and 400M steps additional steps).", "Here are the 3 key findings of the paper:", "1. The AI Economist leads to the best trade-off equality-productivity:", "Overall, the AI Economist achieves the best performance in terms of social welfare: it leads to a 16% improvement over the next best model which is the Saez Formula. This is achieved at the expense of productivity (11% decrease compared to Free Market) but for the benefit of equality (47% compared to the Free Market).", "These results are consistent over the training. The figure below shows that all model converges.", "2. The AI Economist leads to a mix of progressive and regressive tax schedules.", "It fixes a higher top tax rate and a lower tax rate for medium incomes.", "This special structure enables disadvantaged agents to benefit from subsidies and thus ensure a higher equality level. As shown in the graph below, lower-skilled agents have higher net income under the AI Economist than under the other models.", "3. The AI Economist leads to specializing where agents perform better in the respective activity.", "As under the Saez Formula, two kinds of agent profiles emerge from the set-up: high-skilled agents tend to buy resources and build houses whereas other agents are more likely to gather resources and sell them more frequently.", "However, under the AI-driven policy, agents are more productive in their specialization.", "Beyond the results of these experiments, this study is exciting as it paves the way to new methods of testing social policies and analyzing their impacts. It removes the burden of the lack of data and ethical questions that weighs down more traditional approaches when it comes to experimentation.", "In the case of tax policies, the use of Reinforcement Learning enables to recreate specific environments and to put in interaction agents with different objectives. By observing how they adapt to each other, it becomes possible to measure the impact of predefined tax policies and even design one that maximizes the overall social welfare. There are two main advantages of such an approach: (1) it does not rely on economic modeling or any kind of prior assumptions and, (2) is very flexible (another social objective could have been chosen as well).", "Nevertheless, this kind of simulation is not without limitations: their ability to reproduce human behavior and interaction is not guaranteed, the model a relatively small economy and they require important computational time.", "However, I believe that merging Data Science with Economics has the potential to revolutionize the way policies are designed. This would ultimately lead to a significant positive social impact.", "So, get ready, Deep Reinforcement Learning will be the next tool of choice for economists!", "[1] S.
