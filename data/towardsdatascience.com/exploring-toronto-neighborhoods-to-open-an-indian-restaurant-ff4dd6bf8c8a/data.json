Main objectives of this project were to define a business problem, look for data in the web and, use Foursquare location data to compare different neighborhoods of Toronto to figure out which neighborhood is suitable for starting a new restaurant business. In this project, we will go through all the process in a step by step manner from problem designing, data preparation to final analysis and finally will provide a conclusion that can be leveraged by the business stakeholders to make their decisions.", "Toronto, the capital of the province of Ontario, is the most populous Canadian city. Its diversity is reflected in Toronto\u2019s ethnic neighborhoods such as Chinatown, Corso Italia, Greektown, Kensington Market, Koreatown, Little India, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal & Roncesvalles. One of the most immigrant-friendly cities in North America with more than half of the entire Indian Canadian population residing in Toronto it is one of the best places to start an Indian restaurant.", "In this project we will go through step by step process to make a decision whether it is a good idea to open an Indian restaurant. We analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto to identify the most profitable area since the success of the restaurant depends on the people and ambience. Since we already know that Toronto shelter a greater number of Indians than any other city in Canada, it is a good idea to start the restaurant here, but we just need to make sure whether it is a profitable idea or not. If so, where we can place it, so it yields more profit to the owner.", "Who will be more interested in this project? What type of clients or a group of people would be benefitted?", "a) I\u2019m using \u201cList of Postal code of Canada: M\u201d (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) wiki page to get all the information about the neighborhoods present in Toronto.

Using this page I\u2019m going to identify the neighborhoods which are densely populated with Indians as it might be helpful in identifying the suitable neighborhood to open a new Indian restaurant.", "d) To get location and other information about various venues in Toronto I\u2019m using Foursquare\u2019s explore API. Using the Foursquare\u2019s explore API (which gives venues recommendations), I\u2019m fetching details about the venues up present in Toronto and collected their names, categories and locations (latitude and longitude).", "From Foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs), I retrieved the following for each venue:", "a) Scraping Toronto Neighborhoods Table from Wikipedia", "Scraped the following Wikipedia page, \u201cList of Postal code of Canada: M\u201d in order to obtain the data about the Toronto & the Neighborhoods in it.", "Assumptions made to attain the below DataFrame:", "Wikipedia \u2014 package is used to scrape the data from wiki.", "After some cleaning we got the proper dataframe with the Postal code, Borough & Neighborhood information.", "b) Adding geographical coordinates to the neighborhoods", "Next important step is adding the geographical coordinates to these neighborhoods.

As this helps us in identifying the neighborhoods which are densely populated with Indian crowd since that neighborhood would be an ideal place to open an Indian restaurant.", "Scraped the following Wikipedia page, \u201cDemographics of Toronto\u201d in order to obtain the data about the Toronto & the Neighborhoods in it.

The API returns a JSON file and we need to turn that into a data-frame. Here I\u2019ve chosen 100 popular spots for each neighborhood within a radius of 1km.", "Folium is a python library, I\u2019m using it to draw an interactive leaflet map using coordinate data.", "First we will extract the Neighborhood and Indian Restaurant column from the above toronto dataframe for further analysis:", "After performing pandas one hot encoding for the venue categories, let us merge this dataframe with the Toronto DataFrame with latitude & longitude information on neighborhood.

Once we identify those neighborhoods it helps us in deciding where to place the new Indian restaurant. Indian restaurant placed in an densely populated Indian neighborhood is more likely to get more Indian customers than a restaurant placed in a neighborhood with less or no Indian population. Thus this analysis helps in the determining the success of the new Indian restaurant.", "After performing the data cleaning & data analysis we couldn\u2019t identify a big relationship established between densely populated Indian neighborhoods & number of Indian restaurants. This might be because of the missing in data as this an area which can improved in future analysis to get a more insight about the business problem.", "First step in K-means clustering is to identify best K value meaning the number of clusters in a given dataset. To do so we are going to use the elbow method on the Toronto dataset with Indian restaurant percentage.", "After analysing using elbow method using distortion score & Squared error for each K value, looks like K = 6 is the best value.", "Clustering the Toronto Neighborhood Using K-Means with K =6", "Cluster 0 contains all the neighborhoods which has least number of Indian restaurants. It is shown in red color in the map", "Cluster 1 contains the neighborhoods which is sparsely populated with Indian restaurants.

It is shown in blue color in the map.", "Cluster 5 contains all the neighborhoods which is densely populated with Indian restaurants. It is shown in Orange color in the map", "We have reached the end of the analysis, in this section we will document all the findings from above clustering & visualization of the dataset. In this project, we started off with the business problem of identifying a good neighborhood to open a new Indian restaurant. To achieve that we looked into all the neighborhoods in Toronto, analysed the Indian population in each neighborhood & number of Indian restaurants in those neighborhoods to come to conclusion about which neighborhood would be a better spot. We have used variety of data sources to set up a very realistic data-analysis scenario. We have found out that \u2014", "According to this analysis, Scarborough borough will provide the least competition for the new upcoming Indian restaurant as there is very little Indian restaurants spread or no Indian restaurants in few neighborhoods. Also looking at the population distribution looks like it is densely populated with Indian crowd which helps the new restaurant by providing high customer visit possibility. So, definitely this region could potentially be a perfect place for starting a quality Indian restaurants. Some of the drawbacks of this analysis are \u2014 the clustering is completely based only on data obtained from Foursquare API and the data about the Indian population distribution in each neighborhood is also based on the 2016 census which is not up-to date. Thus there is huge gap of 3 years in the population distribution data. Even Though there are lots of areas where it can be improved yet this analysis has certainly provided us with some good insights, preliminary information on possibilities & a head start into this business problem by setting the step stones properly.", "Finally to conclude this project, We have got a chance to on a business problem like how a real like data scientists would do. We have used many python libraries to fetch the data , to manipulate the contents & to analyze and visualize those datasets. We have made use of Foursquare API to explore the venues in neighborhoods of Toronto, then get good amount of data from Wikipedia which we scraped with help of Wikipedia python library and visualized using various plots present in seaborn & matplotlib. We also applied machine learning technique to predict the output given the data and used Folium to visualize it on a map.", "Some of the drawbacks or areas of improvements shows us that this analysis can be further improved with the help of more data and different machine learning technique. Similarly we can use this project to analysis any scenario such as opening a different cuisine restaurant or opening of a new gym and etc. Hopefully, this project helps acts as initial guidance to take more complex real-life challenges using data-science.", "Find the code in github but to view use nbviewer along with github url.", "Your home for data science.
