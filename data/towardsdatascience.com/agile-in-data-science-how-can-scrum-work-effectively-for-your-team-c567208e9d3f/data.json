Using Agile Scrum on a data science team is hard, but it doesn\u2019t need to be impossible. The past year I have worked on a heavily research-focused data science team, using Scrum to define, prioritize, and plan work. On this team, we have a set of 3 product owners overseeing the three scrum teams. Our product owners are also part of the development team, splitting their work 75% product owner duties and 25% development duties. We have adapted software methodologies to work to our needs, and I want to discuss how you can do the same.", "Scrum is an Agile framework used to address complex problems through effective team collaboration, and incremental builds every 2 to 3 weeks your products. For data science teams your products may be something like analytics development. In Scrum, you have a product backlog and a sprint backlog. The product backlog consists of all work that needs to be done on a specific product or team. A sprint is 2 to 3 weeks\u2019 worth of work, and each sprint, you define a sprint backlog of work from the product backlog. This work is what will be done during that 2 to 3 weeks.", "On a Scrum team, there is the product owner and development team. The product owner is the individual that creates the product backlog items, orders those items to achieve the goals of the team best, and ensures the development team understands the items in the backlog. The development team is the individual who will implement the work in the backlog.", "These individuals will work on user stories during the sprint. A user story is a specific work item that the development team must work on throughout a sprint. Depending on how much work is required for a given user story, data scientists on the development team may have one or more user stories to work on each sprint. Defining user stories on a Scrum data science team is one area in which I have seen problems arise. This is due to the open-ended nature of research based tasks that could evolve over time. The main areas I have found useful to fill in for each user story include:", "After you have defined your story and assigned it to a sprint, you will see your completed story on your sprint board. This is where you can see all work being done that sprint and any related information your development team likes to add to their stories as they work on an item.", "Acceptance criteria can be hard to define for data science teams, especially when working with open-ended problems or investigations. Working on a research team means some tasks can be more challenging to define. But these tasks are not impossible. Before bringing a story to a sprint, acceptance criteria need to be determined. The product owner and the data scientist working on the user story should have some understanding of what is the expected outcome of the work.", "The way I have approached acceptance criteria is to define one or more items that are expected at the end of a sprint from this work. Ask yourself, what do I want to achieve in the next few weeks? What decision or outcome do I want to arrive at?", "For example, say you are creating a user story to research a new machine learning technique and you need to decide if you should use it or not in your work. You can develop your initial user story to do this research and define acceptance criteria as the outcome of that decision. That outcome will help you determine if you create more stories to continue the work or stop based on what you found. Below, I have defined the acceptance criteria in three bullet points. I want the data scientist to understand the technique, to determine how it could be useful to our work, and determine if we continue research to develop an MVP notebook. At the end of the sprint, the data scientist should be able to tell me if we continue with the work or not, and why.", "Acceptance criteria can include an action plan for the next steps, a paper or presentation of the outcome, or a decision (go or no-go to continue work).", "After you have defined the title, description, and acceptance criteria, the next item to look at is story point estimation. Estimating story points or level of effort can help understand how long a task will take and how much work someone should be taking on that sprint. You can choose to have story points or ignore them. It is up to you. I have tried it both ways and prefer to use story points.", "When I am writing or updating user stories, I use story point estimations to define the level of effort and determine how much work a person can take on during a 2\u20133 week timespan. We use the Fibonacci sequence as a general estimate of time. I believe it is easier to define story points after the story has acceptance criteria. You know the expected outcome that the development team is trying to achieve making it easier to pick points.", "Typically, I assign these points during sprint planning or backlog refinement when I have the development team decide how long things will take. This is because a more senior data scientist may say something will take less time than a junior data scientist who may need more time. Once I get everyone\u2019s thoughts, I tend to take either the most common story point number or average them. Meaning, if I have four data scientists and they gave me [5,5,3,5] for story points, I would take 5 as the most common value. But, if they gave me [5,5,2,2], then I would average out to 3 story points.", "After the development team has completed their user stories, the last action to be done is for them present their work in a sprint review. The main takeaway I have seen with sprint reviews is adapting your sprint review to your team\u2019s and stakeholder\u2019s needs. In the last year, our sprint reviews format has changed format a few times to find what works best for us, and that is okay.", "It would help if you found a balance between what works best for your team presenting in the sprint review and the stakeholders looking to watch the review. What information are they most interested in seeing? If your data scientists present their demos by delivering PPT presentations instead of showcasing code, then do that! This is your team\u2019s time to showcase what they have done to benefit the stakeholders and customers. Adapt your review to give them the platform to present, take in feedback, and determine the next steps.", "Scrum may or may not work for your data science team, but if you are looking to try it, know that you can adapt the framework to work for your team\u2019s needs. As you learn the best way to define your own user stories, try adding or removing fields that may not be relevant to you. Experiment with the need for story points, the way you story point, and how you estimate time for your planning work. Consider how you can best define acceptance criteria for everyday tasks your team works on. Make the user story template your own as you learn what works best for your team. As your sprint comes to an end, showcase your work in a sprint review to your stakeholders. Your review can include demos, presentations, and more. Adapt the meeting to be what you and your stakeholders need.", "Has your team been using Agile Scrum or another framework?
