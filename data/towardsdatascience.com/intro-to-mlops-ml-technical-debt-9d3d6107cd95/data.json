Our pricing is all screwed up! We are selling 13,000 USD cameras for 100 USD! ML Goes Wrong during Amazons Best Prime Day", "Imagine you are one of the Amazon ML Engineers, your team just released a new RNN Pricing Model to automate pricing setup based on purchase trends which you have painstakingly back-tested and tuned countless times. Your 2 years efforts finally built results and predicted to generate 1 M additional revenue per year.", "You were so happy that you booked an expensive vacation to celebrate. You were on your way to the Bahamas until you received\u2026 Bad news.", "Your ML model went rogue and mispriced all goods. You frantically opened your integration manager to roll back. But it was too late, the system already delivered the goods; you lost your company 3 M USD with your \u201ccutting edge ML Model\u201d.", "The next day, you were determined to debug your model. You tested the model. It looked fine. Has the price distribution changed? Has the data preparation gone rogue? Or the quality data from the recent downstream changes? You racked your brain frantically but you were still clueless. So you decided to isolate each downstream data with virtual machines and different config files, rebuild the model from scratch, and test them one by one again. You lost track of each version update until it took a few sleepless nights to fix the issues.", "Your Cutting Edge ML Model Turns to your Biggest Nightmare During Data or Integration Changes", "Technical debt is the ongoing cost of expedient decisions made during code implementation. It is caused by shortcuts taken to give short-term benefit for earlier software releases and faster time-to-market. Technical debt tends to compound. Deferring the work to pay it off results in increasing costs, system brittleness, and reduced rates of innovation.", "In 1992, Ward Cunningham coined this term to explain product stakeholders\u2019 needs to refactor. For those of you which still do not understand. Technical Debt is the opposite of the Marie Kondo and saying \u201clet\u2019s sweep our dirty laundry under the bed and problem solved\u201d", "Similarly, in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we all tend to increase technical debts. We love to do \u201cninja fix\u201d, taking shortcuts such as hard-code functionalities, smelly codes, and irresponsible copy-paste. These are perfectly fine and necessary if you are rushing for a deadline or deliver Proof of Concepts (POC). But it is extremely dangerous if unpaid.", "Not all debt is bad, but unpaid debt compounds \u2014", "D Sculley, in the Hidden Debt in Machine Learning Systems", "Our AI and ML run on data. Garbage in garbage out. The more features you use, the less stable it becomes especially if these features are dependent on many parts of the systems.", "Imagine pricing system that uses CRM (Customer Relation Management) system to build price discrimination (similar to flight tickets). The quality of the pricing system would be highly dependent on the data that comes from this CRM and missing features would ruin all of the results in ML.", "Now, imagine it is connected to features from many more up streams by more interconnected ML and other systems. Your ML model will be fragile at best and broken at worst to infect its down-streams.", "In a fast paced AI based startups, this has become the norm as they frantically rush the timeline to materialize their products and present them to their stakeholders. I have talked to a friend in an AI startup who mentioned that they have never used proper Versioning(Git), Issue Tracker (Jira) or any Dev Ops Management Tools to develop their ML system. It was a shock that many others jump into the ML/AI hype without proper DevOps and technical debt management. This is the same as building robots with toothpicks.", "For Software Engineering, DevOps is Important. But for ML Productions, MLOps is Inseparable", "ML systems are machines with data. It is generally very hard to make isolated changes (Changing Anything, Changing Everything \u2014 CACE). This applies to feature engineering, ML tuning, regularization, data sampling, etc.", "Let\u2019s say that your pricing model worked really well in all products except vacuum cleaner (cause it sucks :). You fixed the pricing for vacuum cleaners by raising the sensitivity of the cleaning products pricing but you found that you caused pricing distribution mismatch with the dishwasher. The pricing distribution of vacuum cleaners does not apply to dishwasher\u2019s pricing distribution which is narrower. You now need to create a different rule which might affect other products.", "You will realize that data and insights are entangled. Different tuning and model formulations will cause general insight changes which are hard to isolate.", "Entangled Data and Systems would cause difficulties to isolate and debug problems", "AI and ML systems made up of many different workflow pipelines which are responsible for complicated jobs in sequences. Your ML System will be built by many engineers and interlinked with many different systems and data sources.", "In a proper ML pipeline, you will need to design many jobs including scraping, generating data, ETL, validating data cleanliness, cross validation, monitoring performance and deployments. Soon your model will become very complex. Without a proper tool and standard operation, it will take hours to make a simple change across multiple systems with different languages and legacy systems.", "Complex Pipelines caused your engineering effort to be slow and buggy. If not treated well, You might take hours just to make simple changes.", "Real-world systems ended up influencing our data. Imagine your Sales Representatives released a marketing campaign to reach out to children and aggressively include them in the CRM system that your pricing model used.", "The ML model would perceive a large proportion of customers to buy toys. As a result, the ML model raises the toys price and discounts expensive products excessively. However, monitoring your price spike, your competitor\u2019s pricing model also automatically filled the market with exorbitant price of toys. Your system would do the same and the vicious cycle appeared.", "Hidden Feedback Loops put a wrench into your ML System while harder to debug due to interlinking data dependency outside your ML System", "Imagine that your pricing model relies on the gender of your customers. If a guy browses cosmetics, most likely he will buy it for gifts to his wife/girlfriend, so the willingness to pay is higher. Your Machine Learning is ready to determine pricing based on gender.", "However, your business representative adds on a label other to the \u201cgender\u201d feature in the upstream CRM. Would your ML system break down if it saw values other than Male or Female? How would the model price the cosmetics now? This is much fragile compared to Code Dependency as it means that your model might break whenever the upstream systems are updated and give unsuspected features.", "Data Dependency caused logic errors and quality degradation due to mismatch in the semantic meanings during feature engineering and labeling.", "Technical debt is a pain. As an Ex Data Engineer in Visa and Data Scientist in Google, I had to ensure a proper reliable pipeline which remains transparent and accountable. I would need a standard operation to govern both the technical and data side of Machine Learning and ensure quality would not be compromised over time.", "Testing is one of the most important but unsexy roles in the technology sector. It remains very important to consider testing to limit technical debt and ensure ML Production quality. In DevOps, we learnt about two types of testing: unit tests (test a single functionality) and integration tests (test integrated functionalities. However, in MLOps, we need to set up a canary process to test ML Pipeline quality before serving in production. This includes testing the data dependency preparability to identify unseen data (imagine the Male/Female Gender example).", "When you are training your models, you are using log data (pre-recorded/observed logs). However, in production, you will need to deal with live data which might give different values due to many issues such as timezone (time series), quality of camera (image), language, etc. It is highly important to keep track of both logged and live data to ensure quality consistency.", "Score each test stage of your ML Model. Apply scores of pipeline health in four different sectors:", "All these stages are important to deploy and maintain the model. Consider the minimum scoring from each stage as the final score of the whole system. Ensure you can maximize the min scoring to set up the right health standard before putting it into production.", "Simply put, the fight to technical debt is to know your ML Pipeline clearly at any time in its life. This includes data samples, model generation, testing, and finally deployment.", "When done right, you will be able to: develop fast, run your model predictably, and deliver values to your customers reliably.", "For the reference for this article, please refer to this paper by D.Sculley and team at Google.", "I am also going to talk about Tensorflow Extended (TFX) as an open source tool to launch and maintain your ML Models. This framework has been widely used by many large tech companies such as Google, Twitter, and AirBnb. Hope you can stay tune with my Medium Channel.", "I believe knowing this is the first step to convert your ML efforts to produce robust and impactful ML Systems.", "I really hope this has been a great read and a source of inspiration for you to develop and innovate.", "Please Comment out below for suggestions and feedback. Just like you, I am still learning how to become a better Data Scientist and Engineer. Please help me improve so that I could help you better in my subsequent article releases.", "Thank you and Happy coding :)", "Vincent Tatan is a Data and Technology enthusiast with relevant working experiences from Google LLC, Visa Inc. and Lazada to implement microservice architectures, business intelligence, and analytics pipeline projects.", "Vincent is a native Indonesian with a record of accomplishments in problem-solving with strengths in Full Stack Development, Data Analytics, and Strategic Planning.", "He has been actively consulting SMU BI & Analytics Club, guiding aspiring data scientists and engineers from various backgrounds, and opening up his expertise for businesses to develop their products .", "Lastly, please reach out to Vincent via LinkedIn, Medium or Youtube Channel", "Your home for data science.
