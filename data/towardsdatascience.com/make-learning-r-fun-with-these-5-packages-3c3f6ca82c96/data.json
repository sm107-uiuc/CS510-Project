Perhaps you\u2019ve been working on the same concept for an hour or two. Perhaps your progress is slow. Perhaps this is all happening at 6pm on a Friday in the middle of a global pandemic. I\u2019ve been there, and I imagine I\u2019m not alone.", "Thankfully for R programmers, there are packages that help bring joy back into the learning process. What\u2019s\u00a0more, they\u2019re easy to understand and can make amusing additions to recreational projects.", "Below, I\u2019ve put together five of my favourite \u2018just for fun\u2019 R packages. Each example is very beginner friendly, though make sure you install each package before running the example\u00a0code. You can do this by running the function install.packages(\"packagenamehere\") for each example, changing the package name to one of those listed below.", "The \u2018beepr\u2019 package contains only one function: beep. This plays a sound when called, and comes loaded with some fun notifications. If you ever wanted to to hear a Wilhelm scream or the \u2018get item\u2019 sound from the Legend of Zelda in the middle of a script, this is the package for you. It\u2019ll also play sound from a .wav file from the internet if you give it a valid URL. Just call beep with a number or valid URL as an argument, and it\u2019ll play a corresponding sound.", "Unlike some of the other packages I mention below, beepr can actually be quite useful in serious work. While running code that takes a long time to execute, I often work on something else while waiting for it to finish. Calling beep at the end of my script signals that my long process is done. It\u2019s pretty satisfying to hear some 8-bit fanfare at the end of a long analysis or simulation.", "The aptly named \u2018fun\u2019 package is a collection of miscellaneous functions and games. If you ever needed another vehicle for procrastination, you\u2019ve got one in this package. Notable inclusions are a neat version of minesweeper that runs in an R window, as well as other games like a sliding puzzle, and \u20185 in a row\u2019. Running these games is easy, only requires the code below. After loading the package, the conditional statement opens the right interactive graphics device based on your operating system. You can then start any game from the package (such as the sliding puzzle) by calling its function.", "This package also contains some other miscellaneous features and demos. Ever wanted to draw a turtle in R? Test for Alzheimer\u2019s disease? Shut down your operating system? These are all things you can do with \u2018fun\u2019. While bricking your OS might not result in laughter, the many other amusing games and distractions in this package are good fun.", "\u2018fortunes\u2019 is another package with a sole function; fortune. When called with no arguments, it spits out random nuggets of humour and wisdom from the R-help forums, and other R related sites. To receive a more specific fortune, you can add a string argument to the function call (fortune(\"divide\") for example). This frequently results in some amusing outputs, with one of my favourites below:", "As an added learning\u00a0incentive, many quotes get funnier as you find out more about R and its community. But whatever your skill level, fortunes\u2019 selection of humourous asides make for a fun distraction from whatever you\u2019re meant to be doing instead.", "A neat package that adds character to text output in the console, \u2018cowsay\u2019 lets you print messages that are \u2018spoken\u2019 by animals drawn in ASCII characters. Want to soften the blow of a warning message? Make a cat say it with the code below.", "The say function can also handle messages that aren\u2019t defined as warnings, and defaults to printing normal text. It also integrates with the \u2018fortunes\u2019 package; when running say(what = \"fortune\"), a random fortune will be spoken by an animal. Because everyone wants to see a duck lament the stupidity of R users.", "Finally, it\u2019s just nice to receive a compliment sometimes. The \u2018praise\u2019 package facilitates this by generating random praise, allowing you to receive fresh encouragement with each call. Calling praise while specifying parts of speech to dynamically generate with the ${} syntax yields statements like the following:", "In my example, I capitalised my exclamation, while leaving my adjective in lowercase for grammatical purposes. Dynamically generated phrases can be entirely capitalised for some extra enthusiasm (${EXCLAMATION} , for instance). While I can\u2019t see this gaining traction in many serious production-level scripts, sometimes it\u2019s nice to praise your own efforts. Learned a new analysis today? Sensational work, champ.", "In our current economic climate, people are mainly learning programming for career development. The concern of the hour is learning techniques that secure jobs, not building projects that bring joy. I don\u2019t think this is completely unreasonable either. After all, most R programmers don\u2019t get paid to make ASCII animals talk to users. They get paid to analyse data.", "That said, I like these packages because they reaffirm why I was drawn to programming in the first place. It\u2019s fun, and lets me make\u00a0interesting\u00a0things. When I first started learning to code, I wasn\u2019t gunning for a high powered job. I was\u00a0excited\u00a0to\u00a0create\u00a0fun\u00a0small\u00a0scale\u00a0projects\u00a0that\u00a0applied\u00a0my\u00a0new\u00a0skills. Even though\u00a0I\u00a0enjoy\u00a0writing code\u00a0in\u00a0my\u00a0career nowadays, it\u2019s nice to get back in touch with that feeling once in a while.", "So, in the spirit of fun: say(praise(\"Thanks for reading, and have fun ${creating} your own ${adjective} R code!\"))", "Want to read all my articles on programming, data science, and more?
