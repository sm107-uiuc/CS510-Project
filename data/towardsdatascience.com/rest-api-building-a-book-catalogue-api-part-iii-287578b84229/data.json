The first two are the theoretical ones where I\u2019ve not covered any implementation, but looked into what REST APIs are, how to use them, and the architectural constraints in REST. In the third and the fourth articles, I\u2019ve been developing an API system for a Book Catalogue application using all the knowledge gained in the first two posts about REST. If you haven\u2019t been to these posts, then please have a look and then come back here.", "This post extends the development further. Specially, I\u2019m going to update the serializers some more, as the API system till now is not yet RESTful.", "Currently, the APIs we have developed supports GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods. This post discusses two points in particular:", "To start off, I\u2019ll just check a few features provided by Django REST Framework. Let\u2019s see how they work.", "Here we target the related field only with its string representation defined in the model. We just need to add a line on the serializer class for each foreign key related field.", "This is what I actually want. This provides the hyperlink to the particular author resource and the genre resource from the book resource itself. This technique actually ensures the HATEOAS constraint.", "One requirement for this to work is that I need to add the request in the serializer context. This can be done while instantiating the serializer in the respective view.", "But I don\u2019t get any other information about the related object except the Hyperlink. It needs to be hit to see the related object\u2019s details. I need something which will give me the Hyperlink along with the information of the related object.", "Here I will just use the whole serializer of the particular Related field while referring to it in another serializer. This would produce the whole related object in the Response.", "But again, no URL is there for the related object.", "Okay, so this requirement I have is not fulfilled by any solutions provided by Django REST Framework. So here I am creating a custom serializer, which will give me both of them, the Hyperlink to the related resource and other details of it.", "With these two updates, I managed to return the related objects in the response along with their Hyperlink, exactly as I needed them.", "Ideally, as REST architectural constraint says, all the needed information should be there in the response. In my case, I have not provided the age information of the author, as I think that may not be needed with the response. If it\u2019s a need, then please visit the URL with the Author resource.", "Fortunately, the custom serializer would also support this requirement. It accepts nested objects in the request as well. Look how I can send a POST request now.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the constraints again.", "For caching, I\u2019ll use per view cache here. The decorator cache_page would meet my requirement. To use it in the class based view, I\u2019m using another decorator called as method_decorator.", "For Layered System, I\u2019m not going to show the whole code here, as this is a bit out of scope. Basically, what I did for this is I have created another django app and accessed the APIs from its view. Then the app where the actual APIs are defined becomes an intermediate app and the client only interacts with the new app.", "And as Code On Demand is also optional, so leaving that as well.", "The APIs looks good now. It meets most of the constraints needed to make it RESTful.", "This was the last in the REST API series. What I personally liked in the journey was, there is more to this topic than just creating API endpoints, and exposing them. We started with the basics, from knowing what is an API, how a client server communication would look like in plain English, and how actually it happens, the structure of the request and the response, and then of course the architectural constraints of REST which puts more weightage to the APIs when all of them are met. This proceeded with three hands on exercises, in which we developed APIs for a Book Catalogue App keeping the constraints in mind. This pretty much summed up everything one needs to know in the topic. Glad that I made it to the Medium as well. Hope I\u2019ll clear the interview now. :D", "Your home for data science.
