Then, we are going to visualize the results with heatmaps using Seaborn library.", "If you are interested in the code used to extract the rates from IMDb web page as well as to generate the heatmaps, read until the end since first we provide the results and then we explain how we obtained them! So\u2026 Let\u2019s get started \u2b50\ufe0f", "On many occasions, I had the feeling that a series took longer than it should. Successful series have generally many seasons, running the risk of getting repetitive. Next, we analyze 5 series that present a gradually declining quality over time or a precipitous drop in the last season.", "Prison Break is an American television series released in 2005. The series tells the story of Michael Scofield a brilliant structural engineer who elaborates a plan to help his brother Lincoln Burrows to escape from jail. Lincoln was incarcerated and sentenced to death after being accused of killing the brother of the Vice President of the United States.", "The following heatmap shows the score of every episode. As you can observe, the first two seasons have on average higher scores than the rest.", "The Walking Dead is an American series released on AMC in 2010. The series presents a post-apocalyptic world where a group of survivors tries to stay alive under the constant attacks of the zombies while facing conflicts with other human survivors. As we can observe, the scores gradually decrease over time.", "Money Heist is a Spanish television series originally released on Antena 3 in 2017. After being bought by Netflix, Money Heist has become a worldwide phenomenon. The series tells the story of the Royal Mint heist organized by \u2018El Profesor\u2019. After planning the robbery for years, El Profesor recruits eight robbers code-named after cities (Tokyo, Nairobi, Rio, Berlin, Moscow, Denver, Olso, and Helsinki) to execute his master plan: print 2.4 billion euros and escape successfully from the Mint.", "As shown above, the scores of many episodes of the last season have decreased substantially (around 1 point); however, they increase at the end of the season (episodes 7 and 8).", "I have to admit that Money Heist is one of my favorite series \u2764\ufe0f", "Game of Thrones is an American series aired on HBO in 2017, being an adaptation of a series of fantasy novels written by George R.

The series criticises the modern society, particularly the inappropriate use of technology. All episodes are independent and present a near future where technology plays an important but also harmful role.", "As shown above, we can also observe a decrease in scores in the last season.", "Series such as House of Cards, Vikings, Gossip Girl, and The Sinner also show a declining quality over time according to IMDb users. But, are there series that maintain their quality over time? The answer is yes!", "Although many series lose quality over time, there are others that manage to maintain the quality throughout the seasons. Let\u2019s see some examples.", "Breaking bad is just perfect. A puzzle where all the pieces fit together beautifully. Nothing is missing, nothing is superfluous. Needless to say that Breaking bad is my favorite series! \ud83d\udc9a", "The series was released in 2008 on AMC, and tells the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, starts to produce meth to guarantee his family\u2019s financial future.", "As shown below, the series even increases its quality over time.", "I completely agree with the users of IMDb. The last chapter of the Season 4 is simply perfect.", "Friends is an American series aired on NBC in 1994.

The series tells the story of Annalise Keating a law professor at Middleton university and a successful attorney. She and five of her students get involved in the murder of Annalise\u2019s husband Sam Keating.", "In this particular case, we cannot appreciate a decreasing quality over time. However, we can notice that the last chapters of the seasons are rated better than the first ones. We can observe this trend practically in all series!", "Now, it is time to make your own visualizations!", "First, we present the third-party libraries used in this article. Since these libraries are not part of the Python Standard Library, we need to install them separately. This can easily be achieved using the pip package. Verify that all libraries are installed before executing the code on your computer.", "Then, we provide the code used to scrape the data from IMDb web page and to generate the heatmaps, so you can easily make your own visualizations!", "Request is a third-party library that allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. In this article, we will only use the request library to get the HTML code of a web page.", "When performing data analysis, we are not always able to download the data in csv format, or to access it via an Application Programming Interface (API). In some cases, we have to obtain the data directly from the web page.

It provides tools for reading and writing data in different formats, for carrying out exploratory analysis, and for data cleaning.", "Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. In comparison to Matplotlib, Seaborn allows you to make plots using fewer lines of code and provides more sophisticated visualization tools such as heatmaps, box plots, and violin plots. In addition, the visualizations look much better! \u2764\ufe0f", "To scrape the data from IMDb, we create a function (episodes_rates) that accepts as input the web page of a series ( Episode Guide), returning a data frame where the rows represent the seasons and the columns the episodes as follows:", "Let\u2019s understand the code step by step \ud83d\udc4c", "1. We use the request module to obtain the HTML code of the web page as a string. First, we send a GET request to the specified url using .get(url) method. Then, we get the HTML text of the page using the .text attribute.", "As we can observe, the url consists of two parts: url_serie and url_season. Url_serie is the input of the function (episodes_rates) and remains unchanged while url_season (e.g. ?season=1, ?season=2, \u2026) changes as we select different seasons.", "2. We pass the string html into the BeautifulSoup constructor, obtaining a BeautifulSoup type object. Now, we can easily extract information from this object using the methods available in Beautiful Soup.", "3. Next, we explore the HTML code with Chrome Dev Tools.

We can easily access Chrome Dev Tools by clicking Ctr + Shift + I or by selecting More Tools > Developer Tools.", "In the elements tab, we can inspect and edit the HTML and CSS of a page.

This function returns a bs4.element.ResultSet object. Then, we loop through this object (division tags), accessing to the span tag that contains the score (\u201cipl-rating-star__rating\u201d) using the .find() method. To obtain the text between the tags, we use the .text attribute as follows.", "As shown above, we insert the scores in a dictionary, being the keys the episode number and the values the score of the episode. Finally, we append this dictionary to a list.", "4. Once we have collected all scores of a season, we have to access the url of the next season to continue collecting scores. First, we check whether another season is available (anchor tag \u2014 id=\u201dload_next_episodes\u201d). If so, we access the url contained in the href attribute using the .get() method.", "As shown above, if there is not anchor tag with id=\u201dload_next_episodes\u201d, meaning there is not another season available, the while loop is terminated.", "5. Finally, we obtain a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the scores of one season. We use this list of dictionaries to create a pandas data frame as follows:", "And voil\u00e0!
