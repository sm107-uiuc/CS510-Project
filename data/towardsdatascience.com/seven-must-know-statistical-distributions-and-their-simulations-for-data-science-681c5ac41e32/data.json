There is a great tutorial at Khan Academy that explains the details.", "To simulate Geometric distribution, we can use the Bernoulli trials and count for the number of failures before the first success, and then plot the number of failures (Many thanks to Tiffany Sung who caught the typo in this code snippet):", "Uniform distribution models a random variable whose outcomes are equally likely to happen.

Poisson distribution can be used to present the number of customers arriving in a store in an hour, or the number of phone calls a company receives one day, etc. Poisson distribution is closely related to binomial distribution if you measure the number of event occurrences as the number of success. For example, when measuring how many cars will pass a particular street in an hour, the number of cars passing is a random variable that follows Poisson distribution. To understand the car passing event, you can break down one hour into 60 minutes, and see how many cars will pass in a minute, then generalize it into an hour. For a minute, maybe more than one cars pass the street, thus it is not a binary random variable. However, if we break down one minute into 60 seconds, it is likely that only one car passes or no car pass in a single second. We can keep breaking down a second to make a more confident claim. We can then consider car passing as a successful event and no car passing as a failure event, and model how many success events (how many cars passing) in 3600 trials (3600 seconds in an hour), which is a Binomial distribution with success probability p, and the number of trials equals to 3600.", "Connecting Poisson distribution with binomial distribution helps us understand the assumptions and PMF of Poisson distribution. The assumptions Poisson distribution are:", "1, any successful event should not influence the outcome of other successful events (observing one car at the first second doesn\u2019t affect the chance of observing another car the next second);", "2, the probability of success p, is the same across all intervals (there is no difference between this hour with other hours to observe cars passing by);", "3, the probability of success p in an interval goes to zero as the interval gets smaller (if we are discussing how many cars will pass in a millisecond, the probability is close to zero because the time is too short);", "The PMF of Poisson distribution can be derived from the PMF of binomial distribution:", "We know x is the number of success in n Bernoulli trials, and E(x)=np. If we define \u03bb =E(x) =np as the average number of success in n Bernoulli trials, the success probability p can be estimated by \u03bb/n. As n goes to infinity, the PMF becomes:", "After some calculation, we can get a new PMF, which is the PMF for Poisson distribution:", "The Poisson distribution gives the probability of observing a certain number of events in an interval, given the average number of events in the interval. The expected value and variance of a random variable that follows Poisson distribution are both \u03bb:", "To simulate Poisson distribution, we can use the Numpy function:", "The Exponential distribution is a continuous distribution that is closely related to the Poisson distribution. It is the probability distribution of the time intervals between Poisson events. If the number of calls a company receives in an hour follows Poisson distribution, then the time interval between calls follows Exponential distribution. Since exponential distribution is closely related to Poisson distribution, its assumptions follow the Poisson distribution\u2019s assumptions.", "We can derive the PDF of exponential distribution by first deriving its Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and then take the derivative of the CDF. We are using this trick because we can get the CDF using Poisson distribution. Suppose we are still observing how many cars are passing in the same street, and now we care about the random variable \u03c9, which is defined as when we see one car passing, it takes at least \u03c9 minutes to observe another car passing. Let\u2019s start from the beginning \u2014 how long it takes to observe the first car? Assume it takes \u03c9 minutes to observe the first car in \u03c9 minutes, there is zero car passing. We know that the number of cars passing in the street in a minute follows Poisson distribution:", "For \u03c9 minutes, the number of cars passing in the street follows:", "the probability that we observe zero cars in \u03c9 minutes is:", "From exponential distribution\u2019s perspective, we now already know the probability of taking at least \u03c9 minutes to observe the first car, then the probability of taking less than \u03c9 minutes is:", "This is the CDF of the random variable \u03c9, taking the derivative with respect to \u03c9, we have the PDF:", "If we know in a minute, on average, we are likely to observe three cars (\u03bb=3) passing by the street, then it is expected that every 1/3 minutes, we will observe one car passing by. Thus, the expected value and variance of exponential distribution are:", "To simulate the Exponential distribution, we can use the Numpy random function:", "Or we can use the CDF and Uniform distribution from (0,1) to simulate it. The following equations show the process:", "As discussed partially above, these distributions are closely related to each other in different ways:", "1, Bernoulli distribution is a special case of Binomial distribution when n equals one;", "2, As n goes to infinity, and p goes to zero, np = \u03bb, a finite number, binomial distribution approaches to Poisson distribution;", "3, As n goes to infinity, and p are not indefinitely small, \u03bb goes to infinity as well, binomial distribution approaches normal distribution;", "4, If the total number of events in a time interval of length t follows the Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb, the times between random events follow an Exponential distribution with rate \u03bb/t.", "5, Geometric distribution is the only discrete distribution that has the memoryless property, and exponential distribution is the only continuous distribution with the memoryless property.

One of the implications you can think of is that if the lifetime of batteries has an Exponential distribution, then a used battery is as good as a new one, as long as it\u2019s not dead.", "Understanding the assumptions, properties of different statistical distributions definitely helps data scientists with their daily tasks:", "1, Monte Carlo simulations start with generating random variables from a Uniform distribution;", "2, Binomial distribution sets the foundation of any binary classification model;", "3, All regression models that use the least-squares cost function assume the residuals to follow a Normal distribution with mean equals to zero;", "4, The transformed distributions from the Normal distribution, like the Student t distribution, Standard Normal distribution are the distributions used for conducting hypothesis testing, computing p values, and getting confidence interval; Log-normal distribution describes all samples of data when the data is right-skewed;", "5, Poisson and Exponential distributions are greater for modeling events with a fixed time rate (\u03bb). For example, we can use Poisson distribution to model how many customers will show up in a shop in a day, and use Exponential distribution to model how many time it takes between two consecutive customers to enter the shop.", "Statistical distributions are everywhere in daily life.
