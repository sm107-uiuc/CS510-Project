Since then, I came up with a somewhat more clever title for this series: Data Stacks For Fun & Nonprofit. I\u2019m expanding the scope of this series to cover the entire data stack, not just the warehousing component. Last time, I explained that data stacks tend to consist of three components(ETL, DW and BI components), and that for the ETL and BI components your basic choices are either DIY or commercial platforms that are priced towards enterprise customers.", "Well I, of course, spoke too soon, because it turns out that there have been some very interesting open source developments on both the ETL and BI fronts! I\u2019ll dig into those more in this article, but as a result, I believe we can now assemble a true end-to-end analytics stack from freemium and open-source components. Therefore, this series will be geared towards those looking to set up their own \u201cDS4FNP\u201d stack, whether for personal side-projects, as a teaching resource, or for nonprofit organizations who can\u2019t operate on an enterprise budget.", "In the rest of this article, I\u2019ll report some conclusions from the DW options I explored last time, particularly through the lens of dbt. I\u2019ll then introduce some of the open source ETL and BI options that I think complete the stack. Finally, I\u2019ll wrap up by describing how to setup a completely local development environment, as well as presenting some options for a hosted production environment.", "I previously identified three candidate data warehouse platforms that makeup the heart of our stack: BigQuery, Snowflake, and Athena. My conclusions on all three platforms for this purpose are as follows\u2026", "Snowflake, I had somewhat discounted since, while it is perhaps my favorite of the three, it doesn\u2019t offer any kind of freemium pricing model. Despite being \u201cpay as you go,\u201d you still have to pay something to get going. However, it turns out that you practically keep your costs down to the minimum $25/month. Now, while that is a fairly low monthly cost, I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s low enough to justify for personal projects. But if the project was of enough personal importance to me, and I felt that I could maximize the utility of my paid resource usage, I would probably bite the bullet and pay. Snowflake really is that great. With that said, and after an exciting IPO, it would be really great to see Snowflake release some kind of limited freemium model specifically for small projects, training, etc.", "BigQuery I certainly had the most traction with. Setting up an account and a BigQuery instance is a very straight forward process. Configuration in dbt is equally simple, and even the authentication setup (a process I\u2019ve often thought Google IaaS traditionally makes needlessly complicated) was a breeze. I am very likely going to focus on BigQuery as the target warehouse for most of this series, while trying to remain as warehouse-agnostic as possible. With the ease of setup, its excellent pricing model (easily free if desired), and the number of integrations available, you can\u2019t go wrong with BigQuery.", "Athena is a little different from the other two. It\u2019s main advantages are that 1) it\u2019s entirely under your control and within your own AWS account, and 2) it is the cheapest option if AWS is your preferred ecosystem. The main problem with Athena is that you will have to do all of the setup yourself. I think this could be made into a more turnkey solution with the help of Terraform or Pulumi, and that is certainly something I\u2019d like to explore later on. There is also a dbt-athena plugin, though I found the documentation still fairly raw and I\u2019m still working through configuration hurdles. With time, I think that maturation of the dbt plugin and an Athena provisioning script will make Athena a very decent warehousing option for DS4FNP. The native interoperability with S3 together with the potential abstraction of Presto makes Athena a really desirable warehouse target.", "But we\u2019re actually getting a little bit ahead of ourselves in choosing cloud warehouse platforms. In developing your analytics project, you can actually get started with a local PostgreSQL or SQLite database, and of course dbt. In fact, with dbt you can setup separate connection profiles for any number of the warehouses we have discussed, as well as our local environment. This means that all we need to get started are our laptop, Python, dbt, and our local \u2018warehouse\u2019 (postgres or sqlite). Later in the series (probably Part III), we\u2019ll start to actually put together a full tutorial on setting up our project from scratch.", "Alright, so what about these open source ETL and BI platforms I mentioned earlier? I had good reason to think that these components were only really available as either $$$-expensive enterprise services or time-expensive DIY projects. ETL is generally rather compute-expensive, so there\u2019s not really a strong incentive to offer freemium pricing. Your commercial options there include Fivetran, Stitch, Matillion, and several others. Rolling your own ETL from Python scripts might seem straightforward in the abstract, but most real world ETL tasks end up falling into one of two types of complexity:", "In either case, I think people tend to underestimate the long term effort involved in DIY ETL. It\u2019s an easy trap to fall into because from 10,000 feet out it can seem like such a simple \u2018script-able\u2019 task: just fetch data from one source and send it somewhere. There\u2019s some truth to that pattern, though, and you often find yourself repeating the same basic process with just enough variation to warrant some level of abstraction, though not quite enough to justify abstracting it yourself; it\u2019s the type of problem that just begs for a standardized framework, but for a long time those frameworks have been locked away behind commercial platforms.", "Fortunately, just such a framework exists that is available to developers Singer, developed by Stitch, is a composable framework for developing \u201ctaps\u201d and \u201ctargets\u201d. Taps extract data from sources, including databases, APIs, logs, emails, etc. Targets are the destinations for the data extracted by taps, typically your common data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc). Every tap extracts its data into a common intermediate and each target loads from that common intermediate, allowing one to compose any combination of tap and target to form an ETL task.", "Now Singer isn\u2019t necessarily new, but it also doesn\u2019t necessarily present a complete solution for our needs. Singer provides a great starting point for standardizing the components of our ETL workflows, but it still requires significant configuration management and orchestration. However, this obvious gap has been filled by a few new entrants to the field, among them being Meltano (from GitLab) and Pipelinewise (from Transferwise). Both of these tools build upon Singer by adding a configuration management and orchestration layer. They also allow you to manage your extraction/loader tasks as code much like how dbt allows you to manage your transformation models as code. I\u2019ve tried them both, I like them both, and I kinda hope the two projects somehow merge or interoperate, because they each have a different set of strengths that are actually quite complimentary. Transferwise seems to have focused more on developing a solid set of Singer taps/targets to a specific standard, while Meltano has focused more on filling in all the blanks to put Singer into practical action as a legitimate replacement for platforms like Fivetran and Stitch. Because Meltano is a bit more relevant to the mission of our DS4FNP project, I\u2019m going to mostly focus on it.", "The basic elements of a Meltano managed project are extractors (Singer taps), loaders (Singer targets), transformers (dbt!), and orchestration (Airflow by default). You can pretty much manage your entire analytics project with Meltano alone. So far I\u2019ve worked through its documented tutorials and setting up projects. It feels a lot like dbt, and while rolling one\u2019s own production deployment seems feasible enough, I\u2019d be very interested to see a hosted Meltano-as-a-service enter the scene. Meltano is well Dockerized, and I could easily see running it via AWS Batch or similar infrastructure.", "On the BI side of the stack, your commercial platforms include Tableau, Looker, and PowerBI, among others. Snowflake now has Snowsight built-in, BigQuery pairs well with Data Studio, and Athena\u2019s analog partner would be QuickSite. The big standalone platforms really just lack any practical DS4FNP-friendly priced options, and the DW specific options just feel a bit too vendor-locked for the spirit of this project. This is by far the most subjective component in the entire stack, so by all means one should insert their own preference here. The DIY side of the BI coin also presents some notable options, including Shiny for R and Dash for python. I am much less weary of crafting one\u2019s own BI interfaces than I am of ETL workflows.", "However, in the interest of fashioning a complete stack, it turns out that we do have an ideal option for the BI layer. Superset also isn\u2019t necessarily new, but it has certainly been picking up steam, and it\u2019s now an Apache project. Developed by Airflow creator Max Beauchemin, Superset is quickly becoming the open-source alternative to Tableau (imho). Aesthetically it feels like Tableau and Airflow had an open-source love child, but the built-in SQL Lab also feels a bit like Snowsight or Redash. Readily deployable via docker-compose, Superset can be ran locally as part of our DS4FNP development environment, as well as deployed as a long running web service.", "So there we have it, our DS4FNP stack consists of the following components:", "Let\u2019s talk about environments briefly. What\u2019s great about this stack is that we can easily run every component of it locally, but we\u2019ll also need to eventually figure out how we want to deploy in the cloud.", "I think we can organize all of our code in a single repository, thanks mostly to Meltano which manages our dbt code and Airflow dags for us. Between Meltano and Superset\u2019s Docker deployments, and any warehouse infrastructure provisioning code, we may want to circle back on a general infrastructure repository (or not). For the sake of tutorials, I may use SQLite so that every tangible component of the project is version controlled.", "I use a Mac, so some of my local setup may be Mac specific, but I\u2019ll try to be platform agnostic. I\u2019m a big fan of VS Code (which now has a vscode-dbt plugin!), though Atom or any other IDE works just as well. Meltano, dbt, Singer, Airflow and Superset are all mostly Python, so if running each of these natively (non-containerized) we\u2019ll want Python and Anaconda or similar setup. We\u2019ll also want to make sure we have git and docker installed. As for local databases, we\u2019ll want to make sure we have SQLite and PostgreSQL installed, and for the later on Mac I highly recommend Postgres.app along with either Postico or TablePlus as GUI clients. Much of the work will be done using the various CLI tools, so make sure to have a comfortable Terminal setup, or use VS Code\u2019s built-in terminal. I personally use VS Code\u2019s pass-through to iTerm2 with Oh-My-Zsh.", "Cloud deployment is going to depend on a few factors. I highly recommend managing your project\u2019s code in a git repository, either with Github or GitLab. You can then setup CI/CD workflows (via Github Actions, Travis CI, etc.), which helps automate all of the deployment management tasks. I tend to use Github, and I find Github Actions very practical to use rather than a standalone CI/CD service, but other opinions may differ. Now, when we think about cloud deployment of our project, there\u2019s a sequence of events that involves a few different moving pieces:", "Github or other CI/CD service can host our deployment processes, but for both batch processes and long-running services we will need hosting infrastructure. Because pretty much everything comes containerized, we can deploy any of these processes on our own self-rolled AWS or GCP infrastructure. It is also worth noting that dbt offers dbt-cloud, Astronomer.io offers an excellent Airflow hosting service, and Preset.io is an upcoming Superset hosting service. The only thing missing is Meltano, and it seems conceivable that an analogous hosted service could arise for that. It\u2019s entirely possible that we could eventually be able to host every component of our stack on a freemium pricing model.", "So that\u2019s it! We have our data stack architecture. For the next part of this series, I want to walk through a more formal tutorial of how to setup a project with all of these components and culminate in a populated data warehouse along with some live data visualizations. Until then, I definitely recommend reading up on Meltano, dbt, and Superset. I\u2019m also going to need to come up with some datasets for the DS4FNP tutorials, so please feel free to make any suggestions or requests in the comments. In the meantime you may also enjoy this tutorial put together by the Preset.io team. Until next time!", "Your home for data science.
