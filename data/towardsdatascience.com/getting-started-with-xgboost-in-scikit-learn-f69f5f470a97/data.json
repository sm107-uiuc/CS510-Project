Basic familiarity with machine learning and Python is assumed.", "In machine learning, ensemble models perform better than individual models with high probability. An ensemble model combines different machine learning models into one. The Random Forest is a popular ensemble that takes the average of many Decision Trees via bagging. Bagging is short for \u201cbootstrap aggregation,\u201d meaning that samples are chosen with replacement (bootstrapping), and combined (aggregated) by taking their average.", "Boosting is a strong alternative to bagging. Instead of aggregating predictions, boosters turn weak learners into strong learners by focusing on where the individual models (usually Decision Trees) went wrong. In Gradient Boosting, individual models train upon the residuals, the difference between the prediction and the actual results. Instead of aggregating trees, gradient boosted trees learns from errors during each boosting round.", "XGBoost is short for \u201ceXtreme Gradient Boosting.\u201d The \u201ceXtreme\u201d refers to speed enhancements such as parallel computing and cache awareness that makes XGBoost approximately 10 times faster than traditional Gradient Boosting. In addition, XGBoost includes a unique split-finding algorithm to optimize trees, along with built-in regularization that reduces overfitting. Generally speaking, XGBoost is a faster, more accurate version of Gradient Boosting.", "Boosting performs better than bagging on average, and Gradient Boosting is arguably the best boosting ensemble. Since XGBoost is an advanced version of Gradient Boosting, and its results are unparalleled, it\u2019s arguably the best machine learning ensemble that we have.", "Starting with the Higgs boson Kaggle competition in 2014, XGBoost took the machine learning world by storm often winning first prize in Kaggle competitions. XGBoost\u2019s popularity surged because it consistently outperformed comparable machine learning algorithms in a competitive environment when making predictions from tabular data (tables of rows and columns).", "XGBoost is likely your best place to start when making predictions from tabular data for the following reasons:", "Now that you have a better idea of what XGBoost is, and why XGBoost should be your go-to machine learning algorithm when working with tabular data (as contrasted with unstructured data such as images or text where neural networks work better), let\u2019s build some models.", "If you\u2019re running Colab Notebooks, XGBoost is included as an option.

The following code loads the scikit-learn Diabetes Dataset, which measures how much the disease has spread after one year.

The XGBoost regressor is called XGBRegressor and may be imported as follows:", "We can build and score a model on multiple folds using cross-validation, which is always a good idea. An advantage of using cross-validation is that it splits the data (5 times by default) for you. First, import cross_val_score.", "To use XGBoost, simply put the XGBRegressor inside of cross_val_score along with X, y, and your preferred scoring metric for regression.
