It is just intimidating, you know, the name, Support, Vector, Machine.", "But, it becomes less scary once I started to think of support vector machine as a \u201croad machine\u201d, which separates the left,right-side cars, buildings, pedestrians and makes the widest lane as possible. And those cars, buildings, really close to the street is the support vectors.", "Feeling better. Let\u2019s get started of understanding how this \u201croad machine\u201d works.", "Back to the ML world, those cars, building, pedestrians all become dots now. Red dots stand for objects on the left side of the street; green dots stand for those on the right. The street becomes dashed and solid lines.", "Support Vector Machine (the \u201croad machine\u201d) is responsible for finding the decision boundary to separate different classes and maximize the margin.", "Margins are the (perpendicular) distances between the line and those dots closest to the line.", "Obviously, infinite lines exist to separate the red and green dots in the example above. SVM needs to find the optimal line with the constraint of correctly classifying either class:", "I will illustrate the concept of separate hyperplane and margin, but the explanation of solving the optimization with the constraint will not be covered in this post.", "Hyperplane is an (n minus 1)-dimensional subspace for an n-dimensional space. For a 2-dimension space, its hyperplane will be 1-dimension, which is just a line. For a 3-dimension space, its hyperplane will be 2-dimension, which is a plane that slice the cube. Okay, you got the idea.", "Assuming the label y is either 1 (for green) or -1 (for red), all those three lines below are separating hyperplanes. Because they all share the same property \u2014 above the line, is green; below the line, is red.", "This property can be written in math again as followed:", "If we further generalize these two into one, it becomes:", "Separate hyperplane constraint is written mathematically above. In the perfect scenario \u2014 linear separable scenario, this constraint can be met by SVM. But in the nonseparable scenario, we will need to loosen it.", "The distance between either side of the dashed line to the solid line is the margin. We can think of this optimal line as the mid-line of the widest stretching we can possibly have between red and green dots.", "To sum up, SVM in the linear separable cases:", "In the linearly separable case, SVM is trying to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, with the condition that both classes are classified correctly. But in reality, datasets are probably never linearly separable, so the condition of 100% correctly classified by a hyperplane will never be met.", "SVM address non-linearly separable cases by introducing two concepts: Soft Margin and Kernel Tricks.", "Let\u2019s use an example. If I add one red dot in the green cluster, the dataset becomes linear nonseparable anymore. Two solutions to this problem:", "Two types of misclassifications are tolerated by SVM under soft margin:", "Applying Soft Margin, SVM tolerates a few dots to get misclassified and tries to balance the trade-off between finding a line that maximizes the margin and minimizes the misclassification.", "Degree of toleranceHow much tolerance(soft) we want to give when finding the decision boundary is an important hyper-parameter for the SVM (both linear and nonlinear solutions). In Sklearn, it is represented as the penalty term \u2014 \u2018C\u2019. The bigger the C, the more penalty SVM gets when it makes misclassification. Therefore, the narrower the margin is and fewer support vectors the decision boundary will depend on.", "What Kernel Trick does is it utilizes existing features, applies some transformations, and creates new features. Those new features are the key for SVM to find the nonlinear decision boundary.", "In Sklearn \u2014 svm.SVC(), we can choose \u2018linear\u2019, \u2018poly\u2019, \u2018rbf\u2019, \u2018sigmoid\u2019, \u2018precomputed\u2019 or a callable as our kernel/transformation.
