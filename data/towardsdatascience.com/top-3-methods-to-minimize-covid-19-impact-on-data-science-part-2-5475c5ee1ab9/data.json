Specifically, we are taking a deeper dive into potential data replacement techniques, followed by reviewing some feature engineering approaches.", "If you\u2019d like to learn more about the possible repercussions of COVID-19 on ML pipelines, check it out here. The first part of this series covered data-centric methods that can be found here. It would be helpful to go through those before jumping ahead.", "In the first part of this series, we discussed replacing data impacted by COVID-19 data with historical data. This could be a good option in cases where what you are predicting is expected to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, dropping COVID-19 impacted data without replacement is not possible due to the amount of data available, and you believe the historical data is a fair representation of what would have occurred without COVID-19.", "Another option to consider when replacing data includes replacing data impacted by COVID-19 with the original predictions for this time period (before COVID-19 impact). This might be a good option where we see significant changes over time that are due to multiple complex features that wouldn\u2019t -be reflected if replacing the data with historical data. This would of course require high confidence that our prior predictions would accurately reflect what we would have seen in our data if not for the pandemic.", "Applying this replacement technique to an example, let\u2019s say you were predicting regional toilet paper sales at a weekly level, but only have a few years of data. If you are wanting to predict sales into the future after the COVID-19 crisis has (hopefully) passed, and you see that your model\u2019s predictions have been significantly altered by COVID-19, you will need some method for handling the impacted data. If the crisis impacts sales for 3\u20134 months, and you only have 3 years of data, this is already impacting 10% of your data so you likely don\u2019t want to drop it. You could instead replace the data with historical values if you feel confident that the data would reflect what would have happened if not for COVID-19. Alternatively, if your forecasts were highly accurate in the past, you could replace the impacted data with prior forecasted data. There are risks, of course, but as long as clear communication is used to detail those risks, this might be a viable solution.", "Depending on your modeling technique, another potential option is to utilize oversampling. In cases where you are trying to minimize the impact of data during the pandemic, it might be reasonable to still keep COVID-19 impacted data but instead of replacing or modifying it, attempt to reduce its impact by oversampling from time periods where COVID-19 was not a factor. This is a similar approach to what is used in classification techniques where one has imbalanced classes and thus oversamples from the underrepresented class. This may work in the reverse situation as well. In situations where you feel like more recent data will be a better representation of future patterns than most of your historical data, you could oversample from the time period impacted by COVID-19.", "Let\u2019s say we are trying to forecast energy use at restaurants and believe that activity will soon be returning to pre-COVID levels. When creating your training data set for your forecast models, you could choose to oversample from non-COVID-19 impacted time periods, but keep the COVID-19 data as part of the dataset. This could result in reducing the impact of COVID-19 data on your model, without completely removing or replacing the data. One way this might be helpful is where there are other effects happening during COVID-19 (outdoor seating is energy inefficient) that you don\u2019t want to remove, but still want to minimize the impact of that data.", "On the other hand, if you are forecasting something like home cleaning supplies and you believe that future volume will be more similar to what we have seen in recent months, you may want to oversample from more recent data. This may be advisable in situations where you may be modeling very noisy patterns and as a result, the models are not quickly learning to trust the new patterns and thus appropriately impact forecasts. For example, if you\u2019ve seen a drastic increase in sales of your home cleaning products that in normal circumstances your model would treat as an anomaly and ignore, you could consider this oversampling technique as a possible solution to help \u201cconvince\u201d the model of the new trend.", "One of the more complex approaches to handling the data is through feature engineering. Essentially, we can create features that can be used to account for the COVID-19 impact on our data. Going back to the energy use example, one way to model COVID-19 would be to add a feature indicating if the given time period is impacted by COVID-19. This could be a simple flag (0/1 to indicate COVID-19 timing) or could be some sort of index reflecting the degree of COVID-19 impact to the data at a given time, perhaps based on the number of cases or extent of the economic shutdown. One potential problem may be that there is not enough data with the COVID-19 impact for it to fully understand the effect, especially for models that already do well at smoothing out outliers.", "In some applications, we can model the effect of COVID-19 by merging it with another feature that has somewhat similar effects on our predictions. For our energy use example, we may be able to treat the pandemic as a Holiday/Summertime period in those use cases where the COVID-19 closures impact behavior in a similar way. This can potentially help with the limited data issue for models, to isolate the effect of COVID-19. To explain this, let\u2019s take a look at the data from the UK\u2019s National Grid.", "The graph above shows the electricity demand for March 2020 across the whole week. A quick glance can tell you that after the lockdown measures, the electricity demand dropped by around 10\u201315%. But the most important piece of analysis from the above graphs is the flattening of the morning \u201cpeak\u201d as the usage of coffee machines, heating, etc. spreads over the course of the day. If you look closely enough, you will realize that the weekdays are beginning to look very similar to weekends (compare the blue line during weekdays to the rest during weekends). This is an indication of how we can model the current data essentially as a \u201cweekend\u201d and still manage a decent forecast. Again, the assumptions need to be communicated to all stakeholders.", "For multivariate models, another promising approach would be creating features that can help models learn that something unusual was happening at this time, similar to what we might do with natural disasters. For example, the following features may prove beneficial in a variety of models, including forecasting solutions:", "For features like these to be useful for forecasting, we\u2019d also need to make assumptions around future values for them. We could use different input values to scenario possible situations, including a return to normal. By adding features that can help explain what is going on at this time, we may be able to avoid solutions that would require removing or heavily modifying data. In other words, machine learning models may be able to learn relevant information that can be used for forecasting the future, by adding features that can isolate the impact of COVID-19.", "Usman Gohar is a Data Scientist, Co-organizer of Data Science Minneapolis and a Tech Speaker.
