I wanted a piece of the 3Vs. I wanted to analyze the crap out of the endless stream, model it, visualize it, transform it, crush it. Years later, the words \u2018Big Data\u2019 make me lift an eyebrow, awaiting another shower of buzzwords and vague expectations. Have Big Data lost its attraction or have I just become cynical?", "I\u2019ve recently become allergic to buzzwords. They are incredibly overrated and do not mean anything anymore. Here is a sentence that tells you nothing: Let\u2019s use big data to bring innovation in this new digital world. It sounds cool, sure. Yet, the reality is probably stuck in Excel spreadsheets, frustration and slow computations.", "Big Data excited everyone because it represented this idea of a huge treasure (\u201cit\u2019s gonna be huuuuge\u201d, sounds familiar?) in which you could search, find and use anything that was valuable to you. My initial reaction was to think \u201cin all that data, there must be something in there that we definitely want to know\u201d. That might have been true, but at what cost?", "Dealing with large volumes of data requires computational power, the right storage and the right tooling to move data from one location to another. Bottlenecks happen much more easily than you think. As much as computing power has become much cheaper and more accessible with cloud platforms, an exponential growth of cloud storage, regular use of cloud computations or even the maintenance of on-premise servers represent a large expense. Came the biggest lesson of the century about data:", "While some data will be as valuable as gold for a specific miner, it will be an incredible waste of storage space for another.", "Companies stored the data and chose whether the data was useful later, while the costs were already spent. What if one would determine whether the data is useful before gathering it?", "Garbage in, garbage out is the most important saying in the Data Science world. And a lot of what was considered big data is garbage, meaning that it is unreliable, uncleaned data that requires an extreme amount of work to be usable. And sometimes, the little information that can be found in an extremely large datasets is not worth the effort, time and costs that need to be spent to find it.", "According to Forrester reports, at least 60% of all data within an enterprise remains unused.", "What if the cost of storage for this unused data would be invested in the right infrastructure for the data that one actually cares for ?", "The area of \u201cjust throw as much data as possible to the AI\" is over. People have realized that no, not every single feature is useful (and it can even be hurtful!) and the quality of the data often matters more than the quantity. We want data that measures something we care about, in a reliable, consistent manner. By knowing the quality of our data, it also allows us to move to a phase of explainable, responsible and safe AI.", "We\u2019ve realized that we got the data. Now we need the infrastructures to safely use it, share it, analyze it and make a difference between useless garbage and valuable information. We\u2019ve also decided that data and AI were for the world to use and for the world to understand by promising quality and reliability in both. As much as a few people have a hard time understand this, data (like many other things in life) does not need to be huge, it needs to be reliable.", "Big data is dead.
