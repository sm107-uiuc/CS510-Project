I clicked it and saw that they were searching for teams with different skills, also including Data Scientists. Awesome I thought, I\u2019m in!", "I signed up, applied and got accepted. Bingo!", "A little bit about my background could be helpful. I am currently studying in my first year the Master of Computer Science in Germany and I am working part-time as a Machine Learning Engineer. So I know some basics, but well, I thought a Hackathon also exists for bringing beginners into the game and make them socialize with similar minded people.", "Since this was my first Hackathon, I thought the duration of one month is more or less normal. I looked up other Hackathons by now, it is not!", "I ended up in a random nine-headed team with people from all over the globe. Those are some really amazing and highly ambitious people, which was also the driving force for coming this far in the game.", "The official start has arisen. We made some first calls, got to know each other and did nothing but brainstorm for the first few days. Due to the fact of this unusual long duration of the Hackathon, we got some time to think, so it\u2019s okay. But wait \u2026 I am the Data Scientist of the team right? I signed up with the expectation that I would receive some kind of data. Even before it started I already thought about what things I am going to analyze!", "Three days passed. Nothing received. Well played Hackathon company! Okay, what to do? I could scrape data from the web. Since I am doing marketing or sales-focused Data Science, I first looked up: how to scrape Instagram.", "Could have been useful, but hey, it was the third day, we didn\u2019t know which product and strategy we want to go for, so I didn\u2019t know what to scrape from Instagram.", "Sidenote: The semi-finals took place after the first two weeks and after being selected into the top seven teams, we had another ten days to submit the final presentation.", "The first week is over and we got some rough schemes for our product. I switched basically into the role of the idea generator because there was nothing else to do. In the meantime, I found out that there are a lot of product-related sales data provided by websites like Statista. Nice I thought, but \u2026 it costs money (\u20ac).", "You may think now is the right time for me to scrape Instagram data for marketing analysis. The thing that interested me was how specific keywords or hashtags were used and search among the last months / years in order to find trends for our product. Well no! I had easy times to scrape pictures and their hashtags, but keyword analysis for Instagram also .. costs money (\u20ac).", "Sidenote: I have exams and work to do in the meantime, so I could not spend one entire month of work into this Hackathon, like everyone else of course.", "Turns out my team is pretty brilliant. After presenting our semi final presentation we had been selected to move forward into the finals. I provided many ideas and thoughts, but Data Science related insights? Not yet! I really wanted to do some Data Science now for the finals.", "What was this with the .. a yes, a survey!", "Turns out that setting up a survey with Google Survey is pretty easy. I spent a few hours to think of some good questions, even though I have never done this before. I thought that I don\u2019t want to annoy the people with a survey that takes 10 minutes to fill. For that reason, I chose only seven questions and tried to cover as much as possible, such as:", "After coming up with clear and specific questions, I spammed it to all of my contacts. And all of my team members sent it to their contacts. But still, this was not enough!", "If the Hackathon company doesn\u2019t want to provide me data, they shall at least take responsibility and distribute my survey among their company intern mail distributor.", "After two days of collecting votes, I downloaded the results as CSV file from Google Survey, super nice. Finally, the time has come to make some data analysis. Unfortunately, I can not show any of my plots, because this is confidential and classified information, but let me say it like this, Seaborn released a new version in which they make bivariate plots with histplot preeeetty nice and easily useable.", "Now I could support my team with so-called Personas based on the surveys questions. This is a marketing thing to identify and describe the most likely people who are going to buy our product.", "I could also evaluate other metrics to support the sales team and evaluate user behavior to address this to our designer and adjust the product design in this way.", "In general, I have learned a lot. I would not participate again at a one month long Hackathon, but for sure in a shorter one. What I took away is that I now ask in advance if data is going to be provided or not. Maybe it is a special case for this Hackathon I participated in, because it was less Hackathon, but more an idea pitch.", "Keep that in mind if you ever plan to take place in such an event.", "We didn't. We made second place out of 130 participants and 30 teams and won a decent prize. Good enough I guess :).", "Your home for data science.
