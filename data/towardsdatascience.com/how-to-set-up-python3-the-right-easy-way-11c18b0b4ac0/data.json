This step is pretty essential because if you did it the wrong way, plenty of issues would arise and distract you from focusing on the actual development work. So, I\u2019ve decided to write a comprehensive guide listing the steps to help others setting their python development environment from scratch. Hence, you have a more comfortable life handling errors. Let\u2019s get started!", "3. For Data Scientists/Developers who want to make python3 the default interpreter \u2014 type python \u2192 get python3 not python 2.7.", "4. For Data Scientists who want to start using virtualenv within their machine learning projects to have reproducible notebooks \u2014 no more fighting between Dev-ops Engineers and Data Scientists.", "5. For future me \ud83d\ude0e in case I treat myself again!", "First, you need to do is installing the Xcode if you don\u2019t have one already. This step is necessary because MacOs has to set up some local development utilities, including various tools like git.", "The second step would be the magic wand of MacOs, which is homebrew. All you have to do is to copy and paste the link into your terminal and hit return, and that\u2019s it.", "Please be sure to navigate to the link before installing and reading what will be installed on your machine to ensure that you are ok with it.", "Once installed, you can grab a cup of coffee and start installing whatever you want without worry about anything. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions and begin installing python using brew! Instead, install the environment manager pyenv. Pyenv is a tool to manage the python versions installed in your local machine; it is available to many other operating systems, including Ubuntu, windows.", "Please note that MacOs use zsh as the default shell command. in case you want to move into bash just run chsh -s/bin/bash in the terminal. Also, you can change it using the GUI in MacOs using this guide.", "2. Restart the terminal for changes to take effect or run exec \"$SHELL\".", "3. Set up the zlib compression algorithm and SQLite database to avoid any build issues if you intend to develop python packages or frameworks to automate your machine learning pipeline. You can configure them simply by exporting their paths in the .bash_profile", "In case you don\u2019t have a .bash_profile file, you can follow this answer on StackOverflow to create one or this one.", "4. The next step is to install xz package using homebrew. This step is optional; however, it may avoid Runtime errors when importing pandas. This error might be raised due to lzma compression that the python installation is not complete. We need to install some dependencies \u2014 like xz package, before python installation via the pyenv to avoid those errors. You can run the following line in the terminal:", "If you already installed python via pyenv before xz, you can use the pyenv uninstall <the version>. The installation of xz should be prior to pyenv.", "5. Now it is finally time to install python \ud83d\ude04. To do so, you need to choose which python version you want to install. you can list all the available python versions supported by pyenv using this command", "pyenv supports many python versions including anaconda, jython, miniconda, etc.", "6. I will install python version 3.8.6(I found pandas installation has some issues with 3.9.0) by running the following command in the terminal :", "7. The following command should make the installed version global. This will override python 2.7 shipped with the MacOs by default \u2014 no more python3 command\ud83d\udc4c.", "9. To enable shims and autocompletion, you need to include this configuration in the .bash_profile if you are using bash \u2014 as per documentation instruction.", "To avoid the persistent warning about upgrading the pip package. It would be best if you upgrade the pip package.", "According to the documentation, you can run the following command in the terminal to upgrade", "If you still have issues with the upgrade, run the previous command with the sudo -H command, however, this is not preferable.", "Thanks to Joe Klemmer suggestion, I was able to use the pyenv-virtualenv plugin instead of the virtualenv package. Utilizing this plugin would automatically activate and deactivate the virtual environment after adding the required configuration in the bash_profile \u2014 no more source/bin/activate\ud83d\udc4d.", "If you like to use virtualenvwrapper or virtualenv, I will keep the steps below for future reference.", "To enable automatically activating the virtualenv every time you open a project directory, you need two steps:", "2.

Create a project directory with the valid virtualenv environment version", "Now, you can easily switching between environments easily without worry about activating commands.", "It is a good practice to use a virtual environment for your projects so you can worry less about sharing your projects, notebooks, packages, frameworks, etc. So, your team can reproduce the code and easily running your code without issues. I would focus on utilizing vertualenv; however, other methods can automatically initialize the virtualenv every time you create a project directory, virtualenvwrapper, for example. Start by installing virtualenv using the following.", "As demonstrated in the captured image, the file ran successfully free from any errors. The command deactivate might be used to deactivating the running virtual environment.", "It is a good practice to include a requirements.txt file with the project directory to make it easy for others to download and run smoothly. This can be done using the pip freeze command to list all the packages in requirements.txt format \u2014 specifying each package's specific version to avoid conflict.", "Also, you can use pip list to list the installed packages \u2014 check the main differences between list and freeze commands.", "If you use VSCode, make sure that it utilizes the proper interpreter \u2014 the created virtual environment. You can follow this guide to switch between the interpreters.", "For MacOs, press shift + cmd + p, then navigate to Select Interpreter.", "Then select the virtualenv in our case, is devenv", "If you want to install a newer version of python via pyenv, you can list all the installed versions using:", "This will remove the specified version from your machine.", "At this point, the development environment is up and running. That way, you would spend less time debugging intimidating system issues and focus on building instead.", "Another way to set up your development environment without worried about writing some shell commands is to use Ansible Playbook. It is a set of configurations for most of the software required for the Mac. It does include Sequal Pro, homebrew, etc.", "If you would like to make your terminal more pretty with colors, you can use this configurations to set your bash_profile.", "If you would like to make it simple like mine, you can fork or copy my bash_profile config file at this link, including anaconda config, but different python version, this link to the simple bash_profile to follow up with this tutorial, in addition to git-completion.", "Finally, I wish this gave a comprehensive guide to set up your python development environment.
