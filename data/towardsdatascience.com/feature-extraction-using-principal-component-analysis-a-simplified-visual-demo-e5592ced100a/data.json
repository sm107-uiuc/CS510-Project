When I taught Data Science at General Assembly in San Francisco, I found that helping students visualize the transformation between features and principal components greatly enhanced their understanding. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that has four main parts: feature covariance, eigendecomposition, principal component transformation, and choosing components in terms of explained variance. The purpose of this blog is to share a visual demo that helped the students understand the final two steps.", "To understand PCA, we have to know its purpose. To understand the purpose, we have to know the Curse of Dimensionality, the underlining problem the method solves. While we can always look up an exhaustive definition on Wikipedia, the following provides a more straightforward and intuitive explanation:", "\u201cAs the number of features or dimensions grows, the amount of data we need to generalize accurately grows exponentially.\u201d", "\u2014 Charles Isbell, Professor, School of Interactive Compution, Georgia Tech", "Curse of Dimensionality \u2014 A KDNuggets post authored by Prasad Pore.", "There are two options to reduce dimensionality:", "PCA is a dimensionality reduction that identifies important relationships in our data, transforms the existing data based on these relationships, and then quantifies the importance of these relationships so we can keep the most important relationships and drop the others. To remember this definition, we can break it down into four steps:", "Again, we can look up a complete explanation of all the terms mentioned on Wikipedia. I found the following posts more intuitive and helpful.", "A great visualization is published by 3blue1brown for Step 2 (In fact, I highly recommend their entire animated series for linear algebra). The following section covers the visualization for Steps 3 and 4.", "The following demo presents the linear transformation between features and principal components using eigenvectors for a single data point from the Iris database. I describe the calculations without using any linear algebra terms. However, it would be helpful if you understand the dot product between two vectors (since we demonstrate the transformation for a single data point) and matrix multiplication (when we transform all data points).", "Figure 3 includes the values for each part. One of the best ways to learn and understand a mathematical method is to validate that the numbers add up. From here, we are going to do some simple calculations.", "To transform the features into principal components, we multiply the features with the eigenvectors element by element, as shown in Figure 4 above, and add them in the horizontal direction.", "2. Transform Principal Components back into Features.", "Well, you can certainly transform the principal components back into the original features by performing the calculation shown in Figure 5 above.", "After visualizing the math behind the transformation, let\u2019s demonstrate the difference between feature elimination and feature extraction.", "As shown in Figure 6 above, if we choose to reduce dimensionality through feature elimination, we remove some features entirely, in this case, x3 and x4. All information provided by petal length and petal width is lost when we reduce the dimension from 4 to 2.", "In contrast, when we reduce dimensionality through feature extraction methods such as PCA, we keep the most important information by selecting the principal components that explain most of the relationships among the features. Here is where the eigenvalues kick in and help us learn how much information each principal component contains.", "In our case, the first and second principal components (i.e., pc1 and pc2) explained more than 95% of the variation from the features based on the normalized eigenvalue associated with each eigenvector, as shown in Figure 8 below. Therefore, we only keep pc1 and pc2.", "Note that each of the principal components contains information from all four features. By keeping only pc1 and pc2, we extract the most important information from all four features and reduce the dimension from 4 to 2.", "I want to conclude my blog post with several remarks, including the use of PCA, the pros and cons of PCA, as well as when not to use PCA.", "Potential Use Cases for PCA (not an exhaustive list)", "Misuse of PCA (not an exhaustive list)", "Your home for data science.
