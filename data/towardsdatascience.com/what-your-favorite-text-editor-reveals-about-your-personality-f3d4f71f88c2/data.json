Besides, gender-unspecific language is used for obvious reasons. Which doesn\u2019t mean that this story is free of stereotypes!", "When did the word Yuppie go out of fashion? It\u2019s a shame, because it fits perfectly to the type of person that uses Brackets: It\u2019s that kid with horn-rimmed glasses, tweed pants and a chest-long, meticulously trimmed beard who\u2019s obsessed with the espresso in the caf\u00e9 around the corner.", "Why? Because they can make any site look breathtaking, and Brackets is their go-to tool for that. Plus, for reasons that nobody understands, the layout reminds them of the packaging of their favorite beard shampoo\u2026", "The kind of person who\u2019s clever but doesn\u2019t open their mouth very much. The kind of person with wild dreams that nobody knows about. The type that would like to see their name in programmers\u2019 Hall of Fame but keeps quiet about that.", "Or, in other words, your average JavaScript developer. That\u2019s the type that uses WebStorm: Tailored to JavaScript like no other editor, this one is made for people who do JavaScript-World and nothing else.", "Solely for OS X, Coda is for that person next door that always runs around with a shiny new MacBook and creates elusive graphics for the web.", "They\u2019re usually city-hoppers, never staying in one place for more than a few months. They\u2019ve tried working on a farm, but noticed that the chicken drove them mad while they were trying to code.", "One can\u2019t help the feeling that this person is hiding a thousand books worth of life experience behind their business-casual attire. But they\u2018re masters at hiding their inner secrets from the outside world, both on- and offline.", "Oh, the faithful folks who still haven\u2019t abandoned Windows! Welcome to the world of messy hair, thick tinted spectacles and navy-blue sweaters that look like they\u2019ve been picked up from a nearby thrift shop, bathed in pizza dough and then washed until they\u2019re clean enough to not lose that pizza attire.", "Or, in other words, welcome to the world of Notepad++: A lightweight tool for MS Windows which promises to save the environment by making your computer less busy. It\u2019s true, the users of Notepad++ care about their CPU-space as much as about the environment! There\u2019s just one thing they care about even more and it\u2019s \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 pizza.", "They have no idea which file they put where, or what they called that variable fifty lines earlier in the code. And for reasons that nobody understands, they expect their text editor to take care of all the mess.", "Welcome to Sublime Text \u2014 the text editor that cuts through all the clutter. With so many popups and instant switching even between modified and unsaved files, this is the editor that those people use who think their messiness isn\u2019t only efficient in their heads, but also in their projects.", "Your typical Atom user is the friendliest person on earth. Always sporting pastel-colored sweaters and bringing breakfast for the whole office, what\u2019s not to like about them?", "They\u2019re always there when a helping hand is needed, but they never ask for praise. Always self-sacrificing, if they\u2019ve achieved something, they let somebody else collect the prize money. But everyone knows that nothing would work without them. They\u2019re the glue of every team, the knuckle of every book. Welcome to your average Atom-user.", "Their shoes are squeaky clean, their hair is neatly groomed, and on their desk there is not one speck of dust. They\u2019re not unfriendly, but they\u2019re the person who spots the hair in the soup before everyone else. Everything needs to be perfect; there is no space for unwanted debris in their life.", "The same goes for their style of coding. Never \u2014 and I repeat, never! \u2014 would they write their name under a piece of code that contains even the tiniest of bugs. That\u2019s the user of Visual Studio Code: Debugging is made so easy, you don\u2019t even need a compiler any more. A must-have for every bug-averse coder.", "Green beans, coffee beans, NetBeans. The holy triad!", "Your average NetBeans user is obsessed with code and beans. But especially beans. A day cannot start without a holy coffee bean brew in their favorite coffee shop. After that, they\u2019ll stay for the rest of the day, frantically hacking around on their keyboard.", "They\u2019re of the anxious type. Always scared of losing out. Dressed slightly below casual (those jeans really need a wash), always a little jittery and unfocused, they don\u2019t really need coffee to wake them up. They need coffee to calm themselves down. And code, of course.", "Some people are born engineers. Do a task once? Boring. Do it twice? Automate!", "That\u2019s your average user of TextMate: An engineer with OS X (because that\u2019s the only system where it runs). The quiet person in the corner of the office. The person that never seems to work hard, yet their results are beyond amazing. The person who doesn\u2019t say much in meetings, but asks brilliant questions. The person who doesn\u2019t socialize a lot, but would always help you out on a problem.", "The only downside? Their work often goes unnoticed. It can take years before they get some recognition. That\u2019s your average user of TextMate.", "There\u2019s always that one person in your group of friends who\u2019s obsessed about every new productivity hack. Your average user of IntelliJ is that friend.", "They\u2019re the one who put butter in their coffee a few years back, practices the extremest forms intermittent fasting and drinks protein shakes at 4 A. M. in the morning. If you offer them a piece of cake, they\u2019ll gladly take it \u2014 but only to be eaten in five hours, when fasting is over.", "Their dress style is functional above all, and so is their haircut. It\u2019s not bad taste, it just hasn\u2019t got that X-Factor that other clothing has.", "But despite all the focus on productivity, they\u2019re not always the one with the greatest output\u2026", "Their hair is slick, their shirt is freshly pressed, their suit is worth a month\u2019s salary. They\u2019re nice to look at, but not so nice to speak to \u2014 because they don\u2019t know any other topic apart from themselves. They think they\u2019re savvy, but their technical skills are slightly underwhelming. They think they\u2019re learning, but really they\u2019re just bragging.", "Welcome to your average user of Dreamweaver: Complete with a visual interface, this is an editor for show-offs. Secretly, they dislike coding. They don\u2019t like the appeal of a command line interface or understand the power of automation. They\u2019d rather impress their colleagues with that snazzy new website template. And why not? It gets them further in their career.", "The person who hasn\u2019t had a haircut for the last three years, and hasn\u2019t brushed it for the last five months. The person who still wears mom\u2019s sweaters for work. The person whose shoes are falling apart but who refuses to buy new ones (\u201c85% of the material is still intact!\u201d).", "Welcome to your average user of Vim: It doesn\u2019t get geekier than this.", "One-half of the Editor War, Vim is for all those who think in rigidly systematic categories and don\u2019t need much personalization. Vim is for those who like to learn a structure, then never let go of it. Vim is for the geeks of geeks.", "Emacs is the go-to editor for all nerds who haven\u2019t reached geek status. This is the kind of nerd who has a slight dislike for graphical user interfaces but can\u2019t go without them. The kind of nerd who likes to code, but still wants their text editor to be capable of more than code.", "The nerdy person in the corner who always drinks ros\u00e9 wine. The person who, when asked a black-or-white question, will answer with an elaborate gray. The person who gets up at 11 a.m., not because they were sleeping before, but because they were too busy thinking about the optimal time to get up.", "You suck at making decisions? Use Emacs.", "Your average SpaceMacs user is a teacher in academia. Elegantly dressed in worn-out clothes. With a fresh cactus in a smelly office. A beaming smile with tired eyes. And a laugh that is as weird as it is infectious.", "They\u2019re a person who wants to quit with the Editor War. A person who is not as indecisive as an Emacs user, but not as decidedly geeky as a Vimmer. A person who never wants to take center stage. A harmony-dependent person. Often with a purple terminal background.", "Welcome to SpaceMacs \u2014 traditional and unspectacular.", "Who needs code when they can write dramas? That\u2019s what the nerd with the thick glasses and the tweed jacket would say. You know, the one that sits in the corner of the bar each evening and sips on their cognac, thinking that they\u2019ll appear smarter that way.", "Code is just a trend, they say. Here to stay are Shakespeare, Goethe, Plato, Buddha, to name a few. They open their Frost editor, choose one of those amazing in-built music themes, and start hacking. Coders would say that this nerd\u2019s writing is Shakespearesque. Literary geniuses say their work looks more like computer code.", "Your typical CodeLobster coder doesn\u2019t believe in the joy in simple things. Rather, they\u2019d make everything as complicated as possible. Like, really complicated.", "If they make a cocktail, it needs to contain at least 18 ingredients. If they\u2019re using a browser, then only one with at least 27 plugins. If they\u2019re using an text editor, then one that is compatible with everything and capable of everything. Well, almost everything. You get the idea.", "Did you choose your text editor based on who you are? Or did your text editor shape you into who you are today? You decide.", "Edit, 5 March 2020: As Tylor Borgeson so rightly pointed out, IntelliJ was missing when this article was published. It is included now!Also, after edmund munday\u2019s comment Java-World was renamed to JavaScript-World \u2014 to clarify that JavaScript is very different from Java.", "Edit, 21 March 2020: I added a brand new section on NetBeans, specially for Bran Lim!", "Edit, 6 October 2020: I\u2019ve included Mansidak Singh\u2019s Frost editor!
