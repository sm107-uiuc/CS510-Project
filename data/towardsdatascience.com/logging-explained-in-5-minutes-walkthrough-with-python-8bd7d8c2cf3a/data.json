There are so many things to consider, one of them being able to monitor the application\u2019s flow. That\u2019s where logging comes in \u2014 a simple tool to save some nerves and many, many hours.", "Python has great built-in support for logging. It\u2019s implemented through the logging library, and is quite similar to options found in other major programming languages.", "If you\u2019re more of a video person, or just want to reinforce your knowledge, feel free to watch our video on the topic.", "Before we jump into the code, let\u2019s briefly discuss why you should care about logging, and cover some light theory behind it.", "I\u2019ve mentioned previously that logging is used to monitor applications flow, among other things. The question you may have now is why can\u2019t we just use print statements? We can, but it\u2019s not ideal. There\u2019s no way to track the severity of the message through simple print statements. That\u2019s where logging shines.", "Here\u2019s my top 3 list of reasons why you should use logging in your applications:", "As mentioned previously, the logging library is built into Python programming language and provides 5 severity levels:", "You can reason just from the name when you should use one instead of the other, but it\u2019s important to note that Python shows messages of severity level WARNING and above by default. That behavior can be changed.", "Let\u2019s now explore logging with some simple code.", "To start, let\u2019s perform a couple of imports:", "As you can see, the logging library is included here. I\u2019ve mentioned previously that Python will show only messages of severity level WARNING and above, so here\u2019s how we can change that:", "And that\u2019s it! Let's declare a simple function that generates a random number from 0 to 4, and logs messages of different severity level based on that random number. After a message is displayed, the program sleeps for a second. This function is used purely for testing:", "And finally, we need to call this function somewhere, so why don\u2019t we do that in a loop? Just to have multiple messages printed out:", "If you run this code now, you will get an output similar to mine:", "Keep in mind that your output may differ, due to the randomization process.", "This format is fine for some cases, but other times we might want more control, and to be able to further customize how the output looks like.", "If you were to run this code now, the messages would be formatted in the way specified:", "That\u2019s fine, but what I like to do is to add current date and time information to messages. It\u2019s easy to do with format strings:", "Here\u2019s how our new format looks like:", "Now we\u2019re getting somewhere! To get the actual time the message was logged you\u2019d need to embed the call to datetime.now() inside the message.", "The only problem is that the logs are lost forever once the terminal window is closed. So instead of outputting the messages to the console, let\u2019s explore how we can save them to a file.", "To save log messages to a file, we need to specify values for two more parameters:", "Let\u2019s see how we can use the write mode first. This mode will overwrite any existing file with the specified name every time the application is run. Here\u2019s the configuration:", "If you run the program now, no output would be shown in the console. Instead, a new file called test.log is created, and it contains your log messages:", "If you were to run the program again, these 5 rows would be lost and replaced with new 5 rows. In some cases that\u2019s not what you want, so we can use the append mode to keep the previous data and write new rows o the end. Here\u2019s the configuration:", "If you were to run the program now, and look at our file, you\u2019d see 10 rows there:", "And that\u2019s it. You now know the basics of logging. Let\u2019s wrap things up in the next section.", "Logging isn\u2019t the most fun thing to do, sure. But without it, you are basically blind. Take a moment to think about how would you monitor the behavior and flow of a deployed application without logging? Not so easy, I know.", "In 5 minutes we\u2019ve got the basics covered, and you are now ready to implement logging in your next application. It doesn\u2019t have to be an application in strict terms, you can also use it for data science projects as well.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
