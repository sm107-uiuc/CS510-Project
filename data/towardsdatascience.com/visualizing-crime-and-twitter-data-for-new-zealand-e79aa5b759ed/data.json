One of the ways of quantifying citizen engagement is to look at their twitter habits determining its correlation with the crime in that location.", "The fundamental idea behind this exercise was to visualize the location-specific crime and the sentiment of the people in that area by analyzing their tweets. Evidently, for a thinly populated country like New Zealand, the number of people who opt to share their geolocation was too low for such kind of analysis to be trusted.", "Therefore, the total number of tweets sent to https://twitter.com/nzpolice over a period of 5 years and the crime data corresponding to each region of New Zealand was used. This article describes the methodology to develop the visualizations. Check the short video to see how it looks.", "I tried getting the Twitter developers account but it was refused stating it does not comply with their terms and conditions, which is silly. Because I am neither doing anything for the commercial purposes nor am I trying to steal private data. It is just a small experiment. So I used TweetScraper which actually worked quite well, though it is not bug-free.", "I extracted tweets sent to NZ Police from 2015 to early 2020. The following command is a typical example.", "This query was not really useful, because out of 80,000+ tweets in this period, only a few hundred of those users had allowed geolocation access from Auckland. No point in using it for analysis.", "I was looking for deep learning to do proper sentiment analysis but was not keen on doing more research in that direction. That is a separate topic and deep learning for NLP is an area which is witnessing growth but is not close to applications related to vision yet. So, I decided to use vaderSentiment which is quite straightforward to use.", "Extracted the victimization data from the police website. Incidentally, they already had a visualization using Tableau.", "Nothing beats Pandas when it comes to data preparation. Since it is a structure data which has already beaned cleaned and curated by the Police the task was fairly easy. Here are the code snippets.", "So the real fun in this exercise is to just do it. Due to my familiarity with the tools, I chose R and Shiny for developing the visualization. Shiny Dashboard makes it is really easy to produce quality and interactive visualizations.", "Shiny breaks down the process into that of user interface and server. The logic reside in the server, while the UI can be managed separately. It's very easy to throw up a dashboard with the controls on the side panel.", "The visualization consists of two parts. First one is the choropleth. The Wikipedia definition of a choropleth is:", "A choropleth map (from Greek \u03c7\u1ff6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u201carea/region\u201d and \u03c0\u03bb\u1fc6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u201cmultitude\u201d) is a type of thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each area, such as population density or per-capita income.", "It is essentially what was displayed on the police website, described above.", "The second one is the time-series data of the tweets along with the crime. The use of Dygraph in R makes it an interactive plot. The following is the snapshot of that.", "Notice that there is a spike in March 2019. This was an unfortunate day in New Zealand history when a shootout incident happened in Christchurch.", "There are some other spikes in twitter activity on the NZ Police twitter handle and it would be interesting to investigate those. Overall, I do not see any relation between twitter activity and criminal activity. Though I do see some kind of a cycle in the criminal cases. I wonder if it is more administrative than the actual events on the ground.", "The most fun part was in QGIS where the polygons are prepared which are to be placed on the map. It was difficult to identify a vector shapefile which consisted of the same regions as those used by police for administration. And more importantly with the same names. For example, the police dataset called Auckland as Auckland city.", "A number of vector files are available online. e.g. link", "QGIS makes it very easy to merge different regions and rename the features as required. It is definitely not as good as its commercial counterpart, ArcGIS but it is improving very fast. I have been using it for two years for different projects and I can already see that the newer versions are showing a lot of improvement.", "This is how the final application looks like. Note that the crime counts vary widely across different regions. Due to that, the colour coding was difficult. Therefore a logarithmic scale is used.", "Also, the sliders lead to unnecessary computations as the map is recomputed for every increment in the slider. A better input widget should be used.", "This was just a plain visualization and does provide any insights which are not already known or expected. So these are a few ideas which I might work on in expanding this basic work. Firstly, I have collected the Twitter data. A lot of those were a reaction to a number of events.", "It would be nice to understand at what level people engage with these and quantify their emotional involvement. Currently, the sentiments are just positive, negative and neutral. It would be useful to assign degrees to that, which is an extremely difficult problem.", "Also, it would be nice to make this visualization more useful by adding more categories to crime. Though it is not possible to determine geolocation, it would be nice to quantify people\u2019s engagement with respect to these comes. It would give an idea, for example, on how much people are worried about drugs compared to financial crimes.", "Your home for data science.
