With that being said, here are my 5 THINGS I WISH I KNEW when I started learning data science:", "If you\u2019ve read my older articles, you\u2019ve probably already heard me say this \u2014 a data scientist is really a modern statistician who leverages programming to implement statistical methods.", "Understanding the fundamentals will make your life a lot easier and actually save you time in the long run. Almost all machine learning concepts and algorithms are based on statistics and probability, and on top of that, many other data science concepts, like A/B testing, are purely statistical as well.", "Ultimately, how good you are as a data scientist is limited by how knowledgable you are in programming and statistics.", "Check out my previous article, \u201cHow I\u2019d Learn Data Science if I Could Start Over\u201d for more guidance on this point.", "TLDR: Have a good programming and statistics foundation before learning anything else. It will save you much more time in the long run.", "I know this may be a controversial statement to some of you, so let me preface thing by saying a couple of things:", "Personal data science projects are a great way to learn because you\u2019ll be forced to think critically about the problem and solution all on your own.", "Through this, you\u2019ll learn so much more than any bootcamp can teach you. You\u2019ll learn how to ask the right questions, how to Google the right questions, how to approach a data science project that works for you, how to be methodical, etc\u2026", "By being more invested in your own project, you\u2019ll also feel more motivated to learn more and invest more time, creating a positive feedback loop.", "TLDR: Spend less time doing data science bootcamps and more time working on personal data science projects.", "Need some ideas to get started? Check out my article, \u201c14 Data Science Projects to do During Your 14 Day Quarantine\u201d.", "There are so many data science packages and tools out there, and that\u2019s cool because you get to personalize your data science toolkit in a way that works for you.", "However, it\u2019s easy to get carried away in wanting to learn as many packages and tools as possible. Don\u2019t make this mistake.", "You\u2019ll be much better off being extremely fluent in a few tools than scratching the surface with several tools that you\u2019ve barely spent any time using. (Having a laundry list of skills and tools on your resume should not be the end goal!)", "To give an example, there are several great data visualization packages out there: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, etc\u2026 There is no need to spend your time trying to master every single one of these \u2014 it\u2019s a waste of your precious and limited time.", "Another example, if you want to manipulate data with Pandas, be really good with Pandas. If you\u2019re more of a NumPy type of guy, go for it. Yes, ideally you\u2019d like to be good at Pandas and NumPy, but my point is that it\u2019s probably a good idea to stick to one and master it, rather than constantly hopping around.", "TLDR: Establish your data science tool kit and stick to it! Mastering 5 tools are better than barely knowing how to use 20 tools.", "Personally, what got me into data science was all of the different machine learning models, how they worked, and what applications they were useful in. I probably spent at least six months learning and dabbling with several machine learning models, only to realize that it made it a fraction of what a data scientist needs to know.", "Data modeling is only one part of the entire machine learning life cycle. There\u2019s data collection, data preparation, model evaluation, model deployment, and model tuning that you need to have an understanding of as well. In fact, I would say that the majority of time is spent on data preparation, NOT data modeling (machine learning modeling).", "On top of that, there are a several other things that you\u2019ll have to learn, like version control (Git), pulling data from APIs, understanding the cloud, and the list goes on.", "TLDR: Do not spend all of your time trying to master every machine learning algorithm. It only makes up a small percentage of what a data scientist needs to know.", "From the very first day when I started learning data science and to this very day, I experience Imposter Syndrome on a regular basis. But I learned that that\u2019s completely normal.", "Why is it common and okay for data scientists to feel imposter syndrome?", "TLDR: As a data scientist, you will always feel imposter syndrome, and that\u2019s okay.", "Through reading this, I hope that I was able to give you some insights and useful advice that will help clear some of the misconceptions you have and also make your data science journey a lot smoother than mine!", "I\u2019ve received really good feedback for my more opinionated data science articles, which is why I wrote this. Like always, take this with a grain of salt if you disagree with anything that I said. But if you enjoyed it, please let me know what else you\u2019d like me to write about.", "I wish you guys the best in your data science journey as always!", "Your home for data science.
