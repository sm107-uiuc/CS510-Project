But instead of seeing it that way, realize that you have the freedom to construct a learning path that suits you and can bring out the best in you. One good thing is you can learn at times where your brain is at peak efficiency and rest when it\u2019s less efficient. Moreover, you get to decide what you learn according to your interest and passion.", "A few tips while learning online is to always take simple notes, writing takeaways at the end of the day or blogging about what you\u2019ve learned. By the same vein, utilizing the Feynman Technique by explaining what you have learned to friends and family is important, especially for a complex subject such as Data Science.", "Moreover, when learning machine learning algorithms and neural networks, it\u2019s crucial to learn it along with writing the code, this way you can see what you\u2019re learning, and have a better understanding of the topic at hand. It\u2019s also good to be a part of online communities such as Reddit, Discord, etc. so you can ask questions and obtain great answers from experts.", "To end, here is a quote by Arthur W. Chickering and Stephen C. Ehrmann", "\u201cStudents do not learn much just sitting in classes listening to teachers, memorizing prepackaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write reflectively about it, relate it to past experiences, and apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves.\u201d", "Thanks for reading and I hope this article was resourceful for you.", "Please leave in the comments any other free online courses for Data Science you would suggest!", "Data Science toolbox \u2014 An introductory series to Data Science", "Read my series on Ultralearning Data science that proffers a profusion of advice and tips on learning effectively.", "Here\u2019s some great resources for Data Science!", "If you want to be updated with my latest articles follow me on Medium.", "Your home for data science.
