It was created by the two wizards Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman with the only aim of winning a statistical duel.It provides charms for statistical computing and graphics. Its special enchantments allow it to perform statistical modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering and graphical techniques.", "You basically go where the crowd goes.", "When I talk about Python in this article it is not about the generic language capabilities as a whole(That would be unfair) but instead a subset of packages(numpy,scipy etc..) built using the same to meet the requirement of ever growing statistical problems in this age of Big Data.", "Python is more popular than R according to TIOBE ratings.", "What makes python more popular is its generic programming styles (Zen of Python), faster learning curve and the most important reason of all is the excess of high level packages and frameworks for Machine & Deep Learning (SK-learn,Keras,Pytorch,Tensorflow etc\u2026).You perform Data Analysis with an end goal of making a decision so if the decision making(DM) tool itself is in Python you would prefer to do the analysis part in the same as it is easier to integrate with the DM algos in the future. R also has equivalent frameworks but are not as well known.", "As I mentioned earlier Python is very intuitive where as R has a very steep learning curve.The first time I used python I loved it. Everything was so easy.I thought I could conquer the software world with it.But I was naive.The C course in the next semester showed me my place.(Who teaches C just after Python?).", "Even though I had better programming knowledge by the time I came across it ,R was very troublesome.In the beginning it took tripple the amount of time to cookup a code(checking out packages and different constructs were a pain) than it would take for an equivalent Python code.As you familiarise yourself with the R coding style it gets better but I still suffer due to non-intuitive constructs in R.Its probably feel so because I\u2019m addicted to python.", "Ipython notebook makes coding cleaner and easier (magic cmds).It supports both R and Python Kernels.", "Nonetheless I favour Python in this round.", "Anyone who has used both ggplot2(& others) and matplotlib.pyplot will probably agree with me when I state that the latter is a crude beast when compared to the former.There are other Python visualisation packages like seaborn which are good but not upto R\u2019s standards.", "If we are talking in terms of statistical computing and modelling powers R is clearly superior to Python.It has a lot more verified statistical computing packages that are yet to be implemented in Python.Python is closing the gap every hour.", "So the question arises- Is R a dying language?", "No this is not true.R is the language of the learned-Statisticians ,Researchers in medicine & life sciences etc find R to be a better tool than python.The reason could be thought of as a result of superior statistical packages and customs.", "The question mostly arises in our mind due to a booming hype created around Deep Learning and Neural Networks where Python dominates the area and creates a feeling that R is loosing its place in the field as Deep Learning is closely associated with Data Science(& Analytics).Its like a Decoy effect.", "I conducted a poll in Facebook (AI & DL group) to verify the above reasoning and that resultant stats agreed with the reasoning.", "So R manages to triumph over python in this round.", "Like the wizards themselves (before the famous duel-Harry potter reference) there is no clear proof indicating the superiority of one over the other.", "Like a diplomatic politician I\u2019d say that if your aim is classical statistical analysis then go with R and if your aim is Machine Learning than go with Python as the support is better and coding easier.", "But I believe that for a Data Science and ML enthusiast its good to be a jack of both the trades.", "I tried integrating fictional aspects to bring humour to this article.Hope you enjoy it.Please do comment if there are any important characteristics that I could have missed as I cooked up the article in my class hours.", "Your home for data science.
