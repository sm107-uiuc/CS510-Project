The impact of the coronavirus varies between countries massively. Some are facing robust challenges and struggling to get the outbreak under control. Still, countries like South Korea, Singapur, and Taiwan were able to react to the situation almost instantly and bounce back faster.", "Back in February 2020, South Korea was reporting one of the highest daily rates of Coronavirus spread in the world. Besides Mainland China, the number of infected people was the highest, and the forecast was predicting anything, but the worst-case scenarios.", "But as the graph suggests, the curve\u2019s started to flatten much faster than initially anticipated, and the situation was maintained. How is it possible that South Korea has been able to respond to the case so immediately and effectively?", "South Korea has already faced a similar situation but on a much smaller scale. In 2015 a Korean traveler, who came back to Seoul from the Middle East region, brought with him an infection known as MERS-CoV, also caused by a coronavirus. Due to virus novelty in the country, it took a couple of days until the illness was correctly diagnosed. By the time the virus was confirmed, it has been further transmitted, and it seemed almost impossible to trace who was infected. The infection caused 186 MERS-CoV cases in the country and resulted in 14-day quarantine for 16,993 Koreans and an economic loss of 8.5 billion US dollars. Besides Saudi Arabia, South Korea had the highest number of infected people globally:", "Although the virus appeared quite unexpectedly, its further progress was prevented relatively quickly. Rapid testing of the people and the use of various types of advanced technologies, data analytics, and information about the population have been proven as practical measures.", "The first case of the virus in South Korea was confirmed on January 20. An infected lady traveling from Chinese Wuhan was isolated, and officials managed to keep the situation under control. All has changed with the \u201cpatient 31\u201d. Before tested positive, the patient 31 was in a minor accident, checked in a hospital twice, and visited a service at a church. She has been in contact with hundreds of people and has successfully transmitted the virus to many of them. Since then, South Korea confirmed thousands of virus cases in the time of a few days, and the numbers grew steeply, and the outbreak was the biggest outside Mainland China.", "South Korea did a great job when it comes to the prevention of the further spread of the virus, and there are several reasons why. Learning from the experience with MERC, they were able to apply effective measures like:", "Contract Tracing is an excellent example of how to make big data working at scale and bring actionable insights.", "When we\u2019re coming back to the story about our patient 31, the officials were able to track her movement, people she came to contact with, and alert everyone who might be at risk.", "The contact tracing app is based on different kinds of data:", "Information about location might be tracked through several sources: GPS data from smart devices, credit card transactions, or others. Once combined, a comprehensive picture of a confirmed patient\u2019s movement is shared publicly. The app gives information about the history, timeline, and the location visited by the individual. Restaurant and hotel visits, which transportation means they used, which line or bus number they took, even the exact seat in the movie theater is tracked. CCTV cameras are also used extensively when monitoring and analyzing virus transmission. There are more than 1.1 million operational CCTV cameras in South Korea every day. Based on statistics from 2010, each citizen is capture by the public CCTV system on average of 83.1 times every day, and the trend has grown over the years.", "Smart contact tracing reduces the reaction time of authorities to identify a potential threat, isolate transmitters of the virus, and notify everyone who might be in danger. The public app also informs each user, which areas were visited by confirmed patients, which places are under quarantine, and who might be potentially affected. The system also tracks the activity of the virus and helps hospitals and clinics to be better prepared in case of the next wave.", "MERC experience taught Korea another lesson - \u201daggressive testing\u201d. Before major spread by super transmitter event, there were only 30 confirmed cases compared to 75.000 in China. Despite the low numbers, South Korea started to cooperate with biotech companies on test development for Coronavirus. They\u2019ve developed test kits almost instantly and distributed them into every hospital in the country. Korea didn\u2019t face the problem with an insufficient number of tests like other countries did. Thanks to cautious planning and utilization of AI, they were able to flatten the curve at a super-fast pace.", "\u201cTo develop a test in such a short time would not have been possible without AI,\u201d said Tai-Myoung Chung, Professor in the Department of Interaction Science at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).", "The design of test kits was developed with the use of Artificial Intelligence. AI helped to shorten the period needed to design and build test kits. The genetic make-up of the virus usually takes 2\u20133 months. The company called Seegene managed to develop tests in less than three weeks, thanks to automation and AI. Artificial intelligence-based big data solutions enabled scientists to understand the genetic make-up of coronavirus rapidly.", "Moreover, AI is allowing health personal to screen accurately and speedily diagnose patients. The main application of AI is on large-scale chest X-ray data to identify symptoms of coronavirus in a couple of seconds and address patients in the critical state. AI is used to classify patients into four categories: mild, moderate, severe and very severe", "Besides AI-based solutions, there is also telemedicine, supporting social distancing and enabling patients to stay in touch with the healthcare personnel. Remote medicine is targeting either potential or confirmed patients to monitor the symptoms and further development of coronavirus.", "The whole examination is established via video call with the use of smartphones. All the symptoms are included in the database, and the patients are advised on the next steps. The solution is enabling professionals to check symptoms of confirmed patients in real-time and transfer those who need medical assistance to the closest hospital.", "Other crucial parts of the whole Korean system against coronavirus are mobile apps. There were many of them developed within a couple of days. The main objective is to inform the public about coronavirus from different perspectives. Some of them are providing general information on symptoms. Others will let you know about the place with available face masks or the closest place to be tested. There are also AI-powered applications using chatbots to call people who need medical attention.", "South Korea is a great example of how AI and Big Data should be applied for social good \u2014 reducing reaction time, increasing accuracy, and deploying solutions throughout the whole country. Many things need to be addressed. Privacy, data security, and information sharing cannot be left aside. Thanks to the country\u2019s transparent and consistent government, culture, collective effort, technological maturity, and eagerness to innovate, South Korea managed to overcome the potential risks when facing these challenges.", "Your home for data science.
