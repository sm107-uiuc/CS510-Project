We like to think that, while a computer might excel at rote, repetitive tasks, it will always take a human mind to perform any kind of creative, artistic work. Computers operate in the realm of numbers. Ones and zeroes, mathematical operations. Algorithms can perform incredibly complicated calculations, on huge amounts of data, incredibly quickly. But people operate in the realm of thoughts, of feelings, and of words. These concepts are as impenetrable to a computer as the inner workings of a computer are to us. So can we make thoughts and feelings intelligible to a computer? Can we translate the meaning of words into a format that a computer can understand? Will a computer ever be able to really understand us? Well, maybe.", "In the previous chapter, I showed two very straightforward ways of teaching computers to understand something of human meanings: \u201cone-hot\u201d encoding turns words into columns of ones and zeroes \u2014 the word is present or absent \u2014 and the machine learns to associate the presence or absence of certain words with other meaningful values. \u201cCollaborative filtering\u201d uses information about how people have interacted with things, to make inferences about their similarities to other things. If the same people like two things, those things are similar. But these are crude approaches, with very limited results. We can do better.", "The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a vast resource of information about film and television. Of particular interest to me is the user-generated tags associated with each film. Hundreds of users collaborate to associate words with each movie, creating an eclectic, thorough, but by no means comprehensive catalogue of themes, plot-points, images, character tropes, and filmic devices for thousands of movies. The diverse and particular nature of the users\u2019 interests means that broad theme and setting elements like \u201cgun-violence\u201d, \u201cfather-son-relationship\u201d, and \u201cnew-york-state\u201d, are as likely to be tagged as minutiae of the plot such as \u201cpunched-in-chest\u201d, \u201csits-bolt-upright-after-nightmare\u201d, and \u201camerican-flag-waving-in-background\u201d. The wondrous diversity of humankind is also responsible for such uncomfortably specific tags as \u201cclose-up-of-feet\u201d, \u201csuntan-pantyhose\u201d, and \u201cundead-sexuality\u201d.", "Here are some of the tags for a few randomly-selected movies:", "We\u2019re going to use these tags to build an algorithm that tries to understand something about the movies. What we want to see is an algorithm that can do something more complex than just finding two movies that are similar \u2014 we want it to actually generate some novel insights about the movies\u2019 content. That\u2019s an ambitious plan!", "To start, we need to turn this information into something that is intelligible to a computer. As with the previous essay, we can encode these in a numeric format by making one column for each tag, with a 1 or 0 in the column depending on if the movie has that particular tag. For example:", "You can see that 2009\u2019s blemish on global culture, \u201cThe Hangover\u201d has the tags \u201ctiger\u201d, and \u201cwomanizer\u201d. The \u201cwomanizer\u201d tag also appears in 1993\u2019s \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d though I imagine fans of either film would not appreciate the other\u2019s treatment of that theme. By contrast, Schindler\u2019s list is the only one of the ten films that has the \u201caccountant\u201d tag. Films about accountancy are sadly less common than films about womanisers, it seems.", "The tags themselves are a substantially less-than-perfect summary of a film\u2019s plot and themes, and relying on them to determine something so broad as a film\u2019s meaning seems foolish. But there\u2019s a trick we can use which vastly increases the usefulness of these tags. They may be idiosyncratic and incomplete, but we can safely assume that, within certain bounds, it\u2019s likely that across any selection of films, they\u2019re at least consistently idiosyncratic. In other words, they might be weird, but they\u2019re weird in the same way for every movie. If we look at what tags films have in common with each other, we should find similar films sharing similar tags. Here\u2019s what that looks like:", "Every movie obviously has 100% similarity with itself, but the similarities that the films share with other films are more interesting. The 1967 western \u201cEl Dorado\u201d shares a number of keywords with 1977\u2019s WWII epic \u201cA Bridge Too Far\u201d. Theme\u2019s of violent conflict, a rugged male lead, and perhaps other factors make these films somewhat similar. By contrast, El Dorado shares no keywords at all with 2003\u2019s family-friendly holiday comedy \u201cElf\u201d. The films are not very similar at all. More similar to \u201cElf\u201d is 1991\u2019s retelling of the Peter Pan story, \u201cHook\u201d. The films share several themes and character tropes, which are represented by keywords such as \u201corphan\u201d, \u201cfamily-relationships\u201d, \u201cboy\u201d, and \u201cchristmas\u201d.", "Now that we have this matrix of movie similarities, we can do some interesting things with it. For example, we can plot movies on a chart according to the number of keywords they have in common with other films. Here\u2019s all the Disney Princess films plotted according to their similarity to Kevin Costner\u2019s 1991 murder of an English accent, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and the (frankly overrated) 1941 classic Citizen Kane:", "To their vast benefit, none of the Disney Princess films have a great deal in common with Citizen Kane. It is tempting to read Beauty and the Beast\u2019s similarity to Citizen Kane as a reflection of them sharing a male lead who is wealthy and reclusive, and the theme of seeing the humanity of a monstrous man. But the idiosyncrasies of IMDb\u2019s tags mean that the actual keywords in common are much more prosaic \u2014 most of them relate to the fact that both films have scenes in a large old mansion, with fireplaces, servants, a library, and so on. The similarities to The Little Mermaid are equally trivial, including the fact that both films contain brief shots of an octopus.", "Most of the films share more in common with Robin Hood. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 2012\u2019s \u201cBrave\u201d has a great deal in more in common with Robin Hood than the other films \u2014 the medieval setting and the archery chiefly, though the diligent work of IMDb\u2019s enthusiasts has also revealed that both films feature a brief glimpse of a bare bottom. By comparison with Brave, Disney\u2019s 1973 entry in the troubled genre of films about Robin Hood has almost twice as many keywords in common with Kevin Costner\u2019s version, despite having a fox in the title role.", "It\u2019s interesting to note that Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid appear very close together on this chart, implying that, at least in terms of their similarity to Robin Hood and Citizen Kane, they have a lot in common. But on the whole the chart is perhaps not very insightful as to the nature of these films.", "Here\u2019s a very slightly more useful chart:", "This is, as of writing, all of the \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d films, plotted by their similarity to Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s 1990 foray into comedy acting, \u201cKindergarten Cop\u201d, and the 1978 kung-fu classic \u201cShao Lin san shi liu fang\u201d, better known as \u201cThe 36th chamber of Shaolin\u201d. As we might expect, the films are all clustered fairly close together \u2014 they\u2019re fairly similar films. The outlier is \u201cTokyo Drift\u201d, the criminally underrated third instalment in the franchise. What\u2019s interesting about this is that, in terms of the plots, characters, and themes, Tokyo Drift is in fact quite a different film from the rest of the franchise. While much of the data that has produced this chart is trivial or spurious, it has managed to capture some truth about this film and its relationship to its siblings.", "These charts plot films on just two fairly arbitrary axes, chosen more-or-less at random, and yet they manage to convey some small amount of real information about the films\u2019 content. Imagine then how much more information is available by increasing the number of axes we examine.", "To do this effectively, we have to do some maths tricks. In the last chapter I mentioned some mathematical techniques that improved the quality of our recommendations. I didn\u2019t go into much detail about them at the time, but we\u2019re going to use those same techniques again, and this time I\u2019m going to explain a little more about them. It\u2019s going to get a little bit complicated, but you don\u2019t have to understand the underlying maths to get a sense of how it works.", "If you look at Table 3 above, it shows the similarity of each movie to each other movie. But you\u2019ll see that a lot of the movies have no keywords in common at all. Other movies have a lot in common, but their similarity is driven by the fact that they happen to have a few very unusual keywords in common. The tags our dataset is based on are idiosyncratic \u2014 individually they often don\u2019t convey much meaning, but in aggregate they are more useful. What we need is some way of smoothing out the rough edges, of filtering out the noise and boiling down the data to just the core information. The technique we will use is called \u201cdimensionality reduction\u201d. We\u2019re going to take our dataset of several thousand movies, each compared with every other movie, and reduce the number of columns from thousands \u2014 one for each movie \u2014 to only a hundred. While we do this, we\u2019ll try to preserve as much as possible of the information the columns contain.", "When I first heard about this technique, it didn\u2019t sound like it was possible. How can we reduce the number of columns, but keep the information they contain? It seems like a contradiction, and in one sense, it is. We do lose information, but if we\u2019re clever, we can minimise this. To understand how we can achieve this, it helps to visualise it in only two dimensions.", "Imagine you have a series of dots on a two-dimensional chart, like this:", "The position of each of these dots can be written as two coordinates \u2014 two columns of data. Now imagine that we draw a straight line next to these dots, and \u201cproject\u201d their positions onto the line, like this:", "The location of each dot on the line can be written as just one coordinate, its position along the line. We\u2019ve lost some information about the original dots, but, as long as we\u2019ve drawn the line at the right angle to the dots, we\u2019re preserving something about their relative positions to each other. \u201cDimensionality reduction\u201d is a set of mathematical techniques for choosing the right angle for that line, so that we preserve as much information as possible. This is easy to visualise in two dimensions, but it also works in multiple dimensions. In our case, we\u2019re reducing the number of dimensions (columns of data) from thousands to just a hundred.", "The choice of a hundred columns is slightly arbitrary. Reducing the number of columns reduces \u201cnoise\u201d in the data \u2014 arbitrary and useless information. But if we reduce the number of columns too much, we lose useful information as well. Here\u2019s our films reduced to just two columns of information:", "The two remaining columns are impossible to interpret \u2014 so much information has been lost that the remaining two columns are effectively meaningless. We need to find a balance, and it turns out that in this case, for this dataset, a hundred columns is about right. Here\u2019s a small sample of what that looks like:", "The meaning of each column is even more difficult to interpret than the single column we had previously, but collectively, they encode some quite sophisticated information about the films in our dataset. We can test this by looking at which films look similar, according to the data in this table. If we\u2019ve done a good job, similar films in our table should be very similar films in real life. For example, similar films to \u201cThe Hangover\u201d, according to this data, include the similarly dire \u201cThe 40 Year Old Virgin\u201d, \u201cThe Hangover Part II\u201d, and \u201cKnocked Up\u201d. It looks like we\u2019ve done pretty well \u2014 all of these films are from a similar vein of cynical, misogynistic comedy. They share similar subject material and a similar style of comedy. The closest film to Ben Affleck\u2019s career highlight, 1998\u2019s Armageddon, is \u201cDeep Impact\u201d, which makes sense since it\u2019s basically exactly the same film only with (tragically) less Aerosmith.", "We can do some other fun things with this data set, but to explain them, I\u2019ll have to digress into some details about similarity measures. Deep breath everyone.", "In the last chapter, I showed how \u201ceuclidean distance\u201d could be used to measure the similarity of two rows of numeric data. By plotting them as points in multi-dimensional space, and drawing a line between the two points, you can measure the similarity of the two rows. That approach works for this dataset as well. But there\u2019s another approach. Instead of measuring the distance between two points, we can measure the angle between them. For reasons that make sense to people who know more about maths than I do, this is called \u201ccosine similarity\u201d. For example, here\u2019s two classic nautical-themed films, \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d and \u201cJaws\u201d, plotted by their similarity to 1990\u2019s thoughtful independent film \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d, and John Carpenter\u2019s low-budget action classic \u201cEscape From New York\u201d.", "The angle between the two points \u2014 around 40 degrees, indicates that the films are fairly dissimilar, at least on the \u201cFoam Turtle/Snake Plisskin\u201d scale provided by these two axis. For most purposes, cosine similarity and euclidean distance give very similar results. But there is one property of cosine similarity that is very different. Cosine similarity remains the same regardless of the magnitude of the two lines. In other words, the total amount of each value doesn\u2019t matter, only the ratio of one value to the other. This is useful because it means we can add the values of two films together, and still measure similarity effectively. That\u2019s a bit esoteric sounding, so let\u2019s investigate that further.", "\u201cThe Thing\u201d, another classic John Carpenter film, is even further from Finding Nemo than is Jaws. If we add The Thing and Finding Nemo\u2019s values together, we can create a hypothetical new film \u201cThe Thing About Nemo\u201d (for obvious reasons, we\u2019ll avoid calling it \u201cFinding Nemo\u2019s Thing\u201d). \u201cThe Thing About Nemo\u201d, because it combines the values of two other films, sits much further along both axis than any of the other films. It is literally the sum of the two films \u2014 Finding Nemo has around 8% of its keywords in common with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Thing has around 3%. That gives \u201cThe Thing about Nemo\u201d a score of around 11% on this axis \u2014 8+ 3 = 11. This means that our new film is quite distant from the other films on the chart \u2014 it has mugh higher values on both axes. But because we\u2019re using cosine similarity, and measuring the angle, not the distance, we find that \u201cThe Thing About Nemo\u201d, our combination of two films, is in fact very similar to \u201cJaws\u201d.", "Let\u2019s review what\u2019s happened here. We\u2019ve combined a film about aquatic adventure, with a film about being stalked by an alien monster, and the result is very similar to Jaws, a film about being stalked by an aquatic monster. Is this a coincidence? Is this just an accident of maths, or do the numeric values we\u2019ve derived actually encode some useful fragment of meaning about the films? Above, I promised that we\u2019d build something that actually understood films. Have we succeeded in doing that?", "When using just two axes, as we have above, it turns out that this approach returns nonsensical results more often than not. But when we use the full 100-column data set we created earlier, the results become eerily insightful. Just as when we used two axes, we take the sum of two films, adding the values in each of the 100 columns. Then, using cosine similarity, we find the film with the smallest angle \u2014 the least difference \u2014 to the summed row. Using this approach, Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s best film, 1991\u2019s \u201cPoint Break\u201d, added to Disney\u2019s \u201cCars\u201d, yields a film that, by cosine similarity, is most similar to 2001\u2019s \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d. This is spookily accurate. \u201cPoint Break\u201d and \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d are both about maverick police officers, drawn into a seductive subculture in order to apprehend a master criminal, with whom he has an intense homoerotic relationship. The only differences between them are Swayze\u2019s sparkling eyes and that, while Point Break focuses on surfing culture, the Fast and the Furious fetishises cars.", "By the same process, we can try adding the revolutionary horror film, 1979\u2019s Alien, to 2004\u2019s high-school comedy, Mean Girls. The resulting values are, according to our cosine similarity calculation, very similar to the Stephen King adaptation, \u201cCarrie\u201d, a horror film about mean girls in a high school. Perhaps in an attempt to reconcile the interests of a diverse group of friends, we might try to find a film combining the qualities of Schindler\u2019s List and The Hangover. The algorithm informs us that our best bet is the eminently forgettable WWII action film \u201cEnemy at the Gates\u201d (2001).", "This approach also works with subtraction. If we take the disturbingly racist \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d, and subtract its slightly-less-racist predecessor, \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d, the resulting film is most similar to 1941\u2019s \u201cTarzan and the Leopard Woman\u201d, a film which, to put it mildly, does little to contribute to positive race-relations.", "What\u2019s happening here? These combinations don\u2019t always make complete sense, but there\u2019s a hint of something meaningful behind them. What we have, in the end of this process, is an encoding of data about a film which seems to contain something of the meaning of the film. The algorithm is still just numbers and maths, but the results, such as our movie-combining tricks, feel like the product of something that actually knows something about films. What we\u2019ve seen feels tantalisingly close to that vision of a computer that actually understands us. The way we transformed the data allows the computer to generate unique insights about the movies in our dataset. It can give us a novel perspective on them.", "Have we succeeded in making something that actually understands films? It\u2019s easy to feel like the algorithm has generated some kind of understanding of the information it has been given. Techniques like those we\u2019ve used above are increasingly used in all kinds of domains to parse and filter huge amounts of information. Law offices are being revolutionised by algorithms which can scan millions of documents to find relevant case law. Doctors can call upon automated processes to find recent relevant literature to help treat a patient\u2019s illness. We can even produce coherent and useful summaries of these documents, all at the press of a button. Computers can, at least within certain domains, read and understand text.", "But it also seems like there\u2019s a vast gap between this slightly uncanny trick, and real human insights. The computer might get an answer that makes sense, but does it really know what that answer means? It feels like we have constructed an elaborate magician\u2019s illusion \u2014 the rabbit comes out of the hat, and if we forget about the hat\u2019s false bottom and the magician\u2019s dexterity, we can almost believe that it\u2019s magic. Is there a difference between real intelligence, and this simulation of it? That question is something we\u2019ll return to it again as we delve into even more sophisticated algorithms. For now, it feels like we\u2019ve created an interesting toy, but it still falls far short of \u201ctrue\u201d intelligence. In coming essays, that line will become increasingly blurred. We\u2019re going to need a bigger boat.", "The previous essay in this series, \u201cKnitting and Recommendations\u201d can be found here.
