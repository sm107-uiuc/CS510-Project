Apple\u2019s Siri had put voice input onto smartphones. But here was a new class of device that you could shout at across the kitchen to set a timer, play music, or look up facts on the internet. The culture adopted Alexa with an avalanche of jokes and memes. Google soon followed with its own smart speaker called Google Home. And the startup, Jibo, offered similar skills through its own AI technology and incorporation of third party data sources, but wrapped in a fun character with a unique swiveling body form.", "These conversational agents result from many millions of dollars of investment and the labor of hundreds of the smartest researchers and developers in academia and industry. They represent the current pinnacle of scientific and engineering accomplishment in the human endeavor to create artificial beings that augment and magnify our own brainpower. This article explains how these devices can interpret questions and access vast sources of knowledge. Knowledge, however, is only one component of intelligence. So while Conversational AI agents are in some ways very smart, in other ways they remain very dumb.", "We can ask, \u201cAlexa, who won the 1934 world series?\u201d, and immediately it responds, \u201cThe Saint Louis Cardinals beat the Detroit Tigers 4 to 3 in the 1934 World Series.\u201d If you are lucky enough to live near a library, it would take you half an hour to travel there and find a reference book containing this fact. That\u2019s if the library is open. By any measure, that is remarkable, intelligent behavior, and useful to boot.", "Intelligence, however, is not a single thing. On the one hand, we recognize that people have different kinds of intelligence, verbal, visuo-spatial, musical, emotional, social. But in the fields of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence, intelligence decomposes in a different way.", "We can call these the three Pillars of Intelligence.", "The threads of Artificial Intelligence research tend to specialize in one or another of the three pillars, and sometimes, build bridges across them. Most recently, the most striking breakthroughs have occurred in the Pattern Recognition pillar. Deep Learning is a type of so-called Artificial Neural Network technology that has notably revolutionized the fields of Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, and Natural Language Processing. As well, Artificial Neural Network methods impact the Knowledge pillar by bringing \u201csoft\u201d or \u201cfuzzy\u201d representations, achieved by distributing numeric values across vectors of feature attributes.", "Artificial Intelligence has not however been able to unify the three Pillars of Intelligence under an over-arching Cognitive Architecture. The human mind effortlessly invokes each pillar of intelligence in coordination with the others, as needed. When I say, \u201ca glass full of milk spilled,\u201d your mind automatically connects the word sequence to Knowledge \u2014 perhaps a visual image of a glass of milk. A Reasoning step triggers in the form of a mental simulation of the glass tipping, and consequently the liquid contained therein flowing over the rim. In the course of your own Reasoning, the apparatus of Pattern Matching and Knowledge both contribute. You know milk and cream to be similar sorts of things, and that therefore they spill in the same manner. By contrast, sawdust and sugar are not liquids, but instead similar in their granular properties; they flow and land differently when poured, more similarly to each other than to any liquid. For which would a paper towel be in order, and for which a broom? To you, the implications of liquid versus granular are immediately clear. No AI can do this today.", "Short of this depth, today\u2019s conversational agents nonetheless display remarkable abilities to answer even obscure questions. This is due to a specifically designed partnership between two of the Pillars of Intelligence, Knowledge and Pattern Matching. We\u2019ll focus on a knowledge representation known as a Knowledge Graph, and the Pattern Recognition component known as Entity/Intent Recognition.", "The architecture of a conversational agent looks like this.", "Question Answering and other types of dialogue by a Conversational Agent occur via a Perception/Action Loop architecture. In its basic form, this is a series of five computing steps. The starting point is an acoustic waveform picked up by a microphone when a user speaks a question or command.", "For decades, a huge obstacle to conversational agents lay in the Automatic Speech Recognition module. If the words spoken by the user are transmitted incorrectly to the NLP module, then there could be no hope of delivering a correct answer. The past 15 years have seen explosive improvement in ASR due to advances in Machine Learning algorithms, computing power, and available data sets for training the algorithms.", "These days, the cutting edge of intelligent conversational agents resides in the Natural Language Processing and Dialog Manager modules. First let\u2019s consider how large collections of facts can be represented in a knowledge representation called a knowledge graph. Then we\u2019ll see how Natural Language Processing constructs a Logical Form from a user\u2019s query, to look up answers in a knowledge graph.", "A graph consists of nodes, and links connecting nodes. In a knowledge graph, nodes represent things in the world, or entities, and links represent relations among the entities. Entities can be concrete or abstract. The figure above shows a small section of a much larger graph. This section represents the fact that Leonard Nimoy was a Person, that he played the role of Spock, that Spock is a Character in Star Trek, and that Star Trek is a TV Series.", "Knowledge graphs can have different rules and design parameters in the way nodes and links are used. In some knowledge graphs, entities come in two flavors, type entities (green) which are classes of things, and token entities (blue), which are particular instances. The Leonard Nimoy node is a token, an instance of the type, Person. In some knowledge graphs, entities are organized hierarchically, so that for example, TV Series could be a subtype of the class, Entertainment Genre. Some knowledge graphs define a fixed set of link/relation types, while others are open-ended.", "These rules and design parameters are the ontology of the knowledge graph. Ontology means, \u201cthe nature of being,\u201d and the word comes from a branch of philosophy, epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge. How does knowledge in the abstract stand in relation to the real world? How do agents acquire knowledge, maintain knowledge in the face of changes, and invest trust in its correctness? The history of AI research has revealed that a great deal hinges on design decisions about knowledge ontologies. For example, if a knowledge graph allows links to take any arbitrary labels, then how can it be discovered that two links are equivalent, or contradictory? On purely practical grounds, hardened technical engineers have come to greatly appreciate and respect the wisdom that philosophers bring to the table when it comes to designing knowledge ontologies.", "Dozens of knowledge graphs have been constructed over the years according to an array of more or less tightly constrained knowledge ontologies. A number of them are very big and put to heavy use today, complete with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) providing access to application developers. Knowledge content (actual nodes and links) is added by various combinations of hand curation and automatic harvesting from text found in Wikipedia, newspaper articles, and other online sources.", "A knowledge graph enables direct answers to questions like, \u201cWho played Spock in Star Trek?\u201d To answer this question, it first has to be transformed to a Logical Form representation that can address entities and relations. This job is performed by the NLP module, which, in conjunction with ASR, functions as the Pattern Matching pillar of a conversational agent.", "Natural Language Processing is a practical application of Computational Linguistics. This field also aims for the more ambitious goal of Natural Language Understanding, but this term is somewhat of an overreach because what we conventionally mean by \u201cunderstanding\u201d brings together Knowledge, Pattern Matching, and Reasoning to a degree that today\u2019s AI simply does not approach.", "The initial steps of Natural Language Processing involve classifying words in terms of their grammatical parts of speech, and known entity types. The word, \u201cwho\u201d, is a question pronoun, while \u201cin\u201d is a preposition that connotes containment or membership. \u201cSpock\u201d and \u201cStar Trek\u201d are labeled as known entity names as found in pre-compiled entity name lists.", "Given this cataloging of the words, a processing step known as Entity/Intent Extraction attempts to classify the utterance in terms of its purpose (question, command, statement, etc.) and then assign known and unknown entities associated with that purpose. Entity/Intent Extraction analyzes the syntactic structure of the utterance, which is dependent on word order. These days, Machine Learning methods hold sway in the detailed steps for how this is carried out. Every syntactic pattern maps to a Logical Form template. The example shows one way that a Logical Form can be written out. If you can read the nested parentheses of computerese, then you can puzzle out for yourself how the original question gets transformed. Finally, the actual entities and relations from the original word sequence fill in the template, resulting in a final Logical Form that represents what the user asked, but now in a highly structured format.", "Conveniently, the Logical Form is itself equivalent to a graph. This is called a query graph. The example query graph looks a lot like the part of the knowledge graph pertaining to Spock and Star Trek, except the Person instance node has a question mark. That is the unknown value the user wants to know.", "From here, a well-known method in computer science is applied, subgraph matching. That simply means, finding a portion of the huge knowledge graph that aligns with the specified nodes and links of the query graph. The unknown Person instance node is a wildcard variable that will match to anything in the knowledge graph. When the subgraph match is completed, then this node is found to correspond with the Leonard Nimoy node in the knowledge graph, and presto, an answer can be filled in and returned.", "An inverse process converts the filled-in query graph back to a sentence in Natural Language, this time as a statement instead of a question. And via the Text-to-Speech module, the agent presents its brilliance with pride and joy. Well, such mechanical pride and joy as a computer can muster. The engineers and their sponsors harvest the credit.", "The Knowledge Graph is just one of several kinds of structured data representation that can be used to store information for natural language queries. Relational databases are preferred when large numbers of data items have the same sets of attributes. But like knowledge graphs, all data organizations provide interfaces for access by Logical Form queries.", "Given this understanding of how conversational agents perform question answering, one can probe their knowledge sources and natural language capabilities just by talking with them. For example, we can track down where Alexa\u2019s knowledge about Star Trek and other television series actually comes from. That is a topic for a separate article.", "Your home for data science.
