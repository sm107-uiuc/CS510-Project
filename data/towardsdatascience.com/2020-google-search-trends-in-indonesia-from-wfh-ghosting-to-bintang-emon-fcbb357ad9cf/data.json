I found the result from my home country \u2014 Indonesia \u2014 and found some interesting results. While I expected the results to revolve around the Covid-19 pandemic that is currently happening, I also found some other interesting search queries on top of that, which includes activities people do at home and trending influencers.", "In this post, I\u2019m sharing some exploratory data that I did using pytrends \u2014 a Python API that allows report download from Google Trends. This API helps us in automating data retrieval from Google Trends, instead of manually extracting them one by one on the website. The link to the documentation of the API is here.", "Data in this exploration is extracted from Google Trends via pytrends, and they are publicly available on the website \u2014 which covers trending searches, queries by region, related queries, and topics.", "Google Trends results are numerical values scaled from 1 to 100 which shows the proportion of the search query being searched within a region and time frame. A value of 100 means the search query is in very high demand. For more information on how to interpret this value, you can go to this article from Simon Rogers of Google News Lab; or this article from Pew Research Lab.", "Initially, you need to install the library on your machine. This can be easily done using the command below", "After installation, we can start connecting to Google Trends using the TrendReq method in pytrends.", "Inside the TrendReq initiation, we\u2019re inputting the host language, timezone, and geographical location to be explored. In here, I\u2019m putting \u2018ID\u2019 as I\u2019m exploring Indonesia. We will be using this pytrend variable along with the exploration.", "Starting with getting the top 2020 trends, we\u2019re using the below code to obtain the result, which is the top 10 rising queries in 2020 for Indonesia.", "Most of the search queries are related to the Covid-19 pandemic, like lockdown, WFH, virus corona, PSBB (tightened social measures in Indonesia) to resesi (recession), kuota belajar (data package for learning). Interestingly, we\u2019re also seeing terms like ghosting \u2014 are some people being ghosted within lockdown? \u2014 and Among Us \u2014 a multi-player mobile game currently trending with young folks.", "For these top search queries, we\u2019re getting the interest over time, which is the trend score for each week in 2020, using the code below. The output is a dataframe with date, score, and keyword as the column.", "Did some data processing and created time-series visualization from the data. Here we found Covid direct measures terms like PSBB, lockdown, WFH, and gabut/rebahan (resting at home) reached peak queries in mid-March 2020, where Covid cases started to reach Indonesia.", "Another Covid-related economic impact started to rise on July-August, which is about resesi \u2014 the recession (in which Indonesia has officially entered) and kuota belajar \u2014 free data package program from the government to support students studying at home. This economic and social program has been an interest to Indonesian citizens.", "Other trends that recently emerge around October-November include ghosting and Among Us game.", "Google Trends also allows us to view the interest of a search term by region, which can be in a country, state, or city level. Since Indonesia doesn\u2019t have a state structure, I\u2019m going for city-level granularity for each search query as follows.", "I did some processing to group the search queries trend values by island level geo to check whether there is any interest difference between these regions. Interestingly, we found that Covid direct measures of PSBB, lockdown, and WFH mostly interest people in Jakarta and Java island only. And though PSBB and recession is a national topic, the search queries mostly only coming from Jakarta.", "People in the other regions like Nusa Tenggara & Papua, Sulawesi, and Sumatera seem to explore the virus itself (virus corona) and data package subsidy from the government (kuota belajar).", "Another thing that can be explored from Google Trends includes the related queries of search keywords. This will give us an idea of specifically which part of the query that people are interested in. I retrieved the related query data using the code below, resulting in a dataframe of extended words used in the search.", "With the above data, I created a word cloud for each keyword to see the related words people are searching for. In most cases, people are looking for the meaning of the term, like ghosting, gabut, WFH, rebahan terms. For resesi \u2014 recession \u2014 term, on top of the meaning, people are looking for the impact and comparison with the world level. For virus corona, people are looking for the symptoms, images of the virus, and news updates of the cases.", "Another trend that gains my interest is the \u201cHow-to\u201d searches for Indonesia. As people are staying at home on lockdown, I assume there might be several things that people started doing or explore to do at home. Using a similar method as the above, I gathered some top rising keywords on how-to searches. The result from Google Trends is 25 rising how-to keywords as follows.", "From those 25 terms, I figured out that it can actually be grouped into 6 main groups: cooking-related, Covid-measures-related, religious-related, WFH-related, work-support-related, and others.", "There are 6 terms related to cooking. Seems like people are exploring dishes to be cooked at home. They are mostly snacks like boba (bubble tea), cireng, cimol, dalgona coffee, donat (donut), and martabak manis. Well, if you can, why not make it at home, right?", "Some Covid-measures related include queries on how to make hand sanitizer and how to prevent coronavirus infection. Other trends related to work support and WFH in response to Covid impact include queries on kartu prakerja (employment support card from the government), bantuan UMKM (SME support from the government), to membuat soal di Google Form (creating tests on Google Form) \u2014 possibly from teachers who are forced to conduct remote learning but not used to the technology yet.", "One last trend that gains my attention is the \u201cWho-is\u201d searches. Google Trends page shows Bintang Emon \u2014 an Indonesian comedian \u2014 as the most searched person in Indonesia across 2020. I got curious and explore the related queries around Bintang Emon and how it trends over time.", "He gains popularity in March, in which people are searching for his profile, social media account, and girlfriend. Then his popularity spikes again in June, which search query related to the viral Novel Baswedan skit and scandal on Instagram. It resulted in subsequent search queries like drugs and defamation on him.", "Pretty much explains his popularity, huh?", "That wraps up the usage of pytrends and exploration of Google Indonesia\u2019s Year in Search 2020. Though currently data points are still limited, we can still get some insights from Google Trends, showing people\u2019s interests, worries, and curiosity.", "Complete exploration is on this Google Colab notebook.
