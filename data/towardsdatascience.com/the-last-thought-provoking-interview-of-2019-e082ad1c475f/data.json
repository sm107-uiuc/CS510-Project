This article explores interesting slices of this conversation, in the hopes that you, the reader will go on and have a listen (Link to the conversation is at the end of this article).", "I never thought I would be mentioning Cats in a Medium article, but here we are.", "Why are we mentioning cats in this article? And what conversation binds Elon Musk and a ghost?", "Well, read on to find out.", "But I can assure you that after reading this you will most probably be more confused than you were when you started \u2014 apologies in advance.", "Let\u2019s start by understanding what the conversation I\u2019m referencing to within this article is all about. First, a little information on the two interesting minds involved in our conversation.", "The conversation is between two individuals you might have crossed paths with on the internet, and if you haven\u2019t well, let me introduce you to Lex Fridman and Michael Stevens.", "Lex and Michael are quite intelligent and reputable individuals. Both command a strong following on YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter.", "Here is a quick profile on them.", "Lex Fridman's research work lies within Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Autonomous vehicles.", "I was introduced to Lex Fridman through his podcast \u2018Artificial Intelligence with Lex Fridman\u2019 on Spotify.", "He is thirty-three (at the time of writing) and educated to a Ph.D. level.", "Oh, and he also worked at Google, working on Machine Learning.", "Before I move onto Michael, let me add, that the conversation mentioned in this article is hosted on Lex Fridman\u2019s YouTube channel (you gain brain cells watching his videos and discussions). I will put a link to it below.", "Michael Stevens is also thirty-three (at the time of writing) and wears several hats; he\u2019s a public speaker, entertainer, editor, and many more.", "Michael is well known for being one of the most prominent YouTubers by providing entertaining content on his channel Vsauce. He asks the most exciting and thought-provoking questions while providing a scientific method for answering odd and intriguing questions such as: \u2018What is the Scariest Thing\u2019 or \u2018What color is a Mirror.\u2019", "The conversation starts with Lex asking Michael the following on Psychology:", "\u201cHow do you think we can take Psychology from where it\u2019s been in the 20th century to something more like what the theoretical physicists do, something precise and rigorous?\u201d", "It\u2019s only fair Lex begins with a question that explores the mind, as Michael has a series on YouTube called \u2018Mind Field.\u2019", "Michael answers this quite well, and even though there isn\u2019t a measurement on the correctness of an answer, the confident approach and logical reasoning of his response actually might hold some ground \u2014 hypothetically speaking, of course.", "Michael\u2019s answer to the first question settled on the notion that we need to bind the physical foundation of Psychology.", "\u2018Physical foundation of Psychology\u2019 is a vague phrase that is open to subjective interpretations. Still, Michael explains that Psychology might be able to be on par with theoretical physics if we can gain some measurable and quantifiable components within our emotions, feelings, and moods.", "By finding correlations between our emotions and whatever this quantifiable component is, we can then go down a path where consciousness can exist in the physical and mathematical form.", "I followed Michael\u2019s reasoning and thought process until I got lost when he mentioned \u2018quantum state.\u2019 But I found myself after Lex moved on to his second question.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s your view on consciousness, do you think it\u2019s part of reality or it is deeply human and constructed by humans?\u201d", "Before Michael answers the second question, he states, humbly, that \u201cI\u2019m not God,\u201d and his answers are based on speculation.", "These are reasonable disclaimers one has to state before going on to explain our entire existence and universe.", "And again, Michael\u2019s answer doesn\u2019t fail to send me spiraling down into my mind, where I was expecting to end up asking who am I?. But, on the contrary, I was asking, when am I? (Dr. Manhattan vibes here)", "\u201cConsciousness is something that can be fully explained within the laws of physics.\u201d", "Pause, are you telling me that theoretically consciousness could be described by formulas that govern our universe.", "As in the likes of \u2018F=ma\u2019.", "Further explanation of his answer leads Michael to explore the Universe, and how its association with our memory and consciousness fits in the picture. He speculates that within pockets of our universe, there are embedded memories.", "Here is what I understood from this section of the conversation: If were to grab a section of the universe somehow, then I can explore people\u2019s memory at the time that exists within the grabbed the part.", "Michael uses a Cat to home in on his explanation of the association between memory and the universe. I\u2019ll try my best to articulate in writing his spoken explanation.", "Supposedly you are scratched by your cat (I\u2019m a dog person), there are actually two notions or rather proofs of the fact you have indeed been scratched.", "The first one is the physical claw marks on your arm, and the second is that there is a state within the universe that contains the memory of you being scratched by your cat. So, consciousness emerges where there are spaces within the universe that include these stored memory states, and the presence of time is prevalent.", "Time and recollecting past events can be seen as us accessing the memory states in some way or form.", "Not going to spoil the rest of the conversation, but the conversation takes an interesting turn, and topics such as freewill, simulation, scientific challenges, the earth being flat are touched on.", "The mention of ghosts arises due to a previous statement made by Lex on Michael\u2019s method of thinking being \u201cscience like\u201d and encapsulated within the scientific process.", "\u201cAsking the questions, being brave enough to ask the question, being curious and not constrained by what you are supposed to think, is what it means to be a scientist to me\u201d \u2014 Lex Fridman", "I welcome readers to disprove the theory I am about to state. This theory is one made by Michael to convey a point.", "The theory goes, when we move physical objects with our hands, feet or head if you like, what actually happens is that a ghost (Casper is that you) leaves our body and possess the object we want to be moved, and suddenly the object moves.", "What about the heavy objects you ask? Well, Michael\u2019s theory is a two-parter.", "The second part accommodates the inability to move heavy objects by stating that the ghost simply gets lazy.", "\u201cThe laziness of the ghost is proportional to the mass of the object and that\u2019s why F=ma\u201d.", "We might not be able to disprove the existence of the ghost as we lack a visual perception of the ghost, but once we begin to ask questions about the ghost, or run tests and express a variety of curiosity in regards to the ghost, and the theory presented, we begin the scientific process.", "The point Michael was making using the ghost analogy is that being able to ask questions and the ability to express curiosity based on observations is not just attributed to having a scientific mindset, but it is a product of being human.", "Glad you\u2019ve made it this far. So I won\u2019t waste any time here and state the question Lex proposes to Michael.", "\u201cWhat do you think it takes to build superhuman or human-level Artificial Intelligence?\u201d", "I have to applaud Michael\u2019s approach to answering the question quoted above. Rather than jumping straight to an answer that could show off his intelligence, opinions, or experiences, he chooses to dissect the question even further.", "Unfortunately, these questions were not directly answered in the conversation, but discussions on how distinguishable the output of artificial intelligence program is from human results lead to a path that one could explore personally to find either research areas covering the questions above or discussions addressing the questions. Simply type \u2018Turing test\u2019 on google.", "Now, Elon Musk\u2019s name arises in the topic of Artificial Intelligence and autonomous vehicles.", "You can\u2019t mention Artificial Intelligence without having a statement or two referring to Elon Musk or one of his companies.", "You and I are probably both technologists, and we are very aware of the stance that Elon Musk and other reputable individuals have on the advancement of AI and its impact on human lives if developments are not governed and monitored appropriately.", "So Lex Fridman asks this question to Michael Stevens:", "\u201cWhat is a good threshold for people to worry about Artificial Intelligence in the current time?\u201d", "In my opinion, I don\u2019t think we can quantify the level of attention to give to pressing matter that affects human lives, the true indicator of the success of precautionary actions taken on any topic is that the worst possible scenario does not occur.", "And Michael\u2019s answer to the questions shares the same view I have on the matter. He states that cautionary statements and actions on the advancement of technologies are nothing new. He then goes on further and makes a comparison of the creation of AI to the delivering of babies by couples.", "How do we know the babies that are born currently are not psychopaths. Should we stop babies been born if they show a high-level percentage of being evil or psychopaths?", "\u201cMaybe we should not have babies born, maybe we should not create AI\u201d \u2014 Michael Stevens", "To reiterate, there isn\u2019t a straight answer to these questions that are asked. The aim of Lex Fridman\u2019s conversation with these creative and intelligent individuals is to expose and democratize their method of thinking by asking domain-specific and thought-provoking questions.", "Lex is very current on Elon Musk\u2019s endeavors as he has had a couple of conversations with Elon Musk (links are at the end of this article).", "Elon is relevant in the discussion of Artificial Intelligence, Space, and pretty much any technology-related buzzword. Elon has also amassed a massive following of dedicated fans.", "When speaking about Elon Musk, Michael doesn\u2019t focus on the flashy stuff like cars, AI, space crafts. He instead conveys his curiosity on how Elon handles having so much following and responsibilities.", "I\u2019ll list the questions Michael asks, but I have an idea here.", "Humor me here, Medium; I am about to direct some questions to Elon Musk on behalf of Michael Stevens.", "If you are reading this Elon Musk, Michael Stevens (and incidentally Medium) would like to ask you some questions listed below, feel free to answer in the comments section of this article or any response form of your choosing.", "But this begets the question, how do we know it\u2019s the real Elon Musk if he does respond\u2026well, I\u2019ll leave that to Elon Musk to prove his response authenticity. But here are the questions.", "Unfortunately, there is no way to fully present the value of the conversation between Michael Stevens and Lex Fridman in a single Medium article, so I encourage you to watch the YouTube video of the conversation or listen to the Spotify podcast version, also included below.", "If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from me, give me a follow. Thanks for reading.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Machine Learning Content Creator with 1M+ views\u2014 Computer Vision Engineer.
