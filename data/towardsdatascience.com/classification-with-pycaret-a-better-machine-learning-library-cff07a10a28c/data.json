If you are new here, PyCaret is a low-code machine learning library that does everything for you \u2014 from model selection to deployment. Reading the previous two articles isn\u2019t a prerequisite, but feel free to go through them if you haven\u2019t used the library before.", "Classification problems are the most common type of machine learning problems \u2014 is message spam or not, will the customer leave, is the test result positive or negative \u2014 to state a few examples. For that reason, we need to know how to handle classification tasks, and how to do so with ease.", "If you\u2019re more of a video person, or just want to reinforce your knowledge, feel free to watch our video on the topic. Source code is included:", "For developers, PyCaret is considered to be better and more friendly than Scikit-Learn. Both are great, don\u2019t get me wrong, but PyCaret will save you so much time that would otherwise be spent on model selection and fine-tuning. And that\u2019s the least fun part of the job.", "This article assumes you\u2019re familiar with the concept of classification in machine learning. You don\u2019t have to be an expert, but its assumed you know how to fit a model to data in other libraries.", "The article is structured as follows:", "Without much ado, let\u2019s get started!", "In most of my classification-based articles, I like to go with the Titanic dataset. There are multiple reasons why, the most obvious one being that it is fairly simple, but not too simple with regards to data cleaning and preparation.", "We can load it in Pandas directly from GitHub:", "Now we can proceed with the data cleaning itself. Here\u2019s what I want to do:", "I encourage you to just copy the code, as it\u2019s easy to make a typo, and you aren\u2019t here to practice data preparation. Here\u2019s how the dataset looks like now:", "This looks much better. There are still some things we could do, but let\u2019s call it a day and proceed with the modeling.", "To start, let\u2019s import the classification module from the PyCaret library and perform a basic setup:", "I\u2019ve set the random seed to 42, so you can reproduce the results.", "After a couple of seconds, you\u2019ll see a success message on the screen alongside a table that shows a bunch of information on your data. Read through it if you wish. Next, we will compare the performance of various machine learning models and see which one does the best overall:", "Yes, it is as simple as a function call. Execution will take anywhere from a couple of seconds to a minute because several algorithms are trained with cross-validation. Once done, you should see this table:", "It seems like Light Gradient Boosting approach did the best overall, so we can use it to create our model:", "You are free to perform additional hyperparameter tuning through the tune_model() function, but it didn\u2019t improve the performance in my case.", "We\u2019ll make a couple of visualizations and interpretations in the next section.", "To start, let\u2019s see what the plot_model() function has to offer:", "Area under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve tells us how good the model is at distinguishing between classes \u2014 predicting survived as survived, and died as died.", "If this still isn\u2019t quite interpretable as you would wish, here\u2019s how to plot the confusion matrix:", "The model is actually pretty decent if we take into account how easy it was to build it. Next, let\u2019s use SHAP values to explain our model.", "SHAP, or SHapley Additive exPlanations, is a way to explain the outputs of a machine learning model. We can use it to see which features are most important by plotting the SHAP values of every feature for every sample.", "Great! Let\u2019s now make a final evaluation on the test set and save the model to a file.", "Once we\u2019re satisfied with how the model behaves, we can evaluate it on the test set (previously unseen data):", "When we called the setup() function, at the beginning of the article, PyCaret performed the train/test split in the 70:30 ratio. This ratio can be changed, of course, but I\u2019m satisfied with the default.", "The results are a bit worse on the test set, but that\u2019s expected. Before saving the model to a file, we need to finalize it:", "Now the model can be saved:", "The model is now saved in the same folder where the notebook is. To load it later, you would use the load_model() function with a file path as an argument.", "I hope you\u2019ve followed along, spent some more time on data preparation, and got a better model as a result. PyCaret sure does a lot of the things for us, so we can spend our time doing more important things.", "There\u2019s a lot more to explore, and that\u2019s coming soon.
