Those of us who have actually practiced the science and art of extracting insights from data know that the job is at least as creative as it is analytical. The role of the data team within an organization is fundamentally to tell stories with data. Why, then, do so many data teams fail to employ the most powerful communication tool available to them?", "Even seasoned data scientists often relegate data visualization to the exploratory stages of data analysis. They fail to use dataviz in what is arguably the most important stage of the data analysis process: communicating their results. What these data pros forget is that not everybody thinks like them. While numbers or tables may make a lot of sense to somebody with a lot of experience making sense of them, most people are better at interpreting visual representations of data.", "In this post, I highlight a few specific instances where data visualization is crucial for helping data scientists and data consumers better understand datasets. These examples are by no means comprehensive but they can help structure your thinking and understanding about the value of data visualization. I finish by warning about the dangers of deceptive or otherwise bad data visualization, citing a specific example of data manipulation by Steve Jobs.", "Have you ever taken a look at a table and been baffled by it, only to visualize the data and realize that there\u2019s a clear pattern? Effective visual representations of data allow us to identify patterns which aren\u2019t obvious when data is represented numerically. Patterns can be anything from realizing that growth is exponential (as opposed to, for example, linear or random) to demonstrating correlations between two variables.", "Comparing relative value is another area where the human brain is better at intuitively understanding images than numbers. Pie and donut charts, bar graphs, histograms, and treemaps all help to illuminate the relative sizes, values, or quantities of things in a way that\u2019s easy to understand.", "Take, for instance, this video, which attempts to give an impression of just how small the earth is compared to other objects in our universe. While the creators could simply have listed off the volumes of these objects (the earth is 1 trillion cubic kilometers while the sun is 1.409 x 1\u2070\u00b9\u2078 cubic kilometers) they rightly assessed that in order to give people a truly intuitive sense of the magnitude of the cosmos, it would be better to visually show the object\u2019s volumes.", "One type of data where visualization is absolutely essential is geo-spatial information. This is an area where we take graphical, non-tabular data for granted but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that geo-spatial data in tabular form is basically useless.", "To the left is an example of one of the most basic (and yet effective) ways to represent geo-spatial data: a map. Specifically, it\u2019s a choropleth map, which means that the landmasses are divided into regions (in this case countries) and then colored according to a statistic (in this case the number of times that Hillary Clinton mentioned a particular country in her state department emails). Imagine what this data looks like in tabular form: one column is the name of the country, the other is the number of times that country is mentioned. This table is long (over 150 rows) and difficult to decipher. Visualization quickly tells us which countries are mentioned often (China, Russia, the UK, Iran, and Libya) and which are mentioned rarely (Mongolia, sub-Saharan African countries).", "Unfortunately, it\u2019s all too easy to use data visualization to deceive instead of inform. This is true for other tools in the data analyst\u2019s toolkit as well, but with data visualization it\u2019s particularly easy to fall into the trap of deceit.", "Take, for instance, this 3D pie chart that Steve Jobs presented at the 2008 MacWorld Expo. A casual observer might think that Apple\u2019s SmartPhone Marketshare is larger than the \u201cOther\u201d category\u2019s marketshare because the green slice appears to be bigger than the purple. However, if you compare the numbers on the slices, you can see that the \u201cOther\u201d category in fact has 21.2% of the market while Apple only has a 19.5% marketshare. Whether this was intentional obfuscation on the part of Steve Jobs or not is up for debate but the effect is clear.", "As I write about in another post, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of bad data visualizations lately. As data consumers, we must demand more from the producers of media so that they know that they can\u2019t get away with sloppy or misleading data visualizations. Conversely, as data communicators (data scientists, analysts, journalists), we must strive to make data visualizations which are not only visually compelling but also informative and not misleading. Data isn\u2019t just beautiful. It\u2019s a powerful tool for helping people make key decisions in everything from their personal lives to governance. Let\u2019s use our tools in the best ways we can.", "Your home for data science.
