This week the challenge was to leverage the APIs published by COVID ACT NOW to explore all states given their standardized data set as well as to play with Plotly for visualizations.", "For those of you who would like to follow along, you can find the documentation for the COVID ACT NOW API here. The GitHub repository is useful as it shows how to call the API and how to extract the data. While it is possible to extract .CSV files ( in our first adventure we imported from a .zip file) this time I asked for JSON as the format.", "For those of you who are interested in PLOTLY, here is a link to the documentation. While there are a lot of sophisticated charts available, for this effort I just replicated the simple ones I did with Matplotlib.", "First some libraries. (As this was using a Juypter notebook in Anaconda, I did a conda install of plotly in the terminal per the instructions here before starting).", "As I knew I would be calling the API for different states in the U.S., I decided to build the URL in components, with a prefix the state code (ex: MA or TX) as a separate variable and a suffix which included the request for the \u201ctimeseries\u201d data for trends and JSON as the format. This would allow me to compare states as well sometime in the future.", "NOTE: the output from the APIs no longer matches the documented JSON as of July 5, so this code is no longer functional. Per the GIThub link: \u201cAs of 6/5, cumulativePositiveTests and cumulativeNegativeTests were removed from the timeseries rows. This data is still available in the actualsTimeseries field.\u201d", "Then it was time to call the API with requests, ask for the data and print out a status code.", "Once I had the data, the goal was to produce trend graphs for daily testing rates as well as positivity rates for COVID tests. The great part about the APIs was that the data format for each state has been standardized. The downside is that the API does not contain data for antibody testing.", "As the NYTimes indicated this week, lacking antibodies does not necessarily mean you were never infected or that you lack immunity and having them does not necessarily mean that they may not fade away over time, but it is interesting to watch that data.", "Once the data was received, I just needed to subset the data to the columns I wanted, include the first row which included negative tests as the start and exclude dates which have not yet occurred for testing.", "Then I needed to determine the new tests per day and calculate the positivity rate per day.", "This gave me a data set to graph:", "I was interested in the growth in positive tests results.", "Given data privacy concerns it is not likely it will be possible to graph the percent of the population that has been tested given likely repeated testing of first responders, but it is possible to chart out the daily positive rate.", "The total tests per day can give you an idea about testing patterns.", "Finally we can look at some trends after using days as a proxy for time:", "Leveraging the COVID ACT NOW APIs provides standardized data across the states in the U.S. That said, the data is a bit messy and would need more clean-up as data entry errors can lead to some skewed values: (row 4 below for Florida).", "Rather than something which more likely matches the real situation: (starting at row 14) and using LOWESS trending:", "In this adventure, we stayed with calling the COVID ACT NOW APIs for just one state at a time, but we could call them for all the states and begin to compare states. We could use moving averages to smooth out the data given weekly patterns. We could build a UI to make the whole process more user friendly. Who knows where we will go?", "When you are up with the larks, you start every day as an adventure!", "Your home for data science.
