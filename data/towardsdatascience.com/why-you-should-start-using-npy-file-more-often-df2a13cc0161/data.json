It is the foundation on which nearly all of the higher-level tools such as Pandas and scikit-learn are built. TensorFlow uses NumPy arrays as the fundamental building block on top of which they built their Tensor objects and graphflow for deep learning tasks (which makes heavy use of linear algebra operations on a long list/vector/matrix of numbers).", "Many articles have been written demonstrating the advantage of Numpy array over plain vanilla Python lists. You will often come across this assertion in the data science, machine learning, and Python community that Numpy is much faster due to its vectorized implementation and due to the fact that many of its core routines are written in C (based on CPython framework). And it is indeed true (this article is a beautiful demonstration of various options that one can work with Numpy, even writing bare-bone C routines with Numpy APIs). Numpy arrays are densely packed arrays of homogeneous types. Python lists, by contrast, are arrays of pointers to objects, even when all of them are of the same type. You get the benefits of the locality of reference.", "In one of my highly cited articles on Towards Data Science platform, I demonstrated the advantage of using Numpy vectorized operations over traditional programming constructs like for-loop.", "However, what is less appreciated is the fact, when it comes to repeated reading of the same data from a local (or networked) disk storage, Numpy offers another gem called .npy file format. This file format makes incredibly fast reading speed enhancement over reading from plain text or CSV files.", "The catch is \u2014 of course, you have to read the data in the traditional manner for the first time and create an in-memory NumPy ndarray object. But if you use the same CSV file for repeated reading of the same numerical data set, it makes perfect sense to store the ndarray in a npy file instead of reading it over and over from the original CSV.", "It is a standard binary file format for persisting a single arbitrary NumPy array on a disk. The format stores all of the shape and data type information necessary to reconstruct the array correctly even on another machine with a different architecture. The format is designed to be as simple as possible while achieving its limited goals. The implementation is intended to be pure Python and distributed as part of the main NumPy package.", "The format MUST be able to:", "As always, you can download the boilerplate code Notebook from my Github repository. Here I am showing the basic code snippet.", "First, the usual method of reading the CSV file in a list and converting that to an ndarray.", "So this was the first time read, which you have to do anyway. But if you are likely to use the same dataset many more times, then, after your data science process is finished, don\u2019t forget to save the ndarray object in .npy format.", "Because if you do so, the next time, reading from the disk will be blazing fast!", "It does not matter if you want to load the data in some other shape,", "It turns out that at least in this particular case, the file size on disk is also smaller for the .npy format.", "In this article, we demonstrate the utility of using native NumPy file format .npy over CSV for reading large numerical data sets. It may be a useful trick if the same CSV data file needs to be read many times.", "Read more details about this file format here.", "Loved the article?
