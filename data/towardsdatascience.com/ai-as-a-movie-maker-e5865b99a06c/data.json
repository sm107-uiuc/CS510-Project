But the meaning used to slip away. Because it was written by AI.", "Benjamin was the name of the author. Behind this name was a recurrent neural network LSTM hidden, developed by Ross Goodwin, an AI researcher and poet. The movie was directed by BAFTA-nominated British filmmaker Oscar Sharp and featured a Thomas Middleditch among others.", "Even if the plot consisted of absurdist and seemingly random phrases, our human brain was trying to get it. Cogito, ergo sum \u2014 I think therefore I am.", "Ross\u2019 must-read essays about AI and creativity were highly inspiring for me. If you haven\u2019t a chance, do read this.", "With his experiments (and later with his AI-generated book \u201c1 the Road\u201d), Ross proved what is possible to achieve with Artificial Intelligence. And also this realization was a crucial one: AI is neither just a tool nor an entire replacement for a writer. You need a symbiosis to create art together with AI.", "We\u2019ve seen how many creative uses of Machine Learning are possible.", "With the 3D Ken Burns Effect, we can make animated dream visions, converting a photo to a spatial camera flight.", "With GPT-2 by OpenAI, we can write entire stories.", "But what if we combine all the approaches to one single artwork? And so I did it and generated a short movie completely with AI.", "\u2026But before you watch it: do you have an idea, what do you need to create a movie?", "You surely can waive some elements for arthouse quality, but usually, you need the following ingredients to make a movie (even if a short one):", "You also need an original idea and (in most cases) still unused media assets.", "So how can we apply the Machine Learning approach to fulfill all of these points?", "As previously mentioned, GPT-2 is a powerful NLP model (pre-trained on 40 GB text with 1.5 billion parameters) to generate writings. Its main flaw \u2014 and the major advantage \u2014 is the surreal character of created contents. They usually don\u2019t make sense (at least for knowledge transfer needs \u2014 in a literary context they can be a decent object of interpretation). And: every time a new unique text is generated.", "Let\u2019s see which ways GPT-3 will take in the future (OpenAI published this new giant model with 175 billion parameters, which at the moment cannot be fine-tuned due to its excessive dimensions).", "For my needs I used a GPT-2 Colab Notebook with Java Interface by Manuel Romero:", "There are several different notebooks, allowing you to fine-tune GPT-2 or train on your texts, but I\u2019ve chosen this particular Colab Notebook for its user-friendly and robust structure, and support of the entire 1.5 billion parameter model.", "For my movie I entered the following prompt:", "GPT-2 provided me with various texts, but the one I\u2019ve selected was an amazing piece of an absurdist theater play, somewhere between Beckett, Mrozek and David Lynch:", "It convinced me also because of ambiguous communication levels. It\u2019s as if there is a huge story hidden behind all those sparse phrases (human brain does wonders during interpretation, indeed).", "I am a fan of StyleGAN2, but especially in its implementation in ArtBreeder (at least in the section \u201cPortraits\u201d).", "You can generate new faces, you can make transitions or even animations (read more about using Artbreeder here). So I created a bunch of images for faces (see here the assets) of the Man, the Woman, and some Room pictures.", "It was a tricky thing to align the face modification to the story part (e.g. in the \u201claughter moments\u201d etc.), but after various trials and errors, it worked for me.", "Here are just some assets used for the visuals:", "Sure, you can use the First Order Motion Model for dynamical face animations (using yourself with your Andy Serkis skills):", "But for my absurdist and minimalist style, the face morphing was most appropriate.", "The faces were already made, but something was still missing: voices.", "Voice generation is one of probably the oldest Machine Learning approaches. My favorite was MelNet \u2014 a Model with unbelievable quality. Just listen to the samples (trained on professional speakers or also celebrities datasets). Alas, MelNet wasn\u2019t available as a working repository or Colab Notebook.", "My second choice was Amazon Polly. Being a part of Amazon AWS AI/ML-Services Polly provides a broad quantity of voices in various languages. The downside is: most of them have rather a charisma of an anchorman and are not always suitable for fictional content.", "I used one voice for my AI-generated video \u201cPredictions\u201d:", "Still, the non-emotional voice is not really convincing, if used in some dialogues.", "They provide at the moment a small collection, but the voices have astonishing quality. Some of them can be rather used for anchorman need, but another bear already theatrical power within.", "I\u2019ve chosen these three voices \u2014 Deckard for Narrator, Carlos for Man, and Audrey for Woman.", "You also can experiment with the emotional features of various voices, you even can train them your voice, but these three were perfect for my needs.", "The use of Replica Studios is pretty easy. You sort the phrases in chronological order and apply the appropriate voices to the characters:", "It\u2019s possible to export the voices to mp3-files for your project.", "AI-generated music achieved new levels of quality this year after OpenAI released JukeBox \u2014 a library of 7k songs and music pieces, being generated with pre-trained models on various musicians and songwriters (read also here).", "Many of them are pretty glitchy (like this nightmarish \u201cMozart\u201d piece). But many of them are beautiful. And especially combined with AI-generated visuals they evoke strange feelings within.", "I am using them for my series \u201cBreath ZeroX\u201d:", "For our video something cinematic should pass, so I looked up the music trained on Hans Zimmer (and changed the speed a little bit):", "The rest was rather hard work of a cutter \u2014 for my video I used Premiere Pro and amounts of coffee. Probably the most tricky thing was stretching the videos in time and synchronize them with the plot (original face transitions by ArtBreeder were between 8\u201330 sec long).", "Advice: I used \u201cTime Interpolation: Optical Flow\u201d. It creates new frames between the existent and makes the footage fluent. Sometimes it generates glitches \u2014 but they are always welcome if it\u2019s about digitally generated films!", "I wonder which new audio-visual treasures will come with new ML-approaches.
