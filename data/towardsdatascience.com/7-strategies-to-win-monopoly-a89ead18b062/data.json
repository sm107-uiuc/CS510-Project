It has many different licensed and localized versions. Hasbro has just released a longer version of Monopoly with triple properties that takes forever to play.", "This is a board game that gives people (good?) childhood memories. I used to play it during the holidays with my relatives\u2019 kids, and I usually lost.", "I have played Monopoly for years now. But I really want to know if I could have played better to increase my chance of winning. Maybe I could beat the odds. Today, I am going to analyze how we can maximize our chance of winning a Monopoly game.", "Our analyses involve Python, statistics, and visualization.", "Just like in the real world, properties in the game are not equal. They carry different values and rewards. Many people believe the most expensive property just before the \u2018Go\u2019 tile (Mayfair/Boardwalk or Blue 2) can bring them a fortune, while others prefer collecting a whole set of railroads or utilities.", "What do you want to achieve in the game? You want to win. Be the only survivor. Earn money. You want to invest wisely in properties that can bring you profits. We are getting there.", "For investing in some set of properties, how long would it take to break-even? How much could I earn in the game? We need to establish some metrics to measure your performance.", "The performance of a set of properties depends on a) the revenue, b) the cost, and c) the likelihood of an opponent landing on them. If somehow your opponent is 2 times likely to land on property A than B, it could be more worth investing even if the rent of B is higher. Small profits but quick turnover.", "We know the cost and the rent of properties. They are written on their title deeds. But we do not know their landing probabilities. Let\u2019s find out.", "We define landing probability as the probability of a player ended up on a tile at the end of their turn or right before their next roll if they get a double.", "There are many factors in the game that affects the landing probability. All players start at Go (tile 0) at the beginning. They roll a pair of fair dice in their own turn, and move on the board accordingly. Since rolling a 7 is much more likely than getting a 2 or 12, some tiles might be visited more often than others.", "When players land on an \u2018interim\u2019 tile that is not a property, they follow the rules of that tile and might end up in another tile eventually.", "You can immediately find out that the probability of landing on \u2018Go to Jail\u2019 is zero. Players cannot end up staying on this tile without being sent to Jail.* Note that \u2018Get Out of Jail Free\u2019 card gets a player out of jail without paying the bank, they cannot be used to avoid going to Jail in the first place.", "We could find the landing probability analytically using Markov Chain with some gigantic matrices. You can analytically obtain the conditional probability of landing on each tile from every starting tile. And we are not going to do that.", "Alternatively, we can approximate the landing probability by a Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo method approximates distributions by repeated random sampling. In this case, we can simulate the Monopoly game a million times. We record the frequency of players ending up on each tile. The frequency recorded is an approximation of the landing probability. The more games we simulate, the more confident we are in the approximation.", "We simulate the board. We simulate players rolling dice, moving around the board, and everything else using object-oriented programming. We are implementing it in Python, and the codes are available on GitHub.", "There are two kinds of objects in a Monopoly game \u2014 the board and some players. Simulations are conducted with players running around the boards by rolling dice and sometimes drawing cards from the Chance or Community Chest desks when needed. The probability of a player ending up on each tile can then be approximated by the Monte Carlo simulation.", "On the other hand, the board has", "Let\u2019s simulate a four-player Monopoly game a million times. To keep the simulation simple, we did not simulate the exchange of money or trades among players, as this would complicate things.", "For an N-player Monopoly game, we assumed there are R rounds, where each player takes a turn to play in each round. The total number of opponent turns is (N-1)R. We assumed each player plays the same number of turns in a game, i.e. no players exit early.", "Side note 1: Consecutive doubles are counted as one single turn, according to the official Monopoly rules. The landing of each double is still recorded in our simulation. Therefore, the expected number of landings in all tiles is around 119 for every 100 turns.", "In order to obtain a more realistic approximation, we add stochasticity to the simulation where the number of rounds R in a game follows a Gaussian distribution with mean 30 and standard deviation 3. The mean is taken from an article online, and the variance is just arbitrary.", "Let\u2019s visualize the landing probability p(s) for each tile s by a bar chart.", "I certainly did not expect that. Landing probabilities are not equal. We can observe that", "Maybe the Brown set is not worth investing. Maybe the Orange one is a must-buy. We are not sure at this stage as we have not taken into account their rents and costs. Let\u2019s do that as well.", "Side note 2: The landing probability of Jail is possibly underestimated. We assumed a player gets out of jail by either using a jail free card, or paying 50 pounds/dollars. They do not try rolling a double to get out of jail without paying. This assumption holds at the beginning but not at the end of the game, as staying at the jail is the best strategy to avoid paying rents.", "The investment cost c(s,h) of a property includes land price and house price. It differs for different properties and the number of houses built on top. They are hardcoded into the program.", "Note that we consider the investment cost for a whole colour set, but not individual properties. This is because houses can only be bought when a player owns the whole colour set.", "We also hardcoded the rental income matrix r(s,h) in a similar fashion.", "We define the break-even point of a property as the expected number of opponents turns it takes to recoup the investment. This is calculated by the total property cost divided by the expected rental income per opponent turn. The expected income per opponent turn of a property is proportional to its landing probability and rental income. We can use the same logic to find out the break-even point for a colour set with the following formulae.", "We also define the incremental break-even point as the expected number of opponent turns it takes to recoup the incremental investment. This means how long it would take for a player to get their money back if they decided to build an extra house.", "Let\u2019s see how the break-even points vary for each colour set with a different number of houses. 5 houses correspond to a hotel for visualization purpose.", "We came up with the following strategies solely based on the comparison of break-even points. You should", "We all know that the goal of the game is more than breaking even.", "You want to earn money and bankrupt your opponents. The profit of a colour set is the difference between total revenue and the total cost of the set. Revenue is proportional to the total number of opponent turns, whereas cost is constant. They can be calculated by the following formula.", "We previously assumed that the number of rounds R in a game is more or less constant. The number of opponent turns T=(N-1)R increases linearly, and thus revenue (and profit P) increases linearly as the number of player increases.", "Let\u2019s see how your profit varies with a different number of players in a game if you possess different colour sets with a different number of houses built on top. The profits of holding all 4 stations and holding all 2 utilities are also plotted for reference.", "To conclude, we approximated the landing probability using Monte Carlo simulation, so as to compute the break-even point and the expected profit of each colour set with a certain number of houses in an N-player game. Based on the above-mentioned observations and strategies, we summarize the following 7 strategies that you should follow.", "You should take our analyses with a pinch of salt as we made plenty of assumptions which may not hold in some scenarios. Every game is different and it is difficult to generalize. It is also extremely difficult to take into account the unpredictable human behaviours as players are allowed and encouraged to trade freely with one another.", "There is a 1.94% chance that you are in Jail just after one turn. You can hit \u2018Go to Jail\u2019 with the aid of doubles or draw the \u2018Go to Jail immediately\u2019 card from either deck.", "Thanks for reading! Again, codes are available on GitHub.
