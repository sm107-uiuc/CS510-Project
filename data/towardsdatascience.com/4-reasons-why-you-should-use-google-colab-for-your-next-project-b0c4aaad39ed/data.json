The central technology making interaction possible is iPython.

The growth of the iPython notebook project led to Project Jupyter, which contains the notebook tool and the other interactive tools for multiple languages (Julia, Python, and R). Jupyter Notebook and its flexible interface extend the notebook beyond code to visualization, multimedia, collaboration, and many other features, which creates a comfortable environment for data scientists and machine learning experts.", "Let\u2019s get into a more detailed analysis of iPython, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Colab.", "iPython is a command shell and a kernel, which powers interactive Python notebooks. iPython allows programmers to run their code in a notebook environment quickly. The features that iPython provides can be summarized as follows:", "iPython Project has grown beyond running Python scripts and is on its way to becoming a language-agnostic tool. As of iPython 4.0, the language-agnostic parts are gathered under a new Project, named Project Jupyter. The name Jupyter is a reference to core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python, and R. As of the implementation of this spin-off decision, iPython, now only focuses on interactive Python whereas Jupyter focuses on tools like the notebook format, message protocol, QT Console, notebook web application.", "Project Jupyter is a spin-off open-source project born out of the iPython Project in 2014. Jupyter is forever free for all to use, and it is developed through the consensus of the Jupyter community. Several useful tools are released as part of the Jupyter Project, such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Jupyter Hub, and Voil\u00e0. While all these tools may be used simultaneously for accompanying purposes, installing Jupyter Notebook suffices the environmental requirements for a basic machine learning project.", "On the other hand, as an open-source project, Jupyter tools may be integrated into different toolsets and bundles. Instead of installing Jupyter Notebook through Terminal (for macOS and Linux) or Command Prompt (for Windows), you can use the Anaconda distribution, which will also take care of the environment installation on local machines.", "If you want to take your development experience to the next level, Google Colab, which is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment, is the ultimate tool.", "There are several reasons to opt to use Google Colab instead of a plain Jupyter Notebook instance:", "Let\u2019s see these advantages in more detail:", "Anaconda distribution of Jupyter Notebook shipped with several pre-installed data libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, which is awesome.

If you are cautious about privacy, this may be a preferred feature for you. However, if you want your notebooks to be accessible to you from any device with a simple Google log-in, then Google Colab is the way to go. All of your Google Colab notebooks are saved under your Google Drive account, just like your Google Docs and Google Sheets files.", "Another great feature that Google Colab offers is the collaboration feature. If you are working with multiple developers on a project, it is great to use Google Colab notebook. Just like collaborating on a Google Docs document, you can co-code with multiple developers using a Google Colab notebook. Besides, you can also share your completed work with other developers.", "I think this is an absolute no brainer to choose Google Colab instead of a local Jupyter notebook. Google Research lets you use their dedicated GPUs and TPUs for your personal machine learning projects. Speaking from experience, for some projects, the GPU and TPU acceleration make a huge difference even for some small projects. This is one of the main reasons for me to code all my educational projects on Google Colab. Besides, since it uses Google resources, the neural network optimization operations do not mess with my processors, and my cooling fan doesn\u2019t go crazy.", "Google Colab is just a specialized version of the Jupyter Notebook, which runs on the cloud and offers free computing resources.
