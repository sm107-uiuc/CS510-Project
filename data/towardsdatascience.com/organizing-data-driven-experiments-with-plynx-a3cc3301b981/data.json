On top of it they deal with various engineering problems starting with data collection and transformation to deploying and monitoring. Engineers and data scientists developed various tools and frameworks to address the core challenges of conducting data experiments in a reproducible way.", "Notebooks have proved to be great for one-shot analysis. On the other hand, they have countless flaws when it comes to production. Notebooks are often not reproducible, do not encourage reusing the same code, don\u2019t support parallelization out of box, don\u2019t work well with version control tools, etc. Similarly to engineers, data scientists managed to use existing tools and good practices such as Makefiles. They describe computational graph, where each step is a script. The users are still responsible for many engineering details such as parallel execution in the cloud or storing and accessing data.", "Other data scientists adopted the tools that normally data engineers would use. Apache Airflow, for example, is a very popular framework for building data pipelines. Unfortunately Data Science does not often work in the same way. Highly reliable execution is not as important as flexibility and ability to try different experiments. Using reliable data pipelines in Data Science can bring incremental improvements, however there is usually far more to gain from other activities like integrating new data sources or using additional workflows.", "A well-constructed platform abstracts data scientists from the engineering and organizational complexities, such as data access, containerization, distributed processing, automatic failover, and other advanced computer science concepts. In addition to abstraction, a platform will support an experimentation infrastructure, automate monitoring and alerting, provide auto-scaling, and enable visualization of experiments, debugging output and results.", "PLynx was inspired by a couple of in-house platforms that were very successful.", "AEther was developed by Microsoft in Bing team. I could not add more to what Sai Soundararaj (ex. Microsoft, CEO Floydhub) said:", "The success and rapid acceleration in relevance gains was attributed in large parts to the introduction of a new tool called AEther (in addition to improving ML tech and hiring top talent). AEther was an experimentation platform for building and running data workflows. It allowed data scientists to build complex workflows and experiment in a massively parallel fashion, while abstracting away all the engineering concerns. I used it a ton on a daily basis and loved it. The AEther team claimed that it increased the experimentation productivity of researchers and engineers by almost 100X. Even now, when I ask ex-Bing data scientists working at other companies about what they miss the most from their time at Microsoft, AEther is almost always in the top 3 answers.", "Another source of inspiration for PLynx is a universal computing platform developed by Yandex called Nirvana. It was built out of necessity of scaling internal ML platform for various teams and requirements (original / English).", "Experiments in PLynx are represented as computation Graphs. A Graph defines topology of an experiment. Inputs of a single Operation are Outputs of other Operations or resources called Files. PLynx takes care of storing and accessing artifacts and orchestrating running jobs in a parallel way abstracting it away from users.", "You can reuse someone else\u2019s successful experiment, clone it and reuse in your own experiments. It tends to increase collaboration and awareness of existing tools and algorithms. Over time the pool of ready-to-use Operations and sub-Graphs is growing. It encourages people to create their workflows in a more modular and parameterized way reusing existing solutions. This way they don\u2019t reinvent existing solutions many times and can use advantages of cached results and distributed computation.", "You can use the Editor or python API to create a Graph from scratch. It is a simple drag and drop interface, where users define dependancies as data between Operations. Alternatively users may choose to use python API to create the graph topology. There might be various reasons to do it with API:", "In either case, there is no right or wrong way to do it in PLynx. Both UI and API representations of experiments are identical.", "Files and Operations are basic building blocks in PLynx. Users define their own Operations using bash, python scripts or other plug-ins.", "PLynx is primary an orchestration platform. It executes Operations in topological order. Scheduler keeps track of their statuses and updates. When an Operation is ready to be executed, Scheduler will put it in the global queue where a Worker will pick it up.", "Each Operation works with Inputs abstracted as files. Inputs have their types, such as generic file, json, csv file, or more abstracted Directory (under the hood stored as a zip file), cloud resource (stored as json) or others. In practice it is important to define the types for convenience and to encourage a good practice. Other users will need to see what your Operation is consuming and producing. Inputs might also be optional or be lists. Each Input has two parameters: min and max which both default to 1. If min == 0, then an Input is optional. If max < 0 then Operation can consume unlimited number of files.", "Parameters don\u2019t form the structure of the Graph. Users define their own parameters or use system ones. For example, you might need number of iterations, commit hash, activation function, etc. Values of the parameters are familiar from many programming languages, such as integers, strings, enums, lists of integers, etc. Among system parameters at this point the following are supported:", "Besides Outputs, Operations produce very important information in the form of Logs. Users can inspect standard Logs such as stdout, stderr, and worker. Live logs are also available, given than you flush them in time.", "Let\u2019s take a look at Operation definition. You can either create a new Operation or clone from an existing one. Users add or remove custom Inputs, Parameters and Outputs. Don\u2019t forget to specify the types.", "The main parameter is called cmd. It defines the entire execution process of the Operation. \u201cBase Node\u201d from Custom properties block will interpret Inputs, Outputs and Parameters. Base Nodes are plugins. Currently bash_jinja2, command, and python plugins are supported but they can be extended.", "In case you are not sure what way the worker will interpret the Operation, please click on \u201cpreview\u201d button.", "Let\u2019s look at an example. We would like to create an Operation that will clone a git repository, reset it to a given commit hash, and build it. In the end it will produce a file with type \u201cExecutable\u201d so that we can use it in other Operations. We will use bash_jinja2 plugin:", "This script is not executable by itself in bash. That\u2019s why PLynx Worker and bash_jinja2 will take care of the placeholders:", "This script is a valid bash script. PLynx will also take care of downloading Inputs and uploading Outputs to the storage.", "The algorithm of the worker that executes an Operation is the following:", "Note that some of the Input and Output types can be abstracted. For example:", "PLynx is a high level domain agnostic platform for distributed computations. It is not constrained by a particular application and can be extended to custom data oriented workflows and experiments. Here are some applications it has been successfully used:", "PLynx is an open source platform for managing data oriented workflows and experiments. Its core features are:", "PLynx is an open source project, you can find the code at https://github.com/khaxis/plynx.", "Your home for data science.
