This is in no way meant to be a complete review \u2014 I am barely scratching the surface. Hopefully you\u2019ll get an idea of what Cloud Data Fusion is, and whether a closer look is worth your time.", "Before diving into the details, let\u2019s consider the historical context of Cloud Data Fusion.", "If you worked in the data / analytics space before data scientist became the sexiest job of the 21st century, you might know that graphical ETL (extract-transform-load) tools have been widely used in corporate data warehousing environments. In fact, if you visit the headquarters of any large bank or retailer, there\u2019s a good chance their data warehouse environment is still locked into some proprietary graphical ETL tool, like DataStage or SSIS.", "With the rise of startups and big tech \u2014 both heavily reliant on data for product development \u2014 code (often open source) became more important for building data pipelines. One example of this is the prevalence of Airflow for orchestration of data pipelines \u2014 both in startups and big tech companies.", "Google has already capitalized on the emergence of Airflow with Cloud Composer.", "The divide between the traditional corporate world on the one hand, and the brave new tech world on the other, is revealed in the language of the two camps. Corporate folks speak of \u201cdata integration\u201d, while techies use the term \u201cdata pipelines\u201d.", "In the marketing of Cloud Data Fusion, Google uses both terms, but it\u2019s no coincidence that \u201cdata integration\u201d features so prominently:", "Google is going for the corporations with Cloud Data Fusion. That their enterprise pricing starts at ~$3,000/month is further evidence of this.", "At the same time, even among startup hipsters, there\u2019s a big movement towards #NoCode (simply check Twitter for lots of examples). So Google\u2019s timing for launching Cloud Data Fusion as a no-code data-pipeline product seems appropriate.", "As with most Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products, it\u2019s very easy to get started with Cloud Data Fusion. You simply enable the Cloud Data Fusion API, create an instance, and configure the proper IAM permissions. In my case, it took about 15 minutes to spin up a Basic edition instance in the asia-east-1 zone.", "Once your instance is up, make sure you set up permissions for the service account, as described here.", "Cloud Data Fusion conveniently uses Google authentication, and you get a tour of the interface when you log in.", "Quick side-note: the fact that the term \u201cdata governance\u201d is used in the onboarding is further evidence that Google is targeting corporations:", "Cloud Data Fusion has a \u201cHub\u201d where you can get both individual components or complete data pipelines. An example of a simple pipeline is their quickstart, which reads articles from the New York Times (NYT) stored in Cloud Storage, parses and cleans the data, and loads top-rated books below $25 into BigQuery.", "After selecting this pipeline (and optionally customizing it) you click \u201cDeploy\u201d to make the pipeline executable.", "From there, there\u2019s a \u201cRun\u201d button you can use to execute the job. As you\u2019d expect, you can also schedule jobs to run at regular intervals.", "Below are some of the issues I ran into while playing around with Cloud Data Fusion. If I had read the documentation, there\u2019s a good chance I would have found out what was actually going on here. If someone working on Cloud Data Fusion reads this post, these errors might serve as example issues that people could run into.", "Overall Cloud Data Fusion really feels like a product targeted at larger corporations who might want to move their ETL jobs into Google Cloud Platform.", "I personally doubt that Cloud Data Fusion will get traction among startups, but it seems clear that this is not Google\u2019s target audience for this product.", "For traditional corporations, there are at least two reasons why it might make sense to move over to Cloud Data Fusion.", "Firstly, there\u2019s a good chance the $1-3,000 monthly price is lower than many alternatives in the enterprise data integration space. Have a look at DataStage to get an idea of what competitors might charge.", "Secondly, since Cloud Data Fusion is built on Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP), there\u2019s a lower risk of lock-in. Specifically, you get portability in that you can export your data pipelines and bring them with you to another platform that supports CDAP. Side note: Google acquired Cask (the main contributor to CDAP) about a year ago.", "What are your thoughts on Cloud Data Fusion?", "By Alex Svanevik, Data Scientist at D5 \u2014 The Data Science DAO.", "Your home for data science.
