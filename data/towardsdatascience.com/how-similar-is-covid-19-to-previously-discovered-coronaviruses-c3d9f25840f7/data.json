In this article, I will compare the reference genome of COVID-19 with the reference genomes of two different coronaviruses discovered previously; one human coronavirus and one bat coronavirus.", "Disclaimer: This article is based on my analysis of the reference genomes available on NCBI and is intended for adaptation, learning and understanding of concepts of metagenome composition. This is not a part of any official research and results are not suitable for decision making of any sort.", "For this analysis, I have considered the following three coronavirus genomes.", "I have considered a few criteria to compare the composition of the selected coronaviruses.", "An oligonucleotide is considered to be a contiguous string of a small number of nucleotides. In computational terms, we define oligonucleotides as k-mers (words of size k). In this comparison, I have considered 3-mers (also known as trimers of trinucleotides) and their composition (trinucleotide composition). There are 32 (4\u00b3/2) distinct 3-mers. We obtain the normalised frequencies of each distinct trinucleotide by counting the number of occurrences of that trinucleotide and dividing by the total number of trinucleotides. We normalise these counts to avoid any unevenness caused due to different lengths of sequences.", "The oligonucleotide composition is considered to be conserved within microbial species and varies between species [1][2].", "GC content (or guanine-cytosine content) is the percentage of nucleotides in a sequence that are either guanine or cytosine.", "The GC content is also believed to vary between different species[2].", "Let us first analyse the coronavirus genomes individually.", "This is the reference genome of the SARS coronavirus ZJ0301 reported from China which has been published in the year 2003 [3].", "Publication: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus genotype and its characterization and Molecular biological analysis of genotyping and phylogeny of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus", "Figure 1 denotes the trinucleotide composition of the SARS coronavirus ZJ0301.", "This is the reference genome of the bat SARS-like coronavirus [4] which is considered to be very closely related to COVID-19 [5].", "Publication: Genomic characterization and infectivity of a novel SARS-like coronavirus in Chinese bats", "Figure 2 denotes the trinucleotide composition of the bat SARS-like coronavirus.", "This is the latest reference genome published on NCBI for the 2019 novel coronavirus [5].", "Figure 3 denotes the trinucleotide composition of COVID-19.", "Figures 1, 2 and 3 may seem to show the exact patterns and vary between the same range, but if we plot these together as shown in Figure 4, we can see some differences. We can observe that COVID-19 and bat-SL-CoV show very similar trinucleotide composition patterns compared to SARS-CoV (especially for 3-mers such as AGG, ATC, ATG, CTA, CTC, GAA and GTA).", "Figure 5 denotes the tetranucleotide (4-mer or tetramer) composition patterns of the different coronavirus genomes. Similar trends to that of 3-mers can be seen (especially for 4-mers such as ACAA, AGAA, ATAA, CTAA and CATC).", "According to the GC content values listed above, we can say that bat-SL-CoVZC45 and COVID-19 have very similar GC content of~37\u201338%.", "A two-dimensional PCA plot and a TSNE plot of the trinucleotide composition vectors of the 100 simulated reads of length 5000 bp from each of the three coronavirus genomes are shown in Figures 7 and 8. You can see that some points corresponding to COVID-19 (green points) and bat-SL-CoV (red points) are closer together than they are to SARS-CoV (blue points) in the plot.", "The findings in this article support the claims made in the recently published paper titled A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China where the authors state that the genome they have assembled is very closely related to the bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat SL-CoVZC45. The novel strain has indeed involved and changed since SARS-CoV was discovered in the year 2003.", "I have added a jupyter notebook with the code used for this article and feel free to try it out from the link below.", "For convenience, I have added the normalised 3-mer and 4-mer counts directly in the notebook. If you want to calculate the counts by yourself, you can use a software such as khmer or DSK.", "You can read more about what people think about COVID-19, genome assembly and metagenomics from my previous articles.", "I hope you found this article interesting.
