Even if your use case is different, you might benefit from my experience.", "Behind the main narrative \u2014 the complete solution description \u2014 I also detail some general design concepts, which might come in handy to solve some architectural challenges. These are as follows:", "The code to the solution in this post is available in my GitHub repository https://github.com/tibfab/dss-at-k8s.git", "All tasks to complete the mission can be roughly grouped into two phases:", "During the installation phase, as the first step, a Docker base image is created to host the actual DSS installation of a specific node type; see details of the different DSS node types in my post, \u201cMLOps w/ Dataiku DSS on Kubernetes\u201d. As the next step of the installation, a K8s pod is started with an installation container from the base image to automatically carry out all installation steps. Finally, a snapshot from the running installation container is pushed to a Docker registry, which persists the installation status ready to deploy.", "I\u2019m aware of the concept of the ephemeral nature of K8s pods and the need to have basic Docker images easily reproducible from a versioned Dockerfile. Those concepts, however, don\u2019t really count here because some challenges require unique solutions.", "My solution might be unusual, but I came up with that because I couldn\u2019t just ignore the obvious advantages of managing complex software solutions like Dataiku DSS by employing Docker images and K8s pods. For example, the flexibility and easiness of rolling out or migrating complex installations to different environments with adaptable resources.", "The deployment phase creates all K8s resources \u2014 ConfigMaps, Services, and Deployments \u2014 necessary to run and access the whole DSS node cluster building a production-ready MLOps architecture.", "Now I\u2019d like to walk you through the main installation steps in detail:", "The Dockerfile \u2014 see in my GitHub repo \u2014 provides handy tools for installation/debugging and all necessary CLIs (docker and kubectl) needed to manage the DSS installations in K8s.", "I used a terminal on my Mac and performed docker build in my repo\u2019s main directory to create the base image.", "After the image is successfully built, I need to push it to a Docker registry to make it available for the K8s installation pod. GitLab\u2019s Container Registry (CR) seems to be a good choice. It provides 10 GB storage even for a free account.", "To push the new image to the GitLab CR, you need to be logged in, of course. You can create so-called deploy tokens for that instead of using personal access tokens or credentials.", "Note: The concept of having the image pushed to GitLab keeps this installation very close to a production-grade solution; for example, in AWS EKS, the same mechanism could also apply, even I\u2019d recommend using ECR instead of GitLab CR in that case.", "The installation uses several K8s secrets on the pod for various tasks. Describing them all here would make this already lengthy post really long. Therefore, I outsourced this topic into a separate article: \u201cMultiple Ways to Create Kubernetes Secrets\u201d.", "Dataiku MLOps pipeline consists of four different DSS node types: Design, Automation, API Deployer, and API node. The API node is managed by the API Deployer; therefore, it doesn\u2019t need to be installed explicitly.", "The installation of the DSS Design node is started by applying the customized K8s configuration with kubectl as follows.", "The K8s configuration used in this solution makes heavy usage of the tool Kustomize. To avoid coming too short in explaining or making this article too long, I detail this concept in a separate post: \u201cKustomize explained; an MLOps Use Case\u201d.", "This post describes the installation of the DSS Design node, but all other DSS nodes can be installed similarly by specifying the corresponding configuration directory for Kustomize.", "For example, for the Automation node, that would be:", "My article \u201cKustomize explained; an MLOps Use Case\u201d demonstrates in great detail how the K8s configuration is constructed from multiple parts template free.

All DSS nodes have their own directory containing node-specific configurations such as persistent volumes.", "The installation pod starts with three containers (see the configuration YAML in my GitHub repo):", "For details on DinD and DooD sidecar concepts, please refer to my post, \u201cMLOps w/ Dataiku DSS on Kubernetes\u201d.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the pod definition installation/base/dss-installation-pod.yaml, particularly into the configuration of the dss container, and go over the installation step by step.", "Upon dss container startup, the Git repository is cloned, making the script installation-steps.sh available inside the container (line 15). Then in the next line, the script is executed, which performs the following steps automatically:", "The last two steps are performed only if the environment variable AUTO_DEPLOYMENT in the dss container configuration definition is set to true. The container sleeps infinitely otherwise.", "Important note: The installation is kind of two-sided: Steps flagged with \u2691 update the DSS host container; similar to updating a virtual machine with system dependencies. These changes need to be committed to a new Docker image to make changes persistent for the deployment phase.", "On the other hand, the steps marked with \u261a install or update the DSS software on a persistent volume mounted to the installation pod. The same volume is then used for deployment after the installation phase has been completed. Changes to DSS, even later on, such as working on some data science projects in the studio, resides on the persistent volume. If the deployment is (re)started, DSS resumes exactly where it was terminated.", "It would be out of the scope of this article to go through the script installation-steps.sh in every detail. Let me rather explain some interesting aspects of it.", "A very simple an interesting concept: During installation the script installation-steps.sh creates another small script pre-stop.sh.", "The variables used in the excerpt of installation-steps.sh above contain the actual context of the installation written to pre-stop.sh. Upon K8s pod termination, the resulting script pre-stop.sh (see below) stops DSS and detaches the filesystem image. The image was mounted during startup, and it serves as a persistent volume for the DSS installation. As already mentioned above, my article \u201cPersistent Volume for Kubernetes w/ ACL Support on Mac\u201d describes in detail how the image is created.", "Changes to the DSS container made in the installation phase are conveyed to the deployment steps with a new Docker image. This happens in two steps.", "First, a new image is created from the running DSS container when the host container has been successfully installed \u2014 explained in section \u201cHow to commit the running DSS container\u201d.", "Next, the deployment configuration of the K8s pod is updated. Below is another excerpt from the script installation-steps.sh, which reveals how the configuration update is implemented.", "In line 4, the stream editor, sed patches the deployment configuration with the new image tag. Then the configuration update is committed with git. Additionally, the configuration update is tagged to track the change history or roll back to a specific installation state, if necessary (lines 16/17).", "As a result, upon deployment pod startup, K8s pulls the new Docker image from GitLab CR to create the new dss container.", "The DSS deployment configuration is applied either by the script installation-steps.sh automatically at the end of the installation (as shown in the section above) or manually via Kustomize with the following command.", "The below directory hierarchy listing shows a similar structure as of the installation. All DSS nodes have their own directory containing node-specific configurations such as persistent volumes and \u2014 new here compared to installation \u2014 resource requests and limits.", "DSS node types have very different requirements as far as resource reservation is concerned. An example of resources.yaml file of the Design node is shown below for testing purposes.", "In contrast, the DSS API Deployer requires fewer resources (see example in GitHub here).", "Whenever an update was made to the host system, a new DSS host image needs to be created and configured for the next deployment. The DooD concept (Docker outside of Docker) described in this article provides a perfect solution for that.", "The script installation-steps.sh creates some helper scripts for the deployment phase for starting and stopping the dss container. It also creates a script to make the image update process really easy: commit-dss.sh.", "The script commit-dss.sh above resides in the DSS image, and each time the deployment pod is started, the start script copies commit-dss.sh to the mounted volume /share. Given the pod configuration YAML in my GitHub repo, the script becomes available from within the dood sidecar container because it also mounts the same shared volume shared-storage. See an excerpt of the deployment configuration below, how I achieve that.", "To commit the running dss container, the dood container is entered first.", "Then, the script commit-dss.sh is executed. It creates a new image from the running DSS host container \u2014 tagged with the current date/time \u2014 and pushes it to GitLab CR.", "Besides a complete use case description with a special architecture, this article shows some interesting generic concepts in the fields MLOps, Kubernetes, and Docker.
