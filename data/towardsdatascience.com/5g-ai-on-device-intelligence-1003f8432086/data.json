The proliferation of an even more massive IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystem, where wireless networks will satisfy the communication needs of hundreds of billions of connected devices, without prejudice to their speed, latency and cost.", "This is where the concept of Edge Analytics arises, or broadly meant, a \u201cnew\u201d model of data analysis where data stream processing occurs at a non-central point of the system, such as a device or a sensor.", "As we\u2019ve seen, 5G will cause a proliferation of sensors around us, and each of those sensors opens up new opportunities for analyzing data and creating Machine Learning models.", "And not only that. We are no longer talking about moving significant amounts of data from its source to a centralized repository where we can process it.", "We are talking about bringing processing closer to the source, the device itself, offering crucial benefits such as privacy and reliability, in addition to helping scale intelligence.", "More efficient wireless connections, longer battery life, and therefore better user experiences.", "Imagine using 5G and AI to recreate a virtual human who can interact with a client in real time, advising him remotely or simply as a companion.

We are not simply talking about processing information near the data source, but about adding more context by sharing and receiving new data at high speed, taking advantage of the low latency between them.", "Nowadays, when we ask our AI-powered voice assistant any question, it takes a few seconds to respond because it goes to the cloud to process the request and get a response.
