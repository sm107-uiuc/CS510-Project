Read on and follow the link to source code and feel free to use.", "When I moved to Australia six years ago, after the adrenaline and excitement settled down a bit, the first challenge I faced was where to live! My story to choose a place to live was not different from many other first generation migrants. Landed in OZ, crashed at a friend\u2019s place and then decided to find something nearby.", "Now by profession, I am an accountant, so supposedly I get excited to see numbers. For this reason, I decided to up-skill myself in the world of data science. Chose to start off with IBM Professional Certificate about which I will talk in detail in another blog, but for now, let\u2019s just jump straight to the capstone project that is required in order to complete the certification. And you guessed it right, I chose to apply some newly acquired data skills on exploring Local Government Areas (LGA) or neighbourhoods in Greater Sydney Region and possibly decide on which area to live in.", "The link to the detailed presentation and source code is here:", "Now let\u2019s experience the process I have gone through to complete the project.", "As with any data science project, the biggest challenge is to get the one thing\u2026data! I spent hours browsing numerous websites and was finally able to download some suitable data as follows:", "Do bear in mind that all this data was in different formats, and LGA boundaries kept on changing so the more recent data had different LGAs than older ones. This resulted in some loss of data. Considering this analysis is purely for educational purposes so we can live with it.", "A caveat before we go ahead. Considering the factors above and everyone\u2019s individual circumstances, this analysis is solely being done for the capstone project and academic purposes so not be relied on for any other purpose.", "OK. My analysis, as you might notice, would be more inclined towards rental, assuming new migrants would rent as opposed to buying right away. After cleaning and combining a lot of different data, I used a combination of Box, Bar, Scatter plots and heat maps to compare various neighbourhoods.", "Next, I performed geospatial analysis using Choropleth and Folium Open street maps. Lastly, I used Foursquare API to explore venues and applied k-mean clustering algorithm to create groups of neighbourhoods sharing similar amenities. This will help us decide on making a move to new country by gathering some understanding of the area.", "Here comes the part with lots of data visualisation.", "The first plot is made using Seaborn\u2019s box plot function. This gives us a 5 point range of min, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile and max rental per dwelling type. For instance, we can see House rent can range from $400 pw to >$1400 pw. The scatter superimposed on it shows the number of properties on rent within that range. For example in Houses we can see most of the properties within min to median rental range. For Townhouses, there are some outliers that we can further evaluate if needed but would stop here for now.", "For below plots, I used Matplotlib\u2019s to illustrate a simplistic view of avg rental (actually avg of median rental) per LGA along with a number of properties available. Sydney being a metropolis has the highest number of dwellings with avg. of $650 pw. The overall avg is somewhere near $530.", "Next is a collection of scatter plots (using Seaborn\u2019s lmplot function) which shows a detailed rental distribution by number of bedrooms per neighbourhood. Taking Sydney as an example again, we can see that 4 bedroom houses are all >$1100pw with less than 2500 properties. The 1 bedrooms, on the other hand, are in abundance and are in range <$600pw. This is something one can expect from a central business district like Sydney.", "Let\u2019s visualize the rental cost distribution using a heat map for all suburbs by type of dwelling. This tells us e.g. Mosman is the most expensive neighbourhood by individual dwelling type followed by Woollahra and so on.", "Now comes sales analysis. The bar plot below gives us the skyscraper of Median price distribution during Q2 2019 by each neighbourhood. This covers all property types\u2019 median price. In reality, the price would vary by type and size which is not in our scope at this stage.", "Based on above, as one would expect, there has to be a strong correlation between Avg rental and Median prices by neighbourhood which we can see on below scatter graph (having a correlation coefficient of 0.84).", "This section consists of geospatial distribution of Sales and population data. I first converted a geojson file to shape file and then used geopandas\u2019 Choropleth mapping function to map these shape files. Honestly, took me a while to get my head around (and had a big Yay!!! moment when I finally plotted it).", "Next, I created a bubble map to visualize the relative size of crimes in each neighbourhood based on data downloaded for 2019 Sep year to date crime incidents. The data was mapped on top of Folium Open street map.", "This ends our data visualisation portion. Let\u2019s now move to the machine learning algorithm part.", "Here, as mentioned earlier, I used Foursquare API to explore all the venues (cafes, gyms, bars, parks etc) in the neighbourhoods and then created data frame based on those venues.", "On the resulting dataframe, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, known as k-mean clustering was applied. This divided data into 4 different clusters:", "Cluster 1: It had mostly Cafes, Beaches and Parks as common venues.", "Cluster 2: This one had Restaurants, Cafes and Shopping malls in abundance.", "Cluster 3: Dominated by Cafes, Parks, Restaurants and Burger Joints", "Cluster 4: Being closer to Cluster 1, is dominated by Cafes, Bars and Parks.", "Overall, as we discussed earlier, it is not an easy decision for one to relocate to an entirely new country. However, living in the age of technology has its perks! We get loads of information available over internet and then using data analysis tools we can make reasonable decisions based on our individual preferences.", "This concludes my first ever data science assignment which I did from scratch. It helped me learn a lot over the course of it and I look forward to polishing my skills further in this field.", "Please feel free to comment on source code or the plots in order for me to fine-tune this further.", "Your home for data science.
