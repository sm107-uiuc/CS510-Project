This analysis measures how a process performance fits the customer\u2019s requirements, which are translated into specification limits for the interesting characteristics of the product to be manufactured or produced. The results from this analysis may help industrial engineers identify variation within a process and develop further action plans that lead to better yield, lower variation and less number of defects.", "Specifications are the voice of the customer. Every process should be capable of fulfilling the customer\u2019s requirements, which must be quantified to be attainable. Specification limits are the numerical expressions of the customer requirements. Due to natural variations within the process, specifications usually are a range with upper and lower bounds. USL (Upper Specification Limit) is a value above which the process performance is unacceptable, while LSL (Lower Specification Limit) is a value below which the process performance is unacceptable.", "Specifications must be realistic. In order to evaluate their validity, the RUMBA method from the Six Sigma field is used, where R stands for Reasonable, U for Understandable, M for Measurable, B for Believable and A for Achievable, respectively.", "Process performance is the voice of the process. A process can be considered right when it is approximating to the target, with as little variation as possible. In the Six Sigma approach, the most common process performance measures are:", "The ss.ca.yield function from the SixSigma R package computes all of the previous process performance measures. For the following example, let\u2019s consider that a process is linked by three processes. Let\u2019s take a look at the R code!", "The sigma score of a process (Z) is a simple number that conveys how a process fits the customer specifications. Processes that reach a sigma level of 6 may be considered as \u201calmost perfectly\u201d (i.e. with almost zero defects) designed processes. A sigma value of 6 implies that less than 3.4 DPMO (defects per million opportunities) will be attained. The sigma is the number of standard deviations that fit between the specification limit and the mean of a process. It is calculated using the formula:", "Capability indices directly compare the customer specifications with the performance of the process. They are based on the fact that the natural limits or effective limits of a process are those between the mean and +/- 3 standard deviations (i.e. where 99.7% of the data is contained). The capability of a process (Cp) is calculated using the formula:", "However, this formula does not allow to validate whether the process is centered in the mean (which is desirable). To deal with this issue, the adjusted capability index (Cpk) is calculated using the formula:", "Like the sigma score, capability indices help to determine how well a process is meeting customer specifications. In general, a Cpk of 1.33 is acceptable, but the greater its value, the better.", "The SixSigma R package contains several functions for obtaining process capability measures useful for industrial engineers and process engineers. Let\u2019s take a look at the R code!", "From the Six Sigma Capability Analysis Study above, the top chart represents a histogram of the sample data, which includes the target and the specifications. Density lines are plotted for the empirical and theoretical density functions. The bottom chart represents a quantile-quantile chart (Q-Q plot) to verify if the data points are normally distributed. In the same way, two common statistical tests are included to validate the normality assumption: the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Lilliefors (K-S) test. On the right-hand side of the figure, facts of the analysis are included: the specification limits are those that were entered in the function; the process performance and the indices are calculated, and a confidence interval (CI) is calculated for the capability indices.", "Process capability analysis represents a great tool for industrial and process engineers for identifying variation within a process with the aim of improving its yield and make it more efficient. The SixSigma R package allows getting significant information about a process capability with just a few lines of code. Industrial, process and quality engineers are highly encouraged to take advantage of this tool to be able to fulfill the customer\u2019s requirements with high quality and efficiency standards.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
