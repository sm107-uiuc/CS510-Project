In the momentum regime, returns are positively correlated.", "In contrast, the price of a mean-reverting stock fluctuates randomly around its historical mean and displays a tendency to revert to it. When there is mean reversion, if the price increased (decreased) in the current period, it is more likely to decrease (increase) in the next one.", "Note that, since the two regimes occur in different time frames (trending behavior usually occurs in larger timescales), they can, and often do, coexist.", "In both regimes, the current price contains useful information about the future price. In fact, trading strategies can only generate profit if asset prices are either trending or mean-reverting since, otherwise, prices are following what is known as a random walk (see the animation below).", "Stock prices rarely display mean-reverting behavior. In the vast majority of cases, they follow random walks (their corresponding returns, however, are mean-reverting and fluctuate randomly around zero). Mean-reverting price series can, however, be synthesized by combining different stocks to build a cointegrated portfolio (see this reference for more details) which displays the property of stationarity (a lot more about this below). Though stationarity can be identified using a variety of well-known standard statistical tests, in this article, I will focus on one powerful type of analysis based on the so-called Hurst exponent, which is related to the fractal exponent of the price time series. The Hurst exponent provides a way to measure the amount by which a financial time series deviates from a random walk. It is a surprisingly simple tool that can help investors determine which strategy to apply.", "In this article, for practical purposes, I will informally use the terms mean-reverting and stationary interchangeably. Now, suppose the price of a given stock, which I will represent by S(t), exhibits mean-reverting behavior. This behavior can be more formally described the following stochastic differential equation (SDE)", "are, respectively, the stock price at time t, a Wiener process (or Brownian motion) at time t, the rate of reversion \u03b8 to the mean, the equilibrium or mean value of the process \u03bc and its volatility \u03c3. According to this SDE, the variation of the price at t+1 is proportional to the difference between the price at time t and the mean. As we can see, the price variation is more likely to be positive (negative) if the price is smaller (greater) than the mean. A well-known special case of this SDE is the so-called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.", "Two of the best-known tests for (non-)stationarity are the Dickey-Fuller test (DF) and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests.", "The ADF test is an extension of the DF test, so let us first understand the latter. It can be illustrated as follows. Consider the simple model given by:", "where S(t) are stock prices varying in time, \u03c1 is a coefficient and the last term is an error term. The null hypothesis here is that \u03c1=1. Since under the null hypothesis both S(t) and S(t-1) are non-stationary, the central limit theorem is violated and one has to resort to the following trick.", "Defining the first difference and the parameter \u03b4 as follows", "the regression model can be conveniently rewritten as:", "The Dickey-Fuller then tests the hypothesis (technically the null hypothesis) that", "where the distribution of \u03b4 was tabulated by Wayne Fuller and David Dickey.", "The logic behind the DF test can be heuristically understood as follows. If S(t) is stationary it tends to return to some constant mean (or possibly a trend that evolves deterministically) which means that larger values are likely to follow smaller ones and vice-versa. That makes the current value of the series a strong predictor of the following value and we would have \u03b4 < 0. If S(t) is non-stationary future changes do not depend on the current values (for example, if the process is a random walk, the current value does not affect the next).", "The ADF test follows a similar procedure but it is applied to a more complex hence more complete model given by:", "Here, \u03b1 is a real constant, \u03b2 is the coefficient of the trend in time (a drift term), the \u03b4s are the coefficients of the differences", "where p is the lag order of the process and the last term is the error. The test statistic here is", "where the denominator is the standard error of the regression fit. The distribution of this test statistic was also tabulated by Dickey and Fuller. As in the case of the DF test, we expect \u03b3<0. Details on how to carry on the test can be found in any time series book.", "The following Python snippet illustrates the application of the ADF test to Apple stocks prices. Though stock prices are rarely mean reverting, stock log returns usually are. The Python code below obtains log differences, plots the result and applies the ADF test.", "The output from the ADF test is:", "In general, we are more likely to reject the null hypothesis, according to which the series is non-stationary (it has a unit root), the \u201cmore negative\u201d the ADF test statistic is. The above test corroborates the hypothesis that the log return series is indeed stationary. The result shows that the statistic value of around -28.65 is less than -3.438 at 1%, the significance level with which we can reject the null hypothesis (see this link for more details).", "There is an alternative way to investigate the presence of mean reversion or trending behavior in a process. As will be explained in detail shortly, this can be done by analyzing the diffusion speed of the series and comparing it with the diffusion rate of a random walk. This procedure will lead us to the concept of the Hurst exponent which, as we shall see, is closely connected to fractal exponents.", "Though applications of the Hurst exponent can be found in multiple areas of mathematics, our focus here will be in two of them only, namely fractals and long memory processes.", "A fractal can be defined as follows:", "\u201cA curve or geometric figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. Fractals are useful in modeling structures (such as eroded coastlines or snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth, fluid turbulence, and galaxy formation.\u201d", "An example of a fractal is the Sierpinski triangle shown in the figure below.", "The \u201cfractal dimension\u201d which measures the roughness of a surface, has the following simple relation with H,", "We see that large Hurst exponents are associated with small fractal dimensions i.e. with smoother curves or surfaces.

One type of self-similarity which occurs in several branches of engineering and applied mathematics is called statistical self-similarity. In data sets displaying this kind of self-similarity, any subsection is statistically similar to the full set. Probably the most famous example of statistical self-similarity is found in coastlines.", "In 1967, Benoit Mandelbrot, one of the fathers of the field of fractal geometry, published on Science Magazine a seminal paper entitled \u201cHow Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension\u201d where he discussed the properties of fractals such as self-similarity and fractional (Hausdorff) dimensions.", "One important kind of departure from random walks occurs when processes have long-range dependence.

Measurements at high frequencies say, in 1-minute intervals, differ significantly from daily measurements.", "If stock prices follow, which is not always the case (in particular for daily returns), a geometric random walk (or equivalently a geometric Brownian motion or GBM), the variance would vary linearly with the lag \u03c4", "and the returns would be normally distributed. However, when there are small deviations from a pure random walk, as it often occurs, the variance for a given lag \u03c4 is not proportional to the \u03c4 anymore but instead, it acquires an anomalous exponent", "The parameter H is the so-called Hurst exponent.

Instead, the distribution has fatter tails and thinner and higher peaks around the mean.", "The Hurst exponent can be used to distinguish three possible market regimes:", "The Hurst exponent, therefore, measures the level of persistence of a time series and can be used to identify the market state: if at some time scale, the Hurst exponent changes, this may signal a shift from a mean reversion to a momentum regime or vice versa.", "The Hurst exponent, therefore, measures the level of persistence of a time series and can be used to identify the market state.", "Examples of each case are plotted below:", "In the next figure, we see how the Hurst exponent can vary with time indicating a change in regime.", "The autocorrelation function for the stock price S(t) is defined as follows:", "Processes with autocorrelations that decay very slowly are termed long memory processes. Such processes have some memory of past events (past events have a decaying influence on future events). Long memory processes are characterized by autocorrelation functions \u03c1(\u03c4) with power-law decay", "The relation between \u03b1 and the Hurst exponent is", "Note that as H approaches 1, the decay becomes slower and slower since the exponent \u03b1 approaches zero, indicating \u201cpersistent behavior\u201d. It often happens that processes that appear random at first, are actually long memory processes, having Hurst exponents within the open interval", "Those processes are often referred to as fractional Brownian motion (fBm) or black noise, a generalization of Brownian motion.", "To obtain the variance dependence on \u03c4, we must repeat the same calculation for many lags, and extract the slope of the logarithmic plot of the result. As we will see now, the value of H depends strongly on our choices of lags.

We first run the following code, which takes the range of lags to be from 2 to 20:", "We obtain the following value for H:", "As previously explained, this value of H indicates a mean-reverting regime, albeit rather mild. The same code with lags 300\u2013400, gives:", "This value of H indicates the presence of a trending regime. We see, therefore, that the choice of lags strongly affects the value of the Hurst exponent. This means that this time series is neither purely mean-reverting nor trending, but changes behavior or shifts regimes depending on whether one measures it over short intervals or over the long term. Furthermore, as noted here, since these conclusions are far from obvious for the naked eye, we conclude that this analysis based on the Hurst exponent can give important insights.", "The presence of long term anomalous behavior of stock returns was noticed in 1971 by Mandelbrot.", "To test for such long-range dependence, Mandelbrot used the Rescaled Range or R/S test statistic, briefly mentioned above. The R/S statistic is the range of partial sums of deviations of a series from its mean rescaled by the standard deviation (see this book for more details). Mandelbrot and others showed that using the R/S statistic leads to far superior results when compared with other methods such as the analysis of autocorrelations, variance ratios, and spectral decomposition, though it does have shortcomings, such as sensitivity to short-range dependence (for more details, see this article and this excellent blog post).", "The R/S statistic can be obtained as follows. Consider for example the following time series of stock returns of length n", "The partial sum of the first k deviations from the mean is given by:", "The R/S statistic is proportional to the difference between the maximum and minimum of such sums where k \u2208 [1,n]:", "The denominator \u03c3(n) is the maximum likelihood standard deviation estimator. The rescaled range and the number n of observations have the following relation", "where H is the Hurst exponent. This scaling behavior was first used by Mandelbrot and Wallis to find the presence of long-range dependence. Since the relation between the rescaled range and the number of observations is polynomial, one can calculate the value of H with a simple log-log plot since", "In the plot below, the Hurst exponent is estimated to be around 0.53 which approximately corresponds to a random walk. The code uses the hurst library (the link to the Github repo is here).", "There are other methods to obtain the Hurst. You can check this article for more details on that.", "We saw that using the concept of the Hurst exponent can lead to very useful insights about the market regime. With that information in hand, one can decide which of the two strategies, mean reversion or momentum, is more appropriate to adopt.", "In short, the value of the Hurst exponent identifies if the time series has some memory of past events. The fact that the value of the Hurst is not always equal to 1/2 shows that the efficient market hypothesis, according to which markets are completely unpredictable is often violated. Properly identifying such anomalies can in principle be extremely useful for building efficient trading strategies.", "Thanks for reading and see you soon!
