The gold standard for the evaluation of treatment effect is the randomized controlled trial (RCT) since its randomisation minimises bias and maximises our ability to identify causality. However, it has become clear that it is not possible to depend on RCTs for all the information needed on the effectiveness of medical interventions since they do not represent real-world populations or settings and tend to be too short to detect long-term effects. Furthermore, RCTs are designed to estimate the average effect of interventions and might, therefore, not be able to inform decisions about individual patients encountered in clinical practice.", "Recently, I proposed a framework using right-censored observational data from electronic health record (EHR) to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) for binary treatment options (treated vs control) on time-to-event (survival) outcomes using data. These estimates account for loss to follow-up and allow for the measurement of the long-term effect of interventions.", "Step 1. Estimate the individual treatment effect.", "Individual treatment effects are estimated by fitting outcome models on treated and control samples: and; then, we calculate potential outcomes using these models as and. This two-model approach encodes the different relevant explanatory variables for treated and control outcomes and has been proved to improve the potential outcome estimation accuracy.", "We start by converting the original survival data into a counting process: a sequence of binary outcomes over time. We then use Super-learner to estimate the conditional hazard rate for each observation i at each time t as: where is the observed event time for i. The potential survival probabilities are then derived via the probability chain rule to get the initial treatment effect estimation for i at time t.", "Step 2. Identification of features contributing to heterogeneity of treatment effect.", "Given the estimated ITE, we seek to identify which features contribute to the heterogeneity of treatment effect. We model ITE using machine learning algorithms and define important features as those that contribute most to the reduction of the model prediction error. The regression methods employed here are: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), Adaptive Lasso (AL), Elastic Net (EN) and Causal Forest (CF). Previous studies found AL and EN give consistent selections of covariates compared to the standard Lasso. Alternatively, we could have chosen to model ITE within strata of a similar propensity score. However, this was not chosen since recent work has demonstrated the propensity score matching (PSM) may result in increased covariate imbalance in observational studies.", "The feature identification procedure is as follows:", "2. Calculate the variable importance (VI) score, S, for each feature,", "where D is the number of features. If we choose to use CF, the VI score corresponds to the proportion of splits. In BART, it corresponds to the posterior mean of the proportion of splits. In AL and EN, it is the regularisation weight;", "4. Rank features according to their overall importance score in descending order and assign the rank, R, to each X;", "5. Construct an importance score curve using ordered pairs (S,R);", "6. Use Kneedle Algorithm to identify the Knee Point[1], and label features with a higher overall importance score than the Knee Point as having a significant contribution to the heterogeneous effect.", "Step 3. Target estimation of CATE.", "Kernel-based local averaging is used to calculate CATE associated with the reference classes defined by the previously selected features. Let x be a selected feature, we can divide the population into Q strata based on the value of x, then for each stratum q, we calculate its marginal conditional average treatment effect (MCATE) using the one-step TMLE adjustment.", "The first figure depicts the true and estimated individual treatment effects using simulations under different event rates:", "The second figure depicts the Bias on the CATE estimation:", "An advantage of our proposed framework is that it reports the effect heterogeneity in terms of the difference in survival probabilities under treatment and control conditions. This absolute measure is more informative for clinical decisions compared to relative measures such as the hazard ratio. Secondly, we provide the flexibility of choosing user-specified methods for potential outcome modelling, important covariates identification and selection bias adjustment. Thirdly, we automate the heterogeneity discovery process to avoid the ad-hoc selection of subgroups. Fourthly, the adjustment for selection bias was conducted on the identified subgroups to reflect the treatment and censoring mechanisms within the chosen subgroup.", "Your home for data science.
