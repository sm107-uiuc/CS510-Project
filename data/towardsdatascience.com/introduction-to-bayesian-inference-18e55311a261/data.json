In order to save your patient, you need to arrive in less than 15 minutes. If we estimate that route A takes 12 minutes and route B takes 10 minutes, which would you choose? Route B seems faster, so why not?", "The information provided so far consisted of point estimates of routes A and B. Now, let\u2019s add information about the uncertainty of each prediction: route A takes 12 min \u00b11min, while route B takes 10 min \u00b16min.", "Now it seems like the prediction of route B is significantly more uncertain, eventually risking taking longer than the 15 minute limit. Adding information about uncertainty here can make us change our decision from taking route B to taking route A.", "Credit: the previous example was based on what I could remember from a tutorial by Tamara Broderick at Columbia University. Work related to this example can be found in [1].", "More broadly, consider the following cases:", "The ambulance example was intended to illustrate the second case. For the first case, we can have a quick look at the work of Nobel Prize winning economist Christopher Sims. I will simply cite his student Toshiaki Watanabe:", "I once asked Chris why he favoured the Bayesian approach. He replied by pointing to the Lucas critique, which argues that when government and central bank policies change, so do the model parameters, so that they should be regarded not as constants but as stochastic variables.", "For both cases, Bayesian inference can be used to model our variables of interest as a whole distribution, instead of a unique value or point estimate.", "Central to Bayesian Inference is Bayes\u2019 Rule:", "Given the definition of conditional probability, this rule can seem very obvious and almost redundant, although its use is not immediately clear:", "Judea Pearl describes it this way, in The Book of Why [2]:", "(\u2026) Bayes\u2019s rule is formally an elementary consequence of his definition of conditional probability. But epistemologically, it is far from elementary. It acts, in fact, as a normative rule for updating beliefs in response to evidence.", "Indeed, this seemingly simple concept has received enormous attention. Some of its practical consequences consist in allowing to invert conditional probabilities [going from P(B|A) to P(A|B)], and to update our belief in the values that A can take (i.e. its distribution) as we observe more samples of B.", "Before we dive into examples, let\u2019s just give names to the components of Bayes\u2019 Rule:", "Let\u2019s briefly discuss the meaning of each component. Hopefully the examples in the following section will make these definitions much clearer.", "Assume we are interested in knowing about A, but can only observe B:", "Additionally, we can denote the fraction likelihood/evidence as the likelihood ratio.", "Note that we can consider both the prior and the likelihood function as fixed, i.e. they are assumptions chosen before we begin observing samples of B. In this case, the evidence and the posterior are consequences of our assumptions + observations.", "The following two examples were very important for me to see how these concepts materialize.", "Credit: The following example was inspired in Judea Pearl\u2019s The Book of Why [2].", "Imagine we want to estimate the probability of having a disease D, given the result of our test T. If we know that 10% of the population has D, we can incorporate this in our prior (if we know details about the patient, we can use a subset of the population which better represents her):", "Note that D can only take two values (0 or 1 \u2014 healthy or sick), but in other problems our variable could accept more discrete values, or even continuous values.", "We also know, from historic data, how reliable the test is \u2014 we know how likely the test is to fail when the patient has D, and also when it doesn\u2019t have D. This will constitute our likelihood function:", "This way, we have one conditional distribution over T, for each value of D.", "As you saw, we assume to know the probability of the test being correct given the truth about the disease \u2014 P(T|D), but we are interested in the opposite [probability of having the disease given the test result \u2014 P(D|T)]. This illustrates the importance of being able to reverse conditional probabilities, which Bayes\u2019 Rule allows:", "Imagine we took a test which gave a positive result T=1. We now wish to compute the posterior, the updated probability that we have the disease given this new information. We can first compute the evidence:", "To output the updated distribution over D, let\u2019s now compute each of the values that D can assume:", "Naturally the second step is redundant here, but in other settings D may take more than 2 values. Our updated distribution says that P(D=1) increased from 10% to 29% after getting a positive test. We could use this new distribution as input if we were to take a second test, instead of the original prior P(D). If the new test is positive again (T=1), we could repeat this computation, further increasing P(D=1) to 60%:", "It\u2019s also interesting now to observe the meaning of previously mentioned likelihood ratio (likelihood/evidence). This is the proportion according to which our previous belief will increase or decrease.", "Hopefully this was useful to understand the mechanics of Bayes\u2019 Rule when updating a belief. However, to me it didn\u2019t feel like enough to understand what happens when talking about a model\u2019s parameters (e.g. Christopher Sims\u2019 research on modelling the economy, or many machine learning applications).", "Moving to a more abstract domain, Bayes\u2019 Rule can be applied to estimate a model\u2019s parameter as a distribution. For instance, Christopher Sims took advantage of Bayes\u2019 Rule to model an economy where governments and policies change. In this setting, if we describe a model parameter with a distribution we can account for such changes more precisely than using a single value.", "Credit: the following example was partly inspired from Antonio Salmer\u00f3n\u2019s lecture at Probabilistic.AI summer school (slides, video)", "We have a Binomial distribution that represents the outcome of 20 binary experiments, each with probability of success p (say, 20 flips of a biased coin). As you may guess, we are interested in estimating parameter p from observations x (with p representing how biased the coin is). In this case we consider 1 single observation of x, which tells us how many of the 20 independent experiments were observed as successful \u2014 how many times we got tails from the coin flip.", "One observation of x can have any value between 0 and 20 successes. Using the definition of Binomial distribution we can build 21 different likelihood functions P(x|p), one for each value of x:", "The area of each of these curves does NOT need to sum to 1 \u2014 just like in the previous example P(T=1|D=1)+P(T=1|D=0)=0.75+0.2\u22601. These curves are not probability distributions because, for P(x|p), we are fixing x and varying p. If we fix p (for instance p=0.3) and vary x instead, then the values must sum to 1:", "To provide additional intuition, let\u2019s regard the function P(x|p) as having 2 input arguments: x and p. If we allow both to vary simultaneously, this is what it looks like:", "If we fix x to an observed value, we have a likelihood function (we are slicing this 3D plot across the x-axis, obtaining 1 blue curve), if we fix p we have a probability distribution (we slice it across the p-axis, obtaining a curve like the orange one). After we observe x, we fix that value and obtain the corresponding likelihood function to use with the Bayes\u2019 rule.", "Ok, we have almost everything we need to update our belief in the value of p after observing x! A few notes before moving on:", "Finally, if we assume a uniform prior between 0\u20131 for p, we have everything we need to update our belief in p after observing a new sample x.", "In this particular case (Binomial likelihood with Uniform prior) the posterior is easy to compute, which allows for a quick and exact result. However, if we assume other kinds of likelihood functions and priors we may need to resort to other techniques to compute our posterior, such as variational inference.", "Some final notes on this example:", "In this post I tried to motivate the use of Bayesian Inference, and to clear its basic ideas. For me the most confusing part was to understand what exactly must be provided a priori. Besides the prior, the likelihood function must be provided beforehand, but this can mean very different things which are interesting to compare:", "[1] D. Woodard, G. Nogin, P. Koch, D. Racz, M.
