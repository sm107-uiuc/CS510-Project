A gist is an easy way to share excerpts of code or data with others in a clean and reader friendly way. In this article, you\u2019ll see ways to display a function you\u2019ve created, a query into a table, or some other small piece of data (like a sneak peek at a dataframe). These bits of information are hosted by GitHub as a repository. Using gist has all the benefits of utilizing a GitHub repository with a lightweight and easy to share embedding feature.", "Not only are they cleaner but they allow coders who have vision issues a chance to read through your code using accessibility options.", "For now, let\u2019s go through the basics:", "There are two ways of getting to the gists portion of Github.com. The first way is for you to go to Gist.Github.com and it will take you to the new gist creation. Or you can go through your Github home page.", "The bottom red arrow, pointing at my profile picture, is how you would get to your repositories or gists. We\u2019ll ignore that one for now and leave it for when we talk about editing old gists. The top arrow, pointing to the plus sign, leads to creating repos, gists, or projects \u2014 and that is the one we will be looking at first. After you click on the plus sign, you\u2019ll see a dropdown menu.", "That will bring you to the page below. Note how you have several fields to fill out.", "From here it\u2019s all plug and play. Let\u2019s try to create a gist with a snippet of code we want to showcase \u2014 and I have just the one.", "Below I have a snippet of code written out to impute data from a recent linear regression project I finished. It was written to impute the number of bedrooms a house may have using the bathrooms and square footage of living space of a given house.", "The extension is very important. You can put things like .txt, .py or .html. This notifies the reader what language it was written in \u2014 if it is not clear already, and it allows the file to be downloaded with the appropriate extension. The gist works whether you put an extension on it or not \u2014 but best \u2018practices make better job opportunities\u2019 \u2014 Paul Torres 2020.", "After simply copy and pasting the code into the window and filled out the description and the file name.", "I set the settings to public so that the gist could be found in a search on the website. However, you have the option of making a secret gist that cannot be searched \u2014 these gists can still be shared with links you can hand out.", "The next feature we look at is the creation of tables using gists. Gists are not only for showing snippets of code. You can also display small shots of data in them. I say small because as of the publishing of this article, I have not found a method of entering data beyond copy and paste or manual entry.", "The first step is to start a new gist and edit the file name so that it ends in .csv. This tells the website that you are going to be entering in values for the column index and cells separated by commas. Make sure that each column name is separated by a comma and each subsequent row is ordered in the same was as the column names.", "Looking at the picture above, we can see that the first row of entries are the column names. The second row is the first observation in the data. All of the entries have to be separated by a comma and they all have to be in the order of the column names in the first row. This continues on for the entirety of the table.", "Don\u2019t worry about segmentation of the cells or the font of the column names \u2014 the website does it for you.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at the finished table.", "Each observation is segmented into a different row and each feature is segmented into its own cell. As we said before, the formatting of the font was done automatically when the column names are bolded and placed at the top of their columns.", "One very helpful feature is the Search Box on the top of the table. It\u2019s not accessible from the embedding but it is on the website. You can search the table and it returns only the values you designate.", "Now we can talk about showing these gists to the world.", "Right here on Medium, it is as simple as clicking on the + on the next paragraph potion and clicking the <> option. After pasting the gist\u2019s url, press enter.", "If you go back to your Github homepage, to the right of the create button is your picture. That dropdown menu is going to give you links to your profile and settings \u2014 but more importantly your repos, projects, and gists.", "Click on the link for Your gists.", "At which point, you will be taken to a page listing all of your gists.", "Click on one and you will be able to edit. Any gist you edit will update any embedding you have elsewhere. This is a very handy feature in case you spot a mistake or want to format the code in a more pleasing way. Instead of having to visit each embedding, you can just update the gist and it will do the work for you.", "Thanks for reading. I hope this helps you distribute the beautiful code I know you will write.", "Connect with me on LinkedIn here.", "For more information about the projects these gists came from, check out my Github here. And you can check out the articles these gists came from below:", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Scientist with a Physicist\u2019s heart.
