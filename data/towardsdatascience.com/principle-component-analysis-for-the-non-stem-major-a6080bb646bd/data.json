Whether or not you are a visual learner or not, data visualization can serve you well in your future projects. Through this article, we will see the limitations of higher dimensional data sets and understand the intuition behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a solution without going too deep into mathematical theory.", "Data can be very diverse and come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and sometimes we may sometimes feel intimidated when we come face-to-face with one we have never seen before especially when its structure is a bit scary. In school, we may have had the opportunity to analyze data that was cleanly formatted with very few variables, maybe two or three variables. And upon our first sight of the real-world we come face-to-face with a data set with 20 variables (now that\u2019s scary)! So, I will explain the problem that arises with high-dimensional data and how PCA can address such a problem.", "Consider the case that we have a data set with N observations and a single variable. The question is:", "Are we able to visualize a single variable?", "To visualize the 1-dimensional case, we can do so with a line graph which plots a single point for each observation corresponding to its respective value for the specified variable along the number line.", "Great! We are able to visualize the data when there is just a single variable. Through this 1-dimensional plot, we are able to see that there are observations that tend be on the lower end and other observations that tend to be on the upper end (the power of data visualization... am I right?)", "However, this was just for the 1-dimensional case. Let\u2019s ask the question again:", "Are we able to visualize two variables together?", "Looks great! Again, we were able to create a plot of the data for the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional case. Once again, let us ask the question more:", "Are we able to visualize the data for three variables?", "Let\u2019s now try visualizing 4 variables at once (Wait\u2026 we can\u2019t do that). However, visualizing the 4-dimensional and higher dimensional spaces is actually not possible (bummer). So when it comes to high dimensional data sets we can see there are two problems:", "How PCA can be used to solve this issue?", "With this problem mentioned, now we can begin to see the use of PCA. In that, we can take those 20 number of columns and reduce it down to 2 or 3 variables. This can be done if we can some way create 2 or 3 variables that summarize the variability of the original data set well (i.e summarize the data well). And actually, these variables we wish to find are what we call principal components. We say that PCA is a method used to reduce the dimensions of the data set, i.e. a dimension reduction technique.", "For a high-level characterization of these principal components, they are going to be values composed of the 20 variables of different weights. Meaning that the 20 variables have varying importance for each component. In other words, we can identify which variables are most important for a given principal component.", "And it will be so that we can find some number of principal components that explain the total variability of the original data well.", "Therefore, once we identify the 2 or 3 principal components that summarize the original data set well, we can take those components and visualize the data.", "For the purpose of this explanation, I will explain PCA in the 2-D step-by-step. The mathematical intuition for applying PCA to higher dimensions will be similar to that of the 1 and 2 dimension which will be explained.", "The first step in finding principal component 1 is to find the means of both variable 1 and variable 2 to obtain the center of the data. Imagine we do so, then we will have identified one point on the variable 1 axis and one point on the variable 2 axis where both of them represent the mean of all samples for that variable.", "Next, we can draw imaginary lines crossing both of these points obtained. At some point, there will be an intersection of the two lines. This intersection is the center of the data.", "Here we center the data at the origin. Notice that when we shift the data, the center changes but the distance of the data points in respect to one another remains the same.", "We first draw a line that goes through the origin. Initially this line does not need to be the \u201cbest fit line.\u201d It just must be so that the line goes through the origin.", "The reason why this line does not need to initially be the best fit line is because, the line itself just serves a candidate for being our \u201cbest fit line.\u201d So next we will check if this candidate is actually the one we are looking for (is it the chosen one?)", "Next, we project the original data point onto the line.", "When I say project, you can think of it as the data point itself is thrown at the line on the shortest path possible. And this path will always be a path that forms a right angle at the point of projection (i.e. orange point).", "So notice that when we project the point a right triangle is formed", "Now we can begin to identify if this line is the line that has best fit!", "It might be so that you are thinking that we can minimize the sum of squared d\u2081\u2026d\u2099 distances to determine this (i.e. the distances between the original purple data point to the projected orange point) and squared so that negative do not cancel out positives. Perhaps we can think of this because it is similar to how we minimize the sum of squared distances between the line and the data points to determine the line of best fit for a linear regression line. Intuitively, this is actually easiest to imagine and it is correct to say.", "However, PCA actually aims to maximize the sum of squared d\u2081\u2019\u2026dn\u2019 distances (i.e. the distances from the origin to the projected point.", "Why would we want to maximize the distances?", "Intuitively, it does not make too much sense that we are maximizing the distances to obtain the line of best fit. Let me explain.", "We established that the projection creates a right triangle. Due to this notion, we are able to apply the Pythagorean Theorem.", "Notice how earlier I said it is correct to say that we are aiming to minimize the d\u2081\u2026d\u2099 distances (in the plot above d\u2081 is represented as b).", "Now we can say that the distance a is a fixed value because we are not moving the original purple data points themselves. Meaning that the left side of the Pythagorean Theorem equation is fixed. What we are moving is the red line passing through the origin. Therefore, if a is a fixed value and we are lowering/minimizing the distance b, then the distance c must increase/be maximized. So maximizing", "We can see this through the equation: a is fixed. If b decreases, then c must increase.", "We can see this graphically: moving the line closer to the data point, minimizes b, but also maximizes c.", "Therefore, one can determine our best fitted line by either minimizing d\u2081\u2026d\u2099 or maximizing d\u2081\u2019\u2026d\u2099\u2019. PCA elects the latter due to it being easier to calculate.", "The line that is selected to best the best fit checks that the sum of the squared distances across all d\u2081\u2019\u2026d\u2099\u2019 is minimized. So we are computing maximum of SS(d\u2081\u2019+d\u2082\u2019+\u2026+d\u2099\u2019) to obtain the best fit line.", "To summarize we obtained the max SS(d\u2081\u2019\u2026d\u2099\u2019) to get our line of best fit. From this you actually learned what principal component 1 is and what the eigenvalue is for principal component 1.", "The red line of best fit is actually our principal component 1 or PC1.", "2. SS(d\u2081\u2019\u2026d\u2099\u2019) is actually the eigenvalue for PC1. Eigenvalues help us determine which components are most important in summarizing the data.", "Now that we have our principal component 1, we can examine some characteristics of it. One of them being its slope.", "Consider for example, that the slope of principal component 1 (above) if 0.25.", "If we consider this, then this means that increasing along the x-axis (variable 1) by 4 will increase the y-axis value (variable 2) by 1 unit.", "When we say to \u201cnormalize.\u201d This is actually just making it so that the hypotenuse is of value 1.", "This \u201cnormalized\u201d vector of length one is called the eigen-vector.", "The eigen-vector gives us two vectors, the x-component vector and y-component vector. And it these two vectors that give us the loading scores. In this example, they took the values 0.97 and 0.242 respectively. This means that for PC1, variable 1 is 4x more important than variable 2.", "To obtain PC 2 we draw a line orthogonal to PC 1. Meaning that we draw a line through PC 1 that creates a right angle.", "Remember that there still remain the projections of the data onto PC 1. So by rotating the axis so that PC 1 is the x-axis and PC 2 is the y-axis. We get a new coordinate system where PC 1 is the x-axis and PC 2 is the y-axis!", "We saw that each data point was projected onto PC 1 as well as PC 2. We take these two projection points and obtain the new point (as shown above). Which gives us the PC plot.", "We went over the two-variable case in order to understand what is going on behind the scenes in PCA. If we have more than two variables. A similar process is followed, in that subsequent components must be orthogonal to the pre-existing principal components.", "So when we have N columns we can determine N principal components. But looking at how much of the total variation the principal component accounts for allowing us to select specific principal components until we obtain a total variation captured threshold that is pleasing to us.", "Your home for data science.
