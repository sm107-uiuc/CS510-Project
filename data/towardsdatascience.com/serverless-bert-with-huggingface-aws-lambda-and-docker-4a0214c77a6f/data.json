Of course, I\u2019m not talking about Christmas but re:Invent. It is re:Invent time.", "In the opening keynote, Andy Jassy presented the AWS Lambda Container Support, which allows us to use custom container (docker) images up to 10GB as a runtime for AWS Lambda. With that, we can build runtimes larger than the previous 250 MB limit, be it for \u201cState-of-the-Art\u201d NLP APIs with BERT or complex processing.", "Furthermore, you can now configure AWS Lambda functions with up to 10 GB of Memory and 6 vCPUs.", "For those who are not that familiar with BERT was published in 2018 by Google and stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and is designed to learn word representations or embeddings from an unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context. Transformers are since that the \u201cState-of-the-Art\u201d Architecture in NLP.", "Google Search started using BERT end of 2019 in 1 out of 10 English searches, since then the usage of BERT in Google Search increased to almost 100% of English-based queries. But that\u2019s not it. Google powers now over 70 languages with BERT for Google Search.", "We are going to use the newest cutting edge computing power of AWS with the benefits of serverless architectures to leverage Google\u2019s \u201cState-of-the-Art\u201d NLP Model.", "We deploy a BERT Question-Answering API in a serverless AWS Lambda environment. Therefore we use the Transformers library by HuggingFace, the Serverless Framework, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECR.", "Before we start i wanted to encourage you to read my blog philschmid.de where i have already wrote several blog post about Serverless or How to fine-tune BERT models.", "The Transformers library provides state-of-the-art machine learning architectures like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNet, T5 for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). It also provides thousands of pre-trained models in 100+ different languages.", "AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without managing servers. It executes your code only when required and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.", "Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry. It allows us to store, manage, share docker container images. You can share docker containers privately within your organization or publicly worldwide for anyone.", "The Serverless Framework helps us develop and deploy AWS Lambda functions. It\u2019s a CLI that offers structure, automation, and best practices right out of the box.", "Before we get started, make sure you have the Serverless Framework configured and set up. You also need a working docker environment. We use docker to create our own custom image including all needed Python dependencies and our BERT model, which we then use in our AWS Lambda function. Furthermore, you need access to an AWS Account to create an IAM User, an ECR Registry, an API Gateway, and the AWS Lambda function.", "We design the API like that we send a context (small paragraph) and a question to it and respond with the answer to the question.", "You can find the complete code in this Github repository.", "First, we create our AWS Lambda function by using the Serverless CLI with the aws-python3 template.", "This CLI command will create a new directory containing a handler.py, .gitignore, and serverless.yaml file. The handler.py contains some basic boilerplate code.", "To add our BERT model to our function we have to load it from the model hub of HuggingFace. For this, I have created a python script. Before we can execute this script we have to install the transformers library to our local environment and create a model directory in our serverless-bert/ directory.", "After we installed transformers we create get_model.py file in the function/ directory and include the script below.", "To execute the script we run python3 get_model.py in the serverless-bert/ directory.", "Tip: add the model directory to gitignore.", "The next step is to adjust our handler.py and include our serverless_pipeline(), which initializes our model and tokenizer and returns a predict function, we can use in our handler.", "Before we can create our docker we need to create a requirements.txt file with all the dependencies we want to install in our docker.", "We are going to use a lighter Pytorch Version and the transformers library.", "To containerize our Lambda Function, we create a dockerfile in the same directory and copy the following content.", "Additionally, we can add a .dockerignore file to exclude files from your container image.", "To build our custom docker image we run.", "AWS also released the Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator that enables us to perform local testing of the container image and check that it will run when deployed to Lambda.", "We can start our docker by running.", "Afterwards, in a separate terminal, we can then locally invoke the function using curl or a REST-Client.", "Beware we have to stringify our body since we passing it directly into the function (only for testing).", "Since we now have a local docker image we can deploy this to ECR. Therefore we need to create an ECR repository with the name bert-lambda.", "To be able to push our images we need to login to ECR. We are using the aws CLI v2.x. Therefore we need to define some environment variables to make deploying easier.", "Next we need to tag / rename our previously created image to an ECR format. The format for this is{AccountID}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/{repository-name}", "To check if it worked we can run docker images and should see an image with our tag as name.", "Finally, we push the image to ECR Registry.", "I provide the complete serverless.yaml for this example, but we go through all the details we need for our docker image and leave out all standard configurations. If you want to learn more about the serverless.yaml, I suggest you check out Scaling Machine Learning from ZERO to HERO. In this article, I went through each configuration and explain the usage of them.", "To use a docker image in our serverlss.yaml we have to image and in our function section. The image has the URL to our docker image also value.", "For an ECR image, the URL should look like this {AccountID}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/{repository-name}@{digest}", "In order to deploy the function, we run serverless deploy.", "After this process is done we should see something like this.", "To test our Lambda function we can use Insomnia, Postman, or any other REST client. Just add a JSON with a context and a question to the body of your request. Let\u00b4s try it with our example from the colab notebook.", "Our serverless_pipeline() answered our question correctly with 83.1.", "The first request after we deployed our docker based Lambda function took 27,8s. The reason is that AWS apparently saves the docker container somewhere on the first initial call to provide it suitably.", "I waited extra more than 15 minutes and tested it again. The cold start now took 6,7s and a warm request around 220ms.", "The release of the AWS Lambda Container Support enables much wider use of AWS Lambda and Serverless. It fixes many existing problems and gives us greater scope for the deployment of serverless applications.", "We were able to deploy a \u201cState-of-the-Art\u201d NLP model without the need to manage any server. It will automatically scale up to thousands of parallel requests without any worries. The increase of configurable Memory and vCPUs boosts this cold start even more.", "The future looks more than golden for AWS Lambda and Serverless.", "You can find the GitHub repository with the complete code here.", "Thanks for reading.
