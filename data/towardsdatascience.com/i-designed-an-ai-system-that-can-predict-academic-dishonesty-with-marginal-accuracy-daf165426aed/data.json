With COVID-19 in effect there are several institutions that shifted to online education as the platform offers both convenience and safety during a pandemic. However, in spite of the several advantages of online teaching but the system still lacks a \u2018strong\u2019 infrastructure to handle the challenges offered against in person traditional classroom.", "It is projected that online education is likely to reach $325 billion in the next 5 years", "1Individualization and its impact on the learning ability has been the focus of interest for a long time [1]. However, in the United States alone; because of the vast diversity in the classroom population, it becomes difficult for an educator to comply with a \u201cstandardized technique\u201d during planning their lesson [2]. There are various factors that can account for the effectiveness of the learning processes [3, 4]. Having experience in direct teaching and working with students as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I realized the spectrum of students and ensuring quality education is a challenge. Questionnaires have been used regularly as a tool to predict any individual\u2019s learning style [5\u20138]. Learning Analytics, which includes collection, analysis and using of those data [9] has also been suggested to improve the student\u2019s learning experience. However, in most cases, those assessments were particularly used to generalize a classroom populations overall learning pattern rather than utilizing them to compliment any individual student\u2019s learning style.", "2Apart from the element of the learning style an important criteria is academic evaluation and ensuring its integrity. According to a study published in Journal of Academic and Business Ethics, it is highlighted that online educators struggle to ensure the integrity of online student\u2019s grade. The challenges include: (i) ensuring the registered student is the one participating in exams and turning in assignments. (ii) individual assignments are not compromised during submission.", "Online recording and live proctoring are various methods adopted by most instructors during recent semesters to ensure integrity of online assessments. However, as students get creative in their approach it becomes difficult to monitor effectively. Hence an AI driven proctoring is likely to be more effective and contribute to the overall quality of institutional education.", "3 Bolte et al. investigated the effect of emotional state on the ability of intuitive judgements. The study concluded that negative mood could restrict intuitive coherence judgement. The impact of emotional distress due to a pandemic is equally likely to trigger response on learning trajectory and individual performances. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no significant study performed during such crisis or under similar stimulated environment. Understanding of the influence for changing dynamics on individual student performance can allow to effectively help develop an Artificial Intelligent (AI) System that can help improve the quality of online teaching.", "The pandemic COVID-19 has severely affected traditional or regional classroom learning . Such disruptions are more likely to become frequent interruptions with our history of notable pandemics including Black death, Spanish Flu, cholera, Bubonic plague and pandemic Influenza or if a second wave is likely to occur. One of the core delegations during pandemic includes avoiding social gathering which severely impacts the learning and assessment behavior of traditional classroom . Artificial intelligence (AI) can contribute significantly at innovating the current education system during complete or partial transition to online learning. The applied reasoning or cognitive skills and assessment procedures can be utilized at developing an advanced AI system to complement our existing deliberation. During this COVID-19 pandemic, it is probable to trigger emotional responses among student body. This can drastically influence the learning trajectory of individual students.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has gained wide popularity because of its ability to predict with marginal accuracy and complex problem solving potential .One of the several advantages of using the AI in SMART Classroom setting is its cognitive potential. The algorithm to be used in the development of the AI can eventually help to achieve the goal of personalized learning pace for students with different learning styles and ability. Lo et al. utilized multi-layer feed forward neural network (MLFF) to develop a web-based learning system with focus on student\u2019s cognitive style [10]. Curilem et al. also proposed a mathematical model for an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) based on student\u2019s behavior [11].", "Apart from the cognitive ability of an AI, the system allows the option of prediction which becomes vital for forecasting. The time series prediction using AI has been used previously in the financial industry [12\u201314] and also in the medical decision-making process [15]. Similarly, in the education industry, AI had been used for prediction of school dropouts [16] or evading e-learning classes [17].", "The concept of utilizing the architecture of AI in the SMART classroom environment will definitely improve the quality of learning in an ideal scenario. The designed architecture is intended towards engineering students attending both traditional and/ e-learning. The system hence requires modification from its initial concept design to suit the needs of a general student population attending either High School or even recently enrolled into college.", "1.3 The concept of SMART Classroom", "The concept of a SMART classroom that has the ability to utilize both hardware and software components in order to adapt to the necessities of the students [18,19], has been an area of constant research. Aguilar et al. [20] proposed that utilizing an institution\u2019s Learning Analytics in a SMART classroom environment can produce even more efficient results. The application of Wireless Sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) for analyzing social and behavioral patterns in a SMART classroom environment has also been addressed in several testing platforms [21\u201325]. Hence, with the evolving technology, it is now easier to predict the individual learning profile and therefore analyze and provide for them accordingly. This should eventually improve an individual student academic performance and his motivation to learn.", "The primary objective is to develop an advanced AI driven online learning system complementing our existing online approach. Artificial Intelligence has already been a topic adopted by most educational institution.", "Recently, Microsoft conducted a survey that highlighted the following statistics: 99.4 % agreed that AI is integral for institution\u2019s competitiveness and 92 % agreed to experiment with the technology.", "Hence building on improving our current online learning system will improve our competitiveness with other leading institutions. E-learning is the future of education, even after the pandemic is over, it is a good investment both short term and long term. It is projected that online education is likely to reach $325 billion in the next 5 years . Investment in improving this technology is likely to generate streams of potential missed revenue (both domestic and international) since regional barriers is no longer an obligation. According to a report generated by George Mason University and Skidmore College amongst several other factors one of the leading factors that contribute to student-faculty dissatisfaction at online learning includes :\u2022 \u201cRegulation and substantive student-instructor interactivity is a key determinant of quality in online education, leading to improved student satisfaction, learning and outcomes.\u201dAnother concern expressed by professors for online courses include :\u2022 \u201cBut when those students take the final exam in calculus or genetics, how will their professors know that the test takers on their distant laptops are doing their own work and not asking Mr. Google for help.\u201d", "To summarize, for any educational institute to become a global dominant leader at online education it needs to address the challenges on (i) timely and cost-effective improved feedback mechanism to students (ii) enhanced online proctoring mechanism to ensure academic honesty.", "Note: The next chapter focuses on the architecture design and flowchart to understand the model.", "[3] Sutarto, Joko. \u201cDeterminant Factors of The Effectiveness Learning Process and Learning Output of Equivalent Education.\u201d Advance in social science, education and humanities (2017).", "[4] Rahman, Roselainy Abdul, John H.
