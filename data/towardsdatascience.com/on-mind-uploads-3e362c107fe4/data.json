It\u2019s where a (future) device measures your mental state and uploads that to a computer, which then runs a simulation of your mental state and your brain\u2019s functioning following this mental state. In other words, \u201cyou\u201d are uploaded into a machine. A more technical term is Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) and apart from the very interesting technical implications, it raises some philosophical issues as well.", "One interesting consequence of using WBE is the creation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI is an Artificial Intelligence that is roughly as intelligent as humans are across their intellectual domains. Since a WBE mind is obviously as intelligent as a human, and since it is artificial in the sense that it doesn\u2019t run on biological machinery, a WBE mind is indeed an AGI. Since computations on computers are carried out orders of magnitude faster than computations in the human brain, a WBE mind might think a lot faster than humans; in that sense, it might make more sense to talk about an Artificial Superintelligence.", "People often struggle with the question of whether the simulated WBE version of you is \u201creally\u201d you or a mere \u201ccopy\u201d. The thing is, there are two possibilities with WBE.", "Destructive WBE uploads your mental state and destroys your original mental substrate in the process. In other words, it kills your body but also uploads your mind into a computer. Will \u201cyou\u201d live on in the computer? Or did your mind really die, and is there a mere copy of you living in the computer \u2014 another mind with the exact same characteristics as you, so to speak?", "This question is actually answerable with our current knowledge. You see, our mental states (including cognition, memory, consciousness, etc.) are a result of (a lot of) computations, and computations are substrate-independent (meaning they can be performed on different kinds of substrates). The computation 1 + 1 = 2 can be computed on an old mechanical calculator or on a modern computer processor; the calculation is the same. Since mental states emerge from computations, mental states are substrate-independent too. In other words, you can\u2019t tell the difference between being run on flesh (your brain) or on a computer \u2014 which is why, yes, you (meaning the \u201coriginal\u201d you) live on after your mind upload.", "This is the same thing as Destructive WBE except that your brain stays intact. This means that after the mind upload, there are two \u201ccopies\u201d of you. Like with the Destructive WBE option, you live on in the computer. But you also live on in your body! Assuming that your WBE version has ways of communication, there are now two minds with your memories, personality, characteristics, and everything that are both claiming to be you, and both are right; there is no one version more \u201creal\u201d than the other. If you think there is, I\u2019m interested to hear your reasons.", "Your home for data science.
