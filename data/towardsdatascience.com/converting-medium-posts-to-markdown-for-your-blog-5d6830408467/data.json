Markdown is a lightweight language meant to be converted into HTML for the web, and there are several tools that allow you to go from existing Medium articles to Markdown for a blog.", "(If you don\u2019t yet have a blog, then follow this guide to build your own website in five minutes using Jekyll and GitHub pages.)", "There is both a Chrome Extension and a command line tool for taking your Medium posts to Markdown. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve found the Chrome Extension to be unreliable, and if it does work, it makes a number of formatting errors that require correcting.", "If you can get the chrome extension to work and you aren\u2019t comfortable at the command line, then that is probably the best choice for you. However, I\u2019ve found the command line tool to be better for my use because it works every time, and requires fewer re-adjustments to the text after running.", "The medium-to-markdown command line package is written in Javascript which means you\u2019ll need node to run and npm to install the package. If you\u2019re on Windows, use this page to install both (it takes about 3 minutes). Then, install the package using npm install medium-to-markdown. The actual script you\u2019ll need to run is available here, and also shown below.", "To run, save the script as medium-to-markdown.js, change the \"<medium post url\"> to the address of your published post, and type node medium-to-markdown.js at the command line (making sure the script is in your directory.", "This will output the entire post as Markdown in your console. To redirect the output to a file, you can type node medium-to-markdown.js >> file.md If you\u2019re using GitHub Pages + Jekyll for your blog, you\u2019ll want to save the md file in the _posts/ directory of your repository as date-title.md .

Once the article has been converted to a properly named Markdown file, it can be published by pushing the repository to GitHub.", "Personally, I found that process of manually renaming the file tedious, so I wrote a Python script that accepts a url of a published Medium post along a date, calls the medium-to-markdown.js conversion script with the url, and saves the resulting markdown with the correct file name. The script can be found here, and the command line usage is below:", "Overall, it takes 15 seconds to run the script and about 5 minutes for the website to update! Go to your blog to see the article rendered.", "Both the Chrome Extension and Command line tool create minor issues in the Markdown that you\u2019ll have to fix. I do all my editing in the Prose online editor and like to pull up the editor and the original Medium article side-by-side.(I also frequently use the Chrome development tools \u2014 right click and inspect \u2014 on my blog to adjust the css and see the changes immediately. )", "Following are a few of the issues I\u2019ve noticed and how to fix them. I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re working with GitHub Pages and Jekyll for your blog (follow this guide to get started) although these tips may work with other frameworks. These solutions are not exhaustive, so if you run into any more problems, let me know in the comments or on Twitter.", "As you can see above, the default conversion to Markdown renders image captions left-justified below the image.

If you want to do something on your blog, chances are there\u2019s a way to get it done. For example, you can add comments to all of your posts by making a Disqus account and adding it to your _config.yaml file (guide here). If you have a lot of posts and want to limit the number that appear on one page, you can specify that as well using pagination in the config file (instructions).", "Building a website is exciting because you are able to make it look however you want! Although this might not seem amazing to most people, I still appreciate when I make a minor update to my site and I can see the changes online just as I intended. You can\u2019t imagine how enthusiastic I was when I finally got a live code editor running on my about page! At the end of the day, yes, building a website is about putting yourself out there for the world to see, but it\u2019s also about taking pride in something you created.", "Going from an existing Medium article to Markdown can be done quickly using a command line tool. There are a few minor errors that need to be addressed after converting to Markdown, but this also gives you the chance to customize the post exactly how you want.", "If you are still stuck on any points, take a look through my website repository to see if you can find a solution there, or get in contact with me. Moreover, if you find something cool that you can do with a Jekyll blog, I\u2019d enjoy hearing about it.
