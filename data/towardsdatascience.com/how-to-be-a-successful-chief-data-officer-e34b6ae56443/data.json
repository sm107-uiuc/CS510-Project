The CDO role is evolving, gaining significant traction in the industry, and its success is imperative to driving growth and innovation charter for an organization. CDOs must evolve their role from defensive data strategy to offensive data strategy, embrace their roles as change-agents, and take charge of driving value for their organizations. That is the recipe for success.", "While the CDO role is maturing, many CDOs are failing. A recent Gartner study predicts that 50% of CDOs will fail due to numerous internal and external factors. Most external factors are non-controllable so, it is important to be aware of key internal impediments to success.", "\u25cf Level of the role: The title \u201cChief\u201d implies that the role reports into the c-suites but many CDOs don\u2019t. They don\u2019t have the seniority, decision-making authority, and political clout to be able to drive enterprise data strategies.", "\u25cf Role clarity and restrictions: There is still no consistency in the definition of the CDO role, and the expectations of the role are dependent on the data maturity of the organization. A direct consequence of this issue is the restrictions that are placed on the role itself.", "\u25cf Lack of funding and resources: Not placing the CDO role high enough in the organization with its own dedicated budget impacting investment in tools, technologies, and people.", "\u25cf Company culture and resistance to change: The CDO is a disruptive change management role, and not everyone or every company adapts to change well. On top of that, any new \u201cchief\u201d role in the company brings political dynamics with it and depending on where the role is placed, it could create political issues with CIO and CTO.", "As the organizations are maturing and looking at the CDOs to co-lead growth charters, CDOs should first assess the data maturity of their organization and then drive value to their organizations by:", "\u25cf Data Management: This is the table-stakes of the CDO role and addresses data mastering, data quality, upkeep, protection, and governance. Management of data as an enterprise asset, or corporate currency, and building trust in the data is a critical element and everything else hinges on it", "\u25cf Data Enrichment and Enablement: Find ways to utilize existing data towards business results and augment them with additional internal and external data. Start small and build up with each success (and failure). Ensure data availability for analytics across the organization, including actionable insights anemic functions like HR, and Finance", "\u25cf Data Monetization: Identify ways to earn revenue from the data. Create an innovation charter, experiment, build prototypes, evangelize and enable advanced analytics like Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and develop data products as enterprise intellectual properties and competitive advantage", "The advent of new commerce and digital transformation has made organizations increasingly reliant on data \u2014 from in-the-moment transactional sense and respond to defining long term growth strategies. Many organizations that have not embraced this new reality have failed and continue to struggle, e.g., Sears. Marketplace differentiation and consumer-centricity are being led by data and analytics. As organizations began to realize that data is their corporate currency and that it needs to be managed as an asset, the role of Chief Data Officer was introduced.", "The focus of this assessment is on organizations that are digitally non-native and that were not started from the ground up to maximize the potential of data and analytics as critical drivers of their business model, e.g., Amazon, Google, Facebook, Airbnb, etc. In those organizations, the role of CDO as a figure-head generally doesn\u2019t exist and data stewardship, and driving business value with data and analytics is a foundational element and part of everyday business reality.", "Chief Data Officer means different things to different organizations. In some organizations, risk, compliance, and regulation may be behind the creation of the role with a relatively narrow and deep focus. In other organizations, it could be much broader and inclusive of enterprise data and analytics and a driver of revenue generation, or it could be a response to business model disruption and the need to drive innovation. In essence, the role of the CDO has to be tied to the organizational maturity around their strategy for data. Gartner has described the evolution of the CDO role in four categories:", "CDO1.0: Exclusively focused on data management", "CDO4.0: Monetization with a focus on data products", "In concurrence with the evolution of the data strategy, analytics has also been evolving. According to the research conducted by Thomas Davenport, analytics has gone through the following steps of evolution:", "Analytics 1.0: Era of traditional business intelligence", "Analytics 2.0: Era of big data", "Analytics 3.0: Era of data-enriched offerings for fast economy", "Analytics 4.0: Era of cognitive consumer-controlled data", "This creates a challenge for CDOs: where to begin and where to focus? The CDO\u2019s role is also a cross-functional change management role that creates its own internal challenges from organizational alignment and political perspectives. In fact, Gartner predicts that about 50% of CDOs will fail. In Gartner\u2019s 2017 CDO survey, cultural inertia and data literacy were reported to be the top reasons for lack of success.", "This assessment aligns well with the research conducted by New Vantage Partners to identify impediments to the business adoption of analytics.", "A typical day in a CDO\u2019s intake pipeline could include:", "\u25cf Marketing\u2019s demand for campaign performance reports at the consumer aggregate level", "\u25cf Sales saying that the numbers are wrong and can\u2019t be trusted", "\u25cf CFO saying that multiple versions of topline KPIs were reported to them and they need to determine the one that is correct", "\u25cf Business intelligence team saying that they don\u2019t have enough resources and tools", "\u25cf CTO saying that they have decided to migrate data from on-premise systems to the cloud", "It may seem that immediately addressing these issues should be the focus of the CDO, but that would be the wrong approach as this would only exacerbate the concerns around the focus. Much of the tactical work can be undertaken by existing data teams with an agile or tiger-team based approach but CDO must focus on setting up the strategic vision for the function and getting enterprise-wide buy-in.", "First and foremost, CDO\u2019s must embrace their role as change agents and understand that it is a cross-functional responsibility and requires organizational savvy to build alliances and partnerships. Gaining an understanding of how the organization operates is critical. This should lead to the creation of a vision for the function that is culturally-grounded and tied to the corporate mission.", "Next, the CDO must develop an organizational structure that is designed to drive adoption with an engagement model that cuts across multiple layers of hierarchy in business units. The CDO should evaluate centralized vs. decentralized vs. hybrid organizational structure based on the speed of transformation and the political environment of the organization \u2014 better to build trust and collaboration than an empire.", "CDOs should also be proponents of human-centered design, design sprints, and agile methods and create multi-disciplinary agile teams with the domain-experts or the business unit user in the center. This allows for adoption to be part of the initiative from the discovery and design stage onward. An important role to lead these agile teams should be a data translator/evangelist who can communicate effectively in both data and strategy languages.", "A key factor to consider here would be the degree of transformation the CDO wants to lead and how fast they want to go forward. These ambitions should be matched with organizational readiness for change and support of the CEO. CHAOS report from The Standish Group shows that starting with large initiatives has a higher likelihood of failure.", "Identify and focus on winnable problems. Don\u2019t get too ambitious at the get-go, and land the fundamentals first. Balance potentially longer-term initiatives with shorter time-frame projects and deliver components early and often, with increasing rates of success and incrementally higher value. CDOs should measure the productivity and success of their organization on value, not volume. A communication strategy honed in transparent value-driven storytelling to enterprise leaders would incrementally build reputation and trust in the organization.", "Addressing these fundamentals of the organizational strategy would lead to the development of CDO\u2019s organizational charter and set the organization for success.", "Let\u2019s now explore three ways that CDOs can drive value for their organizations.", "Many CDO organizations have their beginning in this domain (DataOps). This is a core area of responsibility for the CDO and must be managed as such. Without mastered, well-groomed, well-governed, and secure data, everything else is moot. This isn\u2019t just an area of sustainment, but an area of innovation that will continue to challenge the CDO organizations. For example, determining how best to store and retrieve high-dimension high-cardinality longitudinal time-series data, or mastering consumer data in the age of GDPR to effectively drive consumer engagement strategies. Some of the value drivers that CDO must focus on:", "\u25cf Protect and secure corporate data as an asset and manage risk and compliance", "\u25cf Reduce exposure of sensitive data with advanced governance principles", "\u25cf Strategies for a single source of truth vs. multiple sources of truth", "\u25cf Evolution of data architecture and systems to stay ahead of the pace of the market", "\u25cf Continuously evaluate and apply lean DataOps methods to deliver high value at a lower cost", "\u25cf Establish high standards of data quality to eliminate the risk of \u201cgarbage-in-garbage-out\u201d", "Recommendation 2: Data Enrichment and Enablement", "CDOs must do a comprehensive assessment of the existing data, catalog them, and create metadata. This will allow for a better understanding of the data by the end-users and can also be leveraged to create organizational data literacy. Then explore, what and how much more can the organization do with the existing data. Start with deriving \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d successes, and build from it. Continue to assess gaps in the existing data and supplement, and augment with external sources and partners. As existing data is leveraged to drive organizational value, it will ease requests for additional funding for data augmentation and enrichment strategies. Additionally, democratize data access across business units to earn more advocates. Show love to data anemic organizations like HR and Finance, and earn advocacy from these powerful business functions as they own critical decisions on resources and budgets.", "Take an evolutionary approach to incrementally develop a \u201csystem of insights\u201d that has to integrate data silos and serve as the system of clean-governed-augmented data that will continue to drive organizational value. Augment with finance and sales data to create dashboards to measure impact on topline KPIs delivered to the organization.", "Data monetization is essentially an extension of data enrichment, leverage, and enablement. CDOs must focus on finding new avenues of earnings and revenue opportunities outside of the existing processes and functions. This will require challenging existing business models and gaining organizational allies through evangelization to push for innovation, and from a project orientation to product orientation. CDOs must create space for product innovation, either within their organization or in partnerships with other complementary organizations", "\u25cf Enable organizational mindset shift from data being a byproduct of business to it having intrinsic monetary value: treat data as the currency of the organization", "\u25cf Add focus outside of current projects that increase existing revenue or reduce cost", "\u25cf Identify new revenue streams with data products, e.g., a merchant services provider can license aggregated insights to their business customers via a SaaS insights portal", "\u25cf Think outside the realm of data and analytics and approach this as an exercise in innovation. Lead with human-centered design, identify potentially valuable ideas, prototype them, ruthlessly iterate, test and learn, and scale-up once value-drivers are established. The framework below can be applied to establish a human-centered product development life cycle (PDLC) process", "\u25cf Don\u2019t go for it alone. Bring strategic finance, corporate strategy, and the rest of the C-suite along this journey as collaborative partners", "\u25cf Identify the opportunities to push the boundaries of analytics, and build AI and Machine Learning based intellectual properties as a competitive advantage", "Approaching the Chief Data Officer role with the framework prescribed here allows the CDO to take lead in making the best data, from within and outside the organization, available in a secure and well-governed environment.
