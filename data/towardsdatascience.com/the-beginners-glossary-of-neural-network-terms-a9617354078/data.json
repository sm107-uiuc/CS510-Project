The field has a steep learning curve, as most concepts are intertwined and complementary. To make things worse, most newcomers have little to no machine learning background, making the task even harder. In this article, I break down some of field\u2019s most important concepts in a sequential manner, linking each new term to the last.", "Let\u2019s start with the definition of\u2026", "Intelligence: So far, no commonly accepted definition for intelligence exists. The definition is an on-going debate that spans a wide range of fields and disciplines, such as philosophy, psychology, sociology, and computer science. However, although no definition is widely accepted, science has been trying to mimic intelligence for decades, creating\u2026", "Artificial Intelligence (AI): The field within Computer Science that studies \u201cintelligent behavior\u201d in machines. In other words, systems that behave in non-trivially predictable ways. Systems that react and (appear to) reason about themselves and the world around them. This definition is vague as we can\u2019t even define intelligence properly. However, something that we can define is learning, which brings us to\u2026", "Machine Learning (ML): The task of showing the inputs and outputs of a problem to an algorithm and letting it learn how to solve it. For instance, to create an algorithm that recognizes dogs and cats in pictures by showing it hundreds of photos of pets. Within, ML, a growing approach is:", "Deep Learning (DL): The idea of stacking multiple learning algorithms to jointly solve a difficult task. When we are kids, we learn the alphabet, then we learn to read simple words, then full sentences, etc. With practice, we are reading books and forming opinions. In between letters and fluency, several learning steps are involved. In imitation, Deep learning algorithms approach learning by breaking the task down into sequential problems, each one building an increased level of abstraction.", "In practice, DL and ML algorithms are frequently the tools of choice for\u2026", "Data Science (DS): The study of data, such as acquisition, cleaning, storing, viewing, and processing data. A common misconception is that DL and DS are the same things, as many DS courses feature DL prominently. ML and DL are tools for the data scientist, as is SQL, NumPy and, etc.", "Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Cognitive Computing: This area is full of lesser-known synonyms, and confusing terms. Some seem to only exist to sound new and fresh, some make reference to specific tasks within DS. For instance, \u201canalytics\u201d usually refers to exploratory analysis while \u201cengineering\u201d refers to implementing systems for production use. Stick to the widely used terms whenever in doubt, such as \u201cdata science\u201d.", "Artificial Neural Network (NN): Among several ways of implementing deep learning, neural networks are by far the most popular. In short, they are a stack of simple learning algorithms (called layers) that sequentially process the input, producing an output. This embodies the idea of deep learning by design, as each layer learns a more refined understanding of the input.", "Network Layers: All neural networks are made up of layers (as shown in the image above). A layer defines an operation that takes some inputs, some parameters, and produces a set of outputs. For instance, the\u2026", "Dense Layer: Is the layer that receives a vector (input) and multiplies it by a matrix (parameters), producing another vector (outputs). While this is one of the most widely used layers in practice, it has a problem, it is:", "Linear: Something is linear when it can be decomposed as independent parts, this makes them easy to study. However, a linear system is no more interesting than the parts that make it. \u201cA+B\u201d is no more interesting than \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d themselves. This is opposed by:", "Non-Linear: A system is non-linear when its parts are intertwined as a complex whole. A non-linear system cannot be easily factored. Hence, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. For instance, \u201csine(A + B)\u201d cannot be broken down into \u201cA\u201d terms and \u201cB\u201d terms. Thankfully, any linear system can be made non-linear by means of an\u2026", "Activation Function: These are ordinary non-linear functions used in DL that have the sole purpose of receiving input and making it non-linear. In the above example, we made \u201cA + B\u201d non-linear by using the sine function. Within DL, the most famous activation function is the:", "ReLU: Short of Rectified Linear Unity, defined as ReLU(x) = max(0, x). This is one of the simplest (and most efficient) ways of making something non-linear. That\u2019s why it is so popular: it is simple and fast. Combining dense layers and ReLU activations, we can build a\u2026", "Dense Network / Fully-Connected Network / Multi-Layer Perceptron: These are all synonyms for the basic neural network: a collection of dense layers interleaved with activation functions. It is important to highlight that, without activation functions, a network would be no more interesting than a single dense layer. The non-linearities are the glue that creates a powerful model out of ordinary parts.", "Out of the synonyms for neural networks, one has historical significance\u2026", "Perceptron Model: In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt created a computational model of a neuron: the perceptron, which is the basis for most of what came afterward. Simply put, the perceptron is a weighted sum followed by an activation function. Formally, P(x; w) = a(x \u22c5 w). This means the perceptron receives an \u201cx\u201d vector, has a set of weights \u201cw\u201d, and computes the dot product of \u201cx\u201d with \u201cw\u201d (the weighted sum) and feeds it to \u201ca\u201d, the activation function.", "Dense Layer (revisited): If an input is fed to many perceptrons at once, as in the figure above, we can simplify the math by \u201cjoining\u201d the weights of each perceptron as a matrix, creating the dense layer: D(x; W) = a(x \u22c5 W). Using this definition, we can build a two-layers network by feeding the result of a dense layer into another, such as: D(D(x;W\u2081);W\u2082) = a(a(x \u22c5 W\u2081)\u22c5W\u2082). This showcases an important notion: neural networks are just math functions.", "In this expression, what we haven\u2019t given attention to yet are the\u2026", "Weights: Machine learning models define an \u201coperation\u201d that is guided by a set of \u201cweights\u201d. By changing a model\u2019s weights, we are able to make it do different things. For instance, we might train the same network to recognize cats and dogs or birds and fishes. What changes are the weights, not the network. This brings us to\u2026", "Training: The actual \u201clearning\u201d is performed by the training loop. In simplified terms, training means to feed inputs to a model, collect its outputs, compare them with the expected outputs, and change the weights to make to correct the outputs. The main component of this process is the\u2026", "Loss Function: The loss, or error, is a function that measures the \u201cwrongness\u201d of the model. In practice, all we want is to reduce the loss of our models. In other words, we want them to be as correct as possible. To accomplish that, we use a mathematical tool known as\u2026", "Gradient Descent: Given a model \u201cM\u201d, its weights \u201c\u03b8\u201d, the inputs \u201cx\u201d, the expected outputs \u201cy\u201d and a loss function \u201cL\u201d, we can optimize the weights to reduce the loss function by considering the gradient of \u201cL(y, M(x; \u03b8))\u201d, known as \u201c\u2207L\u201d. This \u201c\u2207L\u201d indicates how the loss changes as \u03b8 changes. Hence, to reduce the loss we subtract \u2207L from \u03b8. This process creates an \u201cimproved \u03b8\u201d. If we repeat this process over and over, we get\u2026", "Epochs: Each time we train our model with every data example we have, we complete an \u201cepoch\u201d. Models are typically trained for tens to hundreds of epochs until their losses are reduced to tiny values.", "Backpropagation: The above procedure is quite complicated if you are not familiar with the math, yet, I presented a simplified version of it. The complete version is known as backpropagation and has the added complexity that each layer has its own gradient (instead of a single gradient for the whole model, as presented). In this context, some good terms to know are:", "SGD / RMSprop / Adam / Nadam / Radam / Ranger / etc: These are optimizers: algorithms that enhance backpropagation to make it faster and better. Understanding these methods is an advanced topic. In practice, everyone uses Adam 95% of the time. Another useful term to know is\u2026", "Learning Rate: During training, it works best to update weights in baby steps. While this seems counter-intuitive, it improves convergence. Common values are 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001. The learning rate is often a parameter of the optimizer. Another common practice during training is to divide it in\u2026", "Batches: We often have more data than we can fit in memory or in GPU. Thus, we cannot compute the gradient for all examples we have. Instead, we can compute it for a small subset (a batch) and apply it. For instance, a thousand examples can be divided into sixteen batches of 64 elements, yielding sixteen training gradients.", "That\u2019s all for now. If you are serious about learning deep learning, many other terms were left out of this (brief) summary. In particular, I did not venture into the magical world of convolutional neural networks, which has many many names, such as convolutions, poolings, blocks, and several widely popular architectures, such as ResNets, MobileNets, InceptionNets and so on.", "Several of these terms also reveal an entire world of possibilities. While I discussed what a loss function is, we didn\u2019t even scratch the surface of how many of them exist. The same goes for activation functions.", "As mentioned in the beginning, this article is meant as an introduction, covering most of the fundamental aspects in which everything else is built upon.
