In other words, their calculations, which isolate team performance by adjusting for contextual factors such as strength of schedule and back-to-backs, and separate the performance of a team\u2019s goaltenders from their skaters, led to the conclusion that if you replaced every single skater on the Minnesota Wild with a replacement level player (an easily replaced player that falls below the 13th forward, 7th defenseman, or 2nd goaltender on their team\u2019s chart), then their goal differential would drop by a larger number than it would if you did the same thing to every other team in the NHL. To put this all more concisely: by this model, outside of goaltending, the Minnesota Wild were the NHL\u2019s best team in the 2019\u201320 regular season.", "If you\u2019re unfamiliar with goals above replacement, I\u2019ll lay out some quick groundwork: it\u2019s a highly effective model made by EvolvingWild that allows us to improve our player evaluation by isolating a player\u2019s individual contributions from various external factors such as competition, teammates, and usage, and then comparing their contributions to those of a typical replacement level player and determining how much value they\u2019ve added. The model is built from the ground up at the individual player level, and team values are merely aggregated player values, but the statistic is also fine for use at the team level. Since 2007\u20132008, teams with more regular season goals above replacement have won 60.5% of their playoff series, while teams with higher regular season standings rankings have won only 55.9% of their series, which shows the model has solid predictive power even though it is built to be descriptive in nature. I won\u2019t go into further detail, but it\u2019s a great model that arguably a better \u201ccatch-all\u201d snapshot of a player\u2019s value than any other hockey stat that currently exists. You can read about it in more detail from this 3-part series authored by the model\u2019s creators:", "Now, back to the Wild. It may seem a bit surprising that their skaters ranked first in goals above replacement, considering they also ranked 19th in goal differential and 21st in points percentage. If we assume that the model is valid and accurate \u2014 which I\u2019m comfortable doing \u2014 then the discrepancy here between model output and real-life standings results can only be explained by two factors:", "According to the model itself, it\u2019s mostly the latter. Their goaltenders ranked dead last with 6.8 goals below replacement. This means that if you took a typical 3rd string goalie and put them in net for the Wild, their goal differential would\u2019ve improved by about seven goals. This is far worse than the second-worst set of goaltenders, which belonged to the Detroit Red Wings and contributed 1.2 goals below replacement. These numbers aren\u2019t exactly easy to reconcile by save percentage; Minnesota\u2019s goaltenders had a combined save percentage of 90.25%, while Detroit\u2019s goaltenders had a combined save percentage of 89.36%. So, how is it that Evolving Hockey calculated that Detroit had significantly better goaltenders?", "The answer lies in shot quality adjustments. Evolving Hockey calculates the probability of a shot on goal or missed shot becoming a goal based on various factors such as reported distance from the net (the most important factor by far), reported angle from the net, and game strength to calculate the probability of each shot becoming a goal, and assigns that shot an \u201cexpected goal\u201d value based on the probability of it becoming a goal. (To give an example, a dangerous shot with a 35% chance of becoming a goal would have an expected goal value of 0.35.) Their calculations found that the average shot faced by Minnesota\u2019s goaltenders was significantly less likely to be a goal than the average shot faced by Detroit\u2019s goaltenders \u2014 so much so that when you adjust for the quality of these shots, Detroit\u2019s goaltenders come out looking far better despite their inferior save percentages. Intuitively, this makes sense. We know that the biggest factor that determines the probability of a shot becoming a goal is distance from the net. We also know that the reported distance of the average shot on goal that Detroit\u2019s goaltenders faced was 32.2 feet from the net, while the reported distance of the average shot on goal that Minnesota\u2019s goaltenders faced was 36.69 feet from the net. So, there you have it: the Wild just need better goaltending, and they\u2019ll be the best team in the league. Right?", "Well, not exactly. While it\u2019s true that Minnesota goaltenders faced, on average, easier shots than Detroit\u2019s goaltenders faced, it\u2019s also true that the stats I just listed may not describe what actually happened. If you closely re-read the prior paragraph, you\u2019ll see that I was careful to specify that this was the reported distance of each shot on goal. I make this distinction because I have ample reason to believe that the scorekeepers at Xcel Energy Center (Minnesota\u2019s home arena) reported that those shots on goal were taken slightly further from the net than they actually were, and that these scorekeepers do the same for shots that miss the net.", "Note: For the remainder of this article, I will use the term \u201cshot\u201d to refer to not only shots on goal, but also shots that miss the net. These shots are known by the analytics community as Fenwicks (named after analyst Matt Fenwick), and I use them instead of shots on goal because I believe that forcing shots wide and hitting the net with shots are skills that goaltenders and skaters respectively possess, and I wish to credit those who display proficiency in these skills and punish those who do not.", "Now, back to the Wild: It may seem harsh to accuse Minnesota\u2019s scorekeepers of doing their job poorly, but there\u2019s simply too much evidence to just brush it aside. Over every single one of the past thirteen NHL seasons, the average reported shot distance in Minnesota home games at both ends of the ice has been significantly further from the net than the average reported distance in their away games. Here are the numbers for every one of those seasons displayed alongside league average to give you an idea of the distribution:", "On the road, Minnesota\u2019s style of play has wavered back and forth between playing a bit closer to the perimeter than league average and playing a bit closer to the net than league average, but there\u2019s never been a huge discrepancy. Throughout the entirety of this time, the average of reported shot distances for Minnesota\u2019s away games is 34.69 feet, while the average of reported shot distances in all NHL games is\u202634.69 feet. By comparison, the average of reported shot distances in Minnesota\u2019s home games is 37.27 feet.", "This isn\u2019t just some one-off occurrence; this phenomenon has persisted year after year over a sample size of over 500 home games, over 500 away games, and over 15,000 total NHL games.", "One valid counter-argument to the erroneous scorekeeping hypothesis is that the Wild just play a different style at home than they do on the road. Perhaps they clamp down and take fewer risks at home where they feel they\u2019re able to control the flow of the game, but they play into their opponent\u2019s more typical style on the road. This is possible, but it\u2019s also very unlikely that this trend would persist across thirteen straight seasons. It becomes even less likely when you consider that the Wild have had four general managers and six different head coaches in charge over this sample, with each of them likely deploying different strategies. In every one of these seasons, regardless of who has been in charge of the team, the average shot distance in their away games has never deviated more than 1.5 feet from league average in either direction, while the average shot distance in their home games has always been over 1.5 feet above league average. So, while we can\u2019t be 100% certain that Minnesota\u2019s scorekeepers track shot data incorrectly, it is significantly more plausible and requires significantly fewer assumptions than any other conclusion. With that in mind, I will be moving forward with the assumption that Minnesota\u2019s scorekeepers do exhibit a pattern of erroneously tracking shots further from the net than they actually are, and I\u2019m going to refer to this pattern of behavior as \u201cscorekeeper bias.\u201d", "Now that we\u2019ve laid out the groundwork for scorekeeper bias, and agreed to work forward under the assumption that it does exist, the next question is how exactly this plays into Evolving Hockey\u2019s goals above replacement ranking of the Minnesota Wild. The answer to that question is defense. At the skater level, the defensive components of this metric are mostly quantified through expected goals against, and as we\u2019ve covered, the most component of that stat is the reported shot distance of shots that are allowed. If Minnesota\u2019s scorekeepers report shots are further from the net than they actually are, then the expected goal values of the shots that their skaters allow will be lower than the \u201ctrue\u201d probability of those shots becoming goals, and therefore it will appear that these skaters are doing a better job of suppressing expected goals than they actually are.", "Here\u2019s another way of visualizing it: imagine an opposing player takes a shot in the slot. If this shot is properly recorded, an expected goal model may calculate that it has a 25% probability of scoring, and the shot would be assigned a corresponding expected goal value of 0.25. But, if Minnesota\u2019s scorekeepers register this as a shot from outside of the circle, the expected goal model may use the reported distance to calculate that it only has a 10% chance of scoring, and the shot would only be assigned an expected goal value of 0.1. This would inaccurately flatter the defensive performance of Minnesota\u2019s skaters by suggesting that they allowed a less dangerous shot than they actually did. And, if Minnesota\u2019s goaltender allowed a goal on that shot, they would be erroneously be credited with 0.9 goals below expected, rather than 0.75 goals below expected. This doesn\u2019t sound like much, but over the course of a season, or the course of many seasons, it adds up to a very significant number:", "As you can see, Minnesota has absolutely been plagued by poor goaltending. But this issue is being compounded by scorekeeper bias, which isn\u2019t present when they play on the road.", "What about offense? Minnesota\u2019s home & away splits in the tables above display shots for both teams, which means Minnesota\u2019s scorekeepers also report that shots taken by the Wild at home are further from the net than they actually are. So, it follows logically that the expected goal values for Minnesota\u2019s shots would also be inaccurately low, and therefore their offensive ability to generate dangerous shots should be overrated to roughly the same degree that their defensive ability to suppress dangerous shots is overrated, right? The same visualization from above, looking at goals scored, rather than saved, above expected at home and away supports this:", "As you can see, Minnesota\u2019s skaters look like elite shooters at home, but slightly below average shooters on the road. Logically speaking, one may suspect that these issues essentially balance one another out. And they sort of do; the expected goals on both sides of the ice are equally balanced out. But unlike defense, goals above replacement measures offensive contribution using actual goals, not expected goals. And since the NHL reviews every single goal to ensure it entered the net, scorekeeper bias will not be at play for actual goals. Theoretically speaking, if the Wild display average goal-scoring proficiency, it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not they did so through poor quality shot volume and excellent shooting or the opposite; their offensive goals above replacement will be that of an average team.", "Minnesota wasn\u2019t actually an average offensive team this season, though. They were significantly above average. This may surprise you (it surprised me), but Minnesota actually ranked fifth in 5-on-5 goals per hour and tenth in power play goals per hour. This is right in line with their rankings in goals above replacement: fifth in the even strength offense component and ninth in the power play offense component. Given this information, I\u2019m comfortable saying that this model is giving their offense a fair shake, and that defense is the only issue with this particular model.", "Before we move on, let\u2019s remember where we started: Evolving Hockey\u2019s goals above replacement is a highly effective evaluation metric which states that in the 2019\u20132020 NHL regular season, the Minnesota Wild had the best skaters in the league and the worst goaltenders in the league. But we have reason to believe with very strong confidence that the scorekeepers at Minnesota\u2019s home arena have consistently reported that shots are slightly further from the net than they actually are, and we know that if they are doing this, then goals above replacement will overrate the defensive performance of Minnesota\u2019s skaters at the cost of their goaltenders, with no penalty to their offense.", "While I have focused exclusively on the scorekeepers at XCel Energy Center, they are not the only ones that exhibit scorekeeper bias. They aren\u2019t even the worst offenders. Historically, the worst offender by far has been the scorekeepers at Madison Square Garden who do the opposite of Minnesota\u2019s scorekeepers and report that shots are closer to the net than they are, and who are somehow even less accurate than Minnesota\u2019s scorekeepers. Additionally, while Madison Square Garden has actually improved their issues over the past two seasons, Minnesota still hasn\u2019t even had the largest discrepancy between their home and away shot distances.", "As you can see, the absolute value of the difference between average shot distance at home and away is actually larger for the Philadelphia Flyers who play their home games at Wells Fargo Center than it is for the Wild. Dallas, Anaheim, and Chicago are also all close. Could it be that most rinks are prone to some degree of scorekeeper bias? The following visualization suggests this may be the case:", "As you can see, teams show far more variance in average shot distance when they\u2019re playing at home than they do on the road. On the road, the average shot distance for every team falls in between a tight area of 32.5 feet and 35.5 feet, while at home, teams fall between a much larger area of 30.5 feet and 37.5 feet. In addition, the variance for home distance is 2.06 feet, while the variance for away distance is only 0.31 feet!", "So, it\u2019s fair to say that the Xcel Energy Center in Minnesota probably isn\u2019t the only rink that suffers from scorekeeper bias. I think it makes sense, logically, that human error is at play here, and that most scorekeepers do things slightly different from other scorekeepers. In a perfect world, we would have scorekeepers traveling to different arenas in order to randomize this issue, but this world is not a perfect one, and doing so would incur major travel costs, so we must make do with the data that we have.", "I should also point out that I\u2019m not the only person who has identified this, and I\u2019m far from the first. I was ten years old in 2007 when Alan Ryder released \u201cProduct Recall Notice for \u2018Shot Quality\u2019\u201d where he introduced this issue and stated:", "we clearly have an issue of RTSS scorer bias. The problem appears to be brutal at Madison Square Garden but is clearly non-trivial elsewhere. The NHL needs a serious look at the consistency of this process.", "Many other hockey analysts have identified that this is an issue, and provided additional evidence to support their position. It is quite clear that scorekeeper bias in the NHL is a true phenomenon.", "Now that we\u2019ve established that scorekeeper bias in XCel Energy Center exists, explained how it leads us to inaccurately evaluate the Minnesota Wild\u2019s skaters and goaltenders, and established that XCel Energy Center isn\u2019t the only arena that scorekeeper bias exists, it only logically follows that many other skaters and goaltenders may be overrated or underrated due to scorekeeper bias. For example, the average shot in Anaheim Ducks games at Honda Center over the past two years is reportedly 2.56 feet closer to the net than the average shot in an Anaheim Ducks away game over this sample. If this figure is actually the result of shot distance being inaccurately reported, then it logically follows that Anaheim\u2019s defensive performance will be underrated, and that their goaltending will be overrated. The same thing is true for Dallas, and the same thing is true in reverse for Philadelphia. The bottom line here is that scorekeeper bias leads us to some inaccurate skater and goaltender evaluations, especially in the case of goals above replacement.", "How do we fix this? Well, I don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t make the model, and it\u2019s not for me to decide how to fix something that I consider an issue. It\u2019s not even up to me to decide that it is an issue or that it needs to be fixed. What I\u2019m aiming to do here is simply provide an estimate as to how much the effects of scorekeeper bias may be misrepresenting what skaters and goaltenders actually do on the ice, and allow us to keep those estimated effects in mind when analyzing Evolving Hockey\u2019s goals above replacement and other advanced hockey statistics that use expected goals and do not account for the effects of scorekeeper bias.", "In order to do this, I\u2019m going to do three things:", "The end goal of this process will be to provide one point estimate of a skater\u2019s isolated offensive, defensive, and net impact using reported shot distance, one point estimate of a player\u2019s isolated offensive, defensive, and net impact using adjusted shot distance, and then display them side-by-side in order to provide an estimate of how adjusting for scorekeeper bias may affect a player or team\u2019s isolated impact according to one of these models. I also wish to do the same for goaltenders, providing one point estimate of a goaltender\u2019s isolated performance using reported shot distance and one point estimate of a goaltender\u2019s isolated performance using adjusted shot distance. It is my hypothesis that goaltenders such as Minnesota\u2019s Alex Stalock and Devan Dubnyk, pictured in this article\u2019s featured image, will look significantly better after adjusting for scorekeeper bias.", "In part 2, I will go over this process.
