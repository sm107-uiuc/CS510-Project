AlphaZero learns to master the game by playing against itself (self-play) and learning from those experiences.", "We will leverage a \u201csimplified, highly flexible, commented, and easy to understand implementation\u201d Python version of AlphaZero from Surag Nair available in Github.", "You can go ahead and play the game here. The WebApp and JavaScript implementation are available here. This code was ported from this Python implementation.", "Dots and Boxes is an elementary child\u2019s game with a surprising level of complexity in it.", "Two players take turns to place a horizontal or vertical line between two adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1\u00d71 box scores one point and gets another turn. The game ends when the board is full, and the player with the most points wins.", "We have pondered for a long time if machines can demonstrate intelligence. How to validate the machine\u2019s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior? A typical way has been playing board games, like Chess, and attempting to gain superhuman behavior to defeat world champions.", "In 1957, Herbert Simon predicted that a computer system would beat the world chess champion in ten years. It took much longer than that, but in May 1997, a computer defeated the Chess world champion, Garry Kasparov.", "Despite the remarkable milestone, one can argue whether this computer system was \u201cintelligent\u201d.", "These computer systems are composed of three elements:", "The evaluation function would take the board as an input and return the board\u2019s \u201cvalue\u201d. A high value indicates a very favorable position for the current player. For example, a chessboard configuration where the player is about to do Checkmate would have a very high value.", "Game tree search algorithms (like Minimax) search across all possible moves looking for the one that would guarantee a path to a board configuration with a high value. The search can be made efficient by not visiting configurations where we know that we won\u2019t find a better value. That\u2019s what Alpha\u2013beta pruning does.", "Finally, add very powerful hardware, and you would have a machine capable of defeating a world champion.", "What\u2019s the catch? Experienced players manually craft these evaluation functions. These systems would rely on openings books indicating the best-known moves. The middle game would use evaluation functions created by studying games from grandmasters. Then grandmasters would further fine-tune them.", "For example, we could create an Evaluation Function for the Dots and Boxes game. A reasonable and straightforward evaluation function would be to compare the score. The higher the positive delta in the score, the more favorable the board game is. In most cases, that would work. However, in the Dots and Boxes game, like in many board games, the best moves can involve sacrificing in the short-term to have better gains in the long-term. In the Dots and Boxes game, sometimes it\u2019s better not to score a box to avoid gaining another turn, and instead, force the move back to the opponent. We would then have to tune our evaluation function to consider an increasing number of complex scenarios!", "The evaluation function that defeated Kasparov had 8,000 features! And the large majority of those features were created and tuned by hand!", "So, without belittling an important milestone like defeating a chess world champion, an undesirable aspect was the need to have top-ranked players define these computers\u2019 behavior and manually tweak so many variables.", "AlphaZero is the first computer system capable of gaining superhuman behavior at games like Chess or Go, defeating world champions, bootstrapped with only the game\u2019s rules and without human domain knowledge.", "Given only the rules of the game, AlphaZero would start playing against itself. Learning, little by little, strategies and techniques, gaining relatively quickly superhuman behavior.", "Whereas systems like DeepBlue would require chess experts\u2019 assistance, AlphaZero would become strong by playing against itself. Furthermore, AlphaZero showed superhuman strength not only in Chess but also at Go. Go is a more complicated game for computers, given its much larger game space and other factors.", "While humankind has accumulated knowledge in games like Go and Chess from millions of games played over thousands of years, AlphaZero, a straightforward algorithm using only the game rules, rediscovered this knowledge and new strategies in a few days.", "There\u2019s even a movie about it.", "Recall that systems like DeepBlue would rely on a human-defined \u201cevaluation function\u201d, which would take as an input the board state and output the \u201cvalue\u201d of the state.", "Nowadays, it\u2019s extremely easy for DeepLearning models to take as an input an image and classify it as a dog or a cat. The idea is to take the board as the input to a DeepLearning model and train it to predict if the board has a winning or losing configuration.", "But to train a Machine Learning, one needs data, lots of data. Where do you get a dataset of games? Simple, we let the computer play against itself, generating a set of games and make a dataset out of it.", "And just like magic, after many iterations, you have a world-class model. This model managed to outperform the strongest computer chess program in only 4 hours!", "AlphaZero has two components. We already talked about the first one, which is the Neural Network. The second one is the \u201cMonte Carlo Tree Search\u201d or MCTS.", "It\u2019s easier to follow AlphaZero by first looking at its behavior when determining the next move (competitive mode) and then look at the training routine.", "Neural Networks (NNs) are already great at classifying things, like a cat versus a dog. The idea here is simple, can the Neural Network learn to classify a board configuration as a winning versus losing one? More specifically, the Neural Network will predict a value expressing the probability of winning versus losing. Furthermore, it will output a probability distribution over all the possible moves, representing which action we should explore next.", "The Neural Network takes the game state as an input and outputs a value and a probability distribution. Specifically for Dots and Boxes, the game state is represented by three elements: First, whether a line has been played or not, using an array of 0 and 1\u2019s for each line across dots. 1 if a player has already colored the line, else 0. Second, if the current move is a pass, third, the score. We can represent all the required information with these three elements to determine a board\u2019s value and predict its next move.", "Let\u2019s analyze the following game, where it\u2019s the Blue player\u2019s turn. Blue has two options, follow the top path and lose, or play the bottom path and win.", "If Blue plays 23 followed by 21, Red wins. Instead, if Blue plays 23 followed by 9, Blue wins. How would AlphaZero find the winning move if it would be playing Blue?", "You can reproduce the results seen below by using this notebook.", "If we feed that board configuration to the Neural Network, we get an array with move probabilities for each action:", "We also get a value for the board configuration:", "You can find the code that generates these values here.", "There are a few interesting things from these outputs:", "It\u2019s tempting to take the Neural Network\u2019s outputs and decide our next move.", "In board games (and in life!), players typically see many \u201cmoves ahead\u201d when determining their next move. It\u2019s no different here. We use our Neural Network predictions to choose which state to explore next and ignore the ones with low value. Like Minimax, traditional AI game tree search algorithms are inefficient because they have to analyze every single move before going into the next move. Games with even small branching factors make their game space intractable. The branching factor is the number of moves possible. The number of possible moves changes as the game progresses. If so, you calculate an average branching factor. Chess\u2019s average branching factor is 35. Go\u2019s is 250.", "This means that, in Chess, just after two moves, there are 1,225 (35\u00b2) possible board configurations, whereas, in Go, it would be 62,500 (250\u00b2). In Dots and Boxes, for a 3x3 game, the initial branching factor is 24 and decreases with every move (unless it is a pass). So in the middlegame, when the branching factor is 15, there are 2,730 (15*14*13) board configurations after just three moves.", "Instead, the NN will guide us and tell us where we should explore and avoid being overwhelmed by many useless paths. The NN is telling us that 23 and 21 are strong moves.", "It\u2019s the job of the Monte Carlo Tree Search to do that.", "The Neural Network has given us an indication for the likely next moves. The Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm is the one that will help us traverse the nodes to choose the next move to make.", "Take a look at this link for the paper\u2019s graphical description of Monte Carlo Tree Search.", "The way that MCTS works is that for a given board, it will run N simulations. N is a parameter of our model. At the end of these simulations, the next move will be the most visited. You can follow along with the code here.", "An MCTS simulation consists of traversing down the game tree, starting from the current board, by selecting the node with the highest \u201cUpper Confidence Bound (UCB)\u201d value (defined below) until we reach a game state that we have not visited before, which is called a \u201cleaf\u201d. This is what the paper refers to as Part A, \u201cSelect\u201d.", "What\u2019s UCB? It\u2019s Q(s,a) + U(s,a). Where \u201cs\u201d is the state, and \u201ca\u201d is the action. Q(s,a) is the expected value that we expect to get from that state \u201cs\u201d following the action \u201ca\u201d, the same one from Q-Learning. Remember that in this case, the value will have a range from -1 (loss) to 1 (win). U(s, a) \u221d P(s, a) / (1 + N(s, a)). This means that U is proportional to P and N. Where P(s, a) is the prior probability for the tuple (s, a), the value returned by the NN, and N(s, a) is the number of times that we have visited the state s and taken action a.", "The point of the UCB is to initially prefer actions with high prior probability (P) and low visit count (N), but asymptotically prefer actions with a high action value (Q).", "You can follow the code along here.", "Once a leaf is found, we run that board through the NN. This is what the paper calls Part B, \u201cExpand and evaluate\u201d. You can follow along with the code here.", "Lastly, we will propagate back up the value returned by the NN. That\u2019s what the paper calls Part C \u201cBackup\u201d. You can follow along with the code here.", "Let\u2019s see how AlphaZero determines the next move for the state mentioned above.", "AlphaZero will run 50 Monte Carlo Tree Search Simulations.", "You can reproduce the results seen below by using this notebook.", "These are the paths that follow at each iteration:", "The above means the following: In the first simulation, we haven\u2019t seen that board before and thus is a \u201cleaf\u201d node and \u201cexpands\u201d it. Expands means that it evaluates that board with the NN.", "In the second simulation, we have already expanded the root node so it\u2019s no longer a \u201cleaf\u201d and so we can search for the node with the highest UCB", "The action with the highest UCB is 23. It dives into that state, given that it has not seen that state before, and thus it\u2019s a leaf node, it expands it, and the second simulation completes.", "In this case, the NN gives a losing value for 23. We discussed this before. The NN could use even more training to learn that it\u2019s indeed a bad state. But for now, this still works, as we will see below.", "For the next simulations, at each time, the option with the highest UCB are the remaining options. That\u2019s because after visiting each action, it finds out that it has a low value and, thus, a low UCB.", "For the next simulations, an exciting pattern starts surfacing. Remember that the winning sequence is 23, 24 (skip), 9.", "In simulations 10 through 24, the MCTS is already focusing its attention on nodes 21 and 23. This makes sense as with either of those two paths, we score a point.", "Then in simulations 33 through 41, it starts going deep in the losing combination. Notice an interesting thing. Despite going deep, it never reaches the end of the game as there are still playable moves.", "After 50 simulations, our time is up, and we need to choose a move. MCTS chooses the move that we visited the most. Here are the number of times that we visited each move (on the first play):", "Actions 3, 9, 12, 17, 18, and 19 are visited only once in the first 10 simulations. Then the MCTS focused on moves 21 and 23. Visiting action 23 for the last 9 simulations. Given that we visited action 23 the most, 28 times, MCTS returns that as the next move.", "If we compare it with classical approaches like using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and an Evaluation function, we can say the following:", "We are missing one last key aspect. How do we train the NN?", "Luckily it\u2019s straightforward. We mentioned the steps before:", "What does it mean to play in \u201ctraining mode\u201d? The difference is a tiny one. When playing in \u201ccompetitive mode\u201d, we will always pick the move with the highest visit count. Whereas in \u201ctraining mode\u201d, for a certain number of moves during the beginning of the game, the counts become our probability distribution and encourage exploration. For example, let\u2019s say that there are 3 possible actions and the visit count is [2, 2, 4]. In competitive mode, we would always pick the third action as it has the highest visit count. But in training mode, [2, 2, 4] becomes a probability distribution, 2+2+4 = 8 and thus [2/8, 2/8, 4/8] or [0.25, 0.25, 0.5]. In other words, we will pick the third action 50% of the time, whereas we will explore the first and second actions 25% of the time.", "Then let\u2019s use a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game to describe the dataset.", "In the above game, the first player, the Xs win.", "We can configure the board state by having zero if the square hasn\u2019t been played, 1 if the first player, -1 if the second player has played the square.", "For example, the board would be the following:", "Then we have to do two things. First, update each board as if it would be player1\u2019s turn. We will always feed training data to the NN from the perspective of the first player. In TicTacToe, that\u2019s simple. Every time it was the second player\u2019s turn, we can flip the pieces to become player1\u2019s perspective.", "Second, we append the game outcome. Let\u2019s use a \u201c1\u201d if player 1 wins and \u201c0\u201d if it loses.", "The dataset is starting to get some shape! As you can see from the above, we can feed that to a NN to learn in a board is a winning or a losing one, the value.", "We are missing the probabilities, though. Where do those come from? Remember that during training mode, we will still run MCTS simulations at every step. In the same way that we are recording the board configuration, we will record the probabilities.", "We then clone the NN and train the clone using this dataset, expecting it to be slightly stronger as it\u2019s using new data. We validate that it\u2019s indeed stronger by having it compete against the original NN. If it wins more than 55% of the time, we consider it stronger and drop the original, and the clone becomes our new NN.", "We keep repeating this process, and the NN will keep becoming stronger.", "You can see the diagram from the paper here.", "How come the dataset has stronger moves to learn from? By learning from the probabilities generated by the MCTS, they will usually select much stronger moves than the raw move probabilities given by the NN. We are feeding the NN knowledge obtained by having the MCTS go deep into many paths!", "Use this notebook to train a Dots and Boxes model.", "A few months ago, I published a blog post that walks you through the process of transforming a Keras or Tensorflow model into JavaScript to be used by Tensorflow.js.
