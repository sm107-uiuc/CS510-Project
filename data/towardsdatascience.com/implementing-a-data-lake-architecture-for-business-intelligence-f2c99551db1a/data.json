However, in simple language, BI is truly about using data from yesterday and today to make better decisions about tomorrow. It can be understood as the function which ensures that raw data is transformed into meaningful information that provides insights and enables decision-making. If we think about what companies have been trying to do for a long time, very often we hear about investing in technology and tools that are supposed to solve business problems with data and analytics. BI, however, is not only about technology and tool. The end goal of BI is to use data, technology, and tools to create business insights.", "In a nutshell, BI involves gathering functional business requirements and translating them into technical solutions by designing data models, doing the ETL \u2014 Extract, Transform and Load process to convert raw data from operational source systems to meaningful information and to bring that information to an analytics/destination database, which can be used to visualize in the form of a real-time automatic dashboard. This is done in a business to make informed decisions based on past data rather than on a \u201cGut instinct\u201d.", "Get \ud83d\udcac GPT-powered answers to any Data Science, or programming question. Generate summaries and study notes for thousands of \ud83d\udcda learning resources in just one click. \ud83d\udc49", "BI provides a single version of the truth", "The story of a Single Version of Truth is the story of a data dictionary and data source, which is all about the source and meaning of data that should be agreed upon across an enterprise. Let me give you an example. I used to work for a bank that can not answer simple questions such as: How many unique customers does it have? Depending on who you asked, you will receive a different number. Having a unique source of truth is therefore a must. Instead of going through multiple spreadsheets with different numbers and doing reconciliations, BI product provides users with a real-time automatically updated, and consistent report.", "BI provides descriptive analytics \u2014 Business intelligence is descriptive because it tells you what\u2019s happening now and what happened in the past. It informs how a company is doing with regard to its set KPIs and metrics. For instance, BI products can tell a manager how the company is making sales and how far it is from reaching its set goals. This information is usually provided in the form of dashboards that include bar graphs, line charts, and the like, which gives users the most important information at one glance.", "BI provides diagnostic analytics \u2014 Diagnostic analytics is about giving in-depth insights and answering the question: Why something happened? BI dashboards provide drill-down functionality \u2014 which means, from a high-level overview, users can slice and dice the information from different angles to the very details to figure out why things happened.", "Bi does not tell you what\u2019s going to happen in the future.", "Business intelligence is a term commonly associated with data warehousing. If BI is the front-end, the data warehousing system is the backend or the infrastructure for achieving business intelligence. As such, we will first discuss BI in the context of using a data warehouse perspective.", "The ultimate purpose of a BI implementation is to turn operational data into meaningful information. Raw data is scattered from different operational databases, which are designed and optimized for applications to run rather than for analysis purposes. Sometimes in order to get one data field, you would have to do ten joins! And here it goes. People come up with a solution called central data storage \u2014 a data warehouse.", "Data warehousing solution emerged in the 1980s, which is optimized for providing information or insights. The data warehouse is a destination database, which centralizes an enterprise\u2019s data from all of its source systems. It is a relational database because we can join data from different tables using the joint field as presented in a so-called physical data model. The database schema defines relations between different tables. Typical SQL databases include MySQL and PostgreSQL.", "The data sources are connected to the data warehouse through an ETL process, known as Extract, Transform, and Load. A data warehouse follows the schema-on-write pattern, where the design fits the answers to the expected questions. Put differently, a data warehouse collects data coming from primary applications with a predetermined structure and schema. In Data warehouse architecture, when we move data from database A to database B, we need to have some information beforehand about the structure of database B and how to adapt the data of database A to fit the structure of data B, for instance knowing the naming conventions as well as the data type of fields the database B, etc.", "Data warehouse engineers can use various architectures to build a data warehouse. Common data warehouse architectures are based on layer approaches. The well-known three-layer architecture introduced by Inmon includes the following components:", "Staging area/Landing Zone: This is a database used to load batch data from the source system. Its purpose is to extract the source data from the source systems/primary applications to reduce the workload on operational system. The staging Area consists of tables that mirror the structures of the source systems, which include all the tables and columns of the sources, including the primary key. No functional business rules are applied here. However, some hard technical business rules are enforced at this stage, for instance, data type matching (string length or Unicode characters). These technical business rules do not change the meaning of data, but rather only the way data is stored.", "The data warehouse layer: This is the place where the transformation \u2014 applying functional business rules happens. These functional business rules modify incoming data to fit the business requirements. The earlier the business rules are implemented in a data warehouse architecture, the more dependencies it has on higher layers on top of the data warehouse. In data warehouse modeling, you will often hear about Dimensional modeling or Data Vault modeling.", "Data Vault modeling technique was invented by Dan Linstedlt in the 1990s. It is based on three basic entities type including the Hubs, The Links, and The Satellites. The Hubs are the main pillars of the Data Vault Model, which presents the business keys being used by business users to identify business objects. Examples of business keys include Customer identifier, product identifier, employee badge number, etc. The link ties the Hubs together and stores the relationship between different Hubs (business objects). Satellites are known as the standard place to store metadata. Apart from that, Satellites store all the attributes that describe a business object or a relationship. They add the business contexts at a period of time to Hubs and Links. However, this business context changes over time, and the goal of having satellites is also to track those changes and store historical data.", "On top of the data warehouse, there can be a data mart layer \u2014 the layer used to present the data to the end users. I think it makes more sense to call it information mart instead of data mart. A common modeling technique for Data Mart is dimensional modeling. The key concepts of dimensional modeling include a fact entity and dimension entities, which is a standard technique for building the information mart because it is straightforward for end-users to understand. In dimensional modeling, you will often hear about star schema \u2014 meaning one fact table referencing any number of dimension tables. Fact table represents what happens, orders and transactions, meanwhile, dimension entities contain different attributes/fields that constitute the facts.", "Join the Medium membership program to continue learning without limits. I\u2019ll receive a portion of your membership fee if you use the following link, at no extra cost to you.", "Because data that goes into data warehouses needs to go through a strict governance process before it gets stored, adding new data elements to a data warehouse means changing the design, implementing, or refactoring structured storage for the data and the corresponding ETL to load the data. With a massive amount of data, this process could require significant time and resources. This is where a data lake concept comes into the picture and becomes a game-changer in big data management.", "The concept of a data lake emerges in the 2010s, which, in simple language, is the idea that all enterprise\u2019s structured, unstructured and semi-structured data can and should be stored in the same place. Apache Hadoop is an example of data infrastructure that allows to store and process massive amounts of data, both structured and unstructured; which enables the Data Lake architecture.", "The data lake has a schema-on-read approach. It stores raw data and is set up in a way that does not require defining the data structure and schema in the first place. Put differently, when we move data to the data lake, we just bring it in without any gatekeeping rules and when we need to read the data, we apply the rule to the code that reads the data rather than configuring the structure of the data ahead of time. Instead of the typical Extract, Transform and Load in data warehousing, in the world of data lake, the process is Extract, Load, and Transform. Data Lake is utilized for cost efficiency and exploration purpose. As such, a Data Lake architecture enables businesses to gain insights not only from the processed and governed data but also from raw data that was not available for analysis before. From that, raw data exploration can potentially trigger business questions. However, the biggest concern with the data lakes is that, without appropriate governance, data lakes can quickly turn into unmanageable data swamps. Put differently, without knowing how the water is in a lake, who would want to go swim in it? Business users can\u2019t utilize the data lake if they don\u2019t trust the data quality of that lake.", "Recently the trend of companies that want to benefit from a data lake architecture in a more conservative way has emerged. These companies are stepping away from the ungoverned \u201cfree-entry\u201d approach and instead developing a more governed data lake.", "The data lake can contain two environments: an exploration/development and a production environment. Data will be explored, cleansed, and transformed in order to build machine learning models, build functions, and other analytics purposes. Data such as metrics and functions that have been generated by the transformation process will be stored in the production part of the data lake.", "Another trend is, rather than pouring all raw data into the lake, the governed data lake only allows \u2018verified\u2019 data to get into it. Essentially, a governed data lake architecture does not restrict the types of data that are stored in it, meaning that governed data lakes still comprise multiple data types including unstructured and semi-structured data like XML, JSON, CSV. However, the key is to make sure that no data is stored in the lake without being described and documented in the business glossary, which will give some confidence to the users about the quality and meaning of data.", "To provide this layer of governance, a business glossary tool has to be in place to document the meaning of the data. More importantly, there needs to be a governance process around this \u2014 which is all about roles and responsibilities, for instance, who owns the data, who defines it, and who will be responsible for any data quality issues. Going for this approach will be time-consuming because defining data itself can be a long process since it involves people from different disciplines across an enterprise.", "In the old days, companies usually rely on self-host-data-center. During data processing, a massive amount of data has to be processed and data processing runs on a cluster of machines at the same time rather than on one computer. This on-premise storage set-up center requires lots of servers and big computers and enough processing power for peak moments. It also means that, in quieter times, much of the processing power remains unused. Therefore, on-premise systems have huge up-front installation costs but at the same time, their capacity can only sometimes be fully used. Not only that, maintaining this requires a whole dedicated application team to take care of these primary systems, fix production issues, and reduce downtime.", "These huge disadvantages of on-premise storage have made the idea of using the cloud becomes so appealing. Many companies have moved to the cloud as a way of cost optimization. The rise of building data infrastructure on the cloud, for instance, using Azure and AWS has completely changed an enterprise\u2019s big data capabilities. Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in their data center, companies only need to rent the cloud resources, for example, the storage they need at the time they need it. Cloud providers take care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure. When cloud-service users are done using the resources, they can give them back and are billed only for what they use. This makes it very easy to scale since if things are slowing down, companies can assign some more virtual machines to do data processing for instance. With cloud storage, enterprises don\u2019t have to invest in new machines or infrastructure or replace aging servers. Another reason for using cloud storage is database reliability. In the worse case, for example, a fire can happen at your data center. To be safe, you need to replicate your data in different geographical locations. This brings a bunch of logistic problems. On these needs, companies specializing in this kind of service were born. We call them \u201ccloud-service providers\u201d. There are currently three big players in the cloud-service provider market. First and foremost, Amazon Web service (AWS) is the market leader, who takes up 32% of market share in 2018. Second position on the run belongs to Microsoft Azure that owns 17% of the market share and third in popularity is Google Cloud Services who owns 10% of market share.", "What do these cloud-service providers have to offer?", "There are a bunch of cloud services that all have different use cases. The most simple service is storage, which allows cloud-service users to upload all types of files to the cloud. Storage services are typically cheap since they don\u2019t provide much functionality other than storing the files reliably. AWS hosts S3 as a storage service. Azure has Blob storage and google has Cloud Storage. The second service is the computation service which allows you to perform computations on the cloud. Essentially, you can start up a virtual machine and use it as you wish. Computation service is often used to host web servers and perform calculations, for example. AWS provides EC2 as a computation service, Microsoft Azure uses Virtual machines and Google has Compute Engine. Cloud-service providers also host databases. For instance, companies can start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines that run in Azure. Other use cases of cloud service are Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Azure for example provides Azure Machine Learning service which is a cloud-based environment you can use to develop, train, test, and deploy machine learning models.", "It is no doubt that a Data Lake offers several benefits over a data warehouse, particularly for dealing with big data and cost efficiency. However, without knowing about the data quality in data lakes, business users can\u2019t trust in that data. Lots of data scientists often don\u2019t realize that getting the raw data from multiple sources to be ready \u2014 clean and high quality for modeling usually takes 80% of the time. Meanwhile, the architecture and discipline of Data Warehouses that provide governed and good-quality data can\u2019t be ignored. There is still a strong and permanent demand for a core set of KPIs that define how a business is doing, which are also needed for reporting, especially regulatory reporting purposes. Such information demands highly governed information.", "At the end of the day, the most crucial question about what companies want to achieve in their business strategy with data and technology has to be crystal clear. For example, if a company, in their business and data strategy, does not plan to be involved in data science, there is no point in investing in Data Science/Analytics platform that allows AI and Machine Learning to happen. Or companies can govern all their data in a business glossary platform and helicopter them into a Data Lake, but if they don\u2019t know why I doubt if that is going to create value.", "Thank you for reading.
