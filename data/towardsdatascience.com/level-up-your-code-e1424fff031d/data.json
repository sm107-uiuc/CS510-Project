Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\u201d- Martin Fowler", "Code is not always a conversation between a programmer and the computer; in fact, it\u2019s often the work of a group of developers working together or separately to build a working product. Oftentimes, writing a piece of code that works is not the sole goal; instead, it is writing a piece of code that is clean, readable, and it works.", "Clean code is a reader-focused code writing style that produces readable, easy to maintain code. Writing clean code that doesn\u2019t require much explanation \u2014 if any \u2014 is considered art. Programmers usually start writing clean code once they realize that the code they are writing is not just of the computer to execute; it\u2019s also for other people to read, extend, or build upon. Writing clean code is a skill every professional programmer should seek to obtain, it will not be an easy task, but in the end, it is definitely worth the effort.", "There are many cases where poor code leads to failure of both big companies and excellent products that would\u2019ve been great if their internal codes were clearly written. Especially today, if a product or an application didn\u2019t function correctly, companies may lose millions of dollars of profit, not to mention clients and time losses. Clean code, makes the development and deployment process of any code-base efficient and smooth.", "Clean code is a high-quality code that contains the following characteristics:", "Although the phrase \u201cclean code\u201d can be subjective, I mean, not all of us have the same perception of what makes a clean code. However, some techniques can be used to make the code look better, read more comfortably, and scale smoother. Here are five steps that I learned from 9+ years of writing code and teaching how to write code that you can follow while writing your code that will help your code be cleaner and of high-quality.", "Think about writing any line of code like writing a sentence in English \u2014 or any other spoken language \u2014 , long, complex sentence, are harder to understand; you will probably need to go through it two or more times to grasp it fully. Same goes with code, try to make your lines short and concise, avoid super complex syntax that you think will make you look like a programming superstar while confusing anyone else who reads it. You should also care about styling, which means writing code that is easy to go through for the human eye. Here is an example in Python of how styling and formatting make a big difference.", "Almost all editors today have Linters that help you write a well-styled and formatted code.", "Linters are IDE addons that help you catch little mistakes. Such as typos in variable names, forgetting a closing bracket, incorrect tabbing in Python, calling a function with the wrong number of arguments. They also help you with style inconsistencies and dangerous logic that don\u2019t make your code look great.", "Naming is one of the essential aspects of writing clean code. Making sure that the names of your methods, variables, and other custom definitions are self-descriptive and easy to understand is hugely beneficial, not just for those who will interact with your code, but even you as the author of the code. You will find it easier to edit and extend later on. These are some Naming tricks that helped me improve the readability of my codes:", "When writing your code, try to make it as concise as possible. It\u2019s impossible to set one number representing the right block size. However, there is a critical length for sure. If you feel that your code is too confusing or gotten too long, then it\u2019s time to regroup and refactor it and maybe divide it into smaller separate code files.", "Your code should only have lines that contribute to the functionality of the code, nothing more. If you wrote a trial function and then ended up writing a better, more efficient version of it, delete the old one, don\u2019t comment it. It will make the code look cluttered. Moreover, use internal, builtin functions instead of creating your own, that will just make your code, longer and more complicated for no reason.", "If you found yourself with multiple nested conditional statements or loops, re-write your code to avoid redundant nesting, you can do that with guard clauses, early returns, or some elements of functional programming.", "Making a habit of writing comments on your code is great. It is an excellent approach to deliver more clarity to your code. However, they are not there to explain your code in detail, save that for the documentations. Your comments should be sweet and short and to the point. To make it easier for, use comments to stress these points:", "In order to write better comments, I always remind myself that comments are not there to explain code to people; code is there to explain comments to the computer.", "Writing clean, high-quality code is not an easy task; it\u2019s quite challenging, the good thing is, it is very doable, it just needs practice. Sometimes, however, writing clean code is not an option or a very tricky option!", "Just do what you can to make the code as clean and as readable as possible, and remember, writing code is a form of art, so write some art that makes you proud, and the people will enjoy reading.", "Your home for data science.
