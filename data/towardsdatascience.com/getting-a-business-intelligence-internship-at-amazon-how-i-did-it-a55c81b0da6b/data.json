It becomes way easier if you have done one or two internships prior to that. That is why I decided to take I gap year to make myself some internship experience. I got my first internship in a French start-up in Paris as a Full Stack Developer. And just now, I got my second internship at Amazon Luxembourg, as a Business Analyst.", "I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence, but it comes from within. It is there all the time. \u2014 Anna Freud", "I know right. AMAZON. It is such a great and valuable experience. Besides being a renowned tech company, they also give real, interesting work to their interns, so they have a concrete subject to work on and something they produce.", "Getting an internship at Amazon, or any other big tech company is not impossible for that matter. The process might be long, but it is worth investing your time in if it is what you want.", "Back in April 2020, deep in the COVID-19 crisis, I had to find an internship. So I opened Amazon Jobs and applied to every single internship that matched my interests and my capacities. I did not miss one, I was constantly checking the statuses of my applications, and checking the newly open positions.", "It might seem long and tidy, and utterly depressing. But it is worth it. Amazon gets tons of applications, so maybe they have just not opened yours yet. Until they do. You did to be noticed just that one time. That is what happened to me.", "I don\u2019t remember everything that well, because it was 6 months ago and at the time I never thought I might actually get the internship. But there were 3 majors steps :", "Unfortunately, I was not that much into Data Science at the time and I had very poor knowledge in Machine Learning. The third interviewer gave me some piece of advice on books to read and online courses to follow. And obviously, he told me he could not accept me for the internship.", "As much as I was disappointed and down in depth because I felt that my chance had vanished, I was also impressed by myself for being able to get that far. The fact that the last interviewer advised me on what to do to progress and to get the internship meant that I could do it.", "So I dove right in, opened the books, subscribed to the courses, and spent my extra time working on getting that internship. Here is what he told me to study, to get an Applied Science Internship at Amazon.", "Eventually, I needed to find an internship. With the crisis, I could not go abroad, so I focused on the offers in Paris. There I found a Full Stack Developer Internship. It is great to get some new experience, make my first steps in working in a team and a company.", "Finally, I was the time I needed to find a second internship. I was thinking about what I wanted to do, the subjects I wanted to work on. I knew I did not want to be a web developer, even though I loved the experience, but I wanted to try something new.", "One morning, I received a private message on LinkedIn, followed by an email, from an Amazon Recruiter, asking me if I was interested in a Business Intelligence internship, in a team and location that was not already defined. I thought about it, and despite the uncertainty, the purpose of the internship appealed to me. I decided to give it a shot. This time, it could work.", "As the subject of the internship was quite different, the process was different too. I needed other skills. Here is how it went.", "You should expect a technical test, for any kind of internship. There are used to test your logical skills, your efficiency, and your ability to deliver results properly. Here it made sense to have a SQL test as I will have to work with databases.", "This test was a basic SQL test. I was given a database with about 5 tables, and I had to answer 3 questions with queries. They were equal in difficulty but tested different SQL behaviors and functionalities.", "Here the only way to prepare is to know your SQL basics (and more than basics actually). Take a course, or read a book and practice. You need to master SQL functions and features.", "For technical interviews, Amazon clearly tells you how to prepare. You must be ready to relate your experience with their Leadership Principles, and you should be ready to answer their question prep.", "If what the recruiter asks you is not always on their question list (and that is for the best), all are pretty much related, and if you prepare well to answer everything they have listed, you should be able to answer properly.", "Recruiters are not there to trick you, they are truly interested in you and your work. Try to show them that you are passionate about what you do and it should all go well.", "After the two 30 minutes of interviews, I reflected on them and found 4 big categories that interest recruiters. I gathered the questions I was asked in these categories so you can have an idea of what to expect.", "The day after the technical interviews, I got an email to offer be a position in the Transport & Logistic team. After thinking about it, weighing the pros and cons, I accepted the offer. Now I am in the onboarding process. But don\u2019t worry, once you are there, just go with the flow, everything will happen on time.", "So please, if it is something you truly want, don\u2019t give up on it. Work hard. Even if you don\u2019t see the results right away, your work will always pay later. If I was contacted by recruiters last month, it is because I have spent some time applying beforehand, taking tests, answering questions, etc.", "When you feel like something is made for you, the best way to get it is to work on every step of the process and make sure you check every requirement. Good luck!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Green food lover, experienced web developper.
