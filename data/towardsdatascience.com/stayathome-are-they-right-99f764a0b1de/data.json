We\u2019ll deal with the Spain data, but the principles can be applied to any country.", "In this article, we will prove or disprove this claim only with basic math \u2014 but there are also charts if math just isn\u2019t your thing.", "The whole idea behind staying at home is avoiding unnecessary social contact and maintaining distance from the rest of the world. By doing so we drastically reduce the growth rate of disease by some amount.", "As it turns out, a lot.", "Before proceeding, please keep in mind that I\u2019m not a medical expert of any kind, and everything written below is based on pure (simple) math. Also, the dataset used can be download from here.", "I don\u2019t live in Spain nor have someone close to me living there, but as it turns out it is a \u201chottest\u201d place in Europe right now.", "In the moment of writing this article, we had cumulative data up to and including the 3rd of April, 2020. Up to this date, we had 119.199 confirmed cases in Spain. Let\u2019s just quickly visualize the movement of the virus through time:", "And from here who knows how long will it be before the curve starts looking something like your average logistic curve.", "But we need additional information before jumping to conclusions \u2014 we\u2019re also interested in the average growth rate from some time period \u2014 let\u2019s say the last 7 days. This can be obtained by simply dividing today's number of confirmed cases by yesterdays \u2014 results in a number that should be close to 1.", "In a phase of exponential growth, this number would be constantly greater than 1 and is roughly 1.06 if we\u2019re comparing April 2nd and April 3rd \u2014 meaning that on April 3rd Spain had roughly 6% more confirmed cases than the day before.", "Once Spain approaches the inflection point, we can expect the growth rate to be constantly around 1 and to go downhill from there.", "If you\u2019re interested, here\u2019s how Spain looks growth factor wise:", "We can clearly see that the factor is reducing, but who knows what will happen from here.", "Now let\u2019s do a tiny bit of math.", "Calculated growth factor as an average of last 7 days growth factors is something we\u2019re gonna use to prove just how important it is to stay at home, maintaining personal hygiene and avoid social gatherings. The average value of the growth factor is roughly 1.0888.", "It might not sound like a lot to you \u2014 but here\u2019s why you\u2019re wrong. If Spain is to have roughly the same daily growth of 8.88% in the following 30 days, the expected number of confirmed cases can be calculated as follows:", "Xt: Number of confirmed cases today", "n: Number of days into the future", "Once we put in the numbers we get an alarming result:", "This means if no additional measures are taken to make people stay inside and growth rate remains roughly the same, in 30 days we can expect 1.53M people to be infected, just in Spain! Keep in mind that this is only if everything stays the same, which probably won\u2019t happen.", "If, however, by following rules made by the government (or by implementing new, more strict rules) we manage to reduce the average growth rate to, let\u2019s say, 1.05, the situation will drastically improve:", "Well, the number isn\u2019t small by any means, but 515K sounds a lot better than 1.53M.", "To conclude, if you could not care less about math I have something else for you. I\u2019ve gone ahead and prepared a (probably) nice-looking graph, showing the number of confirmed cases Spain will have for 3 different growth rates:", "Now there\u2019s no denying that more people will get infected, and unfortunately, more people will die \u2014 but by implementing more strict rules we can ensure that the growth isn\u2019t following the red curve, but is instead somewhere between the blue and the green one.", "Thanks for reading, take care and stay at home.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
