And if you work in finance, you probably see technology as just a tool \u2014 where anything that doesn\u2019t have a clear UI is too technical and the command line is never to be touched. While both are equal in terms of complexity, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s usually harder to convince someone in finance to pick up coding skills compared to the other way around. It\u2019s easy to chalk this up to there being little immediate financial or fun incentive to learn Python or Java, versus chunking your sign-on bonus into $TSLA. But I think there\u2019s a better explanation:", "The bridges and roadblocks are structured differently. To be more specific, bridges refer to application and roadblocks refer to learning.", "For this article, I will take the perspective of those in finance who are trying to understand and build their coding skills \u2014 since that\u2019s the chasm I crossed over the last three years. However, if you are in tech and want to learn finance I urge you to continue reading as well to get a peek at how we understand the field.", "In the case you\u2019re looking for credibility before continuing on reading, I\u2019ve been a credit analyst at a bulge bracket investment bank for two years as well as a consultant at a Big 4 accounting firm for two years. I\u2019ve learned Python/SQL for Data Science, C#/Unity for XR applications, as well as blockchain fullstack (Solidity/JavaScript/HTML/CSS) for Ethereum dev.", "When you start out in any field, you\u2019re learning on many different domain islands at once \u2014 for finance this would be economics, markets, business \u2014 and breaking down the roadblocks associated with understanding various formulas and variables. At this point you\u2019re not really sure what\u2019s hidden on each island, but you\u2019ve driven along the coastline. So in your mind, it looks something like this:", "After a while, you start diving deeper on these domains with tests and readings and breaking down more roadblocks. You don\u2019t even have to break the roadblock down completely, for example just learning the formula for GDP doesn\u2019t require fully understanding all the components or knowing the variations like GNP. The islands each start to grow clearer with sub-domains, something like this:", "And finally, when you start to apply all these concepts at internships and case competitions \u2014 you start to really bridge the gaps between domains.", "Then at some point, you realize what you\u2019ve learned is only US Finance. Time to scale it to Europe, China, Japan, and more! So you go knock down some more roadblocks by learning the history of a region\u2019s markets, policy, and competition frameworks then apply it in some sort of credit comparison analysis to connect the bridges. Maybe one day you\u2019ll be able to connect the different regional bubbles with bridges too!", "For those in finance who have reached this point, could you say what order you learned and applied these domains in, or how you connected it all? I definitely couldn\u2019t tell you my exact path. That\u2019s why when someone asks any of us how to learn more or get started, we\u2019ve probably responded with \u201cJust read the Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg everyday\u201d.", "In finance, our roadblocks can really be tackled in any order, and bridges can be built weakly and returned to later.", "Scaling knowledge here is just learning bits and pieces of a new industry or country and comparing it your previously built map of the US financial system. However, the flexibility of this means you\u2019ll likely have broken down many learning roadblocks but not have the intuition to bridge these domains. If you can\u2019t explain why the federal reserve\u2019s actions influence auto loans, there\u2019s a lot of bridging you need to start doing by applying actual analysis to what you read.", "On the other hand, coding doesn\u2019t really allow you to start on many different islands at once. You can\u2019t really just start from building a flask web app with Python, the same way you might try to guess what the last three quarters of Tesla\u2019s free cash flow is signaling.", "In code, you need to carefully find the start of the road. Unlike in finance, I can tell you almost exactly what, how, and when I learned concepts of code in a tree map.", "But because it is a pretty linear path, you can\u2019t just ignore a roadblock or remove it halfway. Bridges are also binary, meaning its either there or it isn\u2019t (for those of you who don\u2019t agree, stack overflow can only be your bridge for so long). Approaching code with the same mindset as finance will make it overwhelming, frustrating, and easy to give up.", "So don\u2019t let the linear-ness of the diagram fool you into thinking it will be easy \u2014 the roadblocks on each \u201cisland\u201d are much more stubborn in coding than in finance because trial and error looks different in code. In finance it takes years to be proven wrong or right and the result can still change at any point after. For example, a company could go bankrupt but then come out stronger after a successful restructuring, therefore it is important to always ask questions with a time frame in mind and slowly build your opinion along the way. Coding gives you immediate feedback to small steps/changes, and that can be really frustrating since often you won\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. My advice is to not get too bogged down in the theory, and focus on dissecting what is happening line by line. Unless you\u2019re an absolute genius, you won\u2019t be able to figure out why you\u2019re getting that error message on your own every time.", "Let\u2019s introduce resources that you won\u2019t find in finance. The tech community is much more open to sharing code and helping out for free than finance communities are, and there are many avenues to get help from.", "In finance, you\u2019ve probably become comfortable with how a WACC or CAPM model is derived and used. But no fund or bank is going to share with another how they\u2019ve implemented or tweaked their models in their spreadsheets, so it\u2019s usually pretty tough for outsiders to get started \u2014 unless you have a few hundred bucks to spare. In coding, complex models and frameworks have been put into open-source modules/packages. These are essentially like add-ons in Excel, where 99% of the work has been done for you so that you can operate at a higher level. Most popular languages have many open-source packages supported by groups of small developers as well as large tech companies like Google and Facebook. If you went to a package\u2019s documentation or GitHub issues tracker it may look scary at first, but both will very quickly become your best friends.", "Online communities are much easier to access in coding. Not to say I haven\u2019t found the Wall Street Oasis forum helpful or entertaining as a community, but peer to peer help is hard to find if you don\u2019t have a business network or school finance club to join. For coding, each language/package will have many slack or discord channels with experienced developers (the easiest way to find them is to go to a popular tutorial youtuber\u2019s channel and look in a video description, like this one). Forums such as Stack Overflow and Medium publications like Towards Data Science will also be helpful for new concepts or confusing bugs.", "Here are the resources I used to learn, layered on top of my mapping above. And yes, my mapping was dependent on what packages were available or recommended in articles I read.", "So what\u2019s the equivalent of connecting nations and industries in code? Starting on your second coding language. I\u2019m going to break it to you now: if you really want to be useful, learning just Python isn\u2019t going to cut it. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) just apply the mapping of one language to another \u2014 for two key reasons.", "Don\u2019t be scared, because the second is easier than the first. You\u2019ll find experienced coders can sometimes pick up a new language in a week or two, because they are much faster at creating a learning path/map and are more experienced at dealing with roadblocks.", "There\u2019s one more large boulder to coding. Finance is all around you and in the headlines everyday, however the newest Python package or WASM language won\u2019t be. Because there aren\u2019t constant external reminders or headlines to ease you in small bits and keep you going, you will need to plan out your first fifty steps instead of just taking your first one when coding. This may sound silly or simple, but doing a coding challenge where you commit 30 minutes or an hour a day for 30\u2013100 days on a new coding language will do so much for you in the long run.", "I believe in setting goals with projects in mind, since learning without applying will leave you more confused than when you started. Figuring out how things tie together outside of a tutorial is the real learning.", "Here are some takeaways as you hit the road:", "Best of luck on your journey!
