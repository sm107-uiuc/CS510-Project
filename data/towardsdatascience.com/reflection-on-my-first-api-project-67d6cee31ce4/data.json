I have read multiple definitions and watched multiple Youtube videos, but it was still abstract.", "The common explanation is always something like: \u201ca software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.\u201d or \u201cwe can send a request to it to receive the information that\u2026\u201d and etc\u2026", "but still, is it a physical thing? a package that I can import and use? or something similar to a programming language? I know, it allows applications to talk to each other, but, WHAT IS THAT THING?", "If you have the same question in your mind, read on. I hope this blog might help a bit.", "API is a block of codes. Here, you are looking at one now.", "This is one of my APIs for my most recent project. The project is a web application that allows people to play a trivia game. This API allows the web app to display all the questions and the questions can be displayed by categories as well.", "What makes this block of codes an API?", "In my perspective, it can generally be divided into 2 big parts.", "The first part is Part 1: URL and Methods. This part serves 2 purposes. Firstly, the ```@app.route(\u2026)``` is the noticeable signal that tells you, you are looking at an API. Secondary, in this part, the API is listening to the request from the client, namely the URL address that was passed in.", "If you want to know more about why the ```@app.route()``` works and why every API starts this way, here are two good resources that will help.", "Part 2 and Part 3 are the essences or the jobs of API. They are why we need an API. In Part 2, API retrieves the information that was requested by the client from the database. In Part 3, API tells the server how it should respond to the client so that the client understands.", "If the above paragraphs are abstract. Look at the codes below. These were my frontend code. Look how they correspond to each other. Just a footnote, I used React and Flask and for this app.", "Let me give you another angle to show you how API allows backend and frontend to talk to each other.", "For my frontend, I used React. Therefore, I go to: localhost:3000 to check out my webpage. If I did everything correctly, all the buttons on the webpage should work. Whenever I click a button, the corresponded information, which is stored in the database should show up on the webpage.", "Let\u2019s assumed that now I named one of my variables differently. On my backend, I changed the variable \u201ctotal_questions\u201d to \u201call_questions\u201d, but on my frontend, it is still \u201cresult.total_questions\u201d. What would happen?", "As expected, when I click a button on the webpage to retrieve all the questions, I would encounter an error.", "This means that the server knows exactly how to get the information from the database. My functions work perfectly fine. It is just that it couldn\u2019t transmit this information to the frontend because of the name mismatch.", "The same thing happens if you have a different URL address. Your backend URL address can work perfectly fine on the port 5000, but your frontend would have errors.", "I hope it is clearer now what is an API, and how API bridges frontend and backend.", "When I first started learning Computer Networking, I was fascinated by how the terms \u201cserver\u201d and \u201cclient\u201d fits so well with the metaphor of a restaurant. The frontend/client is the client that walks into the restaurant. The server is literally like a server serving in the restaurant, where they bring up dishes and satisfied whatever the client needs. The database is like the kitchen.", "If we go with this metaphor, an API is a menu. The client knows what to expect when he/she orders \u201cPizza Margherita\u201d. The server also knows exactly what is \u201cPizza Margherita\u201d. Nobody needs to explain: it is mozzarella cheese, basil, olive oil and etc\u2026 That\u2019s the power of API.", "Aside from having a very clear understanding of API, I learned a hard lesson about if-statements.", "I was looking at the two endpoints where I got stuck for a long time. I was reflecting upon why they took me so long to debug. I realized one thing, in both times, I wrote an if statement, trying to catch a special occasion. However, because I did not realize there were problems in my if statements, I did not know both of the if-statements were just useless.", "The special occasion just skipped the if statements and went down the other lines of codes like normal occasions. I thought it was a problem with my logic, so I spent so much time checking it with no result.", "Now I know: double and triple check if-statements. Just because they are there and didn\u2019t cause any error messages, doesn\u2019t mean they are working. They are if-statements, therefore, they can be skipped easily.", "More detail on my problem, I put:", "I was trying to catch the situation of receiving an empty input from the users, which happen to be in an empty string format. In Python, a null or none is DIFFERENT from an empty string. That\u2019s why both of my if statements were useless.", "None is not an empty string, none is not 0, none is just none\u2026 Get it?", "I still find this difference pretty intriguing. Here is a good explanation below on what is the difference, for those of you who wonder. To put it simply, it is better to interpret \u201cnone\u201d as \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in Python, rather than \u201cthere is nothing\u201d.", "These are detailed but hard lessons I learned from this project.", "You see, that\u2019s why you need projects.", "Another article that explains API. I liked the graph but drawing API like a box makes it a bit confusing.", "Your home for data science.
