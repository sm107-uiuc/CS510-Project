And due to the digital distance between the supply of goods and payment the core problem of identifying whether the operator of the funds is actually the owner, a problem that didn\u2019t exist with cash, because the funds are separate from the payment token, now becomes a problem.", "So what happens then is that each card payment event should be subject to two level verification:", "So if I live in Australia but a fraudulent set of card transactions gets blocked originating from Bulgaria? Fair call. But that stays on my record.", "Since a typical large bank in Australia processes a staggering ~130,000,000 payments a month, it is possible to coarsely infer, based on an open Kaggle training credit card fraud dataset, that a small 0.172% of transactions were confirmed fraudulent. If half of the 130M payments involve a card, this is still ~112,000 potentially fraudulent card transactions for one bank per month.", "While credit and debit card numbers have inbuilt verification using a Luhn check, and the CVV number also helps, the online availability of large sets of card numbers that have been obtained illegally through hacking, ATM skimming, online skimming and social engineering means this is one of the biggest problems in eCommerce.", "In most cases of online fraud where the fraud is not perpetrated by the customer, if the card is present (CP), the bank being the issuing authority underwrites the loss. In the case of online transactions where a EFTPOS merchant terminal is used and a card is not present (CNP), the loss is borne by the merchant. Card Not Present fraud costs the merchants in Australia approximately $500M AUD per annum to resolve. So it\u2019s a big deal that eats away at merchant profit margins and can also result in abandoned carts where the merchant rightly says \u2018I cannot be sure you are you\u2019. Also the cost to the card issuer for reissuing the card after a block.", "While level 1 & 2 verification is absolutely warranted to prevent premeditated anonymous hackers who have motive and opportunity, where this gets somewhat complicated is the notion of the \u2018risk score\u2019 that is based on customers own propensity for either committing fraud or infact being a victim of fraud.", "The score(s), which can be out of 100, is like a creditworthiness score. Typical fraud committed by everyday customers is application fraud. Like misstating income on an application for a credit increase. The \u2018score\u2019 can change depending on your life events, especially job loss or relationship breakdown or bankruptcy\u2026", "\u2026and additionally, the behaviour of the account holders associates \u2014 the network of known associates and their \u2018score\u2019 \u2014 can affect the account holders propensity \u2018score\u2019, and visa versa. That is, if a known associate has been verified as conducting fraudulent activity, it rubs off on you.", "How would they know your associates? Quite easily, through Facebook or Twitter. Through people you have paid money to, or they have paid you, your correspondents. Through their own CRM system master data hierarchies.", "And these scores also pertain to merchants who are found to be scamming customers based on poor ratings or high levels of returns.", "Airbnb, apparently not well known for enforcing their own policies, is applying similar automated methodologies to profile and score customers and hosts \u2018traits\u2019 like psychopathy or narcissism after buying online background check company \u2018Trooly\u2019:", "\u201cPostings to blogs and news websites are also taken into account to form a \u201cperson graph\u201d, the patent says.\u201d", "Trait analysis using NLP techniques is a form of language analysis that either uses taxonomies of words and their context to classify sentiment which is mapped to personality models, at a basic level like a Myers-Briggs, or even autoencoding. This is taking it one step further, to use ML techniques to judge your online \u2018personality\u2019, and to red flag and filter out applicants for risky behavioural properties. It\u2019s also the fact that it is now easy to recognise postings of inappropriate images and factor that into a trust \u2018score\u2019.", "So, if Airbnb can do this and thereby ban customers for life, it\u2019s possible ride sharing platforms can do this too, or eBay or Amazon et al.", "What\u2019s problematic about ML/AI techniques being applied to risk/trust score people in this way is:", "In the case of error, with a Bank it is possible to plead your case and infact go to the ombudsman and expend effort to fix the misperception. And Banks, believe it or not, actually have a high degree of integrity when it comes to these matters. In the case of private organisations like Airbnb, complaints may fall on deaf ears.", "Because the models that may score us are based on data and operate autonomously in the background, disputing them and their theoretical basis (like the computational theory of the mind) will become near impossible.", "Furthermore, some of the DNN techniques used to do this cannot be explained due to their black box nature. What this means is that, once flagged, rightly or wrongly, that flag as if a stain on the back of our shirt could be with us unobserved for ever; and because many of these non-governmental organisations are not subject to freedom of information or the oversight of an ombudsman, the flag may prohibit the possibility of redemption.", "As we empirically learn the rules of these scoring \u2018games\u2019 that have real consequences to us in terms of access to funds, availability of accommodation or transport, will we ourselves be trained and disciplined to moderate what was once seen as ordinary free speech, in the nature of a bi-directional machine-human modality?", "Free speech that now gets automatically and with our consent [1] taken out of context by the scoring algos narrow the potential of the amazing social communication tools we now have. If our associates are found wanting, their own scores will influences ours due to the nature of the networks, or graph, that social media like Facebook is built on.", "The tradeoff from corporations using these scoring technologies is that if they train the models too aggressively to maximise risk reduction, the false positive rate will increase to such a degree customers who are unduly penalised will churn out and find alternatives, reducing brand equity and shareholder value.", "A solution here is to conduct human clerical investigation reviews, but that\u2019s expensive and with DNN technology autoencoding scores, using tech like Keras and CloudML [2], not possible anyway, and also the volumes are very large.", "As these scoring-type approaches leak into more aspects of everyday life to try to remove risk and increase trust between unknown participants I think we\u2019ll begin to see the reinforcement rewards and penalties from the scoring models themselves become a dimension of the political correctness we must observe, as language in social media expression narrows towards a vanilla mean, and new private channels for internet based dialogue increasingly emerge outside of the scrutiny of the mainstream [3].", "[1] Through the Privacy terms of service you can read how they are legally entitled to share data for purposes of \u2018research\u2019. e.g.: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#infosharing", "[2] Although modified random forest models can be used instead as classifiers.", "Your home for data science.
