Least Squares minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, which can result in low bias but high variance.", "L2 Regularization, also called ridge regression, minimizes the sum of the squared residuals plus lambda times the slope squared. This additional term is called the Ridge Regression Penalty. This increases the bias of the model, making the fit worse on the training data, but also decreases the variance.If you take the ridge regression penalty and replace it with the absolute value of the slope, then you get Lasso regression or L1 regularization.", "L2 is less robust but has a stable solution and always one solution. L1 is more robust but has an unstable solution and can possibly have multiple solutions.", "K-Nearest Neighbors is a classification technique where a new sample is classified by looking at the nearest classified points, hence \u2018K-nearest\u2019.

However, if it\u2019s too high, it may overlook classes with only a few samples.", "You can use the elbow method, which is a popular method used to determine the optimal value of k. Essentially, what you do is plot the squared error for each value of k on a graph (value of k on the x-axis and squared error on the y-axis).

Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree.

This is the power of random forests.", "Random forests offer several other benefits including strong performance, can model non-linear boundaries, no cross-validation needed, and gives feature importance.", "Naive Bayes is better in the sense that it is easy to train and understand the process and results. A random forest can seem like a black box. Therefore, a Naive Bayes algorithm may be better in terms of implementation and understanding.

Random forests are more accurate, more robust, and less prone to overfitting.", "AdaBoost is a boosted algorithm that is similar to Random Forests but has a couple of significant differences:", "Gradient Boost is similar to AdaBoost in the sense that it builds multiple trees where each tree is built off of the previous tree. Unlike AdaBoost which builds stumps, Gradient Boost builds trees with usually 8 to 32 leaves.", "More importantly, Gradient differs from AdaBoost in the way that the decisions trees are built. Gradient boost starts with an initial prediction, usually the average. Then, a decision tree is built based on the residuals of the samples. A new prediction is made by taking the initial prediction + a learning rate times the outcome of the residual tree, and the process is repeated.", "The bias of an estimator is the difference between the expected value and true value. A model with a high bias tends to be oversimplified and results in underfitting. Variance represents the model\u2019s sensitivity to the data and the noise.

Then, the ensemble model (models 1 and 2) are used against the test dataset and the process continues.", "XGBoost is an ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that leverages the gradient boosting algorithm. In essence, XGBoost is like a bagging and boosting technique on steroids. Therefore, you can say that XGBoost handles bias and variance similar to that of any boosting technique. Boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm that reduces both bias and variance by takes a weighted average of many weak models. By focusing on weak predictions and iterating through models, the error (thus the bias) is reduced. Similarly, because it takes a weighted average of many weak models, the final model has a lower variance than each of the weaker models themselves.", "Cross-validation is essentially a technique used to assess how well a model performs on a new independent dataset.", "The simplest example of cross-validation is when you split your data into three groups: training data, validation data, and testing data, where you use the training data to build the model, the validation data to tune the hyperparameters, and the testing data to evaluate your final model.", "There are two main ways that you can do this:", "R Squared is a measurement that tells you to what extent the proportion of variance in the dependent variable is explained by the variance in the independent variables. In simpler terms, while the coefficients estimate trends, R-squared represents the scatter around the line of best fit.", "However, every additional independent variable added to a model always increases the R-squared value \u2014 therefore, a model with several independent variables may seem to be a better fit even if it isn\u2019t.

This is the type of learning that most people are familiar with, where you source a dataset and build a model on the whole dataset at once.", "Online learning, on the other hand, is an approach that ingests data one observation at a time. Online learning is data-efficient because the data is no longer required once it is consumed, which technically means that you don\u2019t have to store your data.", "There are a number of ways to handle null values including the following:", "Mean imputation is the practice of replacing null values in a data set with the mean of the data.", "Mean imputation is generally bad practice because it doesn\u2019t take into account feature correlation. For example, imagine we have a table showing age and fitness score and imagine that an eighty-year-old has a missing fitness score. If we took the average fitness score from an age range of 15 to 80, then the eighty-year-old will appear to have a much higher fitness score than he actually should.", "Second, mean imputation reduces the variance of the data and increases bias in our data. This leads to a less accurate model and a narrower confidence interval due to a smaller variance.", "A confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a summarized table used to assess the performance of a classification model. The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarized with count values and broken down by each class.", "Supervised learning involves learning on a labeled dataset where the target variable is known.", "Unsupervised learning is used to draw inferences and find patterns from input data without references to labeled outcomes \u2014 there\u2019s no target variable.", "Ensemble learning is a method where multiple learning algorithms are used in conjunction. The purpose of doing so is that it allows you to achieve higher predictive performance than if you were to use an individual algorithm by itself. An example of this is random forests.", "There are a couple of ways to identify outliers:", "Z-score/standard deviations: if we know that 99.7% of data in a data set lie within three standard deviations, then we can calculate the size of one standard deviation, multiply it by 3, and identify the data points that are outside of this range. Likewise, we can calculate the z-score of a given point, and if it\u2019s equal to +/- 3, then it\u2019s an outlier.Note: that there are a few contingencies that need to be considered when using this method; the data must be normally distributed, this is not applicable for small data sets, and the presence of too many outliers can throw off z-score.", "Interquartile Range (IQR): IQR, the concept used to build boxplots, can also be used to identify outliers. The IQR is equal to the difference between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile. You can then identify if a point is an outlier if it is less than Q1\u20131.5*IRQ or greater than Q3 + 1.5*IQR. This comes to approximately 2.698 standard deviations.", "Other methods include DBScan clustering, Isolation Forests, and Robust Random Cut Forests.", "An inlier is a data observation that lies within the rest of the dataset and is unusual or an error. Since it lies in the dataset, it is typically harder to identify than an outlier and requires external data to identify them.", "There are a couple of ways:", "In content-based filtering, you use the properties of the objects to find similar products. For example, using content-based filtering, a movie recommender may recommend movies of the same genre or movies directed by the same director.", "In collaborative filtering, your behavior is compared to other users and users with similar behavior dictate what is recommended to you. To give a very simple example, if you bought a tv and another user bought a tv as well as a recliner, you would be recommended the recliner as well.", "In its simplest sense, PCA involves project higher dimensional data (eg. 3 dimensions) to a smaller space (eg. 2 dimensions). This results in a lower dimension of data, (2 dimensions instead of 3 dimensions) while keeping all original variables in the model.", "PCA is commonly used for compression purposes, to reduce required memory and to speed up the algorithm, as well as for visualization purposes, making it easier to summarize data.", "Generally, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of your model, while the testing set is used to evaluate your final model.", "For those who don\u2019t know, overfitting is a modeling error when a function fits the data too closely, resulting in high levels of error when new data is introduced to the model.", "There are a number of ways that you can prevent overfitting of a model:", "There are many steps that can be taken when data wrangling and data cleaning. Some of the most common steps are listed below:", "There are a number of ways to handle unbalanced binary classification (assuming that you want to identify the minority class):", "Recall attempts to answer \u201cWhat proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?\u201d", "Precision attempts to answer \u201cWhat proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?\u201d", "Mean Squared Error (MSE) gives a relatively high weight to large errors \u2014 therefore, MSE tends to put too much emphasis on large deviations. A more robust alternative is MAE (mean absolute deviation).", "A false positive is an incorrect identification of the presence of a condition when it\u2019s absent.", "A false negative is an incorrect identification of the absence of a condition when it\u2019s actually present.", "An example of when false negatives are more important than false positives is when screening for cancer. It\u2019s much worse to say that someone doesn\u2019t have cancer when they do, instead of saying that someone does and later realizing that they don\u2019t.", "This is a subjective argument, but false positives can be worse than false negatives from a psychological point of view. For example, a false positive for winning the lottery could be a worse outcome than a false negative because people normally don\u2019t expect to win the lottery anyway.", "There are two types of methods for feature selection: filter methods and wrapper methods.", "At its core, a Neural Network is essentially a network of mathematical equations. It takes one or more input variables, and by going through a network of equations, results in one or more output variables.", "In a neural network, there\u2019s an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer consists of one or more feature variables (or input variables or independent variables) denoted as x1, x2, \u2026, xn. The hidden layer consists of one or more hidden nodes or hidden units. A node is simply one of the circles in the diagram above. Similarly, the output variable consists of one or more output units.", "Like I said at the beginning, a neural network is nothing more than a network of equations. Each node in a neural network is composed of two functions, a linear function and an activation function. This is where things can get a little confusing, but for now, think of the linear function as some line of best fit. Also, think of the activation function like a light switch, which results in a number between 1 or 0.", "The Rectified Linear Unit, also known as the ReLU function, is known to be a better activation function than the sigmoid function and the tanh function because it performs gradient descent faster. Notice in the image to the left that when x (or z) is very large, the slope is very small, which slows gradient descent significantly. This, however, is not the case for the ReLU function.", "The weights of a neural network MUST be initialized randomly because this is an expectation of stochastic gradient descent.", "If you initialized all weights to the same value (i.e. zero or one), then each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal. For example, if all weights are initialized to 0, all hidden units will get zero signal.", "If the learning rate is too low, your model will train very slowly as minimal updates are made to the weights through each iteration. Thus, it would take many updates before reaching the minimum point.", "If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behavior to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights, and it may fail to converge.", "Recurrent neural networks, also known as RNNs, are a class of neural networks that allow previous outputs to be used as inputs while having hidden states.", "They are commonly used to recognize the pattern of sequences in data, including time-series data, stock market data, etc\u2026", "The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron. The activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating weighted sum and further adding bias with it.", "A window function is like an aggregate function in the sense that it returns aggregate values (eg. SUM(), COUNT(), MAX()).", "What makes window functions different is that it does not group the result set.
