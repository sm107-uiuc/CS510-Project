Over the course of my career, I\u2019ve occasionally been pressured into setting goals, always as an initiative from an executive or manager who was hoping to inject new life into an old process. I\u2019ve done SMART goals. I\u2019ve done OKRs. I\u2019ve done KPIs. I dislike them all.", "I don\u2019t like goal-setting in the workplace \u2014 particularly in creative jobs like data science and engineering \u2014 because I\u2019ve consistently found it to be ineffective, I\u2019ve often found it to be harmful, I\u2019ve always found it to more trouble than it\u2019s worth, and I\u2019ve never seen it provide me with information I actually needed to achieve results. As far as I\u2019m concerned, goal-setting is pretty much a failure all around. And there\u2019s a better way (I\u2019ll talk about that at the end of the post).", "It\u2019s not hard to find mountains of research claiming to show that goal-setting is effective in achieving results. I\u2019m not aware of any study from that body of research that was conducted in a way that justifies those claims. Any variant of \u201cgoal-setting achieves results\u201d is a causal claim. Causal claims require (at least) two things: support for the claim, and lack of support for any plausible alternative explanations.", "James Clear voiced a very plausible alternative explanation. I\u2019ll use one of his examples: say you\u2019re a sports team and you want to win a championship. Say you set a goal of winning the championship by a certain date. Now, let\u2019s say you make a lot of changes in order to progress towards your goal: you recruit new players, hire and manage assistant coaches, schedule and conduct practices, and even get old recordings of competitor\u2019s games and study them.", "All these things are systems: specific behaviors you commit to do on a regular schedule. If you set up these systems, and you stick with them, you improve your chances of winning the championship. If you also set the goal of winning the championship, your chances of actually winning don\u2019t change. The systems are necessary to the accomplishment of the goal. Actually setting the goal, and even measuring progress towards the goal, is not.", "Plausible alternative explanation. The goal research doesn\u2019t address it. Therefore, the goal research doesn\u2019t support the claim that goal-setting achieves results.", "A few years ago, researchers at several major business schools published a working paper on the dangers of goal setting. Their paper doesn\u2019t prove goal-setting doesn\u2019t work \u2014 I refer to it because it tells a few illustrative stories (all of which I quote here):", "I really like the author\u2019s summary argument:", "The beneficial effects of goal setting have been overstated and that systematic harm caused by goal setting has been largely ignored\u2026 Rather than dispensing goal setting as a benign, over-the-counter treatment for motivation, managers\u2026need to conceptualize goal setting as a prescription-strength medication that requires careful dosing, consideration of harmful side effects, and close supervision.", "In other words, goal-setting is a fragile way of trying to achieve results. Not only are goal unnecessary to achieve desired results (because they don\u2019t do anything systems don\u2019t already do), but they also create incentives that make it easy to achieve undesired results.", "When I make arguments like those I\u2019ve laid out above, I often get a response of \u201cWell, yeah, if you\u2019re stupid about how you set goals then of coarse you get into trouble. Goals work when you do them right.\u201d", "It\u2019s so very easy to say that.", "Take a look at one example of what it takes to do OKRs \u201cright\u201d:", "When it\u2019s that easy to misuse a tool, it may be time to consider that the problem is the tool itself, not the users. The amount of time it takes to set goals in a way that are both meaningful and not harmful is simply not worth it. Time I spend defining and implementing and measuring progress towards goals is time I don\u2019t spend building things that actually add value.", "I think this is especially true when you consider the amount of instrumentation necessary to meaningfully and explicitly measure progress towards an end state in an engineering project. If your goal is a certain sales figure, the instrumentation is already built. If your goal is anything more ambiguous, and it usually is, building a way to measure it effectively will usually take more time and resources than it will take to actually do the thing that will actually accomplish the goal.", "Let\u2019s go back to the analogy of a sports team. Let\u2019s say you set the goal of winning the championship, and let\u2019s ignore the fact that you\u2019ve set up all sorts of systems that will move you towards the goal without you ever needing to set the goal in the first place. Now, let\u2019s say you reach the date of the championship you\u2019ve wanted to win. Let\u2019s say you lose.", "What should you now do because you failed to meet your goal? How should your behavior change? Let\u2019s reverse the scenario and say you actually won \u2014 you met your goal. Same question: therefore, what?", "Whether you accomplish the goal or not does nothing but tell you whether you accomplished the goal. If you\u2019ve already put together systems to lead you toward a desired future state, you already know what you need to do. Clearly-defined goal with measurable progress markers don\u2019t tell you next steps. They don\u2019t contain any information that allows you to reach your desired future state any faster or more efficiently.", "I found this post by a former Google Product Lead insightful. He references Paul Graham\u2019s \u201cMaker\u2019s Schedule, Manager\u2019s Schedule\u201d. Makers (engineers, data scientists) are people whose job performance is measured by what they build. Managers are people whose job performance is measured by the meetings they have. Both are necessary functions (as much as makers sometimes hate to admit it, meetings are the glue that coordinate and hold together the stuff that gets built).", "Talking about his experience using OKRs at Google, the author of the post said:", "We consider ourselves a company founded and driven by Makers (our engineers), but somehow we settled into a Manager planning rhythm, one which mimicked accounting cycles rather than how things actually get built. \u201cQuarterly goals?\u201d Why are three months the right duration for building features, why not two months or four months? And there was the amusing \u201clast week of quarter\u201d push to try and ship all the features you\u2019d committed to ~90 days earlier.", "In a business context, most goal-setting benefits managers more than makers. If a makers need to prove their value, they can point to things they\u2019ve built. The nature of management is such that has a less explicit set of accomplishments, and goal accomplishment is a way to prove managerial value. It\u2019s like assessing a teacher\u2019s value based on student test scores \u2014 and just about as valid. But because the accomplishment (or not) or goals doesn\u2019t tell us what to do next, that\u2019s the best we can hope for: goals don\u2019t tell us about anything but themselves.", "In my experience, goal-setting is often the refuge of weak management. Goal-setting allows organizations to pretend that getting results less messy and more predictable than it really is. The cost of that make-believe is that both makers and managers spend an inordinate amount of time managing the illusion, and to add insult to injury, they don\u2019t even get actionable information from doing so.", "I\u2019ve found the following process effective:", "Is this similar to setting goals, OKRs and things like that? Yeah, it is. But this focuses on \u201cwhere do I want to be?\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s going to move me toward that place?\u201d instead of \u201cwhat can I commit to accomplish?\u201d and \u201cwhat can I measure?\u201d It requires us to set up systems regardless of goals, doesn\u2019t incentivize counter-productive behavior, takes remarkably little time to do reasonably well, yields actionable information at every step. It\u2019s a little shift in perspective that makes a big difference in both job satisfaction and results.", "Your home for data science.
