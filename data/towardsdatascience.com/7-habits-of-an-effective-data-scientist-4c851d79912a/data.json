During that period of realization, I found one of the best self-mastery books- The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People [1] by Stephen R. Covey. As the title suggests, the book elaborates on the 7 habits of the planet\u2019s highly effective people. It\u2019s a powerful book to read for me and I\u2019m still working on implementing these habits in my daily routine. In this article, I want to share with you my take on the 7 habits, seen through my lens of data science.", "Nobody understands the data better than you do. An effective data scientist should advise on how the data can be utilized as other people may not be aware of the power of data. Focus on what value the data can bring and take initiative for the greater good.", "\u201cReactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values\u200a\u2014\u200acarefully thought about, selected and internalized values.\u201d\u200a\u2014 Stephen Covey", "Data science isn\u2019t about reaching your goal, it\u2019s about finding the best path to your goal. An effective data scientist should have a clear idea of how the project should be carried out. Depending on the project, the best practices may vary, but without it, no project can be well-planned and well-executed. Start by figuring out what\u2019s the best output and how to do it.", "\u201cTo begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you\u2019re going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aStephen Covey", "Data science can sometimes be overwhelming, especially when you\u2019re working on the bigger and important projects. Hence, priority must be given to tackling the most important and urgent problem. An effective data scientist understands what should have been done first. Being able to measure what\u2019s important and what\u2019s urgent, then sticking to the highest priority will pay off in the long run.", "\u201cThe key is not to prioritize what\u2019s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.\u201d \u2014\u200aStephen Covey", "A great data scientist is always a person with a win-win approach. Thinking about how both sides can win is crucial to building trust and ensuring long-term success. An effective data scientist knows that everybody can win! Always focus on solutions that aren\u2019t one-sided.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not your way or my way; it\u2019s a better way, a higher way.\u201d\u200a\u2014 Stephen Covey", "The ability to communicate clearly is also essential for a data scientist. To do so, you must endeavor to understand your audience before attempting to make yourself understood. Empathy and open-mindedness are the keys to attaining a full understanding of people. An effective data scientist should first understand before making any assumptions. And often, seeking a different point of view could open up another better possibility.", "\u201cMost people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.\u201d\u200a\u2014 Stephen Covey", "Data science is not about your solo work. Teamwork is vital for a well-constructed plan to be executed with perfection, as every individual may give different and better alternatives. An effective data scientist must be able to work in sync with others. In fact, great things generally happen when people work together.", "\u201cSynergy is better than my way or your way. It\u2019s our way.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aStephen Covey", "Data science is a huge and rapidly evolving field. A deeper understanding of data science can only be gained through continuous learning. An effective data scientist must always be ready to solve upcoming problems. Always strive for more knowledge and adapt to new challenges.", "\u201cUnless you\u2019re continually improving your skills, you\u2019re quickly becoming irrelevant.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aStephen Covey", "Adapting to a new habit can be challenging at first, as it requires you to get out of your comfort zone. But, instead of worrying about things you can\u2019t control, concentrate on getting control over yourself first. Remember, one step at a time!", "\u201cStart small, make a promise and keep it. Then, make larger promises and keep them.\u201d \u2014\u200aStephen Covey", "Currently studying data science at CUHK-Shenzhen.
