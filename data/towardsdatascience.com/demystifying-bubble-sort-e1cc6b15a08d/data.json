You might recall that Binary Search and Interpolation Search only worked on sorted arrays. It is safe to say, sorting is the complement of the searching algorithms. Sorting is the operation to rearrange elements in a data structure into some specified order (either ascending or descending). For the sake of simplicity, we will sort all of the arrays into ascending order.", "There are many sorting algorithms available out there, some of them are better than the others. However, it is important for us to understand every single one of them to give us a thorough foundation in Algorithms. In this article, we will be starting with the simplest one, the Bubble Sort.", "Bubble Sort, which is also known as Sinking Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that operates by comparing every pair of adjacent elements. First, it compares the first and the second element, then the second and the third element, and so on. Should the former element is larger than the latter, these two elements will be interchanged.", "The algorithm gets its name as the bigger elements will \u201cbubble\u201d towards the rightmost position. After each cycle, the largest element will be the last element in the unsorted part of the array.", "The operations that are done in Bubble Sort:", "The caveat is in the first run, you will need to make n-1 comparisons, suppose the number of elements in the array is n. In the second run, you will only need to make n-2 comparisons, not doing the last comparison since the last element at this point is the largest. That means, in each run, the number of comparisons reduces by 1.", "I will provide you guys with the pseudo-code first before we move on to the real implementations in 3 different programming languages.", "It\u2019s time to move on to the real code in Python, C, and JavaScript.", "Bubble Sort operations are basic, however, it\u2019s time complexity is not the best. The time complexity for best case/worst case/average case is O(n\u00b2) as in any array the total number of comparisons is:", "For any array, the algorithms will do exactly n(n-1)/2 comparisons although the array has already been sorted. Because of the O(N\u00b2) time complexity of Bubble Sort, it is rarely used in real-world implementations. The growth of running time will be very large as n becomes larger.", "Although Bubble Sort might be used infrequently. It is definitely worth it to learn Bubble Sort. Learning Bubble Sort will help you to learn the more advanced topic easier since it will act as a bridge for you to understand higher-level concepts.", "\u201cA day that I don\u2019t learn something new is a wasted day.\u201d", "Have fun learning new concepts every day!", "Your home for data science.
