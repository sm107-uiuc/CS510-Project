That is when Linear Algebra is needed.", "Linear regression is an example of linear systems of equations. Linear Algebra is about working on linear systems of equations. Rather than working with scalars, we start working with matrices and vectors.", "Linear Algebra is the key to understanding the calculus and statistics you need in machine learning. If you can understand machine learning methods at the level of vectors and matrices, you will improve your intuition for how and when they work. The better linear algebra will lift your game across the board.", "And what is the best way to understand linear algebra? Implement it. There are 2 methods to solve a system of linear equations: direct methods and iterative methods. In this article, we will use the direct methods, in particular, Gauss-method.", "Since most often time we work with data with many features (or variables). We will make our system of linear equations more general by working with a 3-dimensional data instead.", "Let\u2019s generate an example for the plot above:", "where the coefficients of x_0, x_1, and x_2 and the corresponding values 8, 4, 5 are the samples of points in the plot.

I hope this article helps you understand what is linear algebra and one of the mechanisms of solving a system of linear equations. I try to make this article understandable as much as possible.
