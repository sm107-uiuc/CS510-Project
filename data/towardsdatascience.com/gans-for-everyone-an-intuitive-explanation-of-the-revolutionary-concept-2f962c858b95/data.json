Beyond its generative capability, the concept of adversarial learning is a framework that, if further explored, could lead to a huge breakthrough in machine learning.", "Using understandable explanations and diagrams, this article will instinctively explain how GANs work, what challenges they encounter during training, and the power of adversarial learning.", "A GAN is a system that consists of two models: a generator and a discriminator.", "The discriminator is simply a classifier that determines whether a given image is a real image from the dataset or an artificially generated image from the generator. This binary classifier will take the form of a convolutional neural network.", "The generator\u2019s task is to take in random input values (noise) and create an image from it using a deconvolutional neural network. Think of the concept as setting a seed for a random number generator \u2014 the same input noise will yield the same output. The generator uses the random noise as a seed of sorts to produce an image.", "The goal of the two-model system is for the generator to fool the discriminator, but also for the discriminator to classify the generator\u2019s images with the highest accuracy it can. This ongoing battle between two worthy adversaries (generative adversarial network) means that both models get better by trying to beat the other. The generator uses the discriminator to get feedback on how convincing its images are, and the discriminator gets more data to train on from the generator.", "The deconvolutional neural network (DNN) is the heart of the GAN. It is the algorithm responsible for generating the images. As suggested by the name, convolutional neural networks can be thought of as \u201crunning a CNN backward,\u201d but the mechanics are much more complicated than that. Also known as deconvs or transposed convolutional neural networks, DNNs use layers similar to those found in CNNs \u2014 but backward \u2014 that up-sample (as opposed to down-sampling), making images larger.", "This is more difficult than a CNN. Making an image smaller by condensing or generalizing its information is much easier than making an image bigger without making it blurry and with the same amount of detail. This problem is addressed with the transposed convolution (deconvolution).", "In this sense, if the DNN is the heart of the GAN, transposed convolutions are the arteries. Understanding deconvolutions first requires an understanding of the convolution. For example, consider the following convolution:", "The following convolution is performed as follows, with an assumed stride of 1. The convolution generalizes an image into one of the lower dimensions.", "The goal of deconvolutional layers is the opposite of a convolutional layer\u2019s: take a reduced image and a trainable kernel and predict the \u201coriginal image.\u201d In this case, the random noise will be transformed through a series of deconvolutions to produce a clearer image.", "These transposed convolutions are trained based on the results of the discriminator. If the discriminator performs poorly, the generator\u2019s current weights are desirable and properly tricking the discriminator. However, if the discriminator performs well, the generator\u2019s current weights need to be drastically changed to reduce the discriminator\u2019s performance. In other words, the discriminator is the loss function for the generator.", "While this idea is revolutionary, GANs are notoriously difficult to train. One common failure in GANs is that the discriminator overpowers the generator, identifying generated images as fake with 100% certainty. Because the discriminator serves as the loss function for the adjustment of the deconvolution layer weights, absolute certainty leaves no gradient for the generator to descend.", "Another common failure in training GANs is known as mode collapse, where the generator discovers and exploits a weakness in the discriminator. Mode collapse can be recognized in the GAN when it generates similar images regardless of variation in the random input. This means that the generator only generates images it has learned will almost always trick the discriminator. This means the generator does not improve because the discriminator is giving poor results, implying that the generator is producing ideal results. Mode collapse can sometimes be corrected by \u201cstrengthening\u201d the discriminator in some way (for instance, by adjusting its training rate or reconfiguring its layers).", "GANs are based on the idea that competition between two equally matched individuals improves both and requires both to be healthily and carefully regulated in order for one not to exploit the other.", "Generative Adversarial Networks and Adversarial Learning as a field are still very young and showing tremendous potential. They have tremendous potential to shape the digital world \u2014 for the better or for the worse. Deepfakes that have the capability to put people\u2019s faces on scandalous videos (by specifying images as input noise for the generator) can ruin lives and deceive millions. The solution to dangerous Deepfakes may lie in adversarial learning itself \u2014 the strengthening and analysis of the discriminator.", "Your home for data science.
