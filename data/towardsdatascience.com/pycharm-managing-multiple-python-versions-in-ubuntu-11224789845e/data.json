For instance, you may have Python 3.6 installed as the system-wide version of Python, but need to build a specific program that requires Python 3.8.", "However, installing Python 3.8 as the system-wide version risks making much of your Python 3.6 code incompatible with the new version.", "In this circumstance, the use of virtual environments is needed, i.e. an independent environment that runs a different Python version to the one running system-wide.", "PyCharm is quite effective in serving as an IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) for multiple Python versions. Using Ubuntu 18.04, let us see how Python 3.8 can be set up in a virtual environment through PyCharm.", "From the JetBrains website, one will see that PyCharm (at the time of writing) offers both a paid Professional version of PyCharm, as well as a free, open-source version titled Community.", "By clicking Download, the file will be downloaded as a tar.gz file. At the time of writing, the file name is pycharm-community-2020.2.3.", "This tar.gz file can then be extracted into a folder of your choosing:", "As described in another tutorial, navigate to the bin folder and open up a terminal. PyCharm can then be installed using:", "A relevant window will then open, from which the default settings for PyCharm can be customised.", "As mentioned, Python 3.6 is the default version of Python in this example. In the PyCharm IDE, once Create Project is selected, the below displays:", "The project is called pythonProject for simplicity, but you can assign any name to the project. As can be seen above, python3.6 is selected as the base interpreter. In this case, Python 3.6 and Python 2.7 are the only two versions installed on the system.", "Once the Python console is started, we can see that Python 3.6.9 is loaded.", "That said, since we are using this version of Python in its own separate environment, note that the relevant libraries must be installed separately into this environment.", "As an example, attempting to run the numpy library fails for the first time, and thus it is required to install it manually within the PyCharm project in question as seen below.", "However, when running this in a standard Linux terminal (using the system-wide version), the library runs without issue.", "As mentioned, there are many instances whereby one will be required to use a different Python version to the default system-wide version.", "For this example, let us suppose that we wish to install Python 3.8.0.", "As described in this tutorial from Serhat Teker, this Python version can be downloaded as follows:", "The tar file can then be unzipped as follows:", "In this instance, we do not wish for Python 3.8 to be the default version. Assuming that much of the other Python code on the system is denominated in a different version (Python 3.6.9 in this case), then upgrading Python outright can cause significant issues with dependencies and lead to library deprecation.", "Therefore, one must use sudo make altinstall instead of the standard sudo make install \u2014 the latter will overwrite the default Python version. In this regard, one must navigate to the newly downloaded Python folder, configure and enable optimizations, followed by using altinstall.", "When checking the Python versions in the terminal, you will note that the default version of Python 3.6.9 remains the same:", "However, Python 3.8 can also be called as a separate version:", "We can find out where each Python version is installed through the which command in the terminal:", "Accordingly, the new directory can be set through PyCharm, and the base interpreter is now set to Python 3.8 as below:", "Accordingly, when opening the Python console for the new project, we can see that Python 3.8.0 now loads.", "As in the example above, libraries need to be installed separately for this environment and dependencies need to be configured.", "However, PyCharm fits the bill for what we are trying to accomplish \u2014 install a separate version of Python in a virtual environment without compromising the system-wide version.", "In this example, you have seen:", "In this regard, PyCharm provides quite a useful platform for working with different Python versions. The virtual environments installed are technically separate from PyCharm itself and could simply be run in the terminal. However, one cannot argue that PyCharm does make the process more intuitive.", "Many thanks for reading! Any questions or feedback are greatly appreciated.
