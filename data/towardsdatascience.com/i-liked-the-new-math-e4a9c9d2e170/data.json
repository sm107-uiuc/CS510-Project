We had beanbag chairs in class. We squinted into uncomfortable metal and glass contraptions for \u201cspeed reading\u201d. We read snippets of literature on coloured, laminated cards. I remember being proud of reaching SRA level \u2018purple\u2019, at the end of the reading crate, but not reading an actual book. The four food groups were replaced with a pyramid, encouraging you to eat lots and lots of carbs. And then there was \u201cNew Math.\u201d", "New math was an ambitious change in the mathematics curriculum in response to the \u201cSputnik Shock.\u201d It was a Big Deal in the US, and to a lesser extent, Europe. It was a bold and ambitious plan to turn every child into the next Werner von Braun (assuming Werner von Braun was Alan Turing). It was also a demonstrable failure.", "I liked it. Well, not all of it. If you are like me, you were so immersed in it, you can\u2019t reliably distinguish it from old math (e.g., multiplication tables, algebra, geometry, etc.). New Math expanded (and displaced) traditional mathematics curricula with abstract topics, such as set theory, modular arithmetic, algebraic inequalities, number bases, symbolic logic, and Boolean algebra. Whew! Who out there remembers inequalities? (hint: it involves number lines and shading in objects)", "It is a bit too easy to be cynical and debate which topic was the most useless, and New Math was quite rightly criticized at the time (see: Why Johnny Can\u2019t Add: The Failure of the New Math [1]).", "New Math died in 1973. (The murderers will be revealed later.) After nearly 5 decades, I wanted to understand what it was all about. What follows is a first-hand account of my experience. Many of you will feel my pain. Perhaps, like me, you will have had experienced d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in college or graduate school, where some of these concepts re-appeared and even started to make sense.", "The most ridiculed topic was base numbers. Tom Lehrer parodized it in a song[2], which captures the confusion of parents and teachers alike:", "The book that I got this problem out of wants you to do it in base eight. But don\u2019t panic! Base eight is just like base ten really \u2014 if you\u2019re missing two fingers!", "Shall we have a go at it? Hang on\u2026", "You can\u2019t take three from two, Two is less than three, So you look at the four in the eights place. Now that\u2019s really four eights, So you make it three eights, Regroup, and you change an eight to eight ones And you add \u2019em to the two, And you get one-two base eight, Which is ten base ten, And you take away three, that\u2019s seven. Ok?", "Hooray for New Math, It\u2019s so simple, So very simple, That only a child can do it!\u201d", "Arguably, base numbers were the most accessible and the most practical of the lot. As a quick refresh, here is 7 in base 2:", "Addition (and other arithmetic operations) are performed more or less the same way as in normal math (Base 10:", "Clearly, binary mathematics was to become critical in the digital age. We had a school assembly with a NASA engineer and a ten-foot high computer to emphasize this point. Who didn\u2019t want to be an astronaut? When will we all have computers of our own?", "Learning base numerals and other alternate number systems is valuable in the same way learning foreign language helps you understand your primary language. An analogy from the biology: \u201cIf you want to know why there are only two sexes, try to imagine the evolutionary advantages of 3\u2026 or 7.\u201d", "Binary is unique, in that it is the natural language of switches (on/off), logic (True/False), and of course, computers. Binary math and its twin, Boolean algebra, allows us to design circuits to perform any mathematical calculation (Figure 3).", "We learned that a computer could do anything mathematical. Boolean algebra could be used to solve logic and propositional calculus. Computers could perform anything in mathematics or logical reasoning better than humans! (Actually, that was a bit depressing.) A new, trendy, thing \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d was all the rage. Movies had apocalyptic warnings about computers ruling the world (2001 [1968], Collosus: The Forbin Project [1970]). Sound familiar?", "So, us snot-nosed children understood something our parents didn\u2019t. We were only a few weeks away from understanding how a digital computer works. Boolean algebra was getting somewhere, but suddenly, we shifted gears into to another level of abstraction. It was 5th grade and time for some new algebras.", "Fourth and fifth grade math is a bit of a blur to me. For some reason, we were no longer to think about numbers as quantities, but numbers as things, and things belonged to sets. From what I remember, an integer between 4 and 8 became \u201cthe set of integers:\u201d", "It was a complete mystery to me then and now, why math was supposed to get easier by thinking of numbers as \u2018objects\u2019 in \u2018sets\u2019. If that labels me a philistine, consider I was one of the petit bourgeois. What did the proletarians make of all this?", "Set Theory is potentially foundational to many branches of mathematics, as axioms in several fields can all be cast into the more general theory. On the other hand, it is clumsy and tedious in practice, and the native methods of each discipline are simpler and easier to work with. One unfortunate legacy of set theory is the Venn Diagram, which about the only thing anyone remembers \u2014 and is ubiquitously used in business presentations, to give the illusion of content.", "Since it is rather difficult to think of sets of continuous numbers, our teachers simultaneously introduced the algebraic inequalities to deal with quantities on real number lines, so a real number between 4 and 8 would be represented by", "Which could be expressed using the logical/Boolean notation:", "Problems moved on to thinking in two dimensions (4x+y < 0), so we were finally moving into traditional algebra. Set theory was cast aside, perhaps because they had run out of examples of problems easily solved with set theory.", "By the end of the 5th grade, our minds whirled with the nuances of the operations union(U), addition(+), and \u2018logical AND\u2019(\u22c0). They were all \u201ckind of\u201d the same idea, but the math was different in each case. So far, we had been introduced to three algebras, before mastering basic algebra. Obviously, what was needed was another algebra.", "I was spared investing too much time on Modular Arithmetic \u2014 probably because my teachers did not know what it is good for. To be clear: my teachers in were mostly laid off rocket scientists. (In case you missed it, we won the space race in 1969.) If my teachers didn\u2019t see the point, they were probably on to something.", "Modular arithmetic (sometimes called clock arithmetic) deals with numbers that repeat around a cycle \u2014 or modulus (in the case of clocks, 12), and finding the remainder. Two numbers, a and b, are said to be congruent if they have the same remainder when divided by n.", "In clock time, 100 hours from midnight is congruent to 4 AM", "In Western music, frequencies double every twelve notes, so all \u201cC-notes\u201d are congruent in mod 12.", "There are rules for addition, subtraction, division, commutation, etc., analogous to the rules of normal arithmetic. But, while binary math is a little bit different than base 10 math, modular math is A LOT different.", "I have been a professional scientist for 40 years and have never used the \u201cMOD\u201d button on my calculator, so whoever thought the button would be useful must have been a real devotee. On the other hand, maybe he was showing off he knew what a modulus was and no one in the design meeting had the guts to ask.", "I had not thought about it for decades, until I sat in on a fascinating lecture about its\u2019 inventor, Carl Friedrich Gauss, on his work developing Number Theory [3]. It is only briefly summarized below, so as to not scare you. Reader advisory: this will hurt a bit.", "The Golden Theorem (Quadratic Reciprocity Theorem)", "It turns out that all primes can be divided into two families, those congruent to 1 mod 4 and those congruent to 3 mod 4.", "Primes in the first series can be square roots of each other, at least in modular mathematics. (If p is the modular square root of q, then q is the modular square root of p). For example, 13 and 29 are have \u2018reciprocal modular residues\u2019", "This is what I meant by \u201ca lot different.\u201d This kind of thing just doesn\u2019t happen in normal math. It takes dedication to appreciate what this means, and its significance eludes most of us. This much I do know \u2014 this is such an important result that there have been 246 published proofs, six by Gauss himself [4]. It was critical to finding solutions to problems (such as factoring huge polynomials) that could never practically be solved by brute force. It is also the foundation for proving Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, which given the level of abstraction, it is not surprising took 300 years to do.", "A prominent application of modular math is cryptography (the familiar RSA token uses a very simple modular algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages). This begs the question of what were us juvenile delinquents supposed to have gained from studying this?", "Mathematics is full of weird and wonderful things like this, but few people would voluntarily enroll in a course on Mathematics Appreciation. If you\u2019d like to know more, I recommend the Gresham College lecture by Raymond Flood on YouTube[3].", "Still not interested? OK. Let\u2019s try something more age appropriate.", "Arithmetic in Egyptian and Roman Numerals", "At a recent technical conference, I noticed that none of the younger attendees could read the date on the fa\u00e7ade of the lecture hall. This made me sad. So here is a brief rehash on how to do math with Roman numerals. Again, not that anyone needs to know this, but it is kind of fun.", "Rules for Addition in Roman numerals", "1. Eliminate subtractive notation (e.g. replace IV with IIII)", "2. Group all the symbols in order e.g. CCCLXXXVVIIIIIIII)", "3. Simplify/contraction: Right to left, replace repeated symbols with their higher value equivalents (e.g. VV \u2192X). Egyptian is more annoying as they don\u2019t have 5\u2019s, 50\u2019s and so on, so there are more symbols to count.", "4. Reintroduce subtractive notation (if you feel like it)", "Multiplication is possibly easier than with Arabic numbers:", "A few more fun facts: the Romans invented their own version of the abacus (Figure 1), to speed such calculations. Doing long division or decimals in Roman numbers is painful, yet up until the eighteenth century, Roman numerals were still used for bookkeeping in parts of Europe.", "Math shouldn\u2019t hurt. To me, it has always been interesting. But that is just me.", "In 1973 David McCall, an advertising executive, frustrated at helping his child learn multiplication tables, created the Saturday morning cartoon series, \u201cMultiplication Rock,\u201d for ABC television. This was the most iconic manifestation of the \u201cback to basics\u201d movement. Early backers were none other than Michael Eisner and Chuck Jones (legendary animator/director of Warner Brothers Cartoons). God bless Chuck Jones.", "Historian/mathematician, Morris Kline, offered this succinct critic of New Math: \u201c[A]bstraction is not the first stage, but the last stage, in a mathematical development.\u201d Understanding the structure and theory of mathematics is not really necessary for its\u2019 use, but some of us become curious. Many of the things we learned are no longer taught, and math is very dry and boring again, like in the old days. Some of the stuff that has been dropped is the most fun.", "I subjected my poor daughter New Math when she was very young (But not set theory!). She liked it. She picked up binary math in only a few hours. So, I started guest lecturing at her traditional, Scottish, girls-only primary school. They liked it. The girls jumped to the blackboards, to add to the list of numerals in Japanese, Indian, Chinese, as well as alternative methods for multiplying numbers. The teachers started attending my lectures. To my surprise, they had not learned how to work with Roman numbers. They all probably liked it more knowing they were not going to be graded on this trivia; I just wanted them to know it\u2019s there.", "Russell Anderson did not become an astronaut, but he did work on the Space Station and \u201cStar Wars\u201d missile defence at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics in 1984.
