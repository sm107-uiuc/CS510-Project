What once was a puzzling and rather niche area of computer science, has suddenly started to take over our lives with its many applications. As a result, due to this mysterious and unknown characteristic of AI and its more prominent child, machine learning, news sites, and the press, in general, have taken a liking on overstating the reality behind the successes or advances in the field. This phenomenon often leads to articles of an unsavory nature that seems to sensationalize and even fearmonger what\u2019s genuinely going on. In this essay, I want to shed some light on this issue.", "AI is often described as \u201cthe new electricity\u201d or \u201cthe most important thing humanity has ever worked on\u201d by some of its most prominent advocates, tech-evangelists, and companies, such as Google. These phrases, honestly, gives a sense of hope, future, and even of development. After all, electricity did transform the way we live and with that, the world and our economy. However, they are just that, phrases, hyperboles, and metaphors. As powerful as AI is, it\u2019s just another piece of technology. One that, like many others, is designed to make our days more comfortable, accessible, and straightforward. Hence, when talking about it, it should be done in the same way we\u2019d talk about, let\u2019s say, mobile devices. Yet, some news sites disregard the fact that AI is just another tool, and in the process, they overstate and misinform the real events. Let\u2019s see some examples.", "In 2015, a factory worker died after a machine picked him up and crushed him. This sad news resulted in many sensationalized news stating that a \u201crobot killed a man.\u201d This sentence, in some sense, is partly true. However, the way some news outlets described the accident is as if the machine, knowingly, killed the man. This conjecture is not true at all; as automatic as the robot is, it is not autonomous (accurate source).", "Another example is a Facebook experiment, which featured two chatbots chatting among themselves. The test, according to Facebook, was a failure, and they turned it off because the bots were basically \u201csaying\u201d gibberish. Pretty innocent, right? Well, not to some people. Right after this announcement, news surfaced saying that Facebook had turned it off because the bots had invented their language, and it was too dangerous to keep it running. This statement is not accurate at all. The reality is that the bots were not able to communicate using proper English grammar, and thus, useless to us. The text below is a portion of their conversation (accurate source).", "Bob: I can i i everything else", "Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to", "Alice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me", "Then there are the so-called racist AI models. For example, a while ago MIT revealed their Norman model, an AI they call the world\u2019s first \u201cpsychopath\u201d AI. And sure, the model might produce some lines of dark and morbose content (examples below), but calling it racist right away doesn\u2019t seem appropriate. After all, it is just but a controlled experiment in which the researchers fed the model with \u201cdisturbing\u201d data.", "\u201cA man is electrocuted and catches to death\u201d", "Likewise, it is the recent and controversial ImageNet Roulette project. This art project featured (the experiment has been turned off) a website in which a user uploads an image of itself, and receives a label from an AI that describes the kind of person it \u201csees.\u201d As you might expect, not everybody was happy with their results. ImageNet\u2019s Person categories contain a wide array of classes, with some of them somehow offensive, e.g., \u201crape suspect,\u201d \u201cdrug addict,\u201d and \u201cfailure.\u201d", "As a consequence, users who visited the website expecting a nice classification to share among their friends were instead greeted with a negative one. This outcome led to a considerable uproar in which the media, called the model all sorts of things. I, personally, had no issues since the model called me a rock star. However, I can understand why some people might feel uneasy about a machine calling them a failure. But we need to accept that an AI system is merely a black box that extrapolates from the information it has seen; it doesn\u2019t feel, \u201cknow\u201d or hate you. Before getting all mad and starting pointing fingers, we should research the context of the intelligent entity. How was it trained? What\u2019s the data behind it? Who labeled the data? These are the essential questions here.", "The last example I want to illustrate is regarding a piece I read about an AI that generates music. Here, the author writes about a recently released music album entirely produced by a machine, but then, rapidly changes the topic to what it means for the music industry. I\u2019ll oversimplify the issue here (if there\u2019s even one) and say, in my opinion, that it means nothing. How many albums are released weekly? Many, I\u2019m pretty sure. So, why can\u2019t we just treat this \u201cAI album\u201d as another one? To clarify, the author doesn\u2019t say anything negative. In fact, he seems to be very curious about the topic of generative AI, and his stance was a neutral one.", "Now we have to ask: why is the media doing this? We can\u2019t know for sure. However, I\u2019m willing to say that it is partly due to these two reasons: clicks and lack of understanding. The internet is vast, and getting users to visit your website is basically a competition. To attract them, people employ some of the cheapest tricks we all know, such as clickbait titles or over-the-top (and often fake) news. By using a sensationalized headline, they\u2019ll for sure bring many users, which translate to ads revenue or popularity, and by manipulating the content and straying from the truth, they\u2019ll surely grab the attention who aren\u2019t well familiar with the reality.", "Reason number two could be genuinely not understanding the issues behind what they are trying to inform. AI and machine learning are complicated fields, and many of its concepts are complex, tedious, and not easy to explain. Thus, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of the misinformed facts are merely non-intended human errors.", "Nonetheless, whether it was a mistake or something done on purpose, one of the main problems here is that this trend of wrongly informing AI news may lead to fearmongering. As I said before, AI is a somehow mysterious field that, for years, has been associated with The Terminator, the robot uprising, and the end of the world. So, when we have news saying that a robot killed a man, that another is calling others \u201cnegroes\u201d, or that a Tesla on semi-autopilot caused a deadly accident, the masses will start to associate the idea of AI, the so new called electricity that should benefit the humankind, with the Armageddon or as something detrimental for us, when in reality, it isn\u2019t like that.", "Your home for data science.
