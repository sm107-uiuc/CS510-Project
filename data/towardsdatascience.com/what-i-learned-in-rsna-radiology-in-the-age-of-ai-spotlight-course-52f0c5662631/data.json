His father created a machine learning algorithm (way back in the day) that aided doctors.", "Most of the benefits of machine learning these days come from supervised learning settings. And thanks to the abundance of data AI can now automate a lot of different tasks.", "This is great an all, however, without a large amount of data today\u2019s learning method would not have been successful. Especially in the medical industry where we don\u2019t have a lot of data.", "A model that works well in the research lab might not work well in the real world since the data distribution is different. This change in distribution is very problematic.", "So the question is, how to keep the generalization power of the model? There might not be a clear answer yet, but best practices need to be built in radiology, as a form of regulation.", "Additionally, AI will be used to augment Clinician\u2019s ability rather than replacing them. Computer scientist and radiologist have to work together.", "Fireside Chat and Question & Answer", "To educate both radiologist and computer scientists making a course or a Bootcamp is a good idea. The key to innovation is bringing people together, to solve some of the serious issues we are facing today in Radiology.", "One of that issue is Data labeling, and how to extract information from radiology reports. (More related to NLP tasks).", "How can we explain the model\u2019s decision? Most of the methods that we have are strong black box models (as well as weak black box ones as well).", "Neural Networks are hard to understand and audit, due to having so many parameters. We have no idea what individual role a neuron plays in the system\u2019s point of view, and how each connection is made.", "Another way of putting this issue is the problem of dimensionality since we have so many parameters it is beyond human capability to understand the model with that much parameters. Explaining \u2018what caused what\u2019 is a hard challenge to tackle.", "Finally, there is a transparency problem. (what part of the input data is the model looking at?). Sure we have methods such as deconvolution, integral gradient, Deep LIFT and more, but can we say that this problem has been solved?", "As a radiologist (or researcher) if you want to use Data science (machine learning), should you build your own algorithm or should you collaborate with a company? How clean are the data?", "Those are some interesting ideas to think about, also they have developed a level of data cleanliness ranging from level D to A.", "Level D \u2192 Raw data Level C \u2192 de-identification of the data, ethical approval is needed to access the data. Finally, it is unstructured.Level B \u2192 Structured Data and quality control, no labelsLevel A \u2192 Cleaned and Labeled data", "From all of those steps, getting the ethical approval of the data takes the most amount of time.", "Started the talk with an urban legend of using a neural network to classify tanks, like that the model we use might have a bias.", "When computer systems have an unexpected outcome, we need to know where those errors were made and why they were made.", "In the medical field, there can be three types of bias hospital, Computational, and Cognitive.", "Hospital bias \u2192 different hospitals use different machines to capture data in different manners. A model that has been trained from one hospital data source might not do well from another data source.", "Cognitive bias \u2192 this one is more of human bias since humans tend to behave differently in different situations.", "Interestingly a lot of data related to breast cancer are originating from Europe.", "Some problems in this line of research include different companies using different machines and pre-processing methods to create the mammography images, how can we standardize them?", "This different sources can create bias also patch based analysis was not successful for breast cancer mammography images. Even for segmentation, data labeling is key. Since segmentation is the backbone of a lot of different processes if we don\u2019t get this right might cause some problems.", "CT images are extensively used in medical settings, and there is a lot of potentials when paired with AI, starting from segmentation and classification.", "However, there are also a lot of challenges, in diagnosis such as lung or prostate cancer classification, noise to signal ratio is very critical. And overcoming the serious imbalance data distribution is another challenge. (paired with a small number of training data it gets harder).", "Even though the model might have been trained on natural images, using pre-trained models are a very good idea.", "It was an amazing conference, and I got to meet Dr. Ng! That was a life-changing moment for me. Please click here, to see program details and more. I hope some of the information here helped you as well.", "Your home for data science.
