How it is THE next big technology, how it will solve every problem humanity will ever face. There are lots of exaggerations about this topic, lots of buzz words flying around and news are being produced at an astonishing speed.", "Ignoring all the hype, machine learning really is an incredibly versatile concept. From diagnosis of medical images to self-driving cars, it\u2019s used in a variety of topics.", "Everyone has their own field of expertise. Machine learning is a topic that only comes to life when it is paired with knowledge of a specific domain. As such it is of great importance for anyone to get an understanding of how its basics work.", "Such an understanding enables anyone to find applications for machine learning, chances for automation in his or her own field of expertise.", "The good news: Achieving a conceptual understanding of how machine learning works does NOT require any maths, nor is it particularly hard to understand.", "Don\u2019t read that wrong: Building a business around, implementing, or doing research on machine learning IS difficult. But understanding enough of the basics to identify opportunities for its application? Everyone can do that.", "To prove that claim, I\u2019m going to describe an experiment in which YOU are the machine that learns. From the results of that experiment, I\u2019m going to formulate the general framework that machine learning algorithms follow.", "Even better news: Once you understand the general framework for machine learning, it will be much easier to make sense of trends or buzz words that will eventually pop up.", "Somebody is talking about cars. They\u2019re boasting that they switched their V8 engine with a V12. Even if you don\u2019t know what those specific terms mean, you have a conceptual understanding of how a car works. To simplify things, an engine is the thing that makes a car drive. With that in mind, you can simplify the original statement:", "I switched the V8 for a V12", "I switched the thing that makes the car drive", "Let's start with the experiment. You are the test subject. I will show you a couple of different pictures and your goal is to tell me which of the following to classes they belong to:", "Those names should not mean anything to you, as I\u2019ve just made them up.", "Now here is the first picture. Is it Radebarb or Bigelbub?", "Even if you\u2019re not sure where this is going, just choose a class for now.", "And the correct answer is\u2026. Radebarb. Keep that in mind for the rest of the experiment.", "And the correct answer is\u2026. Radebarb, again.", "And the answers are\u2026. Bigelbub for the first, Radebarb for the second picture.", "So let's break down what just happened in the experiment. First, note the following two things:", "Those are the same preconditions that a machine learning model faces when it is trained. It has no inherent knowledge about what might be important on the photos it\u2019s shown, or what the relation between the classes are.", "In this stage, you were shown the first image. The best you can do here is guess. If I\u2019d ask you to write down how sure you are about your guess, it\u2019d be something like this:", "You\u2019ve received the first bit of information in the last stage. The picture you were shown was Radebarb. In the second stage, you were shown another image.", "It doesn\u2019t look much different than the previous one, but then again you still don\u2019t really know what to look for. So maybe your confidence about the classes look something like this:", "Now it\u2019s getting clearer. One picture looks just like the previous two, but the other one looks completely different. Surely that tipped your confidence:", "At first, all you could do is taking random guesses. After each guess, the correct class was revealed to you. With that information, you updated your notion of \u2018Radebarb\u2019 and \u2018Bigelbub\u2019, getting more and more sure about the characteristics of both classes.", "This is the general concept that underlies supervised learning. The following section formalizes this concept and introduces some commonly used notation.", "Have a look at the following flowchart:", "This flowchart summarizes what happened in the experiment. Let\u2019s use it to derive the general framework for how machine learning works.", "And that\u2019s it! You know have a basic understanding of how machine learning works. In following articles I will use this framework to describe difficulties that arise when actually using machine learning to solve real-world tasks, so stay tuned if you\u2019re interested in that!", "Your home for data science.
