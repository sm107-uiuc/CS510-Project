We will apply the algorithm on a classic and easily understandable dataset. In this article, you\u2019ll get more familiar with the basics of Pytorch. Afterwards, you should be ready to dive into more advanced problems (e.g. time series).", "The structure of the article is the following:", "The dataset that will be used is the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset \u2014 which is perfect to demonstrate binary classification.", "The problem is straightforward. Scientists collected features on patients with (malignant) or without (benign) breast cancer. Our job is to detect right from wrong. This can aid processing doctors data in their daily jobs. The reason behind breast cancer as an example is because of its relevancy. In 2018, it was estimated that 627.000 women worldwide died of breast cancer alone [WHO, 2020].", "In this dataset, there are 30 features (e.g. mean radius, mean texture).", "The target mapping is straightforward. The features indicate that you have a malignant or benign tumour. Most tumours are benign, which means they are not cancerous and will not kill you.", "Firstly, a model is created with training data and afterwards, testing is done using test data. This should be a surprise if you are familiar with the field. Therefore, the code above splits the data up into a random training and test subset with sklearn. One line of code, but very important.", "To have better results, a bit of scaling is important. We don\u2019t want one feature to dominate the other. What we can do is making sure the data is nicely distributed. Nothing new here, a machine learning course might help if you are unfamiliar with standardizing features (e.g. deeplearning.ai).", "You can do this yourself, but why re-invent the wheel right? For this task, the StandardScaler of sklearn can be used. It\u2019s a subtle detail, but it\u2019s important to scale the test set in the same way as the training set. Because the training set is much larger as the testing set and both are chosen randomly, it should be a better estimate for the actual distribution.", "The model of interest is a very simple linear one. In the example, it shows how you can create your own Pytorch \u2018module\u2019, but you could have done it with a one-liner as well. The same thing could be done like this as well. So feel free to use one-liner if you like that more. However, this article intends to inform. It is this easy to create a custom neural network in Pytorch.", "One more thing you could have noticed is that we didn\u2019t use the sigmoid activation function, but this is explainable. Instead of using the binary cross-entropy loss function combined with the sigmoid function, the binary cross-entropy with logits loss function is favoured here. The latter is numerically more stable, which in turn leads to better results.", "Finally, the Adam optimizer has been used. There might be a better optimizing algorithm out there, but it performed rather well. No need to experiment with others yet.", "The rest of the code is just a full gradient descent loop and the calculation of training and test accuracy. In every epoch the following steps happen:", "It would be stupid to not give the full code at this point. Feel free to play around with the algorithm and dataset yourself.", "Tip: Use Google Colab, it\u2019s like Jupiter notebook on steroids \u2014 incredibly easy to get started with as well.", "The results of the binary classification algorithm are about 98% accuracy on both the training and test set \u2014 amazing, isn\u2019t it? And it didn\u2019t require all that much effort either. If you spot any improvements to this article please let me know in the comments down below.
