Its versatility allows detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of complex samples, whether in solid, liquid or gaseous form. Moreover, the analyzed sample can be of any size or shape, including powders, slurries and aerosols. LIBS instrument can be made rugged, portable, and can be deployed in any environment, including hazardous ones. Only an optical access to the sample is required, and measurements can be made at distances of several tens of meters. Data acquisition is fast and the operation of LIBS instrument can be easily automated.", "Among the different analytical techniques available, LIBS can be categorized as a multi-elemental spectrochemical technique that is governed by the physics of laser\u2013matter interaction (such an interaction has a huge influence upon LIBS measurements since it controls all the intermediate physical processes such as electron and ion heating, thermal diffusion, particle ablation and kinetics, and plasma formation and expansion).", "In practice, LIBS is performed by focusing an intense laser beam (usually from a pulsed nanosecond Nd:YAG laser) onto a sample surface in order to create a hot ionized gas of the ablated material (the so-called plasma plume). The plasma light, which comes from the recombination of the excited species, emits atomic emission lines characteristic of the elements present in the sample, is then collected and introduced into a spectrometer in which it is dispersed into discrete wavelengths. The acquisition of LIBS spectra (using a gated CCD camera) is done once the plasma temperature and electron density have dropped sufficiently, and the condition of observing the atomic lines is optimal.", "The figure below illustrates a typical LIBS spectrum obtained from a soil sample showing strong emission lines from various chemical elements.", "Because of its unique characteristics, interest in LIBS has spread rapidly. This interest is well illustrated by the number of research articles published annually. The same is true for the number of industrial applications, which has rapidly grown in recent years, for example in environmental analysis, metallurgical industry, archeology, biology, safety, and in space exploration. For example, since august 19, 2012, the ChemCam LIBS instrument developed by the U.S. DOE\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory and the French CESR laboratory to explore the crater Gale on Mars as part of NASA\u2019s Mars Science Laboratory curiosity mission has provided thousands of valuable analyses of the elemental compositions of the Martian rock and soil. SuperCam which is the improved version of ChemCam is planned to launch in summer 2020, through the rover mission, and to land within Jezero crater in winter 2021.", "Over the past few decades, the use of chemometric methods in LIBS, especially first-order multivariate calibration curve, has significantly improve its analytical performance, since multivariate statistical methods have allowed to exploit the redundant information typically present in the LIBS spectra. In chemometrics, calibration models are built from multivariate regression methods and are trained in order to learn the spectra\u2013concentration relationship, before predicting the analyte concentration from an unknown sample. But first let us define the term \u201cfirst-order calibration\u201d.", "In mathematics, tensors are algebraic objects that can be represented by a scalar (tensor of order 0 with rank 0), a vector (tensor of order 1 with rank 1), and a matrix (tensor of order 2 with rank equivalent to the rank of its matrix). In chemometrics, the order of a tensor refers to as the number of mode or space spanned by the tensor. The rank of a tensor (although not fully understood, especially for high-order tensors) can be defined as the minimum number of rank-1 tensors whose linear combination reproduce that tensor. Which is different from the rank of a matrix, which is defined in linear algebra as the maximum number of linearly independent elements (either vectors of row or column). To put it another way or in chemometrics terms,", "\u201cThe rank of two-way matrix is the minimum number of bilinear (PCA) components needed to reproduce the matrix. Whereas, the rank of three-way array is the minimum number of trilinear (PARAFAC) components needed to reproduce the array\u201d. Rasmus Bro", "When the measured responses from a number of samples are scalars (zeroth-order tensors) they can be arranged in a vector, thus giving a one-way data structure (e.g. pH measurements of several solutions). On the other hand, if the responses are first-order tensors, they give rise to a two-way data structure (e.g. LIBS spectral data, which provides a set of emission intensity at different wavelengths). Finally, working with two instruments (e.g. LIBS working in tandem with a Raman spectrometer) or a set of second-order responses (e.g. LIBS measurements of transient systems) involve handling three-dimensional arrays of data, i.e. three-way structures. To generalize, a set of ith-order data from each of the analyzed samples creates an (i+1)-way structure.", "We define a calibration curve as a model developed from a set of certified reference materials or CRMs (i.e. samples whose properties are accurately defined and certified by an accredited laboratory or agency) or of reference samples (i.e. samples that were previously analyzed from a well-established method), where the analyte contents and LIBS spectra are known (figures below illustrate typical linear and quadratic calibration curves). Note that the classical calibration curve built upon a single-value response, e.g. the signal of an emission line, from a set of calibration samples, is an example of a zeroth-order calibration model.", "Calibration curves are usually provided along with the corresponding confidence and prediction limits, as shown in the figures below.", "The confidence limits (LCL and UCL) give an interval about the estimated mean (i.e. calculated from repeated measurements), which cover the population mean with probability 1\u2212\u03b1 (with \u03b1 = 0.05, the confidence level is 95%). Whereas, the prediction limits (LPL and UPL) give prediction uncertainty of the concentration of a new sample (\u0109) with probability 1\u2212\u03b1.", "It is important to note that the sensitivity of univariate calibration models (i.e. the slope of the regression line) will depend on the spectroscopic features of the emission line. This line is generally chosen according to three main criteria: (1) the most intense, (2) unlikely to be self-absorbed, and (3) free of spectral interference. On the other hand, in multivariate calibration models, the sensitivity will be affected according to whether one chooses to take into account the entire spectrum or to select some spectral lines. Besides, it is often more appropriate to work with the area under the curve (peak area) instead of peak intensity. Straightforward approaches to estimate peak area is by fitting the peak with Gaussian or Lorentzian profile or by using numerical integration techniques such as Newton-Cotes formulas (e.g. trapezoidal rule) or Gaussian quadrature.", "So, after familiarizing ourselves with the basics of univariate calibration curves, it is now interesting to note that multivariate calibration can be classified as either direct or inverse with respect to the spectra-concentration relationship. In the direct multivariate calibration model, the LIBS signal is assumed to be proportional to the analyte concentration. This model appears to be a generalization of the classical univariate model and it can be estimated by classical least squares (CLS) regression. Whereas in the inverse multivariate calibration, the concentration is assumed to be proportional to the LIBS signal. In this approach, the regression coefficients are estimated from a set of calibration samples via inverse least squares (ILS).", "In the following, we will see that ILS regression (i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR)) has limited applicability, especially when dealing with highly correlated predictors (LIBS spectra) or with less samples than variables including complexes matrix effects. Fortunately, a number of alternative regression methods have been proposed to deal with such conditions.", "Signal = Sensitivity \u00d7 Concentration + Errors", "Concentration = Signal \u00d7 Regression Coefficient + Errors", "The advantage of using inverse calibration over direct calibration stemmed from the fact that the letter can be applied when we only know the concentrations of the analyte of interest in the calibration samples, but know nothing about those of other constituents. So that inverse multivariate calibration enables not only to predict the concentration of an analyte but also to predict the physical properties of a sample (for example, we published a research article in which we were abale to predict the fraction of soils particle size based solely on LIBS spectra). This fundamental concept is the basis of chemometric methods applied to LIBS quantitative analysis. Therefore, in the following discussions, we will only be interested in the inverse calibration equation, which can be written as:", "where c is an n\u00d71 vector of analyte concentrations (or of the sample physical propriety), S is an n\u00d7p matrix that contains the LIBS signal for n calibration samples measured at p different wavelengths, b is an p\u00d71 vector of the model\u2019s regression coefficients relating each concentration with the LIBS spectra, and e is an n\u00d71 vector of the concentration residuals. Thus, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of the unknown regression coefficients such that we minimize the sum of squared errors of the residuals is given by:", "S+ is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of S. The superscript \u201ct\u201d means \u201ctranspose\u201d. The predicted concentration \u0109 is given by:", "where H is the hat matrix and S\u1d57S is the covariance matrix (dimension p\u00d7p), which is a square matrix. A geometric interpretation of the above equation is that \u0109 is obtained by projecting c orthogonally onto S-space, using H as the orthogonal projection matrix.", "It is worth mentioning that the inverse calibration equation represents a system of n equations (i.e. the number of calibration samples) with p unknowns (i.e. the number of regression coefficients to be estimated, which coincides with the number of spectral wavelengths). In LIBS, the number of different wavelengths of ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared light are generally on the order of tens of thousands (using any mid-resolution broadband Echelle spectrometer), so that p>>n (which is commonly known as the curse of dimensionality).", "We face here our first issue with MLR applied to LIBS data, since solving the equation requires more calibration samples than wavelengths.", "Preparing a large number of calibration samples is usually not considered a viable option since it requires additional cost in addition to being time-consuming. Furthermore, even if we are able to add more calibration samples to solve this equation, the covariance matrix must be invertible (i.e. a non-singular matrix). On the other hand, the covariance matrix is singular if at least one predictor variable is (1) proportional to another variable, (2) a linear combination of other variables, (3) constant, and (4) there are more variables than observations.", "We face now our second issue, since multicollinearity in the high dimensional LIBS data make the covariance matrix singular.", "The fact that the square matrix S\u1d57S is not of full rank p have a profound impact on the choice and applicability of several machine learning methods. Indeed, it is for this reason that chemometrics practitioners prefer machine learning methods that do not need the inverse of the covariance matrix. That\u2019s why, decomposition and shrinkage regression methods have been proposed to deal with such ill-conditioned problems. Well-known linear methods are:", "In the following, I will give a brief description of these regression methods, especially PCR, PLSR and RR.", "PCR has been proposed as a technique that reduce the number of predictors to a smaller set of uncorrelated components (latent variables) and performs least squares regression on these components. In PCR the components are obtained as the principal components (PCs) from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the predictor data, i.e. the calibration spectra S. By doing so, PCR offers an alternative approach when the predictors are highly collinear. S is decomposed (or factored) into a product of (object) scores T (n \u00d7 r) and (variable) loadings P (p \u00d7 r). T summaries the relationship (similarities or differences) between the analyzed samples, whilst P summaries the relationship (positive or negative correlation) between variables (or wavelengths). The number of columns in T and P is equal to the rank r of S, and it is usually smaller than n or p.", "In the following, we assume that T and P only contain the first j columns, referring to the number of PCs retained which is typically selected via cross-validation. Usually, S is mean-centered by subtracting its mean.", "The inverse calibration equation can be rewritten as:", "The PC scores T are used as regressors for the concentrations, and are determined by T = SP. Thus, by applying inverse calibration equation, the analyte concentrations c are correlated with the scores T, instead of the original data matrix S. The vector of regression coefficients of size j \u00d71 is given by:", "The predicted concentration \u0109 is given by", "where T+ is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of T. This solves the multicollinearity problems since the inversion of T\u1d57T is trivial, since this is a diagonal matrix due to the fact that the columns of T are orthogonal. Recall that the inverse of a diagonal matrix is simply given by a diagonal matrix whose elements are the inverse of the original ones.", "PLSR has been proposed as a way to improve PCR, by introducing the information regarding the analyte concentrations in the estimation of the latent variables. In other word, PLSR employs latent variables which are c-dependent, while PCR employs latent variables which are independent of c. As in PCR, an inverse calibration model is developed by correlating the analyte concentrations c with sample scores T. The mathematical relationship is formally identical to that for PCR. Difference lies in the manner in which the PLSR score matrix is estimated. It can be shown that the regression coefficients vector is given by:", "R (or often called W*) is the weight matrix, whereas W is the loadings weights. Contrary to PCR, T is determined by T = SR. PLSR easily handle multicollinearity because no issue is found in the inversion of P\u1d57W, since P and W are respectively orthogonal and orthonormal matrices. Before going further, I would like to mention here that orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) regression, which is a modified version of PLSR will be the subject of a future discussion.", "Although PLSR is the most popular regression method in chemometrics, other modern machine learning methods based on regularized least squares approaches such as ridge regression are often used in multivariate calibration. In RR, the objective function to be minimized can be written as:", "I is the identity matrix and \u03bb is the regularization parameter determined via cross-validation. In regards to LIBS data, the most important aspect in ridge regression is that the matrix inversion required for determining b is always possible, even when the covariance matrix is singular and cannot be inverted. Thus, RR deals with multicollinearity by penalizing high variance coefficients.", "PLSR (maximum covariance between S et c) forms a compromise between MLR (maximum correlation between S et c) and PCR (maximum variance in S). This has lead Stone and Brooks to develop a method that is a continuum of the above regression methods, with MLR, PLSR and PCR as special cases.", "PCovR is a continuum regression that combines PCR and the reduced rank regression.", "In order to select the best appropriate chemometric methods to use, any physical property or chemical interaction that affects the linearity of the data must be taken into account. It is for this reason that multi-way and particularly three-way data analysis has become an important subject in chemometrics (e.g. well-known methods based upon low-rank tensor decomposition are Tucker3, PARAFAC and N-PLS). Tucker3 (T3) and Parallel Factor analysis (PARAFAC) also known as Canonical Decomposition (CANDECOMP) or Canonical Polyadic decomposition (CP) are the higher order generalizations of the matrix singular value decomposition (SVD) and of the bilinear PCA, while N-PLS generalizes the bilinear PLS. As previously mentioned, three-way data array (i.e. second-order tensor) is defined by n rows (mode 1), p columns (mode 2) and k horizontal slices often called tube (mode 3).", "A straightforward approach to three-way analysis is to unfold the three-way data array into k\u00d7(n\u00d7p), n\u00d7(k\u00d7p), and p\u00d7(n\u00d7k) two-way table, which can then be analyzed according to the regression methods outlined in the previous section.
