More specifically, it seems like we cannot construct the solutions to the quintic (equation of degree 5) or higher using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and radicals (square roots, cube roots, etc). Why is that, what\u2019s so special about the number 5? These were questions that haunted the young Frenchman Evariste Galois in the early 1800s, and the night before he was fatally wounded in a duel, he wrote down a theory of a new mathematical object called a \u201cgroup\u201d that solves the issue in a surprisingly elegant way.", "This is how he did it.", "The set of roots of different equations are of different complexity. Some sets are so complex that they cannot be expressed using only simple objects such as radicals. But how do we measure the complexity of the roots if we cannot even calculate them, and what measure of complexity should we use?", "The answer lies in the symmetry of the roots.", "Symmetry of the roots you may ask, what does that have to do with anything? What does it even mean?", "Let\u2019s plot the roots of two equations and see if we can make sense of it:", "The left one is said to be less symmetric than the right one. This might surprise you, because in the colloquial sense of the word, symmetric is usually used if one can reflect or rotate the object without changing the way it looks. In that sense, the left picture looks more symmetric.", "For example: The star is more symmetric than the heart, because aside from reflecting it, one can also rotate it.", "But in our case, we are going to take a more general view of symmetries. We are not restricting ourselves to only reflections and rotations, any function that transforms the object without changing the way it looks is fair game. In the case of the roots, that means that any function that interchanges (permutes) the roots in any way is valid. More functions means more symmetric.", "It turns out that in the right case, there are functions for permuting all the roots in any conceivable order, as many as 5!=120, so it is highly symmetric. But in the left case, if we interchange r\u2082\u2194r\u2084 using the transformation i\u2194\u2212i we necessarily also interchange r\u2081\u2194r\u2085. This restricts us, and thus all conceivable permutations are not possible. It is less symmetric.", "The functions that permute the roots are called \u201cAutomorphisms\u201d, and if we group those automorphisms together we get what is called a \u201cGroup\u201d (I will get back to better definitions of automorphisms and groups later on).", "This means that the group that represents the symmetries of the roots is larger and more complex in the right case. In fact, the group in the right case is so complex that the roots cannot be described using radicals.", "How do we know how complex a group is? To understand this we need a bit more theory.", "First, let\u2019s take a look at the size of a group. How do I know that there are some quintics that have a 5! large group?", "A general quintic normally looks like this:", "But if we take a more \u201croot-centric\u201d approach we can say that it looks like this:", "That is, the constant a,b,c,d,e in the first equation is replaced by a symmetric combination of the roots:", "Looking at all the terms in detail, one discovers that interchanging the roots does not affect the equation (try it for b above for example). This is true for polynomials of any degree. Since we are able to interchange all the roots, we can draw the conclusion that the symmetry group for this general quintic is in fact all permutations, also called S\u2085 (the symmetric group of order 5).", "Now we are going to expand our definition of automorphisms a bit, as they are more than just functions that permute roots. In the process we need to introduce something called \u201cfields\u201d. Why would we want to do that, you say? The reason is, that while working with roots and their permutations is fun, it\u2019s a bit easier to work with fields and their automorphisms. It is exactly the same functions, don\u2019t worry, just another way to look at them.", "So, if the equation is, say x\u00b2\u20132=0, instead of working with the roots, r\u2081=\u221a2, r\u2082=\u2212\u221a2 we are going to introduce the field Q(\u221a2). This is all the rational numbers Q with an added \u221a2. \u221a2 is called a \u201cfield extension\u201d. It looks like this: a+b\u221a2 a,b\u2208Q. To be able to describe the root of the equation we need the field Q(\u221a2). For every field extension (and also other mathematical objects) we have bunch of functions, \u03c3\u2099, that sends a number to another unique number in the same field and follow the condition \u03c3(a+b)=\u03c3(a)+\u03c3(b) and \u03c3(ab)=\u03c3(a)\u03c3(b). \u03c3 is a function of the extension and does not touch the underlying field Q. These function are called automorphisms. Incidentally, they also permutes the roots. This is because for the root r:", "This means that \u03c3(r) is also a solution to the equation. And since:", "the roots are distinct, so we have 5 of them, which must be the original 5. Thus \u03c3 must permute the roots.", "Of course, this works for an equation of any degree.", "The roots are (1,\u221a2,\u2013\u221a2) (you can verify this yourself by just plugging them in), so the field must be Q(\u221a2)", "Writing down all the ways we can think of to permute the roots (e means identity permutation, it does nothing):", "So far so good. Another one.", "Apparently \u03c3\u2082 is not an automorphism, so we will have to scrap it. The other \u03c3 runs into similar problems, the only ones remaining are e and \u03c3\u2081. This is called the cyclic group C\u2082 since we can only permute in a circle (a very small circle in this case).", "using \u03b6 for brevity. This is what it what it looks like:", "One can play around with the root permutations a bit, and will soon notice that in this case they are all automorphisms. Thus there are 3! automorphisms, which is all the root permutations, so the group must be S\u2083.", "Another fun thing to notice about the image above is that it looks like an equilateral triangle and that the automorphisms exactly corresponds to rotating and reflecting the triangle. If the automorphisms corresponds to the symmetries of a regular polygon in this way, the group is called a \u201cDihedral group\u201d. In this case D\u2083. Usually the group of all permutations S\u2099 is not the same as the dihedral group D\u2099, but in the case of n=3 it is.", "This seems to be a good place to segue into a little lengthier discussion about groups. So, groups started out as collections of permutations of roots, but can also be seen as collections of automorphisms, or rotations and reflections of symmetrical geometrical objects. Any collection of functions that changes an object in such a way that it looks the same can be considered a group. But, we can actually look at the transformations themselves without bothering about the symmetric object that they act upon. Much in the same way that we do not bother about piles of apples when we do arithmetic, we simply follow the rules, similarly we can define some rules that the transformations of a group follow, and use them.", "The rules are something like this:", "If we first do a transform, and then another one we will get a third transform that is still in the group. For example, the group C\u2084 is the group of all rotations one can do on a square. If a is rotating 90\u2218, b is rotating 180\u2218 and c is rotating 270\u2218 then a\u2217b=c. Where \u2217 means, first do b then a, commonly called multiplication since it is (kind of) similar to multiplication of numbers. According to the rule above, c has to be in the group. This is called closure.", "There has to be an identity element (e) that does nothing at all.", "For every element there has to be a reverse of that element.", "Now, we can investigate the features of different group without having to worry about roots or polygons.", "Two fun way to visualize groups are:", "The above is the Caylay table for an equilateral triangle, the D\u2083 group. It is all the elements of the group and what elements we get when we multiply them. For example, if we first do a 120\u2218 rotation (r) and then the same rotation again we get a 240\u2218 rotation rr=r\u00b2 as can be seen in the table. If we do a 120\u2218 rotation-flip rf and a r we end up with just a flip. Notice how the elements f and r does not commute. A group were the element commute is called a abelian group.", "This particular table is still very symmetric though, but that doesn\u2019t need to be the case. Any scrambling around of the elements that follow the rules is valid.", "The above is the D\u2083 Caylay graph. Here the elements are displayed in a way to show how to get from one element to the next, where the edges are the operations. In this case a 120\u2218 rotation and a flip is necessary, these (r and f) are also called the generators of the group because one can generate the whole group with them, starting from the identity element.", "Groups tend to be useful everywhere where there is symmetry. For example, the wallpaper groups are used to describe symmetric wallpapers. There are some wallpapers that can be rotated 180\u2218 and some wallpapers that can be reflected and some where we can do both, and so on. It turns out that there are only 17 of them so it is a neat way of classifying wallpapers.", "The above wallpapers both belongs a group called p6m.", "Another, more surprising, use of groups is in physics. It seems like the laws of nature follow certain symmetries. For example, if one transform Newtons second law F=ma, 10 minutes into the future it is still the same. That the laws of nature does not change from one day to the next seems to indicate that they are symmetrical with regard to time-transformation. Neither do they change from one place to the next so transformations in space are also allowed. Since it is possible to transform time and space in arbitrarily small or large chunks the groups describing these, Lie groups, contains an infinite amount of elements.", "Interestingly it turns out that these symmetries are all related to a conservation law each. Time symmetry entails the conservation of energy, space symmetry the conservation of momentum, angular symmetry (nature looks the same from all angles) the conservation of angular momentum and so on. This was show by Emmy Noether by just combining the symmetries with the principle of least action, a law of nature that states that nature tend to \u201ctake the shortest path\u201d.", "I find it interesting how much of all the complexity and apparent chaos of nature can be explained by such intuitive concepts as \u201claws of nature does not change from day to day\u201d and \u201cnature tend to take the shortest path\u201d.", "End of intermezzo, where were we? Right, we were talking about x\u00b3\u22123=0 and its roots and fields.", "The field of that equation is Q(\u00b3\u221a2, \u03b6) and it would be natural to think that it looks like this: a+b\u00b3\u221a2+c\u03b6, but that is wrong. The reason for this is that we want our field to be \u201cClosed\u201d. That is, if we add or multiply two elements in the field we want to stay in the field. So for example \u00b3\u221a2 and \u03b6 are both in the above field but \u00b3\u221a2\u03b6 is not.", "Looking at our examples of degree 3 above we have", "It would seem like the second field and group are more complex than the first field and group. We can guess this by just counting the number of terms in the field case or the number of automorphisms in the group case. But just counting does not seem to really capture what it means to be complex. Take for example the group C\u2081\u2082. Lots of elements, but it only rotates the roots, so it doesn\u2019t really seem all that complex. A corresponding field is Q(e^\u03c0/6). It will contain e^\u03c0/6,e^2\u03c0/6\u2026 but again, not very complex.", "Worrying about how complex a group is is going to be key to understanding why some roots can\u2019t be described by only radicals, remember.", "To get a better way of appreciating the complexity we are going to introduce the concept of a \u201cSubfield\u201d and a \u201cSubgroup\u201d. A subfield is when you remove some of the terms but you still have a closed field. Similarly, a subgroup is when you remove some of the automorphisms but still have a closed group.", "In the first case Q(\u221a2), the only thing one can do is remove the \u221a2 in the field and one of the two automorphisms in the group (we cannot remove (e) and still have a group).", "As for the second case Q(\u00b3\u221a2, \u03b6), it gets a bit more complicated. One can manually distill the sub-field/groups by just removing elements one at a time and see if the resulting field/group is closed. After a while we arrive at this:", "Interesting, both the field and the group have four constituents. Now, it would be a reasonable guess that the subgroups always contains exactly the automorphisms of the subfields. But they don\u2019t.", "Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re almost there, it\u2019s just a tiny bit more complicated. To see this, let\u2019s have a look at the field Q(\u2074\u221a2, i) and its subfields.", "The field Q(\u2074\u221a2, i) has the permutation-group D\u2084 (same as a square). Let\u2019s look at D\u2084 and it\u2019s subgroups.", "The subgroup lattice is upside down in this picture with D\u2084 at the bottom, I will get to that shortly, but let\u2019s first look at the subfields contra the subgroups. Q(\u2074\u221a2, i) has 5 large subfields and 3 small sub-subfields, but D\u2084 only has large 3 subgroups and 5 smaller sub-subgroups.", "It would seem like there are not enough large groups to permute the 5 large fields. If you were to play around with the subgroups and subfields you would eventually come to the conclusion that the subgroups actually permute not the subfields, but rather everything that is not in the subfields, that they \u201cfix\u201d or do not touch the subfields.", "Why is it this way rather than the other way around, as we first guessed?", "I don\u2019t have an intuitive way of explaining this, the way I see it is that we discovered it empirically and now we can try to prove it. The proof goes sort of like this:", "We want to show that if we turn the subgroup lattice upside down we get a one-to-one correspondence with the subfield lattice where the fields are the fixed fields of the groups.", "First, I would like to point out that it is reasonable (sort of) that this is the case. At the bottom group, we have all the automorphisms, who of course move around everything except Q (fixes Q), and at the top, we only have the e-automorphism, which moves around nothing (fixes everything).", "If we start at the bottom group and remove a few of the automorphisms, the removed automorphisms will no longer move around a small part of the field and will thus fix that part of the field. As we remove more automorphisms a larger and larger part of the field will be unaffected and thus we will have a larger fixed field.", "To be a bit more rigorous we will need to be able to compare the size of the group and the field. The group size is, of course, the number of automorphisms in it. The size of the field is the number of terms. These two happen to be the same, but why is this the case?", "Now, we could look at the S\u2085 subgroup lattice of the quintic and see that indeed it looks pretty complex. But in order to tie this together with radicals we need a way to analyze complexity between groups and its subgroups. That is: How much more complex is D\u2084 than C\u2084 for example? To do this we introduce the concept of a \u201cQuotient\u201d. A quotient is basically group division. How does that work?", "In ordinary division we do something like this: To divide 15 apples on 5 persons, we group the apples in the apple-set in 5 equal piles and every pile will correspond to a person in the person-set. The answer to the question 15/5 is 3, one of the piles, any pile will do since they are equal.", "A similar thing happens when we divide groups. To divide D\u2084 by C\u2084 we group the 8 elements of D\u2084 in 4 equal groups, one for each element in C\u2084. How do we make the groups equal? It\u2019s not like the elements are all identical apples. They can be very different automorphisms for example. Well, quotients are not always possible for exactly that reason. But sometimes a group can be divided into \u201cCosets\u201d. Say we divide D\u2084 in 4 equal parts with 2 elements in each. If we are lucky we can have 4 piles of elements where the relation between the two elements are the same in all of the piles. To be able to do this the original group have to display a high level of self similarity. To see this, let\u2019s look at a Cayley graph of D\u2084.", "As one can see there is in fact a high level of self similarity here. The top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right corner all looks the same. This is our cosets.", "Now, by introducing quotients we actually have a concept of how to build groups from the ground up. Just as 21 consists of 3 and 7, so do groups consist of their subgroups. And just as we can get the constituents of a number by dividing, 21/7=3, so we can get the constituents of a group by taking the quotient. Since D\u2084/C\u2084=C\u2082, this means that if we have a C\u2084 group, we have to multiply it by C\u2082 to get to D\u2084. Since there is a correspondence between fields and groups, this will play a role in how we construct fields.", "Now, I wont show a picture of the group lattice of S\u2085 because it is too big, but I will say a couple of things about its subgroups. One of the subgroups is A\u2085 (Alternating group) which is easily checked. To get from A\u2085 to S\u2085 we need S\u2085/A\u2085=C\u2082. Thus, we can get there by radicals, but: One subgroup of A\u2085 is (e), but A\u2085/e is not a cyclic group. This is true for any An with n\u22655 by the way. Thus we cannot get there by radicals and alas, any polynomial of degree\u22655 cannot be solved by radicals.", "And that is how Galois, as a teenager, invented the concept of a group to prove a long standing open question about the unsolvability of the quintic\u2079.", "One fun bonus fact we get from the machinery surrounding Galois theory, in this case the tower law for fields, is a nice proof of a problem that stumped humanity since the ancient Greeks, namely: The impossibility of trisecting an angle with a straightedge and a compass. Apparently the Greeks loved to draw things in this manner and were curious about the limitations of the method.", "One example is finding a point in the middle of two other points. To do this, set the compass on the two point and draw first a circle around one and then around the other. Use the straightedge as a ruler and draw a line between the points and then between the points where the circles cross. The middle is were the lines cross.", "But how does this way of drawing translate to field theory? Well, one can see the above problem as, say we have a field of two points, (x\u2081,y\u2081) and (x\u2082,y\u2082). We would like to extend the field to also contain the middle point. To do this we find the intersections of the circles (x\u2212x\u2081)\u00b2+(y\u2212y\u2081)\u00b2=r and (x\u2212x\u2082)\u00b2+(y\u2212y\u2082)\u00b2=r. We get two new points (x\u2083, y\u2083) and (x\u2084,y\u2084). The line between them is y=(y\u2084\u2212y\u2083)/(x\u2084\u2212x\u2083)x. The line between the first two points is y=(y\u2082\u2212y\u2081)/(x\u2082\u2212x\u2081)x. Solve for x to get were they cross.", "Apparently, straightedge and compass constructions amount to solving equations of degree one and two.", "But what does trisecting an angle amounts to?", "But since using a straightedge and compass was the same as solving one and two dimensional equations the only field extensions possible is 2 for one operation, and then using the new points we can get to powers of 2: 4,8,16 etc but never 3.", "Although it\u2019s impossible to trisect the angle using only a straightedge and compass it is possible using origami.", "It should be said that, although the general quintic cannot be solved by radicals, it can be solved by the \u201cJacobi theta function\u201d.", "Your home for data science.
