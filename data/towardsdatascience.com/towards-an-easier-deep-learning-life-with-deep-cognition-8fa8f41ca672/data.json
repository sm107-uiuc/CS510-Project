Btw, if you want to know more about that just check this out:", "To try the new features I\u2019m going to show you you need to download the latest version of their DLS:", "Deep Learning Studio has added a feature which will let users convert the models to Tensorflow, Caffe, Keras2, MXNet, CNTK, Pytorch, or ONNX.", "You can now copy the converted code and use it in favorite deep learning framework.", "This is so cool because if for some reason you need to create a Pytorch code, but you only know Keras, now you can transform your code very easily.", "If you haven\u2019t heard of it, JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter. It offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user inteface that can be extended through third party extensions.", "JupyterLab is an interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code and data. Most importantly, JupyterLab has full support for Jupyter notebooks.", "JupyterLab provides a high level of integration between notebooks, documents, and activities:", "JupyterLab is built on top of an extension system that enables you to customize and enhance JupyterLab by installing additional extensions.", "And now is there for you inside of DLS:", "And yes!

A must if you want to improve your data integration workflows.", "I really think GUIs and AutoML are the near future of getting things done with Deep Learning. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love coding, but I think the amount of code we will be writing next years will decay.", "We cannot spend so many hours worldwide programming the same stuff over and over again, so I think these two features (GUIs and AutoML) will help Data Scientist on getting more productive and solving more problems.", "Download the new DLS, check this new features and share it with others!", "Thanks for reading this.
