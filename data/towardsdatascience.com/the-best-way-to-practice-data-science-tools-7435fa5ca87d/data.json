Math, statistics, and software skills are required to create a data science product. On top of these tools, you need to have analytical thinking skills and domain knowledge to be able to come up with ideas to create value out of data.", "In such a broad field, you need both theoretical knowledge and practical skills to do outstanding work. Although some companies divide roles in the pipeline of creating products, the role of data scientists should cover the entire pipeline to some extent.", "In this post, we will focus on the practical side and how to improve your skillset in that manner.", "Since data science is such a popular field, there is a wide variety of software tools and new ones are released in no time. The best way to learn these tools is to practice. You can read the documentation, articles, or watch tutorials. However, when it comes to actual \u201clearning\u201d, you need to practice a lot.", "There are numerous options for practicing but I think the best one is Stackoverflow. I will try to explain why.", "Stackoverflow, in case you haven\u2019t visited yet, is a website where people ask questions and get answers from other people. It carries an enormous knowledge about lots of different topics. Since I started my data science journey, I don\u2019t remember a day in which I did not look for something on Stackoverflow.", "In this post, I will write about how Stackoverflow can be and should be used for practicing.", "First of all, the resource is limitless. For instance, as of now, there are more than 167 K questions tagged Pandas, the most widely-used data analysis library.", "Let\u2019s be more specific and search for \u201clist comprehension python\u201d. There are more than 12 K questions which are more than enough for practice.", "It is highly unlikely that a common issue or problem has not been discussed on Stackoverflow. Thus, what it offers is a book of practice questions with infinite number of pages.", "Just read the questions and try to come up with a solution. The questions are answered in a very short time so you have the chance to assess your solution.", "If you can\u2019t come up with a solution, read what other people did. Try to understand how they approach the problem and solve it.", "Pay attention to the difference in solutions. There is almost always more than one solution to a problem. By comparing and evaluating different perspectives, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of a subject.", "The questions are usually from real-life use cases. People working in the data science domain may be asking about the problems that arose in their daily tasks. Thus, you will be working on typical issues you may encounter while working as a data scientist.", "There are also questions from data science enthusiasts who are working on projects or assignments. Spending time on those questions will also improve your skills.", "The best way to learn something is to teach it to someone. On Stackoverflow, you not only solve a question but also need to explain your solution. It needs to be clear and communicated well to get upvotes. You have to be good at delivering what you do. It will definitely improve your storytelling skill which is a fundamental task for data scientists.", "Last but not least, you have a chance to help others who struggle at solving their tasks, issues, or assignments. It feels good to help someone you don\u2019t even know in person. That\u2019s an efficient motivation!", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
