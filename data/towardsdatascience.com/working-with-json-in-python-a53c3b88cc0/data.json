We are going to learn what JSON is, why it exists, why people use it and finally how to utilise the power of python to help us process it.", "As a data scientist, programmer or simply an avid learner of technology, it is important that you understand what JSON is and how to use it. I am certain that you will find numerous applications for it once you understand it.", "JSON stands for JavaScript Object notation and it is essentially a way to represent data. JSON follows a format that humans can naturally understand, and its true power comes from its ability to capture complex data relationships.", "You can see this in the following example:", "Notice how JSON is structured in key-value pairs, while also holding array objects (notice that \u201cblogpost\u201d has several types underneath it). This is very important to note if you\u2019re coming from a flat data structure background (think Excel or Pandas dataFrames).", "JSON was created at the beginning of the millennial to save us from Flash and Java applets. If you happen to not remember those in-browser plugins, consider yourself extremely lucky, as they were the stuff that nightmares are made of! But I digress. JSON was built to provide a protocol for stateless real-time server to browser communication\u00b9.", "If you are already familiar with XML, you can think of JSON as a lightweight, easier to use, faster alternative.", "It is believed that the first major company to begin offering services and therefore popularising the adoption of JSON, was Yahoo in 2005\u00b9. It is now believed that JSON is the most used data format.", "The top 3 reasons people use JSON are:", "The very first thing you\u2019d want to do when you have to work with JSON is to read it into your Python application. The json library in Python expects JSON to come through as string.", "Assuming your data JSON data is already a string:", "If on the other hand, if you hold the JSON in a Python Object (like a dictionary), the json library allows you to convert it back to string for further processing.", "Now that we have seen how to load our JSON data into our Python application, let us look at the options we have to work with JSON.", "Extracting information from the JSON is as simple as defining the path we are after and provide the name of the key-value pair. Let\u2019s look at a few examples.", "Once we can extract the data as above, we can easily store them in lists or databases for further processing.", "If you are already comfortable in Pandas and you\u2019d like to work with flat data, there is a quick way to get your data into data frames. First up, you can take the first level of your data and add it to a dataFrame.", "As you can see, read_json takes in a string data type and only allows us to see top-level information. In other words, it doesn\u2019t flatten any of the structures. We need a way to navigate through the lower levels of the data.", "We can flatten the data by a further level by using the json_normalise pandas method.", "There are certain cases where you simply want to flatten out the data. It certainly can make data analysis quicker at times and can allow for the visual inspection of a large number of records (think Excel type data filtering).", "You can do that using a third-party library. First up, install the library:", "All the items we have explored so far focused on processing a single JSON record. However, in the real world, you are likely required to process many JSON documents and be required to aggregate across records.", "You can consider any of the following methods for enabling your analysis:", "There you have it. In exactly 5 minutes you know everything you need to know to get you started working with JSON. I encourage you to spend some time and get intimately familiar with it. It is widely used and it is certainly a must-have on your CV!", "Your home for data science.
