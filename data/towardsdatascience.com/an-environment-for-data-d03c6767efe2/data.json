No programming knowledge needed.", "The UK Data Service hosts the United Kingdom\u2019s largest collection of social data. Through the website, you can request, manage and deposit all sorts of social data. Sharing access to that data is only the first step. To make an impact we need people of all skill levels to explore that data.", "I will get to my recommendations shortly. If you are looking to install Python or RStudio then here are the relevant links:", "If you are on a Windows device you likely don\u2019t have Python installed.", "If you are on a device running macOS or anything Linux based it\u2019s likely you already have Python installed. You can check this by running the python or python3 command in your terminal. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the terminal that\u2019s fine too, let\u2019s look at some alternatives.", "Often we want a way to run our code without needing to know about the command line. Below are alternatives that let you write code without learning more tools.", "Repl.it lets you create disposable environments for Python, R and much more. This is a great place to quickly write simple code, explore a small dataset, try out packages and share your code publicly.", "Google Colab lets you run code in the browser in notebook style. A notebook is a collection of code alongside markdown cells. This format lets you write textual analysis inline with code fragments. This, in turn, helps make your work more reproducible and understandable. One disadvantage is that Colab uses Google Drive to store your data. Viable alternatives here are Jupyter or JupyterLab.", "Anaconda is a Data Science platform that includes Jupyter, RStudio and more. Anaconda handles managing environments and package installation. This keeps us away from the worst the command line has to offer.", "First of all download the Anaconda version for your Operating System. Downloads are available here. Run the installer, this should take about 10 minutes.", "Once installed, run anaconda and you should see something like the below. You should have access to Jupyter, JupyterLab, RStudio, VS Code and more. You may have to install these if you want to use them. The most common program I use here is JupyterLab.", "Sometimes you need to use a more recent version of a package. You may need to downgrade your Python version to reproduce a project from years ago. Anaconda makes this easy with the \u201cEnvironments\u201d tab. Here you can create, swap between and manage your environments. This is where you come if you need to install a new package.", "If you plan on writing R, create a new environment now with both a Python and an R library.", "To show what we can do in JupyterLab lets work through a small project. Download this Airbnb data. The following will guide you through reading and displaying data.", "First of all Launch JupyterLab, if this is not installed do so now. If this works it will open a JupyterLab tab in your default browser. In the left-hand side of this tab, you should see a file browser, navigate to wherever you\u2019d like to save your notebook. Create a new Python 3 notebook. This will have a default filename of \u201cUntitled.ipynb\u201d. Rename this if you like.", "You can also drag and drop your dataset into the file browser to upload it to your session. Again rename this dataset if you like, in my example code, I\u2019ve called it data.csv. You should now have both your notebook and a dataset available.", "If you double click the dataset you will see an Excel-like table of your data. This can be useful to check your data is as expected, and ask any data quality questions.", "There is a small \u201cplus\u201d icon next to the save button for your .ipynb file, this will let you create new cells. And the \u201cCode\u201d dropdown will let you swap between markdown and code for this cell. In our first cell we can write:", "This imports our data manipulation library and reads our data.

We need a new environment which has both Python and R installed. To do this go to the \u201cEnvironments\u201d tab and create a new environment with a Python and an R version installed. This may take up to ten minutes.", "If you prefer here, you have the option of installing and running RStudio from Anaconda. I recommend giving JupyterLab a go though! You may need to install JupyterLab again for this new Python and R environment. First of all Launch JupyterLab.

For now, know that GitHub is a place to store programming related files. One extra benefit of Jupyter Notebooks is that Github will render them. This means that whatever you save and push to GitHub can be public or private. See the following examples:", "So we\u2019ve set up our environment to do some basic data science.
