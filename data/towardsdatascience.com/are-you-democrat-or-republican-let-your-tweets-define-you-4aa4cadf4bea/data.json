What caught my attention is that people get super polarized about it. They started to say: \u201cYou sound just like a Democrat!\u201d or \u201cAre you a anti-Republican?\u201d. And by force, you start to have the arguments to defend a position. So I quickly went and took some online tests trying to answer the question: \u201cAre you a Democrat or a Republican?\u201d", "Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel convinced, so I wanted to find a new way and thankfully we have the world of Twitter as our dataset!", "In this study, I will try to find answers for the questions below:", "To start we need to figure out what Twitter accounts are Democrat or Republicans. TweetCongress.org, a directory of members of Congress on Twitter, lists 101 Republicans on the site and just 57 Democrats. Each party is mostly held up by a few Twitter superstars (like Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican Sen. John McCain), but congressional Republicans overall have more followers and tweet more often.", "Another option is to look directly at the @TheDemocrats and @HouseGOP member lists on Twitter. After exploring the lists, you can see that we can pull all of the fullname and username class elements. We will also save the URL of the avatar image and keep it for later.", "I will use Beautiful Soup to extract the handles. It is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. When the HTML or XML document is poorly formed (for example if it lacks closing tags), Beautiful Soup offers a heuristic-based approach in order to reconstruct the syntax tree without generating errors.", "After extracting the handles, I export the results to .csv file, which looks like this :", "Then , I need to create a dataset containing the tweets of these members related to the 2018 U.S. Congressional Election. I collected the tweets between January 22, 2018 and January 3, 2019 from the Twitter API using Social Feed Manager. See each collection\u2019s README for dates of collection, accounts, and hashtags used in queries.", "The dataset contains 86,460 tweets related to the 2018 U.S. Congressional Election (44392 for Republican and 42068 for Democrat). We can say that we have roughly similar proportions of Democrats & Republicans in the training dataset.", "I am going to start with a quick exploration of tweets from Democrat and Republican lawmakers in the US. The main purpose of this initial analysis will be to visualize hashtags used by both of them.", "This is getting interesting. We can now see the Republican party (in red) touting their policies (e.g., taxcutsandjobsact). For those less familiar with US politics, the Republican party controls the presidency and both chambers of the Congress, and are therefore able to implement their agenda relatively unrestrained. On the other side, for the Democrat party, we see some clear bitterness (e.g., goptaxscam).", "In addition, I will explore the words used by the different parties. This will be achieved through cleaning the tweets, parsing them into vectors of words, removing common stopwords, aggregating words by count, and plotting the most frequent results using barplots. The choice of the stopwords can be critical sometimes. I thought maybe it\u2019s better to choose the STOPWORDS from the \u201cwordcloud\u201d library because they contain an average list of all of them.", "If we look at the tweets of people who have a republican opinion, the word \u201ctoday\u201d (4883 times) is in the first place again, \u201ctax\u201d is in the second place and \u201cgreat\u201d in the third place.", "I also categorized the word frequencies into 5 categories :", "I tried to plot a matix in which the \u2018X\u2019 axis refers to the word usage frequency of Republican tweets and \u2018Y\u2019 axis refers to the same thing but related to the Democrats.", "For example, the word \u201ctaxreform\u201d is used by Republican 966 times, so it\u2019s placed in their high category. However, Democrats used that word only 12 times. An other example is \u201cgun\u201d word. Its used 876 times in Democrat tweets and 117 times in Republican tweets.", "Also there is no words, when Republicans used very highly and Democrats used at the medium, low or very low level. The same as for Democrats. The words : \u201ctoday\u201d, \u201camerican\u201d, \u201cgreat, \u201chouse\u201d, \u201cyear\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d, \u201cday\u201d and \u201cthank\u201d are used very highly by both Democrats and Republicans.", "I have selected some words in the data set in order to produce a plot showing the distribution of the words through the text. These words are \u201cvote\u201d, \u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201camerica\u201d, \u201camerican\u201d, \u201ctax\u201d, \u201ctrump\u201d and \u201cclinton\u201d.", "Here, I will try to categorize the tweets into organized groups or parties using different text classifiers, in addition to Sentiment Analysis for understanding if a given tweet is talking positively or negatively about a given subject.", "So I began with converting a collection of tweets for both parties to a matrix of token counts, using CountVectorizer function from sklearn. Then I applied ML algorithms for classification: RandomForest, LogisticRegression, Multi-NB, DecisionTrees, AdaBoost", "After that, I tried to determine the attitude or the emotion of each party, i.e., whether it is positive or negative or neutral. So I used the famous Python library TextBlob which returns 2 important indicators:", "Now let\u2019s try to answer the last question \u201cif my Twitter account is more Democratic/Republican\u201d by using a simple neural network. I will develop a LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network model for Sequence Classification using the Keras deep learning library.", "Let\u2019s start off by importing the classes and functions required for this model and initializing the random number generator to a constant value (7 for example) to ensure that the results can be reproduced.", "Then, we split the dataset, stratified according to the Party variable so as to have approximately similar proportions of Democrats & Republicans in the training & test sets separately as in the whole dataset. The set will be based on those Twitter handles because we don\u2019t want any individual tweeter to appear in both training & test sets.", "Actually, the tweets don\u2019t have the same length in terms of words, but same length vectors is required to perform the computation in Keras. That\u2019s why we need to truncate and pad the input tweets so that they are all the same length for modeling. The model will learn that the zero values carry no information.", "We can now define, compile and fit our LSTM model :", "I used epochs=10 and batch_size=64 for fitting the model. Once fit, we estimate the performance of the model on unseen tweets:", "I got an overall accuracy of 74,52%. It\u2019s not so unusual for a single tweet to be mis-categorized, so perhaps we should consider the overall categorization of each person\u2019s tweets.", "With this adjustment, we get ~93% accuracy.", "Text classification is not only fun, but it\u2019s also a powerful tool for extracting value from unstructured data. Twitter is a very popular social media platform used by millions of users, and the published tweets can sometimes be used to see what the public\u2019s opinion is regarding a certain problematic. It feels like magic when you analyze hundreds of tweets in just a few seconds and automatically get information such as topic, opinion, sentiment\u2026", "After this study, I found out that we can make classification on people to see if they are Demcorat or Republican, and the results were somehow accurate. If sentiment analysis algorithms were improved , we could use them to predict next presidential election results this year.", "Even though, the developed model still have 2 main hurdles :", "Congratulations if you managed to get here.
