In fact, Paganoni writes in Framing Big Data:", "corporate responsibility should be designated as an intrinsic ethical stance in business operations and, for example, implemented by enabling technology that will protect privacy from the start (data protection \u201cby design\u201d) and not retrospectively (Paganoni 95)", "The big message in both these quotes is that privacy shouldn\u2019t be an afterthought, but a central value in how we develop technology that acquires and uses data. However, if you read my most recent post about how our fear of death is manipulated into letting organizations violate our privacy, or observed the Cambridge Analytica scandal that happened a couple years ago, you\u2019ll see how this is a value that remains to be fully implemented.", "The final chapter of Framing Big Data is \u201cEthical Issues and Legal Frameworks in the Big Data Debate,\u201d and discusses language used in the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you\u2019ve seen any coverage of the way personal data is being used on the internet, you\u2019ve probably seen this acronym floating around. The reason why Paganoni spends an entire chapter looking at the language in this set of laws, and the reason you\u2019ve almost certainly seen some kind of mention of the GDPR is because it marks a new era of addressing the use of Big Data, and determining what is and is not an ethical use of Big Data.", "The GDPR is the replacement to the Data Protection Directive, which was written in 1995, when the internet was a very different place. As Zsolt Z\u00f6di puts it, \u201cBig Data was simply not an issue or at least not in the recent narrative framework\u201d (pg. 76). In contrast, the GDPR very much addresses the issues brought up by Big Data\u2019s collection and usage, as it\u2019s \u201csteeped in the Big Data ecosystem\u201d (Paganoni 84).", "One of the main concerns surrounding the GDPR is that it\u2019s leading to the \u201cbalkanization\u201d of the internet. Just as the Ottoman Empire broke up into many different states, the concern is that the internet will also divide into states of its own. Essentially, one\u2019s experience of the internet will change depending on their geographic location. This change, particularly the change brought about by the GDPR in Europe, is framed as a negative in articles such as this one. However, I believe this is a relatively telling quote:", "Yet Europe is creating its own barriers, with new data-protection and privacy rules that may well impede the application of machine learning.", "At the beginning of this post, I bring up two quotes about privacy and Big Data. The core of these quotes is that protecting user privacy should not be seen as a hinderance or an afterthought, but it should be central to any kind machine learning technology developed. The GDPR is a relatively complex set of regulations, but they can really be boiled down to two concepts: privacy and transparency. The fact that regulations supporting these two rights are seen as an impediment to progress demonstrates what kind of progress the author does and does not care about.", "Additionally, many who talk about cyber-balkanization as a negative particularly point out that people will have different experiences of the internet depending on where they are. They bring up concerns that this could lead to countries becoming like China, where many sites are blocked. However, this article points out, that kind of already happens:", "A little Balkanization of the web, in the other words, can be a healthy exercise of democratic power and pluralism. The trouble is deciding where to stop. In the near future, will there be one Internet for Americans who live in blue states and another for those in red states? (Alas, this is already the case in many respects given how sites like Facebook and Twitter create so-called \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d that serve up news and opinions we already agree with).", "You can even see this on Netflix, where different countries have different movie choices. In fact, you can go on this website to see which movies are in which countries. Therefore, this particular issue of different internet experiences is something we already experience in other areas that receive a lot less complaints than the GDPR.", "Without the GDPR and regulations like it, there really is nothing to stop large companies from unethical data usage. As shown previously, privacy is not seen as a central pillar in data collection and usage in machine learning, and companies care about a bottom line, not ethics. Even though Paganoni says at the end of her chapter on the GDPR that it is far from perfect, it\u2019s certainly a step towards introducing concrete ethical rules in a relatively new, rapidly growing field.", "[1] Forg\u00f3, Nikolaus, Stefanie H\u00e4nold, and Benjamin Sch\u00fctze. \u201cThe principle of purpose limitation and big data.\u201d In New technology, big data and the law, pp. 17\u201342.
