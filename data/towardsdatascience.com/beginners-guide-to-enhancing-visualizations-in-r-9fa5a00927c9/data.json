RStudio\u2019s ggplot2 is a useful package for telling data\u2019s story, so if you are newer to ggplot2 and would love to develop your visualizing skills, you\u2019re in luck. I developed a pretty quick \u2014 and practical \u2014 guide to help beginners advance their understanding of ggplot2 and design a couple polished, business-insightful graphs. Because early success with visualizations can be very motivating!", "This tutorial assumes you have completed at least one introduction to ggplot2, like this one. If you haven\u2019t, I encourage you to first to get some basics down.", "By the end of this tutorial you will:", "Before we begin, here are a couple tools that can support your learning. The first is the \u2018R Studio Data Visualization with ggplot2 cheat sheet\u2019 (referred to as \u2018cheat sheet\u2019 from now on). We will reference it throughout to help you navigate it for future use.", "The second is a \u2018ggplot2 Quick Guide\u2019 I made to help me build ggplots on my own faster. It\u2019s not comprehensive, but it may help you more quickly understand the big picture of ggplot2.", "For this tutorial, we will use the IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset, available here. This data offers (fictitious) business insight and requires no preprocessing. Sweet!", "Let\u2019s install libraries and import the data.", "Then check the data and structure.", "Upon doing so, you will see that there are 1470 observations with 35 employee variables. Let\u2019s start visual #1.", "HR wants to know how monthly income is related to employee attrition by job role.", "For this problem, \u2018JobRole\u2019 is our X variable (discrete) and \u2018MonthlyIncome\u2019 is our Y variable (continuous). \u2018Attrition\u2019 (yes/no) is our z variable.", "Check side 1 of your cheat sheet under \u2018Two Variables: Discrete X, Continuous Y,\u2019 and note the various graphs. We will use geom_bar(). On the cheat sheet, it\u2019s listed as geom_bar(stat = \u2018identity\u2019). This would give us total monthly income of all employees. We instead want average, so we insert (stat = \u2018summary\u2019, fun = mean).", "We obviously can\u2019t read the names, which leads us to step 2\u2026", "When names are too long, it often helps to flip the x and y axis. To do so, we will add coord_flip() as a layer, as shown below. We will also unstack the bars to better compare Attrition, by adding position = \u2018dodge\u2019 within geom_bar() in the code. Refer to the ggplot2 cheat sheet side 2, \u2018Coordinate Systems\u2019 and \u2018Position Adjustments\u2019 to see where both are located.", "Now, let\u2019s reorder the bars from highest to lowest Monthly Income to help us better analyze by Job Role. Add the reorder code below within the aesthetics line.", "Let\u2019s change the bar colors to \u201cmatch the company brand.\u201d This must be done manually, so find scale_fill_manual() on side 2 of the cheat sheet, under \u201cScales.\u201d It lists colors in base R. You can try some, but they aren\u2019t \u201ccompany colors.\u201d I obtained the color #s below from color-hex.com.", "Also, we will narrow the bar widths by adding \u2018width=.8\u2019 within geom_bar() to add visually-appealing space.", "Now let\u2019s add Title and Labels. We don\u2019t need an x label since the job titles explain themselves. See the code for how we handled. Also, check out \u201cLabels\u201d on side 2 of the cheat sheet.", "A theme will kick it up a notch. We will add a theme layer at the end of our code, as shown below. When you start typing \u2018theme\u2019 in R, it shows options. For this graph, I chose theme_clean()", "Just two easy tweaks. First, we will remove the graph and legend outlines. Second, the graph seems tall, so let\u2019s reduce the height via aspect.ratio within theme(). Here is the full code for the final graph.", "Nice. We see that Research Directors who make more in monthly income are more likely to leave the company. The opposite is the case for other job roles.", "You\u2019ve accomplished a lot. Ready for another go? Visual 2 walk-through will be a piece of cake.", "For the second visual, we want to know if employee attrition has any relationship to monthly income, years since last promotion, and work-life balance. Another multivariate analysis.", "For this problem, \u2018MonthlyIncome\u2019 is our X and \u2018YearsSinceLastPromotion\u2019 is our Y variable. Both are continuous, so check side 1 of your cheat sheet under \u2018Two Variables: Continuous X, Continuous Y.\u2019 For visualization context, we will use geom_smooth(), a regression line often added to scatter plots to reveal patterns. \u2018Attrition\u2019 will again be differentiated by color.", "We can see that employees who leave are promoted less often. Let\u2019s delve deeper and compare by work-life balance. For this 4th variable, we need to use \u2018Faceting\u2019 to view subplots by work-life balance level.", "Check out \u2018Faceting\u2019 on side 2 of the cheat sheet. We will use facet_wrap() for a rectangular layout.", "The facet grids look good, but what do the numbers mean? The data description explains the codes for \u2018WorkLifeBalance\u2019: 1 = \u2018Bad\u2019, 2 = \u2018Good\u2019, 3 = \u2018Better\u2019, 4 = \u2018Best\u2019. Add them in step 3.", "To add subplot labels, we need to first define the names with a character vector, then use the \u2018labeller\u2019 function within facet_wrap.", "Add your labels and title at the end of your code.", "When I look at the graph, the x and y labels seem too close to the tick markers. A simple trick is to insert newline (\\n) code within label names.", "When you installed library(\u2018ggthemes\u2019), it gave you more options. For a modern look, I went with theme_fivethirtyeight(). Simply add at the end.", "What happened to our x and y labels? Well, the default for theme_fivethirtyeight() doesn\u2019t have labels. But we can easily override that with a second theme() layer at the end of your code as shown below.", "Not bad. But\u2026people may not be able to tell if \u2018Better Balance\u2019 and \u2018Best Balance\u2019 are for the top or bottom grids right away. Let\u2019s also change our legend location in step 8.", "Adding space between top and bottom grids and changing the legend location both occur within the second theme() line. See side 2 of cheat sheet under \u2018Legends.\u2019", "It would be awesome to change line colors to pack a visual punch. Standard R colors don\u2019t quite meet our needs. We will change manually just like we did with Visual #1. I obtained the colors #s from color-hex.com, which has become a useful tool for us.", "Here is the full code for the second visual.", "Another job well done. We see that employees in roles lacking work-life balance seem to stay if promotions are more frequent. The difference in attrition is less noticeable in good or higher work-life balance levels.", "In this tutorial, we gained skills needed for ggplot2 visual enhancement, became more familiar with the R Studio ggplot2 cheat sheet, and built two nice visuals. I hope that the step-by-step explanations and cheat sheet referencing were helpful and enhanced your confidence using ggplot2.", "Many are helping me as I advance my data science and machine learning skills, so my goal is to help and support others in the same way.", "Your home for data science.
