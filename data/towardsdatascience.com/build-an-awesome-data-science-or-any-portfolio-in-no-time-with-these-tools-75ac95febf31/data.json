In many ways it has been. It\u2019s definitely democratised education to some extent, so much so that in some fields you can become a high level practitioner and keep up with cutting edge developments or even without ever getting out of your pyjamas.", "But the barrier to gaining a presence on the internet has always been relatively high. To build anything worth their salt online, you had to code.", "Sure, HTML and CSS isn\u2019t exactly the most difficult language to learn, but it is a yet another language to learn.", "If you don\u2019t know web programming already, is it worth the time investment to learn it to a level where you can build a site that you can be proud of and show people?", "For those whom that web development is to be a key skill for, or those curious and have the time, go for it. But what if it\u2019s a skill that you have little use for? Is the pain of learning these worth the time and pain, just to build one site? What about all the hassle related to deployment and maintenance? There has to be a better way.", "Luckily, there are many tools that can help. Actually, as I found out, there are just. so. many. tools.", "Which means that there are enough diverse enough tools that there\u2019s probably a right tool in there whoever you are. The new barrier to entry is actually wading through the pile of toolkits, and looking in each one to see if it is the right set of tools for you. It doesn\u2019t sound that hard, but it also isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. In a world of software proliferation, researching a SaaS service or an open-source software for your exact use case is difficult to do, and not even always possible.", "So in this article, I list a few tools that I think will be the best candidates for most of us. I hope you find it useful.", "Note: Some of the links below are affiliate links, which means that at no additional cost to you, a small commission goes to me if you purchase something.", "I\u2019m going to lead with the tool that I think is really the best one for most people who aren\u2019t conversant in HTML/CSS (possibly JS), and don\u2019t really care to be.", "Yes, it\u2019s widely used. But so is Microsoft Word. Yes, it is the most popular, and it has a lot of momentum between its installed user base, widely (and cheaply) available expertise. But it\u2019s just a bit dated, and it is somewhat starting to show its age and the fact that it\u2019s a castle built on a million plugins and weighed down by now two decades of development.", "What\u2019s more \u2014 to really customise it, you end up having to learn basically its architecture, which to my mind is actually less useful than learning HTML/CSS, unless you want to become a WordPress dev.", "Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that! But it\u2019s not for me.", "Given my gripes with WordPress, you might have seen this coming. Webflow is basically what DreamWeaver wanted to be, and pretended to be, back in the early days of the Internet, but you know, now.", "It\u2019s mighty powerful in what it can do, and it\u2019s really taken the whole nocode ethos to heart. Do you want to create custom scroll animations? Interactions? Have elements fade in/out or hide based on the user\u2019s actions, and control the triggers, timing, and visuals \u2014 all without coding? Yup.", "Are batteries included? As in, I don\u2019t have to search through a bunch of different plugins, after researching the main tool (e.g. between Webflow vs Wordpress vs Wix etc.)? Yup.", "Does it create sites with production-ready / clean code? Also yes. Although I can\u2019t quantify this, a search through unbiased forums like Reddit indicates to me that code from Webflow is miles apart from tools like Wix. To the point that Webflow also allows you to take the ball and go home (i.e. export the code), if you so choose to, and you won\u2019t be left with code that looks like a first year CS student threw up on their keyboard.", "I also love the fact that Webflow has a comprehensive set of tutorials to help you get up to speed.", "If you progress along with your portfolio to do things like set up an e-commerce portal, you can do that with Webflow as well. You will not need to move to a new platform.", "I can\u2019t recommend Webflow enough from my personal experience, based on the balance of power & relatively low learning curve. Now, there are tools that are easier to learn, and we\u2019ll come back to that. But getting a great-looking site is still pretty easy on Webflow, and some of the options that I\u2019ll discuss later don\u2019t offer as much flexibility.", "For many of us non-experts in web programming, Webflow is absolutely the tool to go.", "But wait, I\u2019m not done yet! It would be a pretty terrible roundup to just cite one option. There are plenty of other great options out there and depending on your needs.", "First and foremost, apologies for the terrible pun. But sometimes it\u2019s just gotta be done.", "Unfortunately, Webflow isn\u2019t free. (You can try it for free, but I believe that you will ultimately have to pay.) But there are truly free solutions out there, if that is important to you, and you have to make surprisingly few compromises if that\u2019s what you are after.", "If you\u2019re in this category, static site builders are probably your best bet, and I personally recommend:", "Gatsby is one of the top few leading static site generators, along with Next.js, Hugo and Jekyll to name a few.", "The reason static site generators are awesome is that they generate static sites.", "Unlike dynamic sites, static sites do not need any back end processing \u2013 as in the user request going to a server, the server doing something and then the front end rendering the output with whatever the server comes back with.", "The only thing that is needed is for the static files to be hosted somewhere, the user to go to it and then the host just needs to deliver the files to the user.", "This reduces much of the compute needs in running a website, to the point where it is relatively easy to find a provider who will host these sites for free. Netlify and GitHub pages are two leading examples.", "The other benefits of a static website are speed and scalability. They\u2019re just lightning quick due to their architecture, and their low demand means that the server can basically handle anything. Practically speaking, anything short of a horde of zombies concurrently reading your website to find the last brain on Earth should be fine.", "Did you notice that while I recommend Gatsby and Netlify, I have yet to mention it? It is true that Gatsby is my personal favourite out of the lot. But it\u2019s also true that each of the other popular packages like Next.js, Hugo or Jekyll are all excellent tools (take a look at this list on Jamstack.org).", "Largely, I think choosing one is a very personal decision, down to familiarity with any of the underlying programming language. I picked Gatsby because it sounds awesome and I thought I\u2019d pick up some JS by osmosis, but ymmv.", "Check out Gatsby here, and Netlify here", "As readers of TDS, I am going to assume that you are Python users (sorry, R-users). There are ways to get your work online without ever leaving the comforts of our cosy snake friend.", "Many of you will be displaying in your portfolio data science outputs in various forms like visualisations or maybe in notebooks. So why not use (and learn) the very tools that are designed showcase these, and remove the middlemen?", "I\u2019ve written about Dash and Streamlit a bit, and as I mentioned in those articles, they just make it so darn easy to create web apps. Well, there\u2019s no rule that says your portfolio can\u2019t be built with these web apps.", "As a matter of fact, these tools might be great for showcasing your data science and visualisation chops with the world without ever leaving the confines of Python, because that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re meant to do.", "One downside of web apps like a Dash app or a Streamlit would be that they would require quite a bit more resources and therefore server capacity. Having said that, free tiers on services like Heroku or PythonAnywhere would be plenty for a portfolio site unless you\u2019re some sort of a rock star, I can\u2019t imagine a portfolio site getting so much traffic that it would overwhelm the capacities of those apps at their free tier.", "As to which of the two, Streamlit is probably easier to pick up and use, but Dash offers a quite a bit more customisability, for example in being able to use Bootstrap themes and styling. Also, as I\u2019ve said before \u2014 Dash is probably more likely to be used in production than Streamlit which is more of a fast prototyping tool.", "So if it were me, I\u2019d probably learn and use Dash, and use Heroku for its deployment which is the easiest in my mind, taking advantage of their free tier.", "Check out Dash here, Streamlit here, and Heroku here", "I suspect some of you may have heard of Jovian, although probably not the majority. It is a relatively young startup aimed at making it easy to share Jupyter notebooks and collaborate on them.", "It allows either entire notebooks to be shared as shown below, or to embed certain parts of notebooks to another medium like a blog.", "So if your work lives in notebooks, Jovian might be the best way to showcase your work in their native form, or to host them somewhere and embed parts of them.", "These solutions won\u2019t give tou the most customisability or the best looking sites, but you\u2019ll probably get something up and running in no time at all.", "Notion is a relatively new platform, which they claim to be a tool to \u201cwrite, plan and get organised\u201d.", "It\u2019s a tool that I would describe as interconnected Evernote notes, nocode database, calendar, kanban board\u2026 basically anything that you can think of.", "What does this mega-powered notebook tool have to do with building a portfolio?", "Well, there is a third party app called super.so that will turn your Notion project into a fully functioning website, with the things that a website needs \u2013 like analytics and deployment onto a domain.", "The showcase page shows that quite a few people have already used this setup to put together their portfolios. This might be one of the easiest ways to put a portfolio together, and the limitation of Notion also makes it more difficult to make a bad-looking one.", "Check out Notion here, and Super.so here", "You might be skeptical, but hear me out. What\u2019s a portfolio for? It\u2019s to showcase your capability for whatever it is that you want to build a brand for. Medium provides a reliable, easy to use platform with clean aesthetics, it\u2019s free, and you can embed all sorts of formats of documents in it.", "It has obvious limitation that it is largely a blogging platform and that it\u2019s not your own domain, but they\u2019re pretty good trade offs given how small the barrier to entry is with this method.", "For some, this might give them a better chance of someone organically finding your portfolio than having a site with poor SEO scores.", "For curation, I would recommend creating your own \u201cpublication\u201d and hosting your portfolio there, say for different portfolios (e.g. data science portfolio vs web dev portfolio) for those of us lucky enough to have needs for multiple portfolios.", "That\u2019s a wrap on that. I hope at you found least one of them to be a suitable option for you. If you skipped to the end, the tl;dr opinion is that Webflow is my recommended tool of choice, but depending on your circumstances others might also be suitable.", "I have previously looked at quite a few portfolios to put together this prior article on amazing portfolios, so I am aware that they come in all shapes and sizes.", "So if I\u2019ve missed your favourite tool, please do write and let me know.", "But just before you go \u2014 if you liked this, say hi / follow on twitter, or follow here for updates.", "Edit: I\u2019m starting a Substack for all things Data and Visualisation \u2014 it is going to be a way for me to engage directly with you. I would love for you to join me here.", "I also wrote a little about why I\u2019m starting a Substack.", "ICYMI: I also wrote these articles, which you might find useful:", "Your home for data science.
