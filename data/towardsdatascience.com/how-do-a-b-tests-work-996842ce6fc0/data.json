Without them, all you have is correlation, which is often unhelpful for decision-making.", "Experiments are your license to use the word \u201cbecause\u201d in polite conversation.", "Unfortunately, it\u2019s fairly common to see folks deluding themselves about the quality of their inferences, claiming the benefits of scientific experimentation without having done a proper experiment. When there\u2019s uncertainty, what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t count as an experiment unless all three of these components are present:", "If you need a refresher on this topic and the logic around it, check out my article Are you guilty of using the word \u201cexperiment\u201d incorrectly?", "To understand why experiments work as tools for making inferences about cause-and-effect, take a look at the logic behind one of the simplest experiments you can do: the A/B test.", "If you don\u2019t feel like reading a detailed example, take a look at this GIF and then skip to the final section (\u201cThe secret sauce is randomization\u201d):", "If you prefer a thorough example, I\u2019ve got you covered.", "Imagine that your company has had a grey logo for a few years. Now that all your competitors have grey logos too (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery), your execs insist on rebranding to a brighter color\u2026 but which one?", "After a careful assessment of what\u2019s practical given your company\u2019s website color scheme, your design team identifies the only two feasible candidates: blue and orange.", "The CEO\u2019s favorite color is blue, so she picks approving blue as the default action. In other words, she\u2019s saying that if there\u2019s no further information, she\u2019s happy to err on the side of blue. Luckily for you, she\u2019s a strong data-driven leader who is willing to allow data to change her mind to orange.", "In order to switch to the alternative action of approving an orange logo, the CEO requires evidence that an orange logo causes your current user population to click more (relative to blue) on specific parts of your website.", "You\u2019re the senior data scientist at your company, so your ears prick up. You immediately identify that your CEO\u2019s approach to decision-making fits the framework from frequentist statistics. After listening to her carefully, you confirm that her null and alternative hypotheses have to do with matters of cause-and-effect. That means you need to do an experiment! Summarizing what she tells you:", "Default action: Approve blue logo.Alternative action: Approve orange logo.Null hypothesis: Orange logo does not cause at least 10% more clicking than blue logo.Alternative hypothesis: Orange logo does cause at least 10% more clicking than blue logo.", "Why 10%? That\u2019s the minimum effect size your CEO was willing to accept. If a decision-maker cares about effect sizes, those should be baked into the hypothesis test up front. Testing a null hypothesis of \u201cno difference\u201d is an explicit statement that you don\u2019t give a damn about effect sizes.", "For a setup like this one, an A/B test is the perfect experimental design. (For other cause-and-effect decisions, you may need other designs. Though I\u2019ll only cover A/B testing here, the logic behind the more complicated designs is similar.)", "So, let\u2019s do an A/B test!", "There are all kinds of ways to run A/B tests. What you see in psychology labs (and focus group studies) tends to involve inviting people off the street, showing different stimuli to different folks at random, then asking them questions. Alas, your CEO is looking for something more difficult. Her question can only be answered with a live traffic experiment, which is exactly what it sounds like: you\u2019ll be serving different versions of your logo live to different users as they go about their usual business on your website.", "If you want to run a live traffic experiment, you\u2019ll need some special infrastructure in place. Work with your engineers to build the ability to serve different treatments to different users at random as well as the ability to track your CEO\u2019s desired metrics (click-through rate on certain website elements) by treatment condition.", "(In case you\u2019re wondering why everyone doesn\u2019t do live traffic experiments all the time, the answer usually has to do with the high up-front costs of rejiggering a production system that wasn\u2019t built with experimentation in mind. While companies like Google build experimentation infrastructure into most of our systems before we even know what experiments we\u2019ll want to run, traditional organizations may forget to add this feature at the outset and can find themselves behind their more tech-savvy competitors as a result. As a side note, if you\u2019re tempted to get into the applied ML/AI game, experiment infrastructure is a must-have.)", "Because you\u2019re properly cautious you\u2019re not going to surprise all your users with a sudden new logo. The much smarter thing to do is to sample a subset of your users for your experiment, then do a gradual rollout (with the option for a rollback to grey if your changes create an unforeseen disaster).", "If you were interested in seeing how users respond to novelty \u2014 do they click more because the logo changed, regardless of what it changed to? \u2014 you\u2019d use the grey logo treatment as your control group. However, that\u2019s not the question your CEO wants answered. She is interested in isolating the causal influence of orange relative to blue, so given the way she\u2019s framing her decision, the control group should be users who are shown the blue logo.", "But before the system actually shows them the blue logo, the experimentation infrastructure flips a virtual coin to randomly reassign some users to the orange treatment and show them orange instead of blue.", "If you then observe a higher average click-through rate on the orange version, you will be able to say that it is the orange treatment that is responsible for the difference in behavior. If that difference is statistically higher than 10%, your CEO will happily switch to orange as she promised. If not, she\u2019ll go with blue.", "If you had not done this at random, if you\u2019d given the orange treatment to \u2014 for example \u2014 all your logged-in users while showing the blue treatment to everyone else, you cannot say that it is the orange treatment that\u2019s responsible for the difference. Maybe your logged-in users are simply more loyal to your company and like your products more, no matter what color you make your logo. Maybe your logged-in users have a higher propensity to click no matter what color you show them.", "Randomization is key. It\u2019s the secret sauce that allows you to make conclusions about cause and effect.", "That\u2019s why that randomness piece is so important. With large sample sizes (experiments don\u2019t work without lots of statistical power), random selection creates groups whose differences come out in the wash. Statistically speaking, the two groups are believable clones of one another.", "Thanks to random selection, the groups of users in the A/B test\u2019s blue and orange conditions will be similar (in aggregate) in all ways folks traditionally think about cherry-picking participants to balance their studies: similar representation of genders, races, ages, education levels, political views, religions\u2026 but they\u2019ll also be similar in all the ways you probably didn\u2019t think to control: similar representation of cat-lovers, tea-drinkers, gamers, goths, golfers, ukulele owners, generous givers, good swimmers, people who secretly hate their spouses, people who haven\u2019t showered for a few days, people who are allergic to oranges without realizing it, and so on.", "When you use randomization to create two large groups, you\u2019ve got a statistical blank canvas.", "That\u2019s the beauty of large sample sizes combined with random selection. You don\u2019t have to rely on your cleverness in thinking up the right confounding factors to control for. When you use randomization to create two large groups, you\u2019ve got a statistical blank canvas \u2014 your two groups are statistically identical in every way except one: what you\u2019re about to do to them.", "Your two groups are statistically identical in every way except one: what you\u2019re about to do to them.", "If you observe a substantial difference between the results of the two groups, you will be able to say that the difference in what happens was due to what you did. You can say that it was caused by your treatment. That\u2019s the amazing power of (proper) experiments!", "If we did a real experiment and find a significant difference in the group results, we can blame that on what we did!", "If you\u2019re keen to read more of my writing, most of the links in this article take you to my other musings.
