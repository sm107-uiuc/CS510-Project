When you think of dirty data, you are probably thinking about inaccurate or malformed data. But the truth is, missing data is actually the most common occurrence of dirty data. Imagine trying to do a customer segmentation analysis, but 50% of the data have no address on record. It would be hard or impossible to do your analysis since the analysis would be bias in showing no customers in certain areas.", "There are three kinds of missing data:", "In this article, I\u2019ll go over the types of missing data with examples, and share how to handle missing data with imputation.", "When we say data are missing at random, we mean that the missingness is nothing to do with the person being studied. For example, a questionnaire might be lost in the post, or a blood sample might be damaged in the lab.", "The statistical advantage of data missing completely at random is that the analysis remains unbiased because the absence of data does not bias the estimated parameters. However, it could be hard to testify if the data is indeed MCAR.", "When we say data are missing at random, we assume the propensity for a data point to be missing is not related to the missing data itself, but it is related to some of the observed data. In other words, the probability of missing value depends on the characteristics of observable data. For example, if your crush rejected you, you can probably know why, by looking at other variables like \u201cshe\u2019s already committed,\u201d or \u201cher life goals are different from yours,\u201d etc.", "Missingness at random is relatively easy to handle \u2014 simply include as regression inputs all variables that affect the probability of missingness. Unfortunately, we generally cannot be sure whether the data really are missing at random, or whether the missingness depends on unobserved predictors or the missing data themselves.", "When we say data are missing not at random, we assume that there is a pattern in the missing data that affect your primary dependent variable. For example, the people with the lowest education are missing on education, the sickest people are most likely to drop out of the study, or drug addicts leaving drug usage fields blank in a survey. This also means these missing values aren\u2019t blank out of randomness but are left null on purpose.", "If the data are not missing at random, it will not make sense if we impute the missing data since it could bias your analysis or model\u2019s prediction.", "Replacing the missing values with the mean, median, or mode in a column is a very basic imputation method. This method is the fastest but doesn\u2019t work well on encoded categorical features. In addition, it doesn\u2019t take correlations between features into account. If we have to use this simple imputation method, consider using the median value instead of the mean value, since the mean value introduces outlier or noise to the analysis.", "KNNImputer helps to impute missing values present in the observations by finding the k nearest neighbors with the Euclidean distance matrix. You can check out how KNNImputer works under the hood here. This method is more accurate than the simple imputation; however, it can be computationally expensive and sensitive to outliers.", "Multivariate imputation solves the increased noise problem by factoring in other variables in the data. The basic multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) assumes that the data are missing at random. We can make an educated guess about its true value by looking at other data samples.", "Here are the three main steps:", "If you are interested to see how it works, check out this video here. Notice that it is still an open problem regarding how useful univariate vs. multivariate imputation is in prediction and classification when we are not interested in measuring uncertainty due to missing values.", "Missing data cannot be ignored in any analysis. As a Data Scientist or Data Analyst, we can\u2019t just simply drop the missing values. We need to understand how the data is missing and handle the NaN values accordingly.", "If you find this helpful, please follow me and check out my other blogs \u2764\ufe0f", "Until next time, happy learning! \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb", "Your home for data science.
