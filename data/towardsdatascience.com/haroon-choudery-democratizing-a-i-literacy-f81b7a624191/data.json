According to an article by CNN, the growth of artificial intelligence has created the biggest \u201cman-machine collaboration in history\u201d. The creation of these new technologies and the new applications of prior discoveries have already begun to create \u201cniche jobs\u201d across industries. With about 16% of the jobs in the United States on the verge of automation, and a booming $90 billion size estimate of the artificial intelligence market in 2025, it is clear that artificial intelligence is the future\u00b9.", "However, with these innovations comes the pressure to keep up with today\u2019s drastically changing technological landscape. At both a business and individual level, individuals need to take the necessary steps to utilize and maximize the potential of artificial intelligence. Particularly in emerging countries and marginalized communities, where the risks of societal consequences like job replacement and increased income disparity are more prominent, keeping abreast of technological progress and becoming data-literate are crucial to prevent individuals from lagging behind.", "Haroon and his team created A.I. For Anyone to equip individuals with the knowledge and skills to keep up in this changing world. With the belief that a society with a better understanding of artificial intelligence would be more equipped to design a \u201cfair and prosperous future for all\u201d, A.I For Anyone created a plethora of resources designed to improve an individual\u2019s general understanding of artificial intelligence and learn the necessary skills to play a more active role in the future of artificial intelligence\u00b2.", "Amber: Could you tell us a bit about your background?Haroon: I\u2019m currently the Co-founder & Executive Director at A.I. For Anyone and a data scientist at Komodo Health. Previously, I worked in a variety of roles at organizations including Facebook, Mark Cuban Companies, and Deloitte.", "I\u2019m also a proud immigrant and first-generation college graduate with a Bachelor in Economics from Penn State University and a Master in Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley.", "A: Did you always know that working in technology was what you wanted to do? What inspired you to pursue a career in artificial intelligence and start A.I. For Anyone?H: I always had an interest in technology from an early age. Although my family didn\u2019t own a computer for a good part of my childhood, I always found ways to get my hands on technology, whether it be by walking to the Brooklyn library on Avenue J to play computer games or by flipping cell phones on eBay as a high school student so that I could buy the latest and greatest smartphones. I started coding during my first year of college \u2014 not because my courses required me to \u2014 but because I was curious to learn how I could build and sell websites to small businesses.", "\u201cNow, we have the opportunity to prevent millions of people from experiencing the same fate. Rather than letting students and workers be blindsided by the rapid changes in technology, we can enable them to be proactive and speak up when they don\u2019t feel heard.\u00b3\u201d \u2014 Haroon Choudery", "My interest in AI developed during college and was mainly piqued through pop culture references to the technology, including movies like Terminator and Ex Machina. As I learned more about the current state of AI today and various theories surrounding its potential future consequences, I became more interested in getting involved in the space.", "During my graduate studies at UC Berkeley, where I studied data science and machine learning, I became increasingly aware of the societal impact that AI was poised to have and how unprepared most members of our society, especially those in underserved communities, were to face that impact. The grim irony is that underserved communities don\u2019t have access to nearly as many resources for AI education as more privileged communities, yet are the most vulnerable to the negative consequences of automation, including job displacement. As an immigrant whose father worked in a variety of labor jobs \u2014 as a taxi driver, tow-truck driver, and poultry farmer \u2014 and as a worker in tech, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to see both sides of the fence and found the disparity between the two sides to be deeply unsettling.", "In 2017, I founded A.I. For Anyone to help bridge the knowledge between the white collar communities and the underserved communities when it came to their understanding of AI.", "A: Why do you think it is important for the wider public to learn about AI? H: To put it simply, the more people that understand the fundamentals of AI, the more voices we will hear in the discussions that are shaping the trajectory of the technology. And it\u2019s important that the voices that we hear come from all walks of life so that our collective voice is as inclusive as possible.", "A: What was the biggest challenge you faced when starting A.I. For Anyone, and how did you overcome it? H: The biggest challenge for us was (and frankly, still is) convincing schools that serve a large percentage of underserved students about the dire need for AI education. These schools have a unique set of challenges that make it difficult to stray from their established curriculum.", "From our observations at A.I. For Anyone, the two biggest blockers that prevent these schools from teaching AI are 1) time and 2) knowledge of AI. Our approach to reducing these constraints is to make it as easy as possible to enable non-technical persons to teach the fundamentals of AI in a short period of time. For the first couple of years of operation, this meant developing an AI 101 presentation that covers the fundamentals of AI in less than an hour, and traveling to schools to deliver the workshop at no cost.", "\u201cOur goal is to make sure every individual has a baseline understanding of artificial intelligence and automation technologies, and we\u2019re not going to slow down until that mission is complete.\u201d \u2014 Haroon Choudery", "Now, our focus is on scaling the delivery of our AI 101 presentation through our Teach AI To Anyone Toolkit, which is designed to enable educators to teach our AI 101 presentation to others in less than an hour \u2014 no prior knowledge of AI required. In addition to this \u201chorizontal approach\u201d, we\u2019re taking a \u201cvertical approach\u201d by creating workshops that build on top of our AI 101, such as industry-specific workshops.", "A: A.I. For Anyone aims to \u201cequip individuals with the knowledge and skills to keep up in this changing world\u201d. How does A.I. For Anyone achieve this mission, and how has your approach to this goal changed from when you first started the organization in 2017?H: We progress towards our goal of democratizing AI by making it as easy and approachable as possible to digest information from the AI space and to engage in the space. AI is often thought of as a nebulous topic and we strive to change that so that more people feel empowered to voice their thoughts and opinions in order to help shape the future of the technology.", "We\u2019ve created several channels through which our audience can engage with the world of AI, including our introductory workshops, our bi-weekly newsletter, our podcast, and others just to name a few.", "A: What advice would you have for other aspiring data scientists who are looking to grow their career and make a positive social impact in the industry? H: The biggest piece of advice I have for data scientists (and tech workers in general) is to do your best to be aware of the impact that your work is having on underrepresented communities. As tech workers, you\u2019re in a powerful and privileged position to influence change much more than the everyday person. You can and should amplify the voices of the unheard if you have the ability to do so.", "A: How can our readers get involved with A.I. For Anyone?H: You can apply to volunteer at A.I. For Anyone at", "With a reach of 1,500 students through in-person artificial intelligence fundamentals workshops, and more than 50,000 attendees for their virtual workshops, A.I. For Anyone is leading the charge to democratizing artificial intelligence literacy. More than being a trusted source of artificial intelligence education, A.I. For Anyone is paving the way to a more equitable and accessible world in the age of technology.", "Special thanks to Haroon Choudery for allowing me to interview him for this series, and a huge shout out to the TDS Editorial Team for supporting this project.", "Do you know an inspiring technologist who you would like featured in this series? Are you working on any cool data science and tech projects that you\u2019d like me to write about? Feel free to email me at angelamarieteng@gmail.com for comments and suggestions.
