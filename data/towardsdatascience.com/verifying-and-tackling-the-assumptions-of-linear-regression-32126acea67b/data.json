Despite its apparent simplicity, it relies however on a few key assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, absence of multicollinearity, independence and normality of errors). Good knowledge of these is crucial to create and improve your model. In this post, I will go over the five main assumptions and explain their importance as well as a few solutions in case they would not be respected.", "As obvious as this may seem, linear regression assumes that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the predictors.", "Pair-wise scatterplots may be helpful in validating the linearity assumption as it is easy to visualize a linear relationship on a plot.", "In addition and similarly, a partial residual plot that represents the relationship between a predictor and the dependent variable while taking into account all the other variables may help visualize the \u201ctrue nature of the relationship\u201d between variables.", "What could it mean for the model if it is not respected?", "If linearity is not respected, the regression will underfit and will not accurately model the relationship between the dependent and the independent variables.", "Independent variables and the dependent variables could be transformed so that the relationship between them is linear. For instance, you could find that the relationship is linear between the log of the dependent variables and some of the independent variables squared (c.f. Polynomial Regression and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for an interesting generalization of this).", "Homoscedasticity means that the residuals have constant variance no matter the level of the dependent variable.", "To verify homoscedasticity, one may look at the residual plot and verify that the variance of the error terms is constant across the values of the dependent variable.", "What could it mean for the model if it is not respected?", "In the case of heteroscedasticity, the model will not fit all parts of the model equally and it will lead to biased predictions. It also often means that confounding variables, important predictors, have been omitted (it could also be due to the fact that the linearity assumption is not respected). While for the predictive context of data science, this may not be of utmost importance, heteroscedasticity is relatively more important in the context of inference, regarding the interpretability of the coefficients.", "As heteroscedasticity generally reflects the absence of confounding variables, it can be tackled by reviewing the predictors and providing additional independent variables (and maybe even check that the linearity assumption is respected as well).", "Multicollinearity refers to the fact that two or more independent variables are highly correlated (or even redundant in the extreme case). While it may not be important for non-parametric methods, it is primordial for parametric models such as linear regression.", "Often, a tell-tale sign of multicollinearity is the fact that some of the estimated coefficients have the \u201cwrong\u201d sign (i.e. the coefficient related to the size of a being negative in a model attempting to predict house prices).", "Pairwise correlations could be the first step to identify potential relationships between various independent variables.", "A more thorough method, however, would be to look at the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF). It is calculated by regressing each independent variable on all the others and calculating a score as follows:", "Hence, if there exists a linear relationship between an independent variable and the others, it will imply a large R-squared for the regression and thus a larger VIF. As a rule of thumb, VIFs scores above 5 are generally indicators of multicollinearity (above 10 it can definitely be considered an issue).", "What could it mean for the model if it is not respected?", "The model may be producing inaccurate coefficient estimates that could thus not be interpreted. It may thus hurt inference power and possibly predictive performance.", "In the presence of multicollinearity, the regression\u2019s results may also become unstable and vary tremendously depending on the training data.", "Multicollinearity can be fixed by performing feature selection: deleting one or more independent variables.", "A common approach is to use backward subset-regression: start by building a regression with all the potential independent variables and iteratively remove variables with high VIF and using domain-specific knowledge.", "Another method could be to isolate and keep only the interaction effects between multiple independent variables (using intuition or regularization generally).", "As multicollinearity is reduced, the model will become more stable and the coefficients\u2019 interpretability will be improved.", "Autocorrelation refers to the fact that observations\u2019 errors are correlated.", "To verify that the observations are not auto-correlated, we can use the Durbin-Watson test. The test will output values between 0 and 4. The closer it is to 2, the less auto-correlation there is between the various variables (0\u20132: positive auto-correlation, 2\u20134: negative auto-correlation).", "What could it mean for the model if it is not respected?", "Auto-correlation could mean that the linearity of the relationship is not respected or that variables may have been omitted.", "Auto-correlation would lead to spurious relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable.", "For time-series, one could add a lag variable. Another potential way to tackle this is to modify the variables from absolute value to relative change (i.e. instead of a stock price, it could be the change percentage from one period to the next).", "More generally, variables should be further fine-tuned and added to the model.", "If the residuals are not normally distributed, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and thus the regression, may become biased.", "To verify the normality of error, an easy way is to draw the distribution of residuals against levels of the dependent variable. One can use a QQ-plot and measure the divergence of the residuals from a normal distribution. If the resulting curve is not normal (i.e. is skewed), it may highlight a problem.", "What could it mean for the model if it is not respected?", "If it is not respected, it may highlight the presence of large outliers or highlight other assumptions being violated (i.e. linearity, homoscedasticity). As a result, calculating t-statistics and confidence intervals with the standard methodologies will become biased.", "In the case where errors are not normally distributed, one could verify that the other assumptions are respected (i.e. homoscedasticity, linearity), as it may often be a tell-tale sign of such a violation, and fine-tune the model accordingly.", "Otherwise, one should also attempt to treat the large outliers in the data and check if the data could not be separate subsets using different models.", "In addition to the numerous assumptions enumerated above, it may be very relevant to verify that your linear regression is not extrapolating outside of the range of the training data and that there are no outliers or single records that may skew/have too much leverage on the regression (cf. Cook\u2019s distance and rule of thumbs for detecting outliers)", "As highlighted throughout this post, despite its apparent simplicity, linear regression relies on numerous assumptions. When building a model, it is important to verify that they are being respected and to tackle potential violations in case they arise. I hope this guide will help you understand better the various assumptions behind the linear regression and give you the tools needed to tackle potential problems you may face as you use it.", "PS: I am currently a Master of Engineering Student at Berkeley and I am still learning about all of this.
