This playlist might have begun as a well-curated R&B vibe, whose airy vocals and hypnotic beats made the perfect soundtrack for your morning cup of coffee. Over time, however, your changing moods and Spotify recommendations transformed this playlist into nothing more than a rolling bumrush of diverse songs and genres that don\u2019t come together for a consistent listening experience.", "Therefore, I tried answered the following question with this project:", "Given a Spotify playlist with far too many songs, how can I use data science to break this large playlist into smaller playlists of similar songs?", "The first step of the process was to access the list of tracks in my playlist, as well as their audio features. To do this, I used the Python library Spotipy to access Spotify\u2019s Web API.", "To begin, I logged onto my Spotify account on the Spotify for Developers Dashboard, then selected \u201cCreate An App\u201d to create a new application. As long as your app is \u201cNon-Commercial\u201d, I believe you shouldn\u2019t encounter any issues in this process. After I created my app, I located my Client ID and Client Secret and stored them in client_id and client_secret variables. These variables were then used to verify access to the Spotify Web API:", "From here, I accessed the tracks and their audio features:", "Using these requests, I populated a Pandas Dataframe with the track name, track artist, and track audio features for each song in my playlist. Spotify provides many audio features for each track, and the details for each of these audio features can be found here. Additionally, I referenced this article and examples from Spotipy\u2019s site to access the tracks in my playlist and their audio features. If you\u2019re curious about Spotipy and Spotify\u2019s Web API, check out Spotipy\u2019s documentation page and Spotify\u2019s Web API.", "To begin exploring my data, I visualized the correlation and hierarchical clustering of the audio features using Seaborn\u2019s heat map and cluster map.", "After glancing through the cluster map, it\u2019s clear that most of the audio features don\u2019t have strong correlations with each other, apart from energy and loudness (in which case a strong positive correlation makes complete sense). Somewhat displeased with my understanding of the data, I decided to perform a principal component analysis.", "Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a method of dimensionality reduction, which is when a dataset with many variables is condensed into a few components that explain most, but not all, of the variance in your original dataset. More information can be found in this excerpt from the Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas.", "Each additional component of a PCA explains additional variance in the dataset, and I wanted to plot how much variance is explained by n number of components as you increase n. Doing this would help me find the ideal number of components that explains the data by looking for the \u201celbow\u201d in this plot, which is where an increase in n results a diminishing increase in explained variance, presenting itself as a cusp on the plot. However, for this dataset, my plot looked like:", "That\u2019s rough. Although the ratio of variance explained by each additional component is decreasing, I would need eight components to explain only 76% of the variance in the data, which just doesn\u2019t seem to be that helpful.", "Nevertheless, the results of my exploration suggest my data doesn\u2019t exhibit multicollinearity, indicating that predictor variables aren\u2019t highly linearly correlated to each other, which is useful if I want to use a linear model.", "It\u2019s time to cluster my tracks into new playlists! I used K-means clustering, which is a clustering algorithm that breaks your data into k clusters. This post by Ben Alex Keen is excellent if you want to learn more about the algorithm.", "The first time I ran K-means, I grouped my tracks into four clusters, as that seemed like a good number of playlists to make (in most other cases, the \u201celbow method\u201d is used to determine how many clusters to use). However, one cluster only had seven tracks, which isn\u2019t a playlist I\u2019d listen to very often. Therefore, I instead ran K-means with three clusters.", "I now wanted to see if there was a clear, visual separation between these clusters. Since the original dataset has many variables, I returned to my PCA and decomposed the dataset into two components, hoping that these two components would show some visual separation between clusters.", "Each point indicates one track, and the color indicates that track\u2019s cluster. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a nice chart I can point to that visually separates the clusters based on principal components.", "Instead, to understand the differences between each cluster, I constructed a Pandas Dataframe to compare the means of each audio feature within each cluster, where the index represents the cluster:", "I was still curious to understand how a track\u2019s audio features affected its cluster. Knowing that the data doesn\u2019t exhibit multicollinearity, I decided to use a linear model to explore this question. Specifically, I first clustered my data with K-means clustering into two clusters, and I then used logistic regression to predict a track\u2019s cluster.", "In the last step, I created a Pandas Series called log_coeff that shows the coefficient for each of the audio features that the model used to determine a track\u2019s class. Audio features paired with coefficients of larger magnitudes were more important to the model\u2019s classification of a track.", "I also checked the classification report and confusion matrix of my logistic model to ensure that the model is accurate enough. Both functions can be found in sklearn.metrics, and would be implemented as follows:", "To conclude, through this project, I took my playlist and broke it down into three smaller playlists. During the process, I used principal component analysis, K-means clustering, and logistic regression.", "The full code used for this project can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
