Prior to training a model, you will first need to go through a lengthy process. Carrying out tasks such as dealing with missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical and analysing the data to inform feature engineering and selection.", "There are a number of tools that seek to automate much of this process including the well known auto-sklearn library. However, many of these are very much a black box and it is both difficult to understand exactly how the tool has changed the data and customise the process if the data has some uniqueness to it.", "The relatively new python library dabl created by Andreas Mueller seeks to address this problem. Dabl offers a tool to automate many of the repetitive tasks involved in the initial model development phase. Although features are currently a little limited, the functionality that does exist is very promising. Looking at the Github repo development is very much ongoing with the latest commit to the project happening as recently as November 15th 2019. In the remainder of the article, I will walk through a simple evaluation of the tool.", "Dabl can be pip installed as shown below. The library is also dependant on having the latest version of scikit-learn installed so if you don\u2019t have this you will need to upgrade or install the latest version scikit-learn==0.21.3.", "To illustrate some of the features I am going to be using a Kaggle data set from the \u2018give me some credit\u2019 competition. The dataset can be downloaded here. I am using the cs-training.csv file which contains features about a persons credit history and circumstances, and the target variable (\u2018SeriousDiqin2yrs`). Which indicates if they have experienced serious financial stress in the last 2 years.", "Ordinarily, the first part of a machine learning project would be to understand the data and perform the necessary preprocessing prior to training a model. Dabl seeks to automate this process. If you run the following commands dabl will attempt to identify missing values, feature types and erroneous data. The output for our data set is shown below the code.", "For more information about the feature types it has identified you can type.", "Dabl will use the above to apply the appropriate preprocessing to the features when a model is fitted to the data. What is particularly useful is that 1) you can visualise exactly what dabl is inferring, and 2) you can make adaptations to the preprocessing if you think that the inferred data type is incorrect. For example in the above dabl has recognised the feature NumberOfDependents as a continuous variable. However, this may actually perform better in a model if treated as categorical so we could opt to specify it as categorical this is shown in the code below.", "The second most time-consuming part of model development is data analysis. Before training a model it is important to understand the underlying distribution of the data, how balanced the target classes are and which features are closely correlated to the target variable. Dabl seeks to also simplify this process. Simply running this single line of code returns a whole host of useful visualisations. As dabl detects features types and automatically cleans the data this makes analysing the data extremely fast.", "Dabl also seeks to speed up the model selection process. By running a very small amount of code dabl trains a selection of scikit-learn models and returns the corresponding scores.", "This library is very new and still very much under development. Looking at the documentation there are some useful features still to come including model explainers and tools for enhanced model building. At present this library offers a way to automate a lot of the work at the beginning of model development and in particular would be useful for very fast prototyping of machine learning models.", "Your home for data science.
