Self-learning is an art that requires discipline, dedication and discipline to master. It gives you the flexibilty to couple learning with work or school if mastered properly. However, when starting to learn Data Science, AI or ML, the beginning stages are very tough but trust me when I say it is worth the worry. The key to making good progress when learning by yourself is to study at your own pace. In this story, I am going to share a path which people seeking to learn Data Science, AI and ML can follow and make good progress at learning new things. I will also share links to resources I have personally used and can recommend without a doubt.", "As annoying as this sounds, it is very essential in this field. I think it is safe to assume that anyone reading this has some basic to intermediate knowledge in mathematics from high school. It\u2019s a good start but its nothing close to enough in the the field of Data Science, AI and ML. You would need to dive deep a little further and learn some concepts in statistics, algebra and other topics. I would compile a list of topics and resources to help you study math for data science but it has already been perfectly done in this article by Ibrahim Sharaf ElDen.", "As a beginner, do not jump straight into learning to write code for machine learning but rather, learn the core concepts of programming in general. Learn what programming is all about, learn the types of code that exists and how to properly write code. This is very important because you will learn many essential concepts that you\u2019ll live with for the rest of your life in this field. Take it slow in this step, do not rush into learning advanced things, understanding most of the things in this step will determine how good you will be in the industry. You can find a very good video resource which introduces you to programming and computer science here. This video takes you through all the important concepts of programming and computer science in general. Take your time with it and make sure you understand every bit of it.", "There are many languages Data Scientists, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Engineers use today to get their work done with the most used languages being Python, R, Java, Julia and SQL. Many other languages can be used but the ones I listed are the most used languages for a number of reasons.", "There is absolutely nothing wrong with learning more than one language, as a matter of fact, it is a good thing to know more than one language. However, you have to take your time when learning programming languages and try as much as you can not to learn more than one language simultaneously as this may confuse you and leave you disoriented for a while. Take your time, learn one language at a time and make sure to learn only the parts of a language you need for your career. I would suggest you learn python before any other language as it is a relatively easy language to understand. I would also recommend you learn general python before you go into learning python for data science and AI/ML.", "Data will most often not be handed to you dierctly, sometimes there will be no data for you at all but whatever be the case, you have to find a way to get data you can work with. The organization you work with may have a good data collection system, if they do, thats a plus for you. If not, you have to find a way to get data, not just any data but good data you can work with to achieve your goal. Getting data does not directly imply to mining data, it is a process under data mining. You can get free and open source data in many places on the internet and you may sometimes have to scrape data from websites. Web scraping is very important and I beseech everyone to learn it as a need for it may arise in your career as a Data scientist, AI or ML engineer. Here is a good tutorial on web scraping. Data may also be kept in a database so as a Data scientist, AI or ML engineer, you have to know a bit of database administration so as to be able to connect to and work directly from a database. Knowledge in SQL is very essential in this stage. You can learn SQL for Data Science here.", "This is most often called Data Wrangling. This process involves cleaning the data you have, this can be done by performing some Exploratory Data Analysis on the data you have and prunning out the unwanted parts of your data. The process also involves structuring the data you have into a form that you can work with. This stage is the most exhausting part of working on a project in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. In the learning process, most of the sample data you are going to work with have been pre-processed but data in the real world might have not been through any stage of processing. As someone aspiring to be good at what you do in this field, you should find some real world data and work around it. Real world data can be found almost anywhere but Kaggle is an amazing place to get real world data from companies around the globe. Data wrangling or processing is an extremely tiring task but with constant dedication and consistency, it can be a very interesting thing for you. You can find an amazing lecture on Data Wrangling by a Cambrige professor here.", "Being a Data Scientist, AI or ML engineer doesn\u2019t necessarily mean everyone at your workplace or in your team will be able to understand the technicalities in your field or will be able to make inferences from data in its raw form. This is why there is a need to learn to visualize data. Data Visualization basically refers to the process of presenting data in a graphical form in order to give anyone regardless of their knowledge in data science, AI or ML an understanding of what the data is about. There are many ways of visualizing data. As programmers, writing code to visualize data should be our go-to method as this is fast and comes with no costs. Writing code to visualize data can be done with many of the free and open source libraries that come with the programming languages we use. Matplotlib, Seaborn and Bokeh are all python libraries we can use to visualize data. You can find a video tutorial on data visualization with matplotlib here. Another way of visualizing data is using closed-source tools such as Tableau. There are many closed-source tools out there for data visualization and they are used to make more elegant and complex visualisations but they come at a cost. Tableau is the most common one and it is a tool I personally use very often. Learning to use Tableau is something I would recommend to everyone. You can find a very good tutorial on using Tableau here.", "Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are more like subsets of Data Science because they are powered by data. They refer to the process involved in training machines or other inanimate objects to behave like human beings by feeding them with well-processed data. Machines can be taught to do many things human beings can do by gradually teaching and guiding them. Think of machines in this case as babies who have no knowledge at all but are gradually taught to identify objects, speak, learn from mistakes and become better. Machines can also be taught in the same way to do most of those things. AI and ML is basically bringing life to machines by use of many mathematical algorithms. The full potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is still not known since it is one of the fields that is constantly being improved. But for now, AI and ML is widely used for cognitive functions such as Object Detection and Recognition, Facial Recognition, Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing, Fraud and Spam detection and others. I will leave the In-depth walk-through of AI and ML for another story but for now, I would like you to learn about the general applications of AI and ML here and dive deep into machine learning from this video resource. By the end of these videos you should have gathered a beginner to intermediate knowledge about machine learning, learnt about the many machine learning algorithms available, what they do and how to use them. You should by now be ready to build your first simple machine learning model, which you can do with help from this article by Victor Roman.", "Models you build using machine learning can be made available to everyone on the internet by deploying them. To do this, a good understanding of web development is needed as you would have to create a webpage or a group of webpages to house your model. The front-end of your website would also need to communicate with the back-end which contains your model. For this, you\u2019d also need to know how to build and integrate APIs to handle the communication between the front-end of your website and the backend which houses your machine learning model. You may need a good understanding of cloud computing and DevOPs if you intend to deploy your machine learning models on a cloud server, through a pipeline or docker container. There are many ways of deploying machine learning models but for a start, I suggest you learn how to deploy machine learning models using the python web framework, Flask. A good tutorial for doing that can be found here.", "Learning on your own is amazing but nothing beats learning directly from a professional in the industry. This is because you get to learn real life concepts and other things only hands-on experience can teach. There are many benefits with having a mentor but not every mentor can be impactful in your career or life as a whole. That is why it is important to have a good mentor. Notitia AI is a good platform for being trained from beginner to expert level in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning where you will be assigned a personal Mentor who will personally and professionally contibute to your growth in the chosen field. Its is also the most affordable virtual training and mentorship platform you can find out there.", "Note that just taking courses and learning from online resources will not make you a Data Scientist, AI or ML Engineer. You will have to get certified by institutions that offer certifications in these fields and some job positions will also require you to have some academic degrees. Take your time to learn, earn your certifications or degrees and you will be industry ready.", "I hope you liked this story and it has been helpful to you. Thanks for making time to read this. Kindly share your thoughts and opinions on this story and feel free to correct me at places you think I have gone wrong. I am human and as such, I am prone to making mistakes. You can reach me directly on Twitter or LinkedIn. You can also contact me to suggest topics you\u2019d like me to write about in my consequent stories. Have a wonderful day.", "A big thank you to Anna Ayiku for proofreading and correcting the many mistakes I made writing this.", "Your home for data science.
