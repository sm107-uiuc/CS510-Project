John currently writes for The Athletic, was the VP of Basketball Operations for the Memphis Grizzlies, and was a columnist at ESPN and\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["If you\u2019re a fan of NBA basketball and you\u2019re a fan of analytics, you\u2019ve heard of PER.", "PER is an all-in-one statistic developed by John Hollinger. John currently writes for The Athletic, was the VP of Basketball Operations for the Memphis Grizzlies, and was a columnist at ESPN and Sports Illustrated. He is the author of four basketball analytics books and is a titan of the NBA analytics community.", "The player efficiency rating (PER) is a rating of a player\u2019s per-minute productivity.", "PER is rightly cited as one of the godfather stats of the advanced analytics movement in basketball. It was one of the first basketball measurements to adjust for pace of play, adjust for playing time, and to normalize data across seasons (the measure assigns an average player for each season at 15 PER). PER is still commonly cited on broadcasts and in the media.", "Some people say PER is overly complex. Some say it doesn\u2019t account enough for defense. Others say it overvalues scoring.", "While the above statements may be true, the real problem lies in the methodology \u2014 it\u2019s less about the math and more about the approach to data analysis that led to its imperfections. Today, I want to focus on Hollinger\u2019s PER research method in hopes that we can all \u2014 as data scientists \u2014 avoid similar mistakes in the future.", "In research there are a few general steps scientists follow:", "Now that we have a basic understanding of research methods, let\u2019s take a brief theoretical look at how you might approach figuring out per-minute productivity in the NBA.", "Let\u2019s compare this to what we see with John Hollinger\u2019s work with PER.", "What PER can do, however, is summarize a player\u2019s statistical accomplishments in a single number. That allows us to unify the disparate data on each player we try to track in our heads[\u2026] so that we can move on to evaluating what might be missing from the stats.", "He achieved the former goal with PER, but along the way he failed to conduct the basic scientific analysis needed to make sure his metric was statistically valid in achieving the latter.", "To be fair to John Hollinger, he might not consider himself a data scientist. Heck, he probably thought PER would primarily be a tool for him to use for his writing, and he\u2019s probably updated his personal beliefs on PER.", "But the work he did with PER definitely falls under the data science scope, and PER hasn\u2019t been updated as a statistical measure. There were some mistakes he could have easily avoided with PER if he\u2019d followed basic scientific method principles from the beginning.", "Additionally\u200a\u2014\u200abecause PER is so popular\u200a\u2014\u200amany other data scientists in the basketball analytics community are also making the same mistakes\u00a0Hollinger\u00a0made.", "Let\u2019s try and put a stop to that. Here is how you can easily learn from (and avoid) the data science mistakes made with PER.", "In data analysis it\u2019s extremely important to be specific in all aspects of your project. Make sure you:", "If you don\u2019t do this before you start extracting data you\u2019re basically running blind and wasting a lot of time.", "If John Hollinger had been more specific with his PER methodology we would easily be able to see whether or not PER was an effective measure. As it stands, we don\u2019t know what \u201cproductivity\u201d is in the context of PER according to John. We all have our own ideas \u2014 mine is that productivity should be measured by team wins \u2014 but it\u2019s all based on our personal definitions instead of a stated definition by the scientist conducting the research.", "This ties into the former point \u2014 since Hollinger had no specific outcome variables there are no reported findings. Websites that still use PER do not report whether PER significantly predicts wins, what percentage of wins it predicts, or any other findings regarding potential outcome variables.", "For any project you do, it\u2019s imperative that you report both the significance and effect size of your independent (i.e. predictor) variables\u00a0on\u00a0any\u00a0dependent\u00a0measures\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0interested\u00a0in.", "The PER on the ESPN and Basketball-Reference.com websites remain the same \u2014 the metric hasn\u2019t changed since its inception. If you are going to do data science, you have to be ready to iterate based on your findings.", "Just because you had beliefs about something before doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t update those beliefs if you find evidence that runs to the contrary. Let the data guide you to better theories and models.", "Despite its flaws PER remains a heavily used NBA statistics. Why is that?", "Well, for one, I\u2019m quite certain it does predict some amount of variance in team wins (even if the effect sizes haven\u2019t been stated outright). There\u2019s also the matter of cultural relevance \u2014 PER is embedded deeply into NBA culture now.", "It\u2019s cultural relevance comes down to two main things:", "15 \u2014 the \u201caverage\u201d PER score \u2014 is a relatable basketball score. If someone scores 15 \u201creal\u201d points in a basketball game we think of them as a good player. If someone scores in the high 20s or in the 30s we see them as a great player.", "In that sense, PER is brilliant. John Hollinger understood the psychology of NBA fans and made sure his measurement was something his readers could easily identify with.", "Again, PER is not a perfect measure. But by including it in your research we can get a better understanding of its effectiveness as a metric\u200a\u2014\u200asomething that is currently lacking due to the problems we\u2019ve mentioned above. You\u2019ll also be able to compare the efficacy of other metrics compared to PER, giving us a baseline of\u00a0metric\u00a0efficiency.", "The only way to cure the problems we have with PER are to actually observe PER in data science settings \u2014 even if we don\u2019t find it to be the metric we rely on.", "Just like George Mikan shouldn\u2019t be considered the greatest basketball player of all time, we shouldn\u2019t consider PER the GOAT of basketball analytics. Smart teams seemed to have moved on from using it as a measure of player evaluation. Hopefully, broadcasters and media members will move away from it too as we get more knowledgeable about how the game of basketball should be measured statistically.", "At the same time, PER is the cultural keystone of basketball analytics. I\u2019m not joking when I say I think it should be enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.", "It might fail some simple scientific principles, but without it we might still be stuck in the dark ages of basketball statistics.", "As data scientists, we should revere what John Hollinger did \u2014 and then learn to do better.", "Your home for data science.
