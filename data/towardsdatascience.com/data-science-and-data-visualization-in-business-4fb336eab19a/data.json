Data visualization has a compelling and inspirational purpose. The use of the web and new technology like document and databases, such as Excel and Power BI, has enabled visualization to become both essential and engaging.", "For business decision makers, the search for useful data often starts with visuals. But, there is a lack of effective tools for charting data and visualizing it in ways that meet the needs of analysts and decision makers alike. Data visualization is one of the critical components of organizational data science. Data science is worth using in today\u2019s competitive marketplace.", "Today, data tools are much better than they were 5 years ago, and are more widely available to a wider audience. Therefore, data tools are essential to quickly tap into the wealth of data available to the business to make accurate and useful decision on future investments and decisions. There are many vendors who have put their best efforts into making data science tools and platforms more user-friendly and business-ready. While some of the more well-known tools have all the functionality, there are several other tools that can benefit from integrating with certain data analysis workflow or integration with other BI applications. A look at some data visualization trends will bring out some of these trends.", "In the early 1980s, before the emergence of R and NumPy, it was difficult to get a complete tool set for data visualization in an integrated fashion. Since the emergence of R, and other numerical computing tools, there are now tool boxes which represent the development of data visualization solutions such as the Linux Data Studio and custom software and proprietary solutions which enhance the functionality and power of certain business and technical analytics.", "Right now we have even more tools available, either in the form of programming languages (Python and R notably) but also in the form of ready-to-use tools coming both from large enterprises (Google, Microsoft) as well as smaller startups.", "Data is a basic resource. It shows the necessity of your business regardless if it is about mapping, collecting customer lists or developing intelligent chatbot. It can answer the customer\u2019s question and provide contextual guidance about solutions.", "However, like the concept, use of data is also confusing. It can be used for different purposes, and only few business do data science right. So, what can you do while increasing the effectiveness of data science?", "Always try to be well prepared before applying for a jobs. This goes for every data science position. However, not all data science positions use the same methodology. It is of great importance for the employers and applicants that have achieved success with developing data science teams in their startup or enterprise. Each company has its own way of explaining everything that they believe is important about this topic. Here, I will share my ideas and perspectives on how to approach the implementation of data science in a company. I will conclude with some examples. In between you can click \u201cbooks\u201d on the right hand side to download the data book mentioned in this article.", "If you want to start with something concrete, here\u2019s 3 ideas for your organization.", "It is not only possible, but should be done. As marketers, we are not just building Facebook profiles or endorsements. We are trying to elicit target audience into ordering of products online. In fact, we wish to create authentic discussions.", "To do this we must take into account that \u201creal-time\u201d communication is starting to become the norm and that a huge amount of people use social media platforms to talk about the real-time.", "Hence, real-time bot projects are seen as a good thing. Bot projects look cute and realistic to our users, but they also expand our audience.", "There are plenty of different kinds of real-time projects. My personal favorite is serving comments on other websites or comments on photos with a witty and funny response as opposed to the traditional form of commenting on the web.", "Remember that bots are not real-time in the sense that they will speak constantly.", "It\u2019s also perfect for customer service automation.", "Knowing how a user feels is one thing, but implementing new marketing schemes is actually the most complex task in data science projects.", "How do we make our users believe that there is some real value in what we offer (assuming that our product is awesome of course)? The first problem is to make sure that the users actually click the attractive prices on our website. The second problem is to convince them that they should shop for everything else. And the third problem is to convince them that shopping on our website actually makes them happier.", "The truth is that a real-time marketing platform can be implemented even if you only have a small budget. You may also improve your marketing schemes to optimize your efficiency, and increase the conversion rates.", "It\u2019s all about using data smartly.
