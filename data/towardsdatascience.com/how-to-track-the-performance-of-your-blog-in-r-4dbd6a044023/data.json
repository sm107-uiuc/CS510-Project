["Stats and R has been launched on December 16, 2019. Since the blog is officially one year old today and after having discussed the main benefits of maintaining a technical blog, I thought it would be a good time to share some numbers and thoughts about it.", "In this article, I show how to analyze a blog and its blog posts with the {googleAnalyticsR} R package (see package\u2019s full documentation). After sharing some analytics about the blog, I will also discuss about content creation/distribution and, to a smaller extent, the future plans. This is a way to share my journey as a data science blogger and a way to give you an insight about how Stats and R is doing.", "I decided to share with you some numbers through the {googleAnalyticsR} package instead of the regular Google Analytics dashboards for several reasons:", "I am not an expert in the field of marketing, but who knows, it may still give some ideas to data analysts, SEO specialists or other bloggers on how to track the performance of their own blog or website using R. For those of you who are interested in a more condensed analysis, see my custom Google Analytics dashboard.1", "Before going further, I would like to remind that I am not making a living from my blog (far from it!) and it is definitely not my goal as I do not believe that I would be the same kind of writer if it was my main occupation.", "As for any package in R, we first need to install it \u2014 with install.packages()\u2014and load it\u2014with library():1", "Next, we need to authorize the access of the Google Analytics account using the ga_auth() function:", "Running this code will open a browser window on which you will be able to authorize the access. This step will save an authorization token so you only have to do it once.", "Make sure to run the ga_auth() function in a R script and not in a R Markdown document. Follow this procedure if you want to use the package and its functions in a R Markdown report or in a blog post like I did for this article.", "Once we have completed the Google Analytics authorization, we will need the ID of the Google Analytics account we want to access. All the available accounts linked to your email address (after authentication) are stored in ga_account_list():", "As you can see I have two accounts linked to my Google Analytics profile: one for my personal website (www.antoinesoetewey.com) and one for this blog.", "Of course, I select the account linked to this blog:", "Make sure to edit the code with your own property name.", "We are now finally ready to use our Google Analytics data in R for a better analysis!", "Let\u2019s start with some general numbers, such as the number of users, sessions and page views for the entire site. Note that for the present article, we use data over the past year, so from December 16, 2019 to December 15, 2020:", "For those unfamiliar with Google Analytics data and the difference between these metrics, remember that:", "So if person A reads three blog posts then leave the site and person B reads one blog post, your about page then leave the site, Google Analytics data will show 2 users, 2 sessions and 5 page views.", "In addition to the rather general metrics presented above, it is also interesting to illustrate the daily number of sessions over time in a scatterplot \u2014 together with a smoothed line \u2014 to analyze the evolution of the blog:", "(See how to draw plots with the {ggplot2} package, or with the {esquisse} addin if you are not familiar with the package.)", "As you can see, there was a huge peak of traffic around end of April, with almost 12,000 users in a single day. Yes, you read it well and there is no bug. The blog post \u201cA package to download free Springer books during Covid-19 quarantine\u201d went viral and generated a massive traffic for a few days. The daily number of sessions returned to a more normal level after a couple of days. We also observe an upward trend in the last months (since end of August/beginning of September), which indicates that the blog is growing in terms of number of daily sessions.", "Note that I decided to focus on the number of sessions and the number of page views in this section and the following ones, but you can always change to your preferred metrics by editing metrics = c(\"sessions\") in the code. See all available metrics provided Google Analytics in this article.", "Knowing how people come to your blog is a pretty important factor. Here is how to visualize the evolution of daily sessions per channel in a line plot:", "We see that a large share of the traffic is from the organic channel, which indicates that most readers visit the blog after a query on search engines (mostly Google). In my case, where most of my posts are tutorials and which help people with specific problems, it is thus not a surprise that most of my traffic comes from organic search.", "We also notice some small peaks of sessions generated from the referral and direct channels, which are probably happening on the date of publication of each article.", "We also see that there seems to be a recurrent pattern of ups and downs in the number of daily sessions. Those are weekly cycles, with less readers during the weekend and which indicates that people are working on improving their statistical or R knowledge mostly during the week (which actually makes sense!).", "As shown above, traffic seems to be different depending on the day of week. To investigate this further, we draw a boxplot of the number of sessions for every day of the week:", "As you can see there are some outliers, probably due (in part at least) to the article that went viral. For the sake of illustration, below the same plot after removing points considered as potential outliers according to the interquartile range (IQR) criterion (i.e., points above or below the whiskers), and after a couple of visual improvements:", "After excluding data points above 3,000, it is now easier to see that the median number of sessions (represented by the horizontal bold line in the boxes) is the highest on Wednesdays, and lowest on Saturdays and Sundays.", "The difference in sessions between weekdays is, however, not as large as expected. For the interested reader, if you want to test whether there is a significant difference between the days in terms of number of sessions, you could perform an ANOVA.", "We have seen the traffic per day of week. The example below shows a visualization of traffic, broken down this time by day of week and hour of day in a density plot. In this plot, the device type has also been added for more insights.", "In addition to that, thanks to the additional information on the device category, we also see that:", "In the following code, we create a barplot of the number of daily sessions per month and year:", "This barplot allows to easily see the evolution of the number of sessions over the months, and compare this evolution across different years.", "At the moment, since the blog is online only since December 2019, the year factor is not relevant. However, I still present the visualization for other users who work on older websites, and also to remind my future self to create this interesting barplot when there will be data for more than a year.", "Another important factor when measuring the performance of your blog or website is the number of page views for the different pages. The top performing pages in terms of page views over the year can easily be found in Google Analytics (you can access it via Behavior > Site Content > All pages).", "For the interested reader, here is how to get the data in R (note that you can change n = 7 in the code to change the number of top performing pages to display):", "Here is how to visualize this table of top performing pages in a barplot:", "This gives me a good first overview on how posts performed in terms of page views, so in some sense, what people find useful. For instance, I never thought that the post illustrating the different types of variables that exist in statistics (ranked #2) would be so appreciated when I wrote it.", "This is something I learned with this blog: at the time of writing, there are some posts which I think no one will care about (and which I mostly write as a personal note for myself), and others which I think people will find very useful. However, after a couple of weeks after publication, sometimes I realize that it is actually exactly the opposite.", "When it comes to comparing blog posts, however, this is not as simple.", "Based on the above barplot and without any further analysis, I would conclude that my article about variable types is performing much better than the one about outliers detection in R.", "However, if I tell you that the article on outliers detection has been published on August 11 and the one about variable types on December 30, you will agree that the comparison does not make much sense anymore since page views for these articles were counted over a different length of time. One could also argue that a recent article had less time to generate backlinks, so it is unfair to compare it with an old post which had plenty of time to be ranked high by Google.", "In order to make the comparison more \u201cfair\u201d, we would need to compare the number of page views for each post since their date of publication. The following code does precisely this:2", "Now that our data is ready, we create two visualizations:", "Note that both plots use the {plotly} package to make them interactive so that you can mouse over a line and find out exactly what page it is (together with its values). The interactivity of the plot makes it also possible to zoom in to see, for instance, the number of page views in the first days after publication (instead of the default length of 180 days),3 or zoom in to see only the evolution of the number of page views below/above a certain threshold.", "(See the original post for interactivity on this plot.)", "The plot above shows again a huge spike for the post that went viral (orange line). If we zoom in to include only page views below 1500, comparison between posts is easier and we see that:", "(See the original post for interactivity on this plot.)", "Compared to the previous plot, this one shows the cumulative number of page views since the date of publication of the post.", "Without taking into consideration the post that went viral and which, by the way, does not really generate much traffic anymore (which makes sense since the incredible campaign from Springer to offer their books for free during the COVID-19 quarantine has ended), we see that:", "The analyses so far give you already a good understanding of the performance of your blog. However, for the interested readers, we show other important metrics in the following sections.", "In the following we are interested in seeing where the traffic comes from. This is particularly interesting to get to know your audience, and even more important if you are running a business or an ecommerce.", "To visualize this table of top countries in terms of page views in a barplot:", "We see that readers from the US take the largest share of the number of page views (by quite a lot actually!), and Belgium (my country) comes in third place in terms of number of page views.", "Given that the US population is much larger than the Belgian population (\u2248 331 million people compared to \u2248 11.5 million people, respectively), the above result is not really surprising. Again, for a better comparison, it would be interesting to take into consideration the size of the population when comparing countries.", "Indeed, it could be that a large share of the traffic comes from a country with a large population, but that the number of page views per person (or per 100,000 inhabitants) is higher for another country. This information about top performing countries in terms of page views per person could give you insights on which country do the most avid readers come from. This is beyond the scope of this article, but you can see examples of plots which include the information on the population size in these COVID-19 visualizations. I recommend to apply the same methodology to the above plot for a better comparison.", "If you are thinking about doing the extra step of including population size when comparing countries, I believe that it would be even better to take into account the information on computer access in each country as well. If we take India as example: at the time of writing this article, its population amounts to almost 1.4 billion. However, the percentage of Indian people having access to a computer is undoubtedly lower than in US or Belgium (again, at least at the moment). It would therefore make more sense to compare countries by comparing the number of page views per people having access to a computer.4", "For more technical aspects, you could also be interested in the number of page views by browser. This can be visualized with the following barplot:", "Most visits were, as expected, from Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers.", "One may also be interested in checking how users are engaged on different types of devices. To do so, we plot 3 charts describing:", "From the above plot, we see that the majority of readers visited the blog from a desktop, and a small number of readers from a tablet.", "From the above plot, we see that:", "Given this result, it would be interesting to also illustrate the number of page views during a session, represented by device type.", "Indeed, it may be the case that visitors on mobile spend, on average, more time on each page but people on desktop visit more pages per session. We verify this via a density plot, and for better readability we exclude data points above 2.5 page views/session and we exclude visits from a tablet:", "This last plot confirms our thoughts, that is, although people on mobile seem to spend more time on each page, people on desktop tend to visit more pages per session.", "(One may wonder why I chose to compare medians instead of means. The main reason is that not all distributions considered here are bell-shaped (especially for data on tablet) and there are many outliers. In these cases, the mean is usually not the most appropriate descriptive statistics and the median is a more robust way to represent such data. For the interested reader, see a note on the difference between mean and median, and the context in which each measure is more appropriate.)", "This is the end of the analytics section. Of course, many more visualizations and data analyses are possible, depending on the site that is tracked and the marketing expertise of the analyst. This was an overview of what is possible, and I hope it will give you some ideas to explore your Google Analytics data further. Next year, I may also include forecasts and make annual comparisons. See also some examples of other analyses in this GitHub repository and this website.", "As a side note, I would like to add the following: even if tracking the performance of your blog is important to understand how you attract visitors and how they engage with your site, I also believe that looking at your Google Analytics stats too often is not optimal, nor sane.", "Talking about personal experience: at the beginning of the blog I used to look very often at the number of visitors in real-time and the audience. I was kind of obsessed to know how many people were right now on my blog and I was constantly checking if it performed better than the day before in terms of number of visitors. I remember that I was spending so much time looking at these metrics in the first weeks that I felt I was wasting my time. And the time I was wasting looking at my Google Analytics stats was lost not creating good quality content for the blog, working on my thesis/classes, or other projects.", "So when I realized that, I deleted the Google Analytics app from my smartphone and forced myself not to look at my stats more than once a month (just to make sure there is no critical issues that need to be fixed). From that moment onward, I stopped wasting my time on things I cannot control, and I got more satisfaction from writing articles because I was writing them for myself, not for the sake of seeing people reading them. This change was like a relief, and I am now more satisfied with my work on this blog compared to the first weeks or months.", "Everyone is different and unique so I am not saying that you should do the same. However, if you feel that you look too much at your stats and sometimes lose motivation in writing, perhaps this is one potential solution.", "Now that we have seen how we can analyze Google Analytics data and track the performance of a website or blog in details, I would like to share some thoughts about content creation, content distribution and the future plans.", "One of the biggest challenges I face with my blog is creating proper content. In the best case scenario, I would like to:", "By sharing only articles about topics I am familiar with, the writing process is easier and quicker. Indeed, most of the articles I wrote cover topics I teach at university, so a large part of the preliminary research is already done when I decide to write about it. Also (and this is not negligible), questions and incomprehension from students allow me to see the points I should focus on when writing about it, and how to present it to make it accessible and comprehensible to most people.", "Moreover, by making my thoughts public, I often have the chance to confront them with other points of view, which allows me to study the topic even further. This in turn accelerates the writing process even more when writing about a related topic.", "I also tend to write only about things I enjoy or I am interested in. I prefer quality over quantity, so writing an article from A to Z takes quite a long time depending on the depth of the subject. Since it takes time (even without taking into account the time spent after publication) and I have a full-time job, I really focus on topics I enjoy in order to keep seeing this blog as a source of pleasure, and not as a work or an obligation.", "The fact that I write only about things I am familiar with, which I enjoy and when I have some free time (which mostly depend on the ongoing projects related to my PhD thesis) makes it hard for me to follow a defined pace for posts. This is why my writing schedule has been a bit inconsistent during this first year and is likely to be similar in the future as I do not want to be in the position to force myself to write.6", "Even if we all agree that bloggers should write for themselves first and not for the sake of having lots of readers, it is still appreciated when your content is being read by others.", "So although I do not like abusive self-promotion and I do not feel comfortable sharing my blog posts to all existing Facebook, LinkedIn and Reddit groups, somehow people need to get informed that you have written something.", "For this reason, I created a Twitter account where I share new posts immediately after publishing them on the blog. In addition to posting them on Twitter, I also share the link by email to people who subscribed to the newsletter of the blog.", "I also managed to get my content published on Medium through the Towards Data Science publication, R-bloggers and R Weekly. A non-negligible part of my audience comes from these referral, especially during the couple of days after publication.", "By distributing the content this way, I do not feel pushy (something I want to avoid at all costs!) because people decided by themselves to receive the content I publish (e.g., they subscribed to the newsletter, they followed the blog on Twitter, they chose to read blog aggregators, etc.). So in some sense, I do not distribute my content \u201cwithout their prior consent\u201d and they can always choose not to see my posts anymore.", "However, as you can see from the plot of the number of session per channel, you see that most readers come from the organic channel, so from search engines. And for this channel, apart from creating quality content (and some basic knowledge in SEO), I do not have any control on how well it is presented nor distributed to people. For this channel, it is basically search engine algorithms which decide to promote my content or not, and if they do, how well it is promoted. The only control I have regarding ranking factors is simply to create quality content.", "So even if I believe that having a content distribution strategy definitely helps in reaching more people and growing your blog, it does not make everything. Creating quality content is, in my view of a beginner in SEO and marketing, the best strategy for my posts to be read.", "For this very specific reason, now that I feel I have settled a decent distribution strategy, I no longer spend my energy and time on this matter.", "So I just simply try to enjoy writing on my blog, and the rest will eventually follow. If not, I am still learning a lot from this blog anyway so I do not see it as wasted time.", "I know that an easy way to get money out of your blog is to run ads and I understand that people do it if it is profitable. However, I often find ads too intrusive or annoying and I personally do not like to read blog posts which include many ads.", "To keep the reading process as enjoyable as possible, as you can see, I do not display any advertising on my blog. As long as the costs of running this website and the related open source projects (e.g., my Shiny apps, etc.) are not too high, I do not expect to include ads.", "If in the future costs were to increase, I will still try to avoid putting ads as much as possible and I will try to rely on sponsorship programs & donations and on paid side projects for people who need help for their statistical analyses.", "After exactly one year of blogging, I am asking myself the following:", "What do I want statsandr.com to be?", "As already said, as long as I enjoy writing stuff I am passionate about on this blog, I will continue. This is very important to me.", "In addition to that, I would like it to be a place to share knowledge. The field of statistics and R (and data science in general) is evolving at an extremely fast pace \u2014 and more and more people have many interesting things to say.", "Moreover, I learned a lot since the launch this blog. But I learned even more when working in collaboration with someone else (see for instance these collaborations). I see so many learning opportunities when collaborating that I would love to see this blog as a place to share knowledge, but not only my knowledge.", "To be more precise, I would love to hear about other researchers, statisticians, R lovers, data scientists, authors, etc. who want to collaborate with me. This could lead, in the end, to:", "With this article, you see the figures and the audience of the blog.
