In total, there were 5,047 images.", "Then, labels for each image were extracted using Google Cloud\u2019s Vision API. The Cloud Vision API leverages \u201cGoogle\u2019s vast network of machine learning expertise\u201d (great article by Sara Robinson) to detect features and labels about images. In total, 487 different labels were given to the 5,047 images.", "Machine learning techniques called feature extraction and reverse image search were then done using Gene Kogan\u2019s code to find images based on visual similarity. First, a pre-trained convolutional neural network was used to extract \u201cfeatures\u201d for each image, then, the cosine similarity of those features was computed to \u201csearch\u201d for a handful of images similar to a query image.", "The main role of features in computer vision is to \u201ctransform visual information into vector space\u201d. Similar images should produce similar features, which we can exploit to do information retrieval. Based on these features, we can also cluster images by similarity using a method called t-SNE.", "In this section, I present the findings of my computer vision analysis. Below, I report on the following three metrics:", "Labels for each photo was generated using Use Google Cloud Vision API. The idea behind this was to categorise the images so that I could identify similar ones. The bar graph below shows the top 10 labels for the 5,000 images.", "We see that \u201cnight\u201d and \u201clight\u201d appeared the most. These labels make sense because it was a night-time festival of light installations! However, they don't explicitly describe the artworks themselves, which highlights a drawback of some label detection techniques.", "Generating labels for images can be extremely useful in a variety of other applications such as training machine learning models or building recommendations systems, but for this essay, they weren\u2019t that useful.", "Admittedly, I did not use the vision API to its fullest extent \u2014 this great article by Sara Robinson highlight\u2019s the many great features of the API \u2014 this is probably because it costs to call the API!", "Instead of using labels to understand the images, we could program the computer to learn visual similarities between the images. A technique called feature extraction and reverse image search does exactly this.", "Using a Keras VGG16 neural network model running on a TensorFlow backend, I first extracted a feature for each image in the dataset. A feature is a 4096-element array of numbers for each image. Our expectations are that \u201cthe feature forms a very good representation of the image such that similar images will have a similar feature\u201d (Gene Kogan, 2018).", "The feature\u2019s dimensions were then reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) to create an embedding, and then, the distance \u2014 cosine distance \u2014 of one image\u2019s PCA embedding to another was computed. I was finally able to send the computer a random query image and it selected and return five other images in the dataset that had a similar feature vector.", "This technique can be really helpful when trying to find similar images from an album of say 1 million images!", "Now that we have an embedding for each image in a vector space, we can use a popular machine learning visualization algorithm called t-SNE to cluster and then visualize that vector space in 2-dimensions.", "\u201cThe aim of tSNE is to cluster small \u201cneighbourhoods\u201d of similar data points while also reducing the overall dimensionality of the data so it is more easily visualized\u201d (Google AI Blog, 2018)", "Below we see clusters forming based on visual similarity.", "In the image below, I highlight three artworks \u2014 Harmonic Portal by Chris Plant on St James\u2019s Church, Waterlicht by Daan Roosegarde in Granary Square, and The Light of the Spirit by Patrice Warrener on Westminster Abbey\u2014 and their cluster profiles.", "So there you have it! I\u2019ve only really dipped my toe into the wonderful world of computer vision. There\u2019s is still so much that I need to learn but this was a great first step for me.", "My findings showed it\u2019s possible to use machine learning and computer vision techniques to understand and contextualise images about the Lumiere London 2018 light festival.", "One obvious next step would be for me to count how many art installations appeared within the data set to measure \u201cpopularity\u201d. I\u2019m going to continue playing around with this dataset.", "This is the end of my blog series on Lumiere London 2018! This series has been part of a longer discussion I am having about using data science to understand and measure the impact of culture in cities.", "Next year, I\u2019ll be moving on new projects where I\u2019ll mainly be working with JavaScript.
