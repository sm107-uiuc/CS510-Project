There are a couple of explanations floating around. First, for obvious reasons, deaths are a lagging indicator. Spikes in deaths usually follow spikes in cases by approximately one month.", "However, we might want to consider that we\u2019re viewing these numbers wrong in the first place. The US is a large country, and what\u2019s happening in Wyoming has very little connection to what\u2019s happening in Austin, Texas. We\u2019re looking at numbers for the country as a whole when, to get an accurate picture, we need to drill down into individual states, regions, or cities, to get a better picture of what\u2019s going on in different communities. Unfortunately, this data tells a different story.", "Simpson\u2019s Paradox refers to a phenomenon in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.", "To illustrate, I created some simulated data in which there are two groups, which both exhibit a positive correlation between X and Y (there is randomness introduced, but in both cases Y increases by 4 units for every one-unit increase in X).", "With each of the groups considered separately, the line of best fit is clearly sloped upwards for both groups. However, when you pool the groups together, the parameter estimate becomes negative.", "A famous real-world example is the Berkeley gender bias study. In a 1975 article for Science, researchers observed a large disparity between admittance rates for men and women in graduate school admission at the University of Berkeley.", "Taken at face value, this could signal possible gender discrimination by the University. However, when the researchers dug deeper into the numbers across 85 different departments, they found a different story.", "Within specific departments, the researchers only found a few that were substantially more likely to admit men than women (and slightly more that did the opposite). However, much more significant trend was that women were more likely to apply to the most selective departments. As selective-department-applicants made up a larger percentage of women than men, they appeared to have a large disparity in acceptance rates, even though individual departments were not found to be favoring men over women.", "If you look at the national trends for the United States, the downward trend in deaths is evident, even amidst a recent increase in cases over the past month.", "However, there are certainly states where the data does not conform to this trend. In Arizona, for example, you have a surge of cases that started in early June, and a definite increase in deaths in late June and July.", "In Florida, deaths remained steady from April through June (while the nation, broadly, was declining) and just recently had their worst 2 days of the pandemic on July 9th and 10th.", "Similarly, Texas started to experience an increase in cases in June and is likely now starting to see an increase in deaths as well.", "If there\u2019s a steady or upward trend in multiple states, why do we still see steadily declining deaths nationally?", "Remember the Berkeley gender bias example? Women were admitted as frequently or more frequently to the majority of programs. However, a far larger number of female applicants applied to most selective programs, causing their numbers to look worse when pooled together.", "Consider New York. While it was one of the hardest-hit cities in the first wave of deaths, it also happens to be one of the country\u2019s most populous cities.", "Deaths per day in New York State (mostly in New York City) plateaued at around 800 for several weeks back in April but now average just over 10 per day.", "New York should certainly be applauded for their efforts in getting their outbreak under control. However, when viewing our national data, we should keep in mind that the country\u2019s most populous city experienced a decrease of around 800 deaths daily. While there are, unfortunately, most definitely spikes in COVID deaths in recent weeks, none of the 3 states mentioned had over 150 deaths in a single day. The 800-point decrease by New York, and other states that were harder-hit in April, are enough to dwarf any spikes we are starting to see in smaller states.", "When analyzing COVID data, or any data where large disparities exist between groups, beware of improper pooling. While I would love to believe the narratives implied by declining deaths nationwide, a second look at individual states shows us that that may be too optimistic.", "Your home for data science.
