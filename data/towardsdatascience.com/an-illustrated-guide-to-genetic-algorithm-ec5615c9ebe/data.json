It would be less informative if we only know the information from the outside. So in this post, I will go into a little more detail into one of the methods that exist in the AI \u200b\u200bfield.", "On this occasion, I will discuss an algorithm that is included in the AI \u200b\u200bfield, namely Genetic Algorithms. The genetic algorithm is a part of Evolutionary Computation (EC) which is inspired by the process of evolution and natural selection of living things.", "Genetic algorithms are generally used to overcome optimization and search problems. This algorithm is a general algorithm so that it can be easily implemented in various problems and can provide better results for each iteration of the search solution. Genetic algorithms can find the best solutions from candidate sets that are broad and have many optimum points and also the results tend to go to the global optimum compared to similar methods such as hill-climbing, depth-first search, etc.", "Genetic algorithms can be used to solve a number of cases due to the following advantages.", "Before we go any further, we must know first about the terms that are commonly used in Genetic Algorithms.", "In addition, there are also other terms that are often used in this algorithm.", "For more details and examples of its use, I will explain in the next section.", "After we learned about the advantages and terms in the Genetic Algorithm, now we will describe the stages carried out by the genetic algorithm to produce a solution.", "Here, I will explain these stages in general terms. For specific cases, maybe I\u2019ll explain in the next article. In general, genetic algorithms consist of the following steps.", "The initial stage in genetic algorithms is to initialize populations. At this stage, we must determine the population and length of the chromosomes to be used. For determining the number of the population itself there is no provision for the amount. The greater the number of population will produce more variety of solutions, thus increasing the possibility of achieving the best solution.", "The determination of the length of the chromosome is usually adjusted to the case being handled. For example, if in the case of the maximization of the function f(x,y) = 5 * x \u2014 10 * y, then the length of the chromosome is two because there are two variables namely x and y which we will look for. Another example is if the case is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) then the length of the chromosome is adjusted to the number of places to be visited.", "In addition, we also have to determine the representation of the chromosomes to be used. There are some commonly used representations such as binary, integer, float, and permutation representations. The determination of representation is adjusted to the case to be resolved.", "We also have to determine when this genetic algorithm process stops. There are 2 commonly used methods, the first is to determine the threshold on the fitness value, the second is to determine the number of generations.", "In addition, we must also determine the value of the crossover probability and the mutation probability. For this reason, it will be explained further along with the process.", "After we initialize the population, the next step is to calculate the fitness value for each chromosome. Fitness functions can vary, depending on the problem to be solved. For example, if we want to find the maximal value of the function f(x,y) = 5 * x \u2014 10 * y, then the way to calculate it is to include the x and y values \u200b\u200bin the function.", "After all fitness values \u200b\u200bare obtained, then parents are chosen. Determine the number of parent pairs you want to choose then make the selection in the following way. There are several ways to choose parent chromosomes.", "After selecting parents, the next step we will do is to do a crossover. Crossover is a process for producing new chromosomes. Crossover is done between two chromosomes, and the result of the crossover is two chromosomes.", "There are two types of approaches for determining new chromosomes, namely generational and steady-state.", "If you still remember, during the initialization process we must determine the probability of the crossover. Here is the function of the probability. The probability is used to determine whether a crossover occurs or not. In general, the crossover probability used is 0.8, but you are free to determine the probability because there is no certainty of the best probability.", "We must generate random values \u200b\u200bfrom 0 to 1, if the random value is smaller or equal to probabilities then a crossover is performed. The types of crossovers that can be done are as follows.", "All the cut points are obtained randomly.", "Almost the same as a crossover, mutations are not always done due to the probability of mutations. The probability of mutation common being used is 0.1. As with crossover probabilities, there are no definite provisions regarding the value of mutation probabilities.", "In the process, mutations change the phenotype of genes (change the value of genes). mutations can be done with one point or can also be with many points, can also be swapped points.", "Next is to get another population for the next iteration. Some chromosomes that are not important will be discarded and replaced with new chromosomes that have gone through a process of crossover and mutation.", "In the application of genetic algorithms, it is better to use the principle of elitism, which always stores the best chromosomes during the process so that there will always be chromosomes with the highest fitness. If a newer chromosome combination appears better, then one chromosome stored previously is exchanged with the new chromosome.", "After determining the new population, the next process is to calculate the fitness value of the new population. This will continue to be repeated until the termination conditions are met. As explained earlier, the termination condition that is commonly used is to use a threshold fitness value or determine the maximum number of generations.", "If the process has stopped, then the solution of this genetic algorithm is the chromosome with the greatest fitness value.", "Your home for data science.
