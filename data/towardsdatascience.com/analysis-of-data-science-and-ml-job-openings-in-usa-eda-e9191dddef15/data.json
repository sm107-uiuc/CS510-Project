Unfortunately, the data explored in this article is based upon August 2018. But I think the companies which hire people for specific roles do not change significantly with time. To help job hunters, I decided to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on this dataset. The dataset can be accessed from here.", "In this article, I have analyzed the number of job openings for major positions (Data Scientists, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, etc) with respect to each state, company, and skills required. Further, I have separated the dataset based upon four major roles and analyzed the number of positions available for these specific jobs in each state. Also, based upon the job description for these jobs, I have analyzed which programming languages should be most focussed on for specific roles.", "First, we will read the dataset and see how it looks. After looking closely into the dataset it has very few Nan values for columns \u201cpositon, company, description\u201d just 11, so these rows can just be removed. For the reviews column, it has a very significant amount of missing reviews which are mostly for startup companies. This means that these companies have just been newly established hence it is reasonable to replace these missing values with 0.", "Also for the location column, I have extracted a new column representing states of the US. After cleaning the dataset and following the steps given below we arrive at this data.", "In this section, I have filtered out the companies having the maximum number of job openings as per the data of August 2018 with respect to each state of the USA.", "We can see that Washington has the most number of job opening offered by companies like Amazon and Microsoft. Whereas for Google the most number of job openings are in Mountain View. Google also has job openings in other states as well but in this plot, I have shown the data with the maximum number of openings for a particular company.", "In this section, we can see that the maximum number of job openings is for the position of data scientists which accounts for 60% of the total positions.", "Further, if we separate these job openings for these positions with respect to different states of the USA, we can see that New York has the most number of openings for Data Scientists and Analyst jobs. Note: Here I have only shown jobs with the maximum number of vacancies (top 20)", "In the next section, we will divide the jobs into four categories- Data Scientists, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, and we will analyze them individually based upon the company, location, and skills required.", "In this section we will first filter out all the jobs related to data scientists as follows:", "We can infer that New York and San Franciso have the highest number of openings for data scientists. Next, we will plot the word cloud for the description of jobs posted for data scientists and further assess the skills required of these jobs mainly the programming languages required.", "First, we will create a function that will merge all the words of these descriptions into one list. Then this list will be used for making the word cloud plot", "We can see that machine learning is one of the most required skills for data science position. Now we will find the kind of programming languages required by most of the job postings as follows:", "We can see that almost 90% of the job openings have listed python and ML as the most predominant skills followed by SQL which is in 70% of the job postings.", "In this section we will first filter out all the jobs related to machine learning engineers as follows:", "We can see that most of the ML engineer jobs are in San Franciso and Boston followed by New York and Seattle, In contrast to data science jobs which were majorly in New York.", "We can see the difference most of the ML engineer jobs require skills like-Computer Science, Ml, AI, algorithm, and deep learning. This is where a data scientist differs from a machine learning engineer.", "In terms of skills required ML and python are the most predominant skills. We do not need any SQL for ML Engineer positions, but a deeper knowledge of ML is require since it is present in all the job postings.", "In this section, we will first filter out all the jobs related to data engineering positions as follows:", "We can see that most of the data engineering jobs lie both in New York and San Franciso followed by few in Boston.", "For the job postings for data engineers, we can see that most frequent words are big data, data, development, experience, etc. This signifies that we do not need any machine learning knowledge for data engineering jobs.", "For Data Engineering jobs we can infer that Python, SQL, and Java are the most predominant programming languages required. A little knowledge of ML is sufficient for these jobs.", "In this section, we will filter out the job postings related to data analyst positions as follows:", "We can infer that most of the data analyst jobs are being offered in New York and Cambridge. This count is pretty small due to the lack of data availability, but still, this gives a basic idea for job postings in the month of August 2018.", "We can see that the most frequent keywords are- team, SQL, experience, skill, business. Hence we can conclude that data analyst jobs do not require much of programming and machine learning skills rather they focus more on team management and business skills.", "For Data analyst positions we can hence conclude that the most predominant language required is SQL followed by python. Knowledge of ML is not a major requirement.", "We can conclude that most of the job openings in the USA are for the position of data scientists and they are mostly in New York and San Franciso. Among the top skills, python and machine learning knowledge are the most important requirement for data scientists and machine learning engineers. On the other hand, SQL is the most required programming language for data engineer and data analyst positions.", "If you like my work and want to support me:", "1-The BEST way to support me is by following me on Medium.", "Your home for data science.
