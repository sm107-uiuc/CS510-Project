And we commonly find if using CTRL + F. The proverbial Google-fu, the art of effectively searching for information on google is a valuable skill in a 21st-century workplace. All of humanity\u2019s knowledge is available to us, it is a matter of asking the right question, and knowing how to skim through results to find the relevant answer.", "Our brains perform a semantic search, where we review the results and find sentences that are similar to our search query. This is especially true in finance and legal professions as documents get lengthy and we have to resort to searching many keywords to find the right sentence or a passage. To this day, the cumulative human effort spent on discovery is staggering.", "Machine learning has been trying to solve this problem of semantic search since the dawn of NLP. A whole area of study -Semantic Search has emerged. And recently thanks to advancements in Deep Learning computers are able to accurately surface relevant information to us with minimal human involvement.", "Natural Language Processing (NLP) field has a term for this, when a word is mentioned we call it a \u201csurface form\u201d take for example the word \u201cpresident\u201d by itself this means the head of the country. But depending on context and time it could mean Trump or Obama.", "Advancements in NLP allow us to effectively map these surface forms and capture the context in those words into something called \u201cembeddings\u201d Embeddings are commonly a vector of numbers which have certain peculiar characteristics. Two words with similar meaning would have similar vectors allowing us to compute vector similarities.", "Extending this idea, in the vector space, we should be able to compute the similarity between any two sentences. And this is what sentence embedding models achieve. These models convert any given sentences into a vector to be able to quickly compute the similarity or dissimilarity of any pair of sentences.", "The idea is not new, The paper that started it all \u2014 word2vec proposed representing individual words with vectors back in 2013. However, we came a long way since then with BERT and other Transformer-based models which allow us to capture the context of those words much more effectively.", "Here how we stack up on recent embedding models compared to word2vec or GloVe of the past.", "These modified and fine-tuned BERT NLP models are quite good at identifying similar sentences, much better than older predecessors. Let's take a look at what this means in a practical sense.", "I have several article headlines from April 2020, And I wish to find the most similar sentences to a set of search terms.", "Here are my search terms \u2014", "And the article headlines I have are the following \u2014", "After running the similarity of each query to each embedding, here are the top 5 similar sentences for each of my search terms:", "You can see how uncannily accurate the model is able to pick out the most similar sentences.", "The code I used can be found below \u2014", "The example above is simple, but illustrates an important point of semantic search. It would take a human couple of minutes to find the most-similar sentences. It gives us the ability to find specific information in a text without human involvement, this means we can search phrases we care about in thousands of documents at computer speed.", "This technology is already being leveraged to find similar sentences between two documents. Or a key piece of information in a quarterly earnings report. With this semantic search, for example, we can easily find daily active users for all social companies like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and others. Even though they define and call the metic differently \u2014 Daily Active Users (DAU) or Monthly Active Users (MAU) or Monetizable Active Users (mMAU). Semantic search powered by BERT can find that all these surface forms mean the same thing semantically \u2014 a measure of performance and it\u2019s able to pluck the sentence of interest for us from the reports.", "It is not a far fetch idea that hedge funds are leveraging semantic search to parse through and surface metrics within Quarterly reports (10-Q/10-K) and have them available as a quantitative trade signal in an instant once they are published.", "The experiment above shows how effective semantic search has gotten in the last year.", "Another major way one can use these vector embeddings of sentences is for clustering. We can quickly cluster sentences in a single document or multiple documents into similar groups.", "Using the above code one can take advantage of a simple k-means from sklearn\u2014", "And again, results are spot-on for a machine. Here is a couple of clusters \u2014", "Interestingly, ElasticSeach now has a dense vector field and others in the industry operationalizing the ability to quickly compare two vectors such as Facebook\u2019s faiss. This technology is cutting-edge but is quite operational and can be rolled out in a matter of weeks. Cutting edge AI is at the fingertips of anyone knowing what to look for.", "If you are interested to learn more feel free to reach out, I am always available for an e-coffee.
