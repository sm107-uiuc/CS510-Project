For some groups, this could represent many years\u2019 worth of song-writing and refinement. It sounds new and fresh, and it tends to come without the weight of expectation.", "A band\u2019s second album (the so-called sophomore record) is then produced with the energy and confidence that comes from the success of the first. And even a group\u2019s sound hasn\u2019t moved on that much from their debut, it\u2019s unlikely that people will have tired of it after just one release, if it was good in the first place.", "So, if bands are able to knock out decent debuts and a sophomores, what could make album number three so tough? For starters, the third album is likely to come four or five years after the first \u2014 prevailing musical trends will have shifted. Bands generally need to evolve beyond the comfort zones they may have developed, and this can find out songwriters who aren\u2019t quite up to scratch.", "Moreover, a band weary from a couple of years of touring may lack the headspace to write an LP\u2019s worth of quality material, and a long time on the road together can make a group thoroughly sick of each other. Extended periods of substance abuse are still common place in rock and roll, and are less conducive to the production of good music than The Beatles would have you believe.", "The theory stands to reason, but is the \u2018Difficult Third Album\u2019 born out in the data? To find out, we will use the dataset we have seen in previous posts in this series, which is comprised of data scraped from Metacritic.", "The important datapoint that we\u2019ll think about for each album is its \u2018Metascore\u2019. This is a weighted average of an album\u2019s different critic reviews.", "Though the exact methodology that is used to create the Metascore is not public, Metacritic suggests that extra weight is given \u201cbased on [a publication\u2019s] quality and overall stature\u201d. It then normalises these scores (akin to \u201cgrading on a curve\u201d in college) to prevent scores from clumping together. At any rate, the Metascore is the best measure we have for the \u2018true\u2019 quality of any given album.", "We start with an \u2018albums\u2019 dataframe, which contains information about each release such as the artist, the album\u2019s Metascore, and the album\u2019s genre(s). There are 17,727 albums in the dataset.", "For the sake of this analysis, we focus in on artists that have only produced albums that are at least partially \u2018Rock\u2019, since the \u2018Difficult Third Album\u2019 is typically associated with this genre. We will also only consider artists that have released at least three albums. This narrows things down to 5,791 albums, by 1,324 artists.", "There are a couple of ways that we can look at this data. Firstly, let\u2019s simply take the Metascores of the different albums, grouping them based on whether the album was a band\u2019s debut, second, or third release.", "By plotting the means and kernel density estimates (KDEs) for these three groups of albums, we see that the distribution of Metascores is quite similar. Debut albums have higher Metascores on average, with second albums having very slightly higher Metascores than third albums.", "The other way we could look at the data is to think about the relative Metascore differences a band has from one album to the next. We can plot the Metascores of a bands\u2019 albums relative to their debuts, thus showing how their scores progressed over time.", "Again, we see that the mean Metascore (relative to the debut album) decreases for album three. This supports the existence of the \u2018Difficult Third Album\u2019. However, the variance is significant at each album, and there are no clear patterns as far as an average score \u2018trajectory\u2019 is concerned. Many bands avoid \u2018Difficult Third Album\u2019 syndrome entirely (those highlighted in green and amber in the above diagram).", "So we have some evidence that \u2018Third Albums\u2019 garner lower Metacritic scores than debuts or sophomores. But we clearly have a lot of noise in the data, and the differences between means are far from compelling. Eyeballing the data alone is not sufficient to make a conclusion here \u2014 we need to be more statistically rigorous.", "Monte Carlo simulations are a non-parametric statistical test, which can tell us whether two samples come from the same population (within a given degree of certainty \u2014typically 95%). In other words, they can tell us if the difference between the means of two samples is statistically significant.", "In this sense, they have a similar function to T-Tests. The advantage of Monte Carlo simulations, however, is that we can ignore some of the assumptions that must be satisfied for a T-Test to be reliable (e.g. normally distributed samples). For my money, Monte Carlo simulations are also more intuitive.", "Let\u2019s consider a very basic example.", "Suppose we have two samples, of size 4 and 3 respectively.", "We can see that Sample A\u2019s mean is 1.67 bigger than Sample B\u2019s. Thus, we might want to conclude that Sample A is drawn from a different population than Sample B \u2014 one with a larger mean.", "However, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s suppose that A and B are drawn from the same population (take this as a null hypothesis). Now, if we were to observe the same 7 datapoints, but in a different permutation (still drawing samples of sizes 4 and 3) how likely is it that we would observe a mean difference that is larger than 1.67?", "If we find that drawing samples of these sizes often creates mean differences larger than 1.67, then this difference clearly wasn\u2019t very special in the first place \u2014 we can conclude that the two original samples are not significantly different.", "Conversely, if we mostly see mean differences less than 1.67, then we can draw the opposite conclusion. Such a mean difference is unlikely, thus the two original samples are significantly different.", "We therefore look at all the different ways that we could draw samples of size 4 and 3 from the 7 datapoints that we have.", "We see that there are 3/35 instances (or 8.5%) where the mean difference is larger than 1.67. This percentage can be used in the same way as a p-value in a standard T-Test.", "In other words, if we want to say with 95% certainty that the mean of Population A is greater than that of Population B (i.e, we want to use an alpha of 0.05), then we would need this value to be less than 5%.", "Since 8.5% > 5%, we can not reject the null hypothesis that the two samples come from the same population. Sample A is not statistically different to Sample B, despite having a larger mean.", "The above example with 7 datapoints is fine for explaining the theory of permutation tests. There is, however, a snag if we want deploy the same logic in the real world.", "The number of possible permutations of two combined samples explodes as we increase the sample sizes. If we have two samples of size 140, for example, then there are more possible permutations of these 280 datapoints than there are atoms in the known universe.", "Given that we have a few thousand albums in our analysis of \u2018Difficult Third Albums\u2019, it\u2019s impossible to look at the mean-differences of each possible permutation \u2014 there is no computer on Earth that is powerful enough.", "This is what the Monte Carlo simulation method deals with. Rather than working out all possible permutations (which can number in the billions of billions of billions), a Monte Carlo simulation takes a random sample of the possible permutations, and calculates the mean difference of those instead.", "Let\u2019s create a new example with larger samples, of sizes 20 and 15.", "Suppose we combine the two samples above, and take a series of 20 and 15 sized samples (taking the difference of their means each time). There are 3,247,943,160 possible ways to do this, however we do not need to look at each of these. Remember \u2014 the Monte Carlo method will only take a sample of these permutations.", "The next question we need to answer is \u2014 how many permutations do we need to take before we can be confident in our answer?", "As we can see, the share of mean differences below 0.92 (the mean difference of the original pair of samples) starts to stabilise once our simulation looks at more than 10,000 permutations. By the time we\u2019re doing Monte Carlo simulations that look at 100,000 permutations, we can be pretty certain that our p-value will be close enough to the real thing.", "In this case, the p-value is stabilising at around 0.095. Again, this is larger than our standard alpha of 0.05, thus we can not reject the null hypothesis \u2014 Sample A and Sample B are not significantly different, despite the difference in their means.", "Let\u2019s apply this theory to the albums dataset. Firstly, let\u2019s bring in some required libraries. Pandas will allow us to interact with the albums dataframe, and Numpy will allow us to do basic operations and arithmetic quickly \u2014 useful when you\u2019re running hundreds of thousands of simulations!", "We now need to write a couple of extra functions. Firstly we need a function that can \u2018subtract\u2019 one Numpy array from another. In other words, if we have two arrays:", "We require this for the part of the Monte Carlo simulation where, having drawn an initial random selection of datapoints from the combined samples, we need a list of the other datapoints that were not selected. I have scoured Google for an inbuilt Numpy function that does this, to no avail. If it does exist, then please feel free to message me\u2026", "The second function is the one that runs the Monte Carlo simulation itself. We build in a couple of extra parameters, including the default number of simulations it should run, and whether we\u2019re testing the mean of sample A to be greater or less than the mean of sample B.", "Let\u2019s use the functions above to run some hypothesis tests.", "Firstly, let\u2019s compare the raw Metascores of third albums with those of first and second albums. Remember \u2014 for these tests, we\u2019re only using rock artists, and only considering artists that have released three or more albums.", "So it seems that third album Metascores are significantly lower than the combined Metascores of debuts and sophomores.", "However, is it possible that this is driven by relatively high scores amongst debut albums? Let\u2019s compare third albums against second albums only \u2014 we know that third albums have a slightly lower mean Metascore than second albums, however the gap did seem small.", "Indeed, the hypothesis test shows that the gap is not significant \u2014 more than 40% of random permutations of the same data produced larger mean differences. We have failed to prove that third albums are generally worse than second albums.", "What about the gap from debut to second albums? The mean difference here looked more substantial, but is it statistically significant?", "Here we can see that our p-value is very small indeed \u2014 less than one tenth of a percent of random permutations had a larger mean difference than the real thing. We can categorically reject the null hypothesis, it seems that there is a statistically significant difference between debut albums and sophomores.", "So, far from the third album being the \u2018difficult\u2019 one, it seems that bands face an even greater challenge making album number two.", "This is the latest blog in my \u2018Music By Numbers\u2019 column, which uses data to tell stories about the modern music industry.
