They invented what became known as the Toyota Manufacturing Technique.", "While its DNA was squarely rooted in the assembly line, they took the notion of lean manufacturing a few steps further by identifying the seven most common wastes that arise in the manufacturing process and using that as a legend to streamline their process.", "It became such an effective model that years later Toyota would teach the principles to GM in an exchange where General Motors would help them acclimate to the American market.", "While competition drives the market, there can often be identified as the best way to accomplish tasks, and the best companies will learn from each other to develop their own processes.", "Success in manufacturing is evolutionary in the purest sense, predicated on the notion that the company that creates the most efficient processes for development will prosper while those that fall behind will die.", "Such appears to be the case with machine learning.", "The assembly line is built on the premise that a larger group of employees each performing repetitive tasks can achieve greater efficiency than a smaller group of employees who are multidisciplinary.", "Some tasks are inherently more complicated than others. Defects were identified by Toyota as one of the critical wastes in the car manufacturing process.", "Machine learning could help with this.", "By understanding the underlying problems that cause defects and identifying the potential risk factor for such defects, they can dramatically reduce waste and accelerate the timelines for production.", "A case study in the steel production sector further bolstered such notions.", "It\u2019s not that machine learning algorithms will replace humans, more that the roles that humans will need to fill in the process are becoming different.", "By creating a tight nucleus consisting of data engineers, domain experts, and plant managers, this study demonstrated the dramatic effects that machine learning could have manufacturing safer products with fewer defects and less risk to the consumer.", "Forbes discovered that machine learning could actually improve defect detection rates by a whopping 90%.", "Machines have long been used to identify risks that can\u2019t be detected by eye, like those predicated on weight or shape.", "Humans are typically far better at identifying colors, cracks, shine, and other issues that could indicate a quality control issue.
