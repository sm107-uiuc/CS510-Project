Some recent notable examples include MIT\u2019s former Media Lab Director Joichi Ito\u2019s manifesto of sorts, Resisting Reduction, which examines the ethical issues inherent in social applications of AI and ML.", "Similarly, computer scientist Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru (also of MIT) published Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification, which investigated the differences in accuracy in facial recognition systems for \u201cintersectional\u201d groups, such as black females.", "These are great examples of how having a plurality of voices can contribute to better, fairer uses of AI, and a better functioning democracy to boot. John Dewey would have clicked the like button on that.", "But I still feel like there\u2019s a gap in the general academic and popular discussion on ethical AI/ML, and in particular the ethics of data science. Too often in this discussion, the focus is on the technology instead of the people building, maintaining, and using it. We need to examine the role of the data scientist in society and the moral duties deriving from this role, especially in a multinational corporate environment, where physical borders do not apply, but General Data Protection Regulations do.", "We need a dose of what Karwat et al. (2015) call activist engineering. I have in mind something similar: activist data science. Here\u2019s a first attempt at laying out the basic tenets of activist data science:", "Activist data scientists are both wise and humble enough to know when the tools and methods of data science cannot alone solve the problems that confront them. Activist data scientists recognize when other means, such as social or political action, are needed to solve a problem, such as \u201cbias\u201d in AI/ML. Activist data scientists understand they do not work and live alone, independent of a broader social community and political system with its own traditions and history from which various social practices derive their meaning. Activist data scientists remind themselves that they are not independently and identically-distributed data points, but rather more like fleshly-covered, situated, and conscious nodes in a complex, interconnected network of legal, social, cultural, economic, and moral beliefs and practices, themselves potentially affected by and constituted through the activity of data science itself.", "Consequently, activist data scientists take their roles and associated expectations, norms, and responsibilities within this network seriously and consciously as they carry out their work. They realize that what currently \u201cis\u201d threatens to remain so unless confronted with the \u201cought\u201d of our collective moral imagination.", "If you\u2019re interested in the is-ought distinction and its role in data science, you may want to check out my other post Algorithmic Injustice and the Fact-Value Distinction. In any case, let\u2019s now move on to the main topic of this post. I will have to develop this idea of activist data science in another post.", "Surprisingly, little to no research has been done on the collective power data scientists have in our digital society and the ethical implications of such power.", "Notice how I formulated the above statement. I didn\u2019t say algorithms have power. I said data scientists have it. Data scientists are the moral agents responsible for making decisions, and we, the users of global internet platforms, are their moral patients. But what rights do we have as moral patients, and what duties, as moral agents, do data scientists have towards us? That\u2019s what we need to work out. Part of doing so will require figuring out the scope and extent of the power wielded by data scientists around the world.", "The notion of responsibility is a philosophically thorny one. First of all, we might distinguish between causal responsibility and moral responsibility. Causal responsibility implies your actions were proximate in time to some (negative) effect in question. In legal terms, we refer to this as \u201cproximate cause\u201d when determining questions of liability. Perhaps you pushed some code to a Github repo for a hiring classification algorithm that was shared with a team of other data scientists at your company, for example. Your code then contributed to gender discrimination when it was eventually deployed in production. Your pushing of that code is causally responsible for this outcome. It\u2019s a further legal determination whether your actions were, in fact, the proximate cause of this effect. Most likely they weren\u2019t.", "Moral responsibility is a different but similar matter. Moral responsibility entails blameworthiness. We may be causally responsible in the sense above, but not be blameworthy for some action. For instance, your boss held a gun to your head and told you to push that feature update, or else. Here we cannot blame you for doing this, although you are strictly speaking causally responsible (to some degree) for the harm done. As you have probably already figured out, questions of free will determine questions of blameworthiness. In practice, the distinction between causal and moral responsibility is blurry due to the social and political pressures that dictate the ascription of responsibility. In everyday language, we tend to conflate these two senses. The price we pay for doing so is moral confusion.", "Yet we are activist data scientists, and we are not afraid of vagueness or complexity. Instead of turning away from such questions, we tackle them head on and engage in debate and reflection.", "Focusing on the accountability of algorithms is a category mistake, like saying \u201cthis food tastes handsome\u201d or \u201ccomputers have feelings.\u201d Blaming an algorithm for \u201cbiased AI\u201d is like me blaming my coffee table when I stub my toe on one of its exceptionally angled and hidden legs. My coffee table didn\u2019t choose to sit where it does in my living room; I chose. In the case of applied data science, some person decided to collect these data, measure them in this way, aggregate, clean, and do dimensionality reduction on them in some way. Some person chose models XYZ to compare using cross-validation. Good training in data science involves learning how to make good data science choices. And as I\u2019ve tried to illustrate above, free choice implies (moral) responsibility.", "Even in the case of so-called \u201cautomated ML solutions,\u201d one chooses not to choose, which in itself is a choice. And usually a bad one at that. Sorry Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. If you\u2019re a data controller and you don\u2019t understand how ML works, you probably shouldn\u2019t be using it for your business. In fact, if you don\u2019t understand how it works, I can almost guarantee you that a bright, young physics grad, a copy of MS Excel, and two weeks of Youtube tutorials on vlookups and macros will get you 99% of the way there.", "To be clear, using automated ML when the input data are not personal data (as defined by GDPR), is not necessarily morally problematic. But if your business relies on the collection and processing of personal data, the burden is on you, the data controller, to explain why an automated solution is necessary. Note that the GDPR explicitly deals with this issue \u2014 it\u2019s called automated individual decision-making (or profiling) \u2014 and gives data subjects explicit rights to opt-out (see Article 22 linked above).", "We can\u2019t outsource moral responsibility to machines, since if we follow the causal chain far enough backwards, we eventually find a person making a decision somewhere. At that point, we must ask if the person could have done otherwise. If not, they are merely causally responsible. If so, they are morally blameworthy. One thing, however, is clear:", "One cannot use the excuse of a \u201cblack box\u201d to escape questions of moral accountability.", "Please see Rudin (2019): Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead. The decision to use a black box algorithm in the first place is subject to moral judgment. What kind of moral calculus could one perform that would result in one believing accuracy is more important than explainability, for example? We should instead be focusing the debate on the accountability of persons writing and deploying the algorithms, not the bits and bytes themselves.", "To this point, the under-appreciated German-American philosopher of technology Hans Jonas wrote in his 1979 book Das Prinzip Verantwortung that all heretofore-developed ethical systems need updating because they erroneously assume \u201cdie Reichweite menschlichen Handelns und daher menschlicher Verantwortung ist eng umgeschrieben.\u201d [Translation: the extent of human activity and thus human accountability can be narrowly defined].", "Jonas\u2019 point is that traditional approaches to ethics, typically based on utilitarian or deontological (agent-based) considerations, were developed under completely different societal conditions. In the information age, small local causes can have global effects, as we\u2019ve seen from the COVID-19 pandemic. Misinformation can spread remarkably fast across the world. A data scientist\u2019s work in India can affect hundreds of millions of data subjects in Europe or America.", "So, following Jonas, I think it\u2019s time we re-examined ethics. We must develop an ethics of data science that can function as an action guide in cases where, for example, classification algorithms on platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, or Google, can affect the online experiences of potentially billions of people around the world. We\u2019ve already seen the moral importance of scale in Facebook\u2019s Emotional Contagion experiment, which was published along with an Editorial Expression of Concern in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). In short, it\u2019s time to rethink ethics in the era of digital networks and surveillance capitalism.", "John Donne\u2019s 1623 poem Meditation 17 captures this sentiment quite movingly (and provided a title for one of Hemingway\u2019s greatest books):", "No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend\u2019s or of thine own were. Any man\u2019s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.", "In this short piece, I don\u2019t want to focus on obvious forms of power involving physical force or violence. As Michel Foucault points out in Discipline and Punish, in medieval Europe crimes were considered personal offenses against the power of the King. The body of the criminal was effectively property of the crown and could be drawn, quartered, hacked and splayed on the public scaffold. The King \u201cowned\u201d the body of the criminal. This is repressive power.", "That\u2019s not the kind of power data scientists possess. Most are legitimately nice, humble people, worried about making a positive impact and contribution to social justice. It\u2019s not so much an issue of bad intentions, but more an issue of incentive misalignment: it\u2019s bad for your job security to ask too many questions. Heck, even the venerable statistician RA Fisher went to his death bed defending tobacco companies against charges that smoking caused cancer:\u00b9", "\u201cUnfortunately, considerable propaganda is now being developed to convince the public that cigarette smoking is dangerous\u2026it is perhaps natural that efforts should be made to discredit evidence which suggests a different view.\u201d", "No, the kind of power data scientists have is more like an invisible power, the kind Foucault captured in his concept of discourse. It\u2019s invisible power because most ordinary users of Amazon, Google, or Facebook (in effect, no one who would ever read this blog) have no idea how algorithms work or what a data scientist even does. I can conclusively state this is true for at least my mom, and probably yours too. But just because discourse is intangible and invisible does not mean its effects are invisible, too. The effects of discourse can be very real. The flip side of this invisibility means that only those data scientists who are attuned to it can perceive it and do something about it.\u00b2", "In Foucault\u2019s analysis, power is not a property of its bearer, but instead reflects the intangible social relations between individuals or groups. For Foucault, discourse was a set of (implicit) rules laying out the norms for the classification and categorization of knowledge. In this sense, discourse defines and sets rules for assessing the relations between objects. It\u2019s the kind of power to decide and define what counts as what? Who is labeled as sane and who is labeled as mad? These social labels are important because they determine who gets sent to a psychiatric ward (the insane) and who receives capital punishment (murderers). Today these labels determine who gets which service, or which product, at which price and in which user experience configuration.", "Foucault\u2019s insight was in recognizing that part of what it means to have power is to be able to assign labels to people and objects and then, on the basis of those labels, treat them according to certain norms. Foucault pointed out that we increasingly rely on the guidance of \u201cexperts\u201d to dictate these norms and define what is normal from what is deviant. He worried that individuals \u2014 the objects of such labels and classifications \u2014 in such a society might eventually internalize such labels to, in effect, repress themselves. It is at this point, when power relations have become fully internalized, that power truly reaches its zenith. It is precisely when power is most invisible that it is most powerful. This is an observation with direct relevance to the work of data scientists.", "Hopefully you see now how this conception of power might relate to the ordinary work of the data scientist in clustering, classifying, and segmenting data subjects on the basis of their personal data. We have gone from literally expressing power through corporal punishment (repressive power) to now using the power of the body \u2014 in the form of Behavioral Big Data \u2014 to set the terms of discourse and define what is normal and is deviant and use these classifications to some economic ends (what Foucault terms \u201cproductive power\u201d or \u201cbiopower\u201d). All the while, most of the human \u201cfuel\u201d (BBD) which drives this process is blissfully ignorant of what goes on.", "Somehow French philosophers were eerily aware of how powerful technology could be as a kind of discourse, even back in the 1970s. Perhaps it was due to the decidedly French invention of Minitel, the precursor to the World Wide Web. In 1979, for example, Jean-Francois Lyotard published The Postmodern Condition in which he wrote the following:", "\u201cScientific knowledge is a kind of discourse. And it is fair to say that for the last forty years the \u2018leading\u2019 sciences and technologies have had to do with language: phonology and theories of linguistics, problems of communication and cybernetics, modern theories of algebra and informatics, computers and their languages, problems of translation and the search for areas of compatibility among computer languages, problems of information storage and data banks, telematics and the perfection of intelligent terminals, paradoxology.\u201d", "In case you\u2019re wondering, paradoxology is the study of apparent paradoxes that nevertheless have truth value. G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem is a prime example. Anyhow, Lyotard\u2019s general point here is that, unlike in the Modern industrial era, in the postmodern era, knowledge is now the \u201cprinciple force of production.\u201d I would also add here that in the postmodern era, power \u2014 in the form of discourse \u2014 is a function of the scale of global information networks.", "It doesn\u2019t require a big inferential leap to realize that the knowledge possessed by data scientists takes the form of the massive amounts of behavioral big data (BBD) that fuel the machine learning algorithms of the Big Four technology companies.", "Before going further, we should perhaps stop and clarify the major terms of our discussion. The crux of debate around power is really whether it ought to be considered as Power over or Power to. What do I mean?", "I mean whether power should be conceived as 1) something that only exists when it is physically or socially realized \u2014 power over; or 2) something that exists regardless of whether it is subjectively experienced or physically realized \u2014 power to. In other words, is it something that must actually be exercised to exist (i.e., is it performative?) or is it more like a latent capacity (i.e., existing regardless of whether it is ever experienced by someone)?", "Another complicating issue surrounding power is that our very conceptions of it may be shaped by our theoretical and political assumptions. Ironically, as Marx, Nietzsche, and others have long pointed out, the act of articulating ideas about power and power relations may itself be shaped by the power relations currently in operation in our society, as a kind of Foucauldian discourse. We may not be able to escape the linguistic and conceptual confines of discourse.", "Here is a short collection of influential definitions of power taken from sociologist Steven Luke\u2019s important book Power: A Radical View. Some definitions understand the concept as power over, while others see it more as power to. Take your pick on which seems most applicable to the kinds of power data scientists might be said to have. We need to start the debate somewhere.", "\u201c[Power] is a potentiality, not an actuality \u2014 indeed a potentiality that may never be realized.\u201d", "\u201c[Power] is something\u2026which makes or renders somebody able to do, capable of doing something. Power is capacity, potential, ability, or wherewithal.\u201d", "\u201cA has power over B to the extent he can get B to do something that B would not do otherwise.\u201d", "\u201cIf we speak of the structures or the mechanism of power, it is only insofar as we suppose that certain persons exercise power over others.\u201d", "\u201c[Power is] the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance\u2026\u201d", "\u201c[Power] corresponds to the human ability not just to act but to act in concert. Power is never the property of an individual; it belongs to a group and remains in existence only so long as the group keeps together.\u201d", "\u201c[Power] is the production of intended effects.\u201d", "I will continue this post in a second installment. In that post, I will examine some of the definitions above and look at a specific formulation of power designed to capture the role of the modern data scientist.
