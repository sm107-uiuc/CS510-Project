Unsure of whether or not I really wanted to spend my time designing some years-long Gantt charts I decided to take a risk and get into Digital Marketing. Why Digital Marketing? Because when I realized that Google AdWords (I know, Google Ads now) consisted of staring at wide tables of statistics all day long and getting paid for it, I fell in love (Weird, I know. To each their own!).", "But after five years of Digital Marketing I realized this wasn\u2019t for me. This wasn\u2019t the thing that was going to make me giddy about going to work. This isn\u2019t the subject I can keep harping on about to people who may or may not have asked for it.", "So I decided to take a break and start a Data Science MOOC to see if it\u2019s as interesting as I thought it would be. And, spoiler alert, it is. So I decide to kick it up a notch and get certified in the Data Science Starter Program at the oldest engineering school in France.", "\u201cOk. Cool. So now you\u2019re a Data scientist, Lai. What was the point of your story?\u201dNot quite, you skeptical reader. Even with my certification in the bag, I decided to continue with my career by working as a Data Analyst at a consulting agency. It\u2019s somewhere between my Digital Marketing past and my Data Science future. It makes sense. It\u2019s a steady path. The certification gave me a steady basic understanding of Data Science projects and Python programming so I could go like this with my sales engineer: \u201cSo, Clara, I have a 2-to-4-year plan. I\u2019ll keep learning Python online while gaining knowledge in data projects by being a Data Analyst, and when I feel secure enough about my Python skills, I\u2019ll be a Data Scientist.\u201d", "Since I\u2019ve said that, I\u2019ve already made a bit of adjustment by changing 2-to-4 years to 1-to-2 years. But still, Dan Becker came around and crushed that plan with all the benevolence in the world.", "\u201cOn the spectrum, there are two extremes: Short term Sal and Long term Lee\u201d", "Dan explained it this way: there are two types of approaches to get into Data Science.", "On the one hand, you have short term Sal who gets just the knowledge they need to get a job, dives in, and then lands a job in Data Science, learning the rest while doing it. On the other hand, you have long term Lee who learns and learns and learns and finally gets a job as Data Scientist. That\u2019s right, reader, that\u2019s me. And that\u2019s what Dan said should be a \u201cfair\u201dcareer trajectory.", "But let\u2019s be real, Sal gets on the job sooner, gets hands-on experience quicker (meaning practical knowledge that Lee doesn\u2019t get from text books), and earns himself a network in the field, something lonely Lee didn\u2019t get from his learning hermit life. So this is what really happens:", "At this point, I\u2019m staring at the webinar, annoyed. \u201cOh Dan, how dare you crush my dream like that!\u201c but Dan has thought of us, the poor Lees watching all the Sals attending Youtube\u2019s live stream pointing their virtual finger at us and laughing in the comments section. He has one piece of advice that might be simple for some of you, but has a large impact as I think about my approach.", "\u201cFind your passion project, work on it, publish about it, tweet about it.\u201d", "\u201cOk, hold on, Dan. So far I only managed to copy a pre-prepared Titanic survival analysis, tinker with a few classification algorithms, and make a very mildly successful text mining project for my certification. Do you really think I\u2019m going to put any work of mine out there to be slaughtered by top notch data scientists?\u201d At this point, I firmly believe that Dan reads minds because he then explains that yes, first projects may not be good but it\u2019s ok, putting them out there might attract some constructive feedback that will make the next one better. And that\u2019s how a Lee becomes a Sal.", "\u201cFine, Dan, fine. Jeff, it\u2019s time to take on a Kaggle challenge.\u201d", "Thank you, Jeff, for proof reading this article and for being the Sal to my Lee.", "To this article, I would like to add Dan\u2019s answer to the original post on LinkedIn. Again, I greatly admire the spot on insight. (Fangirling much, Lai?)", "Kaggle Competitions are a good way to learn. Especially because you can try a problem, and then see how your approach compares to others (since so many people publish their work in easily accessible \u201ckernel notebooks\u201d). But I don\u2019t think they are a quick path towards a portfolio project to land you your first job (which I think is the real turning point for most people). Here\u2019s why: Competitions have a lot of skillful participants. You need to score exceptionally well for employers to take notice, and (tautologically) most people will be average or below average. Instead, I\u2019d suggest finding a topic that\u2019s interesting to you and doing some data exploration. Search for relevant data, and explore it until you can write a nice blog post about it (and ideally present it at meetups). It could be about news, a hobby of yours, whatever. Make your project visual (potentially through graphs), communicate about it clearly. Heck, maybe even brainstorm on whether you can leverage your digital marketing background to help it get more exposure. But the idea is to do something creative. This is more likely to get you noticed (that yellow scarf trick I mentioned yesterday), and more readers (or meetup attendees) will find it interesting.", "Your home for data science.
