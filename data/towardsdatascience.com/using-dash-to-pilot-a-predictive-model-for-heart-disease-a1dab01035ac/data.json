Now, assume we wish to pilot this model in a clinical setting. The first thing we need is a UI for the model so it can then be deployed. We will also assume that the tool is for screening to recommend follow-up actions and not diagnosis.", "For the purposes of illustration in this example, we will focus on the following:", "The application was developed using PyCharm and all materials can be found on my GitHub.", "Disclaimer: in a real-world setting when a new predictive model is deployed to prevent, diagnose, or treat health conditions, numerous considerations including demonstrated impact, ethics and algorithm bias, and legislative requirements (i.e., SaMD, patient privacy) apply. While these considerations are extremely important, they are beyond the scope of this article.", "In collaboration with clinical colleagues suppose the following requirements were identified:", "Based on the requirements above, a simple structure with the following sections is a reasonable starting point:", "A rough layout for our Dash app is shown in Figure 1.", "Based on the requirements and sketch from above, the first working application is shown in Figure 2. Please note the screenshots are from viewing on a wide screen (24-Inch, 16:9, 1920 x 1080). The alignment may be off on smaller or non-wide screens. I highly recommend cloning the GitHub repo and exploring the UI yourself!", "On left-hand side of the application main view we have appropriate mechanisms for a user to input the required information to generate the features for the predictive model (Figure 3). Drop-down menus are used where possible (all categorical features) otherwise values can be entered directly for numeric features.", "Typically, the data preprocessing pipeline would be embedded in the application to handle steps such as imputation or scaling. In this case due to the minimal preprocessing and the fact that in all but one case the data entered is the feature value, I opted to keep it simple.", "The right-hand side of the application summarizes the required outputs based on our predictive model (Figure 4). First, we get a predicted risk score, which is used to place the patient into one of three risk groups.", "Next SHAP values and a waterfall plot are used to convey which patient factors are contributing most to risk. The idea is that it will help the user to see which factors the model thinks is contributing to heart disease risk, and if modifiable, could be targeted for lifestyle interventions. Of course, this comes with the usual association not causation caveat. The shap package waterfall plot (by Scott Lundberg) isn\u2019t easily incorporated into a dash application so I created my own replica using the plotly waterfall plot.", "Finally, there is a (fictional) recommendation of actions based on which of the three risk groups a patient falls into. The idea is to prompt a set of sensible next steps whether it is lifestyle changes, further testing, or follow-up appointments. This could also be used as a place to reference approved guidelines for prevention/treatment of a medical condition or as a starting point for referral to appropriate services (i.e., refer to nutrition counselling). The risk grouping and corresponding actions should be developed in collaboration with clinical colleagues.", "In this section we added information about the data used, selected model, training/tuning process, performance metrics, study cohort table descriptively comparing those with and without heart disease, and SHAP-based feature importance (Figure 5).", "We could also consider including the average characteristics of the entire study cohort, external validation procedures or other studies if applicable, references to published work supporting the tool, highlight any feature interactions etc.", "As always, any pilot UI has potential for improvement, for example:", "What other improvements would you make, or what you might have done differently?", "We got the dashboard up and running for our pilot. Using Dash is a bit more towards the custom end of the deployment spectrum. This could have been deployed via other tools such as PowerBI or Qlik as possible mid-range options. We could also take a lower end approach and create an API using for example FastAPI. In a future article I will attempt to recreate the Dash application using these other UI options.", "Thanks for reading, and I hope you spend some time exploring the Dash UI from this example. As always, comments, thoughts, feedback, and discussion are very welcome!", "Your home for data science.
