The resources to learn the basics of neural networks and underlying mathematics are covered in my blog How I passed the TensorFlow Developer Certificate Exam.", "It\u2019s fairly recent when the computers were finally able to perform seemingly trivial tasks of detecting objects/organisms in images or even recognize spoken words.", "The more important question is why are these tasks so trivial to humans?The short answer is that our consciousness lacks the ability to understand this perception that utilizes specialized visual, auditory, and other sensory modules in the brain. It is so fast that the high-level features of an image, video, or audio are already amplified by the time the sensory information meets our consciousness.", "Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have emerged from the study of our brain\u2019s visual cortex and they are a type of deep learning model that is universally used in computer vision applications.", "But before we deep dive into developing CNNs, let\u2019s work on the building blocks of deep neural networks.", "This blog post covers developing deep learning models with the help of two examples:", "Let\u2019s start off with the implementation of the first very simple neural network.", "To build a basic understanding of how neural network works, I\u2019ve chosen this very simple example of house price prediction. We will be predicting house prices based on the number of bedrooms in the house.", "The data follows a simple linear function of y = mx + c .", "The data is merely organized: for every bedroom, we add a cost of $50K and c, the y-intercept(when x = 0) in the equation is 50K", "We don\u2019t need Deep learning to solve such trivial problems and this is only to get an understanding of neural networks \u2014 how they are defined, compiled, trained, and how they make predictions.", "So, the first step is to import the required libraries which are TensorFlow and NumPy here:", "Make sure you\u2019re using TensorFlow 2.x. We\u2019ve imported Keras separately so that we can use it directly.", "Next is we define the data as per the formula explained above:", "This is going to be the simplest neural network model you\u2019ll ever build. We just need one layer and only one neuron in that layer. The input shape is also [1] because we have 1-Dimensional data.", "We\u2019ll use the Keras\u2019 Sequential API which creates a sequence of connected layers:", "units \u2014 the number of neurons in the layer.", "Dense \u2014 builds a dense neural network. Though this one has only one layer.", "input_shape \u2014 tells the dimension of the incoming data to the model.", "If you\u2019ve been wondering where does math comes into play in Machine Learning, this is the section you should explore more. Although, we have amazingly defined functions that nicely encapsulate the math.", "We know that our data follows a simple mathematical function, the relationship between the bedrooms(x) and house price(y) is", "When the machine is trying to learn that function, it makes a guess\u2026maybe y=5x+10. The loss function then evaluates this guessed answer against the actual answers to measure the error in the model\u2019s predictions.", "The optimizer function tries to improve upon this loss by making another guess. With each prediction, it will try to minimize the loss. After a number of iterations(EPOCHS), it may reach a function close to y=45x+45, which is still not correct but closer to the actual function.", "We are using mean_squared_error as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent(sgd) for the optimizer.", "How to figure out appropriate loss and optimizer functions for a specific scenario is a skill that you\u2019d develop with time and practice.", "The above image shows the training results and the prediction at the end of the image for a 10 Bedroom house which should have been 550 but the model predicted it to be 579.13. Maybe training the model for a few more epochs may improve the prediction. Why don\u2019t you try that out?", "Now that we have a decent understanding of the individual components of a TensorFlow-made sequential model, it\u2019d be a lot easier for us to solve complex problems like Image classification which includes some preprocessing based on the data at hand, added Dense layers in the model, and changed input and output neurons.", "We are using the Fashion MNIST dataset which is an alternative to the famous MNIST dataset. It has 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels each but the images represent fashion items. So, each class is more diverse and the problem turns out to be significantly more challenging than MNIST.", "Let\u2019s load the dataset using Keras utility functions to fetch and load common datasets, including MNIST and Fashion MNIST, and many others.", "The load_data method splits our images into a training and testing set.", "Let\u2019s check the shape of the training set:", "We have 60,000 images in the dataset, all of which are 28x28 pixels each.", "Similarly, we have 10,000 images in the testing set.", "Let\u2019s look at what an image looks like when we print it:", "We have 28x28 intensities in a numpy 2D array. All of these intensities range from 0\u2013255.", "Since we don\u2019t have validation data here, we are going to further split our training data to create a validation set as follows:", "Also, from the dataset description, we have the 10 fashion apparels in the dataset all of which are coded from 0\u20139 and we\u2019re going to create a list of these items:", "Looking at the first 40 apparels,", "The next step is to define the model:", "Each Dense layer manages its own weight matrix, containing all the connection weights between the neurons and their inputs. It also manages a vector of bias terms (one per neuron).", "We can access the layers, their initialized weights and biases:", "Captured the model training history in the history object which we\u2019ll use to plot the loss and accuracy of the model.", "We can evaluate the model performance by passing the test instances and the actual labels.", "The model has an accuracy of 88% at this point. You can tweak your model with different parameters to see the effects.", "You can see that the history helps us compare the model training accuracy and loss with the validation accuracy and validation loss i.e. the model performance on unseen data.", "The model\u2019s performance is always slightly lower as compared to its performance on training data. If the model has a low accuracy on training and testing data then we have a case of underfitting but if the model performs accurately on training and data and not so much on the validation data then we have a case of overfitting.", "Running it on a sample of test dataset:", "We can get the names of these apparels using the list we created above:", "You can play around with these models and test other features and parameters using the Google Colab Notebook:", "Note: This is going to be a series of blogs(probably 3) where we\u2019re going to cover basic computer vision problem, classifying real world images with convolutions & pooling and using pre-trained models to solve complex problems.", "Here is the video version of this blog:", "With this channel, I am planning to roll out a couple of series covering the entire data science space.
