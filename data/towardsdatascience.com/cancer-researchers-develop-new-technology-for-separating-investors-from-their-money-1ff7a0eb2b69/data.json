But screening \u2014 testing apparently healthy people for a disease \u2014 is the Great White Whale of cancer diagnostics. I predict it will lose more venture capitalists more money over the next decade than every other Dx play combined. But that\u2019s OK. Redistributing money from wealthy but clueless investors to deserving scientists is definitely a good thing (says the scientist).", "Few investors \u2014 and far too few biologists \u2014 understand Bayesian statistics. The priors of disease prevalence show how seemingly high-performance tests fail to have much predictive value.", "False-positives are the bane of any test that screens low-prevalence diseases. In the US, about 0.5% of the population is diagnosed with cancer in any particular year.", "Now let\u2019s imagine a test for cancer that is 99% specific. That is, for every 100 patients without the disease, the test returns only one false positive. Sounds pretty good, no?", "But in fact it would be awful. If 1000 US persons were screened for cancer, we would expect 5 true positives (if the test was 100% sensitive, a very generous assumption). Those 5 patients would benefit from getting the care they need sooner. But we would also get 10 false positives \u2014 patients who are told they have cancer even though they are healthy. What happens with them?", "We know for sure that they will be frightened. And that they will undergo more tests. But we don\u2019t have any tests that are good at ruling out cancer. There will be NO POINT at which they can be told \u201cYou\u2019re OK, no need to worry\u201d with any degree of certainty. They will then have to decide whether to wait-and-see, or undergo therapy. Waiting could mean delaying treatment when it is most effective. But proceeding with therapy is no easy choice. Cancer therapy is expensive and toxic, carrying its own risks of harm \u2014 such as increased risk of cancer. Not something to which you can ethically subject healthy persons.", "That\u2019s the general problem for cancer screening. Let\u2019s see how the new hotness in cancer screening \u2014 liquid biopsy based on differential methylation of cell-free DNA \u2014 stacks up.", "Here are some of the key results:", "These are receiver-operator curves, so-called because they were devised to optimize filtering of signal from noise in radio transmissions. They are a standard way of evaluating diagnostic tests. They visualize the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity (1-false positives). A perfect test would be a right angle with the corner in the upper left (100% sensitivity and 0% false positives). A perfectly useless test would follow the diagonal.", "You\u2019ll note that these plots are for different specific cancers, not \u201ccancer\u201d. We will return to this point.", "Let\u2019s assume we want the test to have 80% sensitivity (meaning that we are willing to accept that 20% of cancers will be missed). This doesn\u2019t sound great (it\u2019s not \u2014 most FDA-approved diagnostics have \u226595% sensitivity), but it is much better than other blood DNA tests for cancer, which have 50\u201370% sensitivity (see here and here).", "Now draw a line from 0.8 on the y-axis to where it intercepts the blue ROC curve. Read down to the x-axis. That\u2019s the false-positive rate at 80% sensitivity. For lung cancer it is about 7%, for pancreatic 20%.", "At an overall cancer incidence of 0.5%, this means that there would be many false-positives for every true positive. But since these are tests for specific cancers, the false-positive:true positive ratio is far worse.", "The incidence of lung cancer diagnosis in the US population is about 0.05%/year, that of pancreatic cancer 0.01%/year. The ratios of false- to true-positives in our scenario of 80% sensitivity will thus range from 100 to 2000.", "So for every patient helped, at least a hundred would be frightened or harmed by the results from this test. I don\u2019t think anyone considers this to be remotely acceptable.", "As good Bayesians, we will express these results as a positive predictive value: the fraction of patients who test positive and actually have the disease. Put in terms of sensitivity (S), prevalence (P), and false-positive rates (FPR, equal to 1-specificity), this is:", "For our lung cancer test example we get:", "Taking the test and getting a positive result will thus increase the probability that we have the disease from 0.05% (our prior) to about 0.6%. That difference is significant but useless. No one would undergo therapy based on these results.", "And it\u2019s actually worse than this. This is not a single test, but a battery of tests, each with its own independent false-positive rate. If we tested for the 10 most prevalent cancers and had an average false-positive rate of 1% (much better than current performance), then fully 10% of patients would test positive for at least one cancer. What a disaster.", "I don\u2019t want to dump on the science here. It looks very promising, and I\u2019m sure the technology will get better. But I do want to give you an appreciation of just how very very hard this problem is. It\u2019s unlikely that any one test technology is adequate to the task. Maybe this approach, which looks at DNA methylation patterns, can be combined with the CancerSEEK test (which has much better performance) to start making screening of at-risk populations feasible.", "I hope that happens. I am sure it is not happening very soon. In the meantime, I hope that no TDS readers get suckered by the hype around liquid biopsies.", "Update Jan 6 2020: A Chinese group has published an article Jan 4 describing a similar approach with even better results for colorectal cancer detection. Their sensitivity and specificity in the validation cohort were 90% and 87%. That\u2019s impressive. In screening a high-risk group (7.1% prevalence of colorectal cancer and pre-cancerous lesions), that works out to a PPV of 35%. This number is high enough to justify intervention. But the US yearly incidence of CRC is 0.04%. A screen of the population would result in a PPV of 0.3%. Implementing this test for the general public would cause far more harm than good.", "The obvious conclusion is that tests like this have to be combined with other risk factors to be of any use. Using likelihood ratios is the best way to do that, and will be the subject of a future post.", "Your home for data science.
