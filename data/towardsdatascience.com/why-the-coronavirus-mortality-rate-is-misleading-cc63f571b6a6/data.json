Its origins can be traced back to Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is comparable to other animal-based coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. Although most cases have been confined to the Hubei Province, which Wuhan is part of, it has spread to HK, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, the US, and possibly even North Korea. Although new details about the virus\u2019s nature and its growth are still emerging, we know that it has a 2\u201314 day incubation period and the average #/transmissions by each person who has it is roughly in the range of 2\u20132.5. As of Feb 14, over 64,000 have been suspected/confirmed to be infected, with almost 1400 deaths.", "Despite the seemingly endless media coverage of the virus, many questions remain unanswered. Are there truly only 60k+ confirmed cases, or is this figure deflated? Is the number of fatalities under-reported as well? How fast is the virus spreading every day? How dangerous is it? In order for us to accurately gauge the danger it poses, it\u2019s necessary to calculate the case fatality rate (CFR). Even if the virus is spreading quickly, it is not a large threat if people don\u2019t die after contracting it.", "Currently, the case fatality rate calculations are incorrect and misleading. As of now, it is calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of infected. The figure below shows the \u201cmisleading\u201d CFR for Hubei Province since Jan 22. Based on these calculations, the case fatality rate is determined to be around 2.5% currently. However, it is incorrect because it does not take one hugely important factor into account: the lag effect.", "Consider a group of 100 people that feel sick on Jan 10, 2020. Let\u2019s track them over time. Some of them fall seriously ill over a period of a few days. Some recover, while others continue to be sick. If we could fast forward a year from now, we would know exactly the number of people that would die from this cohort. Most of the people that were sick would have recovered, and others would have died. At this point, you can calculate the death rate for this cohort to be the number of dead to the number that were initially infected. For example, we could use this method to calculate the case fatality rate of the 2002 SARS outbreak in China, since everyone who contracted SARS has either recovered or died by now. This is not true of the COVID-19 because it is still ongoing.", "In the midst of an infection, we have different cohorts at different stages. I.e, a few thousand people that just became sick yesterday would not die today; but people that die today would be from a much earlier cohort. As a result, it is completely incorrect to calculate the CFR to divide the number of dead by the number of infected. The correct way to do this would be to follow each cohort separately and determine the death rate from each. Of course, when the disease has completely stopped, both the methods would converge. The coronavirus epidemic is ongoing and has not ceased and this method will not work. In contrast, this would work with calculating the SARS case fatality rate now.", "Here is the graphical way of depicting it.", "On the x-axis is the number of days after the members of the cohort have been infected (they were all infected on the same day) On the y-axis is the cumulative death rate (number of deaths/number infected) within the cohort.", "Reports say it takes anywhere between 2\u201314 days to even show symptoms and possibly an additional few weeks or so before you could potentially die. Therefore, the number of deaths will likely be zero for the first few days regardless of the nature of the cohort members.", "For the sake of illustration, we will look at two different groups. Say one group is 25-year-old men from Wuhan (modeled by a CFR of 2 % and reaching its peak in 14 days), and another represents a cohort of 80-year old men (modeled by a CFR of 5% reaching a peak in 7 days). We can assume the latter will rise faster, reach a greater height, and plateau sooner than the former. This means that more 80-year olds will die, and more quickly, due to their generally lower immunity and weaker overall health. The same can be said for people with health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, as well as chronic smokers. As well as these factors (the very old and very young have demonstrated more vulnerability), the cohort curves will vary with country, wealth, etc.", "This idea sounds quite simple in theory: find the number of infected each day and track them at the cohort level and we would have the case fatality rate. In practice, this is a bit difficult. Here are some challenges.", "We need to have much more granular data on the cohort level that can help us model the CFR. Unfortunately, that data does not appear to be available.", "Triangle charts are the right way to calculate the death rate by cohort. We would need to construct these triangle charts for groups that are as homogeneous as possible to ensure that certain members do not skew the death rates. Age, high-risk medical groups, and countries are the right granular segments to look at. Using these, we can most accurately gauge the case fatality rate for each group.", "Below is an example triangle chart for the death rate.", "Here, the uppermost rows depict older cohorts, and newer cohorts are represented by the lower rows. Each column represents an additional day after they were infected, with the number in the box representing the cumulative number of deaths within the cohort. Scanning the boxes diagonally from right to left gives the numbers for each cohort on the same day.", "In order to model the number of deaths, two assumptions are made.", "1) There is a 5% case fatality rate among all cohorts.", "2) If people died, they died within 7 days after contracting the virus. Additionally, the data is only from the Hubei Province, where Wuhan is situated.", "We can immediately see the cool-to-warm gradient between the topmost and bottom-most rows. This means that the older cohorts were smaller in size to start with and the newer cohorts are larger, indicating the spread of the COVID-19. (see the above figure)", "Although the information can paint a general picture of what\u2019s happening, shedding light on the basic nature of COVID-19\u2019s spread, the model has several shortfalls. Firstly, not all information is available, hence the entire rows without data. There may be deaths not accounted for, especially in Wuhan, the epicenter. We are likely vastly undercounting the number of infected. We also do not understand how long it takes for people to die once infected. We do not know the mix of old and young; healthy and sick; etc. Despite its deficiencies, the model is still illustrative.", "Okay, here is some preliminary analysis that shows that the data is seriously incorrect", "Next, we use the model \u2014 there is a case fatality rate of 5% and the number of days until death is 7\u2014 to compare the predicted number of death versus actual in Hubei province.", "This figure compares the model of the number of cumulative deaths with the assumed case fatality rate and time to mortality to the numbers reported by Beijing. Our model, with the current parameters, is strikingly close. However, given the huge amount of factors other than time to mortality and the case fatality rate, we can never be completely sure what the real numbers are. Here are some key insights.", "It should be noted that there are multiple ways to get to the same number of deaths by altering some of these parameters. Regardless, it is very likely that the data is seriously incorrect (many more are infected) or we have a serious crisis (the CFR is > 5%).", "Here is an update that shows the range of possibilities of the case fatality rate. Another update that shows that the warm weather will not curb the growth. One more update where I reveal how many deaths the US could experience", "Note from the editors: towardsdatascience.com is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
