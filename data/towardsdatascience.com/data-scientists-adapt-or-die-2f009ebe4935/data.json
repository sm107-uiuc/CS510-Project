As domains mature, tools and automation weed out those who aren\u2019t really qualified or aren\u2019t doing high value work.

The remaining time is spent trying out features and testing models to squeeze out a few % pt\u2019s of accuracy. It simply takes a lot of time \u2014 and while experience, intuition and luck allow a scientist to narrow down the scenarios, sometimes the best solution requires trying many extra atypical (almost random) scenarios. One solution is automation and utilizing brute-force compute cycles using the new breed of tools named AutoML.", "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is software that automates of the repetitive work for you in an organized way. (Get a demo of H2O or DataRobot and see for yourself). Feed it the data, set the goal, and take a nap while it grinds thru iterations of features, models, and parameters. While it lacks domain expertise and precision, it makes up for it with brute force and superb bookkeeping/reporting (with some logic and heuristics of course) .", "When and if it replaces Scientists was polled on KDNuggets 5yrs ago\u200a\u2014\u200arecent thinking is that time for some of us is\u00a0very\u00a0soon.", "Rachel Thomas of Fast.AI: \u201cThere are frequent media headlines about both the scarcity of machine learning talent and about the promises of companies claiming their products automate machine learning and eliminate the need for ML expertise altogether.\u201d [7]", "Dr. Thomas seems to feel AutoML is misconstrued and a fair amount of hype. She makes compelling points to help us understand the full ML cycle and what AutoML is and what it isn\u2019t.

The number of scientists may drop per project as you add AutoML to your team (bots like TARS, R2D2 or HAL), but most research still suggest that aggregate demand for humans (scientists) will continue to increase for the next 5yrs+ at least.", "The bulk of online articles [9] make it clear Data Scientists are not dead after all. But most agree AutoML has come of age and is changing the makeup of projects and staffing even today. We all need to evolve, and as a Data Scientist you need to learn to leverage AutoML and related tech improvement or risk falling behind.", "Automation is a good thing \u2014 we can focus on higher value work and eliminate boring and repetitive tasks (albeit the the boring, repetitive work paid pretty well \u2026). I think we know it makes sense, why pay us when they can pay a cheaper robot?
