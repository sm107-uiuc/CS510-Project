Well, here are a few more of his tweets\u2026", "Trump\u2019s tweets are easily iconic, (and renown for their capacity to arouse confusion). If you saw any of those tweets above, you\u2019d probably be able to guess Trump as the author. In other words, they are also easily identifiable.", "In fact, it used to be even easier to identify a tweet as Trump's\u2026", "Before March 2018 Trump used an Andriod phone to tweet, and in the Twitter API, you can check the source of tweets. This made it clear which words are from Trump and from the White House staff. After Trump switched to an iPhone this is no longer the case, so let\u2019s figure out a new way to differentiate the two!", "In order to recognize Trump\u2019s tweets, we\u2019ll be using neural networks. Neural networks can model complex relationships between variables and predict possible outcomes, meaning it\u2019s the perfect tool for this job!", "I started by mining a lot of data, collecting Trump\u2019s tweets dating back to 2015. This happens to be a collection of Tweets from three sources, Andriod, his new iPhone, and Twitter Web Client. With this huge set of data, I split the data into a training set (to train the neural network), and a testing set (to check the accuracy of the neural network).", "I was able to mine data from twitter by using the access token keys.", "I formatted them as a pandas DataFrame (kind of like a spreadsheet) and joined the mined data from 2016 to 2018 together.", "Here are the last few lines of the dataset\u2026", "Neural networks can\u2019t process text directly, so I used a TFIDF Vectorizer from the Scikit Learn model to fit the text data. What this does essentially changes the text data into a numerical pattern that we can feed the neural network. Imagine a huge spreadsheet with a column for each word. Values are generated for each word. These values could be the frequency or even it\u2019s importance/significance to the overall context.", "Here\u2019s the portion of the code that changes the data from text format to a numeric array.", "So here\u2019s how it works! We\u2019re using neural networks to model a complex relationship, in this case between the tweets (input) and who sent them (output). Neural networks are composed of three main parts:", "By the way, if you haven\u2019t read it yet, read my introduction to neural networks here to get you up to speed!", "We feed the neural network the tweet data with labels indicating whether it was from Trump or his staff into the algorithm, this is the input data. The model calculates a prediction, compares it to the correct label, and makes adjustments to its weights and biases.", "It calculates a prediction based on the model framework, meaning at first we generate random weights and biases for each node to arrive at a prediction.", "After the nodes calculate a weighted sum of its input the activation function decides whether or not the information is \u201cfired\u201d or passed on. One simple activation function is the step function. The step function calculates if the weighted sum is above a certain value, if so then it\u2019s considered activated, otherwise it\u2019s not.", "The softmax activation function does a similar thing, except it calculates probabilities. The outputs of softmax will always be from 0 to 1 and will add up to 1. This of it as a confidence score, for example, we can be 60% confident that the tweet is from Trump.", "After generating a probability the model calculates an error value (how far we are from the correct label). Using this error value we backtrack and edit all of the weights and biases accordingly to get closer to the correct answer. This process is called back-propagation and it\u2019s key to reducing errors and increasing our accuracy score.", "Here\u2019s the general model, we\u2019ll be using this to generate multiple models with different frameworks to find which architecture works best.", "We want to train the model until it\u2019s predictions are close to the actual label. We also want to test its accuracy for tweets it\u2019s never encountered before, this is where the testing dataset comes in handy.", "One of the hardest parts of this project was finding the right neural network. Changes in the number of nodes and layers can change the final accuracy of the model. So I tested a variety of different model architectures using different portions of the training data.", "In the end, I calculated which models had the highest score and utilized that model (this time it was 4 hidden layers each with 1000 nodes). Since this model was only trained with a portion of the training data before. I retrain this model with the whole training data set and evaluated its performance on the training data (which was a 93% accuracy rate).", "Here comes the fun part! Testing time! Now we feed the testing data into the algorithm without a label and ask the model to give us a prediction. Overall, it was able to differentiate between Trump and White House staff tweets with a high accuracy score of 80%.", "Turns out, after mining and cleaning Hillary\u2019s tweets I was able to do just that. After testing the model, I found that I was able to predict Hillary\u2019s tweets with 87% accuracy and Trump\u2019s with 60% accuracy.", "Here\u2019s the tweet my algorithm thought to have the highest probability to be Hillary:", "\u201cWe urge voters to dump Trump and choose the clearly qualified candidate in this race: Hillary Clinton\u201d \u2014 @DenverPost https://t.co/bpbgC5VhYV", "Here\u2019s the tweet my algorithm thought to have the highest probability to be Trump:", "\u2026..nice call with with the new President of Ukraine, it could not have been better or more honorable, and the Fake News Media and Democrats, working as a team, have fraudulently made it look bad. It wasn\u2019t bad, it was very legal and very good. A continuing Witch Hunt!", "Out of curiosity, I looked into the most common n-grams of Trump compared to Hillary\u2019s. N-grams are continuous sequences of a certain number of words (2\u20135 in this case) in a piece of text.", "Here are Trump\u2019s most common n-grams:", "Here are Hillary\u2019s most common n-grams:", "There are infinite possibilities and ways neural networks can be applied to data analysis. Neural networks are non-linear data modeling tools, meaning they can model complex relationships between various variables.", "Most applications fall into three categories:", "Here are a few examples of possible applications of neural networks:", "If this much data can be gained from just tweets, think of how much data there is everywhere around us! The age of big data has already started, and applications and possibilities are endless. Not only can we use it for tweets, but we can apply it to speech recognition, forecasting the weather, and even provide more efficient solutions to routing problems.", "With this much data, neural networks are key to making sense of it all! We need them to make proper use of the data and extract more insights than ever!", "This was definitely a really fun project to do, and I hoped I\u2019ve inspired you to look into your own explorations with neural networks and data analysis!", "Check out my project page on my website here!", "If you want to read more articles in the future, give my account a follow!", "In the meantime, feel free to contact me at ariel.yc.liu@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.", "You can also read my monthly newsletter here!", "Or visit my personal website to see my full portfolio here!", "Your home for data science.
