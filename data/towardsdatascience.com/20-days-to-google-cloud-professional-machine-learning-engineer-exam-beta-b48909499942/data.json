Please don\u2019t add any other edits to this original besides bullet formatting, do it in your own copy if you want.", "I knew there was time to go through any material for only one pass, so focus and efficiency is crucial, then I discovered creating flashcards using PowerPoint filled with screenshots (~120) of material I have gone through is really helpful to jogging memory. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fLGQfco8DcTx-g4djL7KQYc2SY1MbT6w/view?usp=sharing", "Unfortunately, I did not complete the recommended Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud on Coursera and only went through Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals, and the first 2 courses (they covered a majority of what\u2019s necessary) of Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization. However, going through the slides of all the other recommended courses was significantly helpful to the exam (especially the 5th course in the advanced specialization). A significant amount of knowledge covered in the exam also came from Google\u2019s machine learning crash course.", "Most of the preparation tips I have are collected in the MeisterTask planner above already, so I will share my thoughts after taking the exam.", "Be able to translate the layman language in the question to machine learning terminology, such as what kind of algorithm to use to solve what real-life problems. Read the question carefully, it is not as straightforward as just looking at the label type. Some questions seemed completely business-oriented and required an understanding of business metrics and what is good for the customer.", "IAM and permissions may have been implicitly tested through the MCQ options provided, so know what GCP products have additional security features beyond the general IAM. Know what products can be used at each stage (ingest, transform, store, analyze) of a data pipeline. Read very carefully the current state of the company in question and do not choose options that repeat what has already been done by the company or what is too far ahead.Know the differences between GPU and TPU acceleration and what makes either option impossible or undesirable so the choice is immediately clear once you see the key points in the question. Learn generally about what KMS, CMEK, CSEK do, and how they are used to deal with privacy requirements.", "Be familiar with translating modelling requirements into the right feature engineering steps (hashes, bins, crosses), and hashing for repeatable train-test-split. MLCC (https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) is thorough on this. Statistical methods of feature selection should be compared and understood. Quotas and limits are implicitly tested through the options showing substitute products at a particular stage in a pipeline. Knowing common uses of DataFlow vs Cloud Functions would help.Learn how TFrecords feature in data pipelines and the general ML flow involving them, such as when to convert to them, how to train-test-split with them. Be able to identify data leakage and handle class imbalance (MLCC covers this)", "Know the spectrum of the modelling tools on GCP(BQML, SparkMLlib, AutoML, ML API, AI Platform) and their degree of no-code to transfer learning to full custom code. Modelling speed and accuracy are competing requirements. Learn how data/code moves in between GCP ML components and look out for import/export shortcuts and their formats.Know what kinds of explanations are available in AI Explanations for what types of data.", "Most of the questions were asked at a higher level than I expected, so running through Kubeflow pipelines UI with Qwiklabs, looking at the sample code to see how components connect and understanding how TFX vs Kubeflow differ is sufficient. Note how some things can be done on-prem vs GCP. Learn how to build Kubeflow pipelines fast. There is always a competing concern between no flexibility but fast copy-paste development vs full flexibility but time-consuming development from scratch. Neither is always better, depends on where the company is at in terms of skills and product, and what infrastructure, libraries they currently use or are planning to go towards, so read the question.", "Know the tools to analyze model performance during development. and continuously evaluate model performance in production. Pipeline simplification techniques are introduced in the 2nd course in the Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization.", "Some questions are really short that you can answer within 5 seconds. Some time burners exist where the options are longer than the question. Some options can be guessed correctly through careful reading of requirements and common sense. Understand what the question wants and go for the option that does things just right, not more, not less. Some options are a subset of other options. Sometimes the best answer does not fulfil 100% of the question\u2019s requirements, but the other options are even more wrong. Sometimes the closest answer suggests you do something undesirable to solve a higher priority problem, so there are elements of sacrifice. There were not many \u201ctick all that is correct\u201d questions. There are general python questions and Tensorflow debugging questions that require real hands-on experience which Qwiklabs will not offer because they can only teach how to succeed, not how to fail.", "Read the options first and form a mental decision tree of what are the decision variables to seek from the question. There seems to be very little of the \u201cpermute 2 options on 2 decision variables to make up 4 MCQ options\u201d, but mainly slightly different options, with up to 4 all correct, but just meeting the requirements at 0\u201320%, 50%, 70%, 90\u2013100% effectiveness. Some parts of the multi-part options are repeated so there is no need to choose there. Much of the question could be irrelevant once you parse the options so reading the question anymore is wasting time. Filtering out irrelevant options is an effective speed booster. If it\u2019s not obvious where the variances in the options are and you have to read the whole question, always start from the big picture of the current state of the company, what stage of the SDLC are they in. If you know the question is talking about deployment, all options regarding development can be eliminated. The options being multi-part could confuse people and make it harder, but it also means there are more opportunities for elimination, so even if you don\u2019t understand all the parts of the option, you just need to find one part that makes the whole option wrong.", "If time permits, prove not only why your selection is correct, but also why all other options are not on your first pass. If short on time, it is easier to prove options wrong than how the possibly correct one matches all requirements. I had only 24 minutes left to review 58/120 and only managed to review 20.", "Questions load page by page and there are 4 buttons on every page (back, forward, review all, submit). Do not submit until all questions are done and reviewed. The review page will show how many were answered and put an asterisk beside those you marked for review. Have a low threshold for marking review (i had 58/120), because it costs a lot of time to click the back button repeatedly and look for something you did not mark for review but later wanted to. However, if you realize in the middle you don\u2019t have 1 min to spare per review, start having a higher threshold for review because having too many asterisks at the end means you could spend time reviewing things you are pretty sure of already rather than on the ones that really need review. The \u201creview all\u201d page only shows you question numbers (with an optional asterisk) and your selection, with no question preview text at all, so unless you have great memory it\u2019s hard to know which number corresponds to which question, so you may have to go through all the asterisks.", "Jot down on first pass in the comments box below every question(not sure if this box is only a beta feature) why certain options are wrong so when coming back to review, you don\u2019t restart the question from nothing and can immediately think through only the possibly correct competing options. Another use for the comment box is to record concepts you are unsure of. There could be future questions you come across that resolve such uncertainty by providing the answer as a given in the question, such as what tools are used together, which tools call which tools. Google has a history of offering non-existent options, but if you see the same option/concept appearing in more than 1 question, it is likely possible.", "Don\u2019t click the Back button 2x in succession to prevent accidental submission, because the submit button will be loaded right under your cursor after the 1st click. The back and forward take about 3\u20135 seconds to load, where the timer stops, so you can get some extra time to think while the page loads. Don\u2019t type in CAPS using shift lest you do a Ctrl+C/X or some other combination that gets your exam locked (i got locked twice, luckily I did it onsite so a proctor was there to unlock, not sure how it works if done remotely).", "Follow the recommended courses first before going to the tutorials (search ai platform on https://cloud.google.com/docs/tutorials and you cover 95%, the rest are GCS, PubSub, Cloud Functions, Bigquery). The courses cover a majority of what\u2019s tested. Another benefit is when you know the concepts already, reading the tutorials will organize the individual tools and concepts into an entire architecture. You can then use the knowledge from tools to ask questions about how a tool performs against another in this architecture, how to stretch its limits, can it be connected to another source/sink, how does 1 tool\u2019s quotas/limits affect another tool\u2019s limits in the pipeline, where/which tools are the common bottlenecks, where is seldom a bottleneck, where are the serverless parts (2 types: can configure vs no need to configure) and which parts are not serverless.", "Opening multiple tools when doing Qwiklabs is useful, such as always keeping the VM console page on, to learn that your 1-click GKE cluster deployment is actually provisioning 3 VMs by default under the hood with certain settings, or that your \u201cOpen JupyterLab\u201d click in AI Platform notebooks has provisioned one VM of certain machine type behind the scenes, or that the startup script that was automatically run when you do some Qwiklabs has set up some git clone behind the scenes already. Keeping the GCS console open is important too since so much of GCP AI tools depend on buckets.", "Read the tutorials and documentation (overview, best practice, faq) straightaway. This is the more difficult path because there will be many unknown concepts while going through the tutorials, and they may be too in-depth, that level of knowledge covering < 10% of what\u2019s tested. However, they serve as the fastest starting point for the learner to know the unknowns.", "Know the gcloud SDKhttps://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/referenceThis is the fastest way to know what Google has and how it is named. Expand each section to see the method names and you will have an idea of what services are available without trawling through GCP console UI. This page also alerts you to doc pages you may have missed and helps solve questions that test the correct command to use.", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m too much of a newbie to go for it.\u201d", "On Day 1, I had totally no idea what 53/81 bullet points in the exam guide meant, or how to achieve those points. After studying https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course, I also realized some of the 28/81 which I thought I knew, was not what it\u2019s supposed to be.", "I don\u2019t think having a ton of ML knowledge is necessary for these reasons.", "Some arguments supporting the benefit of previous experience:", "As a final disclaimer, it is unlikely that anyone can pass this in 20 days without previous experience which helps answer the debugging questions and to react faster to evaluation metrics like (precision, recall, F1, AUC), but this article hopefully motivates people who are considering that it can be done.", "Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin if you have any more questions or like to share your experience: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanqi91/", "Your home for data science.
