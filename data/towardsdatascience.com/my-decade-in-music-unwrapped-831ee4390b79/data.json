I still remember the first album I bought, it was \u201cSpice\u201d by\u2026 yes, you\u2019re right, Spice Girls. Soon Jurassic Park\u2019s and, probably, The Flinstones\u2019 \u2014 do you remember that movie? \u2014 OST followed. I know, it\u2019s embarrassing, but, hey, I was 14. Since then, I have been listening to music almost compulsively; whenever I was doing something, music was sounding. I soon \u2014 thankfully \u2014 stopped listening to the Spice Girls though, and I can say that a taste for good music started growing on me. That didn\u2019t come as a surprise as I grew up in a music-loving family.", "Remember \u2014 because I assume you are at least as old as I am \u2014 back then the Internet was in its infancy; no Facebook, no Instagram, no MySpace yet. Instead, we had cassettes, videos, CDs, and MTV. As a proper melomaniac, I started to collect CDs at a pace the shelves in my room couldn\u2019t stand. I was a proud collector. And now I have around 300 CDs back home. You might \u2014 or not \u2014 think that that is a significant number of albums, but things could have gone worse for my mum, who is safely keeping the legacy. Thankfully for her, the Internet changed everything.", "At the beginning, I resisted my brother telling me to stop spending money on CDs while music was free on the Internet. But when Spotify came, there was nothing left for me to argue. Everything was there; literally everything \u2014 well, not Oasis and Metallica at the beginning, but nothing is perfect.", "In its first years, Spotify was completely free, and, sometime later, a Premium account was really inexpensive. For someone like me, there was not much to think. I stopped buying music, and I embraced Spotify\u2019s endless catalogue. (Then I shifted to buying books compulsively instead, but that\u2019s a different story.)", "What came with Spotify was awesome. You could have all the music you wanted a mouse-click away, in a split-second. However, I was genuinely missing something: the physical CDs, with their booklets; that feeling of coming home with a new album, taking the plastic off and playing it. It was something special. That was gone in the Internet era. Something had to replace that.", "During those early days of online listening, I came across two platforms that I am still using: LastFM and Rate Your Musi (RYM). I am sure that some of you are familiar with the former. Besides being a music database, LastFM gives you the opportunity of tracking the music you listen. This is how it works. LastFM can scrobble every single song you play in many different devices and players (e.g., your mobile phone, Spotify or, even, Youtube). This way, you can have a record of your listening history, which in my case started in 2008. Rate Your Music is a less known website. It is a music database where people rate albums; and I have rated everything I have heard in my life \u2014 every single song.", "These two services replaced what collecting CDs used to be for me. Now I could have a look at my virtual catalogue every time I wanted. It had its downsides \u2014 nothing was physical \u2014 but it also had its advantages. I was able to see which were my most listened artists \u2014 a service that LastFM offers \u2014 , or find people with similar tastes and discover new music. Over time, I have realised that a tremendous amount of information about my music habits is stored in their servers. And if I could have access to it, I could dig into it and carry out statistical analyses. Good news is that those data are (partially) available.", "We all have seen how popular Spotify\u2019s \u201cYour 2019 Wrapped\u201d has become this year. Although this is not the first time they provide an annual summary, for some reason, everybody was sharing it on Instagram this year. Sadly for a statistics lover, the listening habits analysis they offer is pretty poor \u2014 and it has barely got better since they started providing it. The same goes for LastFM, you can only see which are your most listened artists, albums, and songs in different periods (e.g., last week, last six months, etc.). Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could have all the data and conduct a customised statistical analysis? Indeed; and that\u2019s what I intent to do here.", "In what follows, I will walk you through the analysis of my music habits during the last ten years, using data obtained from LastFM and RYM. Let\u2019s get started!", "First, we need to get the data. This is pretty straightforward. For LastFM, we can use this great website that only asks your username to generate a file with your whole listening history. You can get even richer data using the API, but that would require some coding. Even easier for RYM. Go to your profile and click in \u201cExport your data\u201d at the bottom of the page. That\u2019s all. Once we have the two files, we can start the data cleaning in R.", "We want to combine the two data frames eventually, so it would be a good idea to start to rename the columns, so they are called the same. Also, we will need to create new columns (for example, with IDs for albums or artists) and remove some others. The data is pretty messy in some cases \u2014 we are dealing with all the songs I have listened to in the last ten years \u2014 so there is a great deal of NAs we want to get rid of. Here I share the code I used:", "One of the primary analyses I want to carry concerns the time of listening, be it the day of the week or the month, etc. My \u201clastfm\u201d dataset comes with a column (\u201cuct_time\u201d) specifying the date I listened to each song. However, I have done certain modifications to ease the analysis.", "Now, this is a good one. I want to have a column indicating whether I scrobble in a weekday or the weekend. Thankfully, R has its own calendar; thus, we can extrapolate that info if we make R read our dates. First, the function \u201cweekdays\u201d returns the day of the week, but we have to tell R where (and how) to read it from. We use \u201cas.Date\u201d for that, where we specify the column where R is going to read the data from and how it is formatted. In the example below, it was \u201c08 Dec 2019\u201d, so we tell R that the first value is %d (day), the second is %B, and the third is %Y (year).", "One last thing before we are ready to move on to the analysis. We need to join the two datasets (lastfm and rym). For that, we will use the function \u201cleft_join\u201d, which will allow us to add the values from the \u201crym\u201d dataset into \u201clastfm\u201d via the matching values from a certain column (we will use \u201calbum\u201d). Note: the column name has to be the same in both tables. The code is pretty easy: new_dataset = left_join(dataset1, dataset2, by=\u201dshared column\u201d). The new dataset, with the new data from \u201crym\u201d, has some very interesting info that we will use later on, as the albums\u2019 ratings or their year of release.", "Let\u2019s crack on! I will skip those things LastFM already provides, as the number of total scrobbles (plays); but, if you wonder \u2014 I know you do \u2014 I have officially listened to 142,056 songs in the last 11 years. That\u2019s a lot of music. However, LastFM is not very helpful when we want to know how is that number distributed over the years. (From now on, I will not be counting 2008 and 2009 as I barely used LastFM and that would distort the analysis.) Thus, I plotted the number of scrobbles per year.", "What we can see there is that this year I have not listened to as much music as I used to \u2014 blame my ongoing PhD for that \u2014 and that I listened to a lot of music between 2013 and 2018. On average, I scrobbled 13,987 songs per year. That roughly equals 1,400 albums or more than 60,000 minutes annually. Not bad, isn\u2019t it?. Also, you may wonder \u2014 as I did \u2014 what is the month when I listen to more music. This is how the plot looks like.", "December is clearly the king, but there are not huge differences overall. Continuing with not-very-relevant-information, the plot below also shows music is not so vital for me during the weekends.", "I am sure, at this point, you are wondering which are my favourite groups. I am afraid I have not an answer for that \u2014 nor my data does. I am not able to pick a single artist from the many I am a fan of, as some of them having very different styles and little things in common. However, this is precisely the type of situation where statistics can be helpful. What we ultimately want to know is who is my favourite artist, but that\u2019s not something easy to answer \u2014 not even for me! Thus, we can use a proxy measure (e.g., how many times I listen to an artist or an album) to try to answer the question. It will never be a definitive answer, but it is undeniably informative. The assumption here is quite clear: the more I listen to something, the more I like it, although we all know that that\u2019s not necessarily true. For instance, I listen to Jazz or Electronic music when I am reading, but I do not like it that much actually.", "My most listened artist in the last ten years is Arctic Monkeys, with 1374 scrobbles, followed very closely by Neil Young (1204). Kanye West (924), The Rolling Stones (918), and Wilco (908) complete my top-5 \u2014 pretty eclectic, isn\u2019t it? This is how the scatterplot of the scrobbles over the last decade for these five artists looks like:", "The question is: are the Arctic Monkeys my favourite band? Undoubtedly one of them. However, we still have no answer. Another way of approaching the question could be by looking at the albums\u2019 ratings of my favourite artists. Which is the band with the highest average rating?", "As soon as I dig into that, I notice that many artists have just one album with the highest rate possible (10/10). Yet, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to compare artists with only one excellent record to artists with many, would be? Instead, we could be interested in knowing which is the band with the highest ratings within those with at least, say, three albums rated. That changes the story quite a bit:", "But, hold on, where is Neil Young? He now ranks 10th with a pretty decent average rating of 8.99, which is quite impressive when you know that I have listened to 13 of his albums. Obviously, the more albums rated, the lower the average will be. My wife and I are big fans of using Google Maps to choose where to dinner, the problem comes when we have to decide between a tempting new Italian restaurant with an impressive rating of 4.8 stars (out of five) but with only 300 votes, and one with a 4.3 from 2,300 ratings. Which one would you go for? What happens with my music taste is very similar, and there is not a definite answer. All things considered, I guess I can confidently say that I certainly love Arctic Monkeys and Neil Young\u2019s music.", "Before we move on to the inferential analysis, we can look at a couple of things more. For example, according to my ratings, which year has produced the best music in the last decade? To do that, I need to have a column in my dataset with the year of the albums\u2019 release. Then, a simple plot or the function \u201csummarySE\u201d in R, which calculates the mean ratings per year, would tell us.", "The winner is 2010, with an average rating of 7.98; followed by 2012 (7.96), and 2011 (7.95). In my humble opinion, in those three years, a great bunch of great records was produced: \u2018My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u2019 (Kanye West, 2010), \u2018The ArchAndroid\u2019 (Janelle Mon\u00e1e, 2010), \u2018Helplessness Blues\u2019 (Fleet Foxes, 2011), \u2018Let England Shake\u2019 (PJ Harvey, 2011), or \u2018Lonerism\u2019 (Tame Impala, 2012). However, as you can see in the plot above, thankfully, every year, outstanding albums get to the market and the decade has been pretty homogenous in quality \u2014 at least to me! (And I am saying this because, as you will see in the next plot, I mainly listen to new music.)", "One last question: which has been the best decade in music for me? The \u201960s are the decade with the highest mean rating (8.51), and the \u201910s has the lowest one (7.6). Now, does this tell us something about my taste or what is the best decade for music in general? I love The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and The Beach Boys. Still, a scientifically honest answer to the question above would be \u2018not much really\u2019. The problem is that I have listened to much more new than old music during the last ten years, and, as we have mentioned before, that brings down the mean. In the next plot you can see what decade\u2019s music I have been listening to each year \u2014 where are the \u201980s!?", "As I said a few paragraphs ago, sadly, this dataset is not very informative. For instance, I wish I had a Genre (i.e., rock, hip-hop, folk, etc.) column. I could implement that myself for every single artist or album, but that would take me ages. Instead, now that I know my music taste a little better, we can focus on a different type of analysis, using inferential statistics. That would allow us to infer, to predict, trends about a population \u2014 me \u2014 based on the data.(If you know enough about statistics and inferential analysis, skip the next paragraph.)", "To conduct the analysis, we need a dependent variable. That is, something we are interested in measuring because it informs us about the real world, and might change when we modify certain factors (independent variables). For example, we might want to know whether the world is warming up or cooling down. To investigate that, we measure the temperature (our dependent variable) at various points in time (and space) varying in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We hypothesise that the independent variable (carbon dioxide) might affect our dependent variable (temperature). That is, increased concentrations of carbon dioxide would lead to temperature rises.", "In our current analysis, we are interested in my music taste, for which we use my ratings as a proxy. An ideal independent variable we could have an obvious hypothesis about would be music genre. For example, our research question could be something like \u2018Does the genre of the album predict its rating?\u2019. However, I don\u2019t have that information and what I have is scarce. So I came up with very silly questions! We will use linear regression models to answer them.", "Once we put the variables \u2014 which I am about to show you \u2014 in the model and run it, the summary will tell us whether they are significant predictors or not, that is, whether they significantly influence the dependent variable (i.e., the ratings) or not. We test those hypotheses against the null one (i.e., there is no statistical relationship between the variables tested, or, in other words, our results are due to chance).", "The research question for each of variable I will test is pretty similar \u2014 as you may imagine: \u2018Does X significantly modify Y?\u2019). These are the factors: length of the albums\u2019 titles; length of the artists\u2019 name; the number of vowels in the albums\u2019 titles; the number of vowels in the artists\u2019 name; presence or absence of \u2018the\u2019 in the artists\u2019 name. Don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t warn you! It was going to be really non-sensical. But, hey, who knows, there might be a significant relationship after all; however, miles away of being theoretically motivated. Let\u2019s run the model.", "For a relationship to be significant, we will use a p-value lower than 0.05 \u2014 the cut-off that tends to be the standard in many fields of science. That means that we can \u2018confidently\u2019 reject the null hypothesis as there is only a 5% probability that it is true. It is important to note, though, that the null hypothesis is not entirely falsified, as there is still a 5% probability of it being true. This is what our model shows:", "As you can see, any of the factors is significant (p-value > .05), which makes a lot of sense. Thankfully, any of those stupid and arbitrary factors determine my music taste. That\u2019s reassuring! Jokes aside, even a significant result would not necessarily mean that that is true in the real world; but, I will leave that discussion for a future article.", "And this has been pretty much all. I hope you have enjoyed this first post. This has been much more about descriptive statistics than inferring information out of the data. Hopefully, the next time will have a richer dataset to play with!", "Your home for data science.
