The goal of differential privacy is simple: allow data analysts to build accurate models without sacrificing the privacy of the individual data points.", "But what does \u201csacrificing the privacy of the data points\u201d mean? Well, suppose I have a dataset that contains information (age, gender, treatment, marriage status, other medical conditions, etc.) about every person who was treated for breast cancer at Hospital X. In this case, a data point is a row of a spreadsheet (or DataFrame, or database, etc.) containing information about a person who was treated for breast cancer.", "I want to build a machine learning model that predicts the odds of surviving breast cancer at Hospital X. What should I do if I want to preserve the privacy of the patients?", "This is where differential privacy comes in. Differential privacy helps analysts build accurate models without sacrificing the privacy of individual data points by introducing randomness into the process of data retrieval.", "In the framework of differential privacy, there are two actors: a curator and a data analyst. The curator owns all of the data, with all of the original (true) values, and the data analyst wants to interpret that data. The data analyst can \u201cquery\u201d the database; that is, the data analyst can ask the curator for a subset of the data. Differential privacy doesn\u2019t give any information away directly; instead, for every variable the data analyst is interested in, such as age, diagnosis, treatment, etc., they might get the true value, or they might not. The likelihood that the analyst actually recieves the true value varies based on how much noise is introduced.", "The more times you query the database, the less private the data is. There is a lot more complexity to differential privacy than I just covered, but you get the basic approach.", "But for now, let us move on to a quick explanation of European privacy legislation.", "The General Data Privacy Regulation, abbreviated as the GDPR, is a piece of data privacy legislation that applies to all companies based in or operating in the entire European Union. The GDPR outlines how companies are allowed to use, store, and process data about people. The goal of the legislation is to give people more control over what companies know about them, and standardize those practices across Europe.", "In order to talk coherently about the GDPR, we need to quickly define three terms: personal data, data subject, and processor. While we all know the colloquial definitions of these terms, the GDPR defines them precisely, so we want to be familiar with their definitions.", "And as they say, with great processing comes great responsibility.", "The GDPR makes it very clear that the processor is completely responsible for ensuring and maintaining the privacy of the personal data it handles. Not only that, but the processor actually needs to care about the privacy of that data. The legislation mandates companies to design their products and processes with privacy in mind, sets limits on how long the processor can hold data for, and gives data subjects many rights concerning how their data is used, stored, and disclosed.", "Privacy Goals of Individuals and Companies", "In general, we can assume that the data subject wants their personal data to be maximally private while the processor wants the data to be maximally public.", "In general, we can assume that the data subject wants their personal data to be maximally private while the processor wants the data to be maximally public.", "The processor wants the data to be as public as possible because the less restrictions there are on the data, the easier it is for the processor to use. However, it\u2019s important to note that the interests of the data subject and the processor are not entirely in opposition \u2014 after all, the data subjects want the products and services they use to work as well as possible, and many are willing to give up some privacy in exchange for that.", "Additionally, most companies are not evil by nature, and they care (at least a little bit) about maintaining the privacy of the people they provide services to, regardless of the law.", "You may have noticed that the GDPR and differential privacy both share a word in common: privacy. Privacy is one of those words that you can come with a million contradicting definitions for, but for now:", "Privacy \u2014 the right of individual people to selectively disclose information about themselves to the world.", "Combining all the terms we just introduced:", "Differential privacy is a property of an algorithm(s) that processes data, used by one or more processors, to protect the personal data of the data subject. In other words:", "It\u2019s important to understand that both the curator and the data analyst of the differential privacy world are by definition processors of the GDPR world, and that they could be either the same entity or different ones. For example, if my Android phone collects location data about me and then a Google engineer analyzes it, both the curator and data analyst are Google. But if Google decides to give a third-party company like Tinder access to my data, then Google is the curator and Tinder is the data analyst. Both Google and Tinder are processors.", "In this section, I\u2019m going to go over the pros and cons of using differential privacy for the different stakeholders, specifically companies and users.", "Benefits for Both Companies and Users", "However, there are also definite disadvantages to using differential privacy related to security and quality of analysis.", "Additional Challenges When Using Differential Privacy", "Overall, I believe that the use of differential privacy within companies, particularly companies that share data with others, can be an excellent tool for both increasing privacy and complying with the GDPR, as long as it is used appropriately.", "If you have any questions, comments, or want more resources about anything I discussed, please reach out.", "[2] A.
