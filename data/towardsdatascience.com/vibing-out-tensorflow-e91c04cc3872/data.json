Vague? Let me share a visualisation that I found helpful when learning about tensors:", "I think most of us have a pretty intuitive understanding of what a scalar is (a number!) and even vectors and matrices, but what isn\u2019t clear from the above image is that all of these things are tensors of different dimensions!", "So, generally speaking, a tensor is like a matrix but it doesn\u2019t just have to have rows and columns, it can have depth as well (aisles) and more (which we can\u2019t visualise)!", "This means we can have one object that stores references of n features. This is something that comes up a lot in machine learning, and tensors, in particular, feature heavily in deep learning.", "Funnily enough, TensorFlow allows you to work with machine learning and deep learning (neural net) models and algorithms in a synchronised way, so you can start to see where the \u2018tensor\u2019 part of the name comes in.", "As I\u2019ll touch on more later, TensorFlow is a workflow tool that ties together a bunch of industry standard tools in order to deploy seamless machine learning and deep learning projects.", "In short, TensorFlow gives you your machine learning flow.", "\u201cTensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

(And don\u2019t worry, TensorFlow has the last say of what contributions are adopted so that the worst minds in the world can\u2019t add dog sh*t \u2014 thus is the nature of open source projects).", "As we were with our description\u2026", "\u2026 platform for machine learning \u2014", "Okay, okay I know I\u2019m trying to become a data scientist but\u2026 what actually is machine learning?!", "Notice the distinction here between Machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Libraries? Community resources?", "This one is a bit of a pandora\u2019s box and will often highlight more tools that need to be learnt. But for now, we can understand that a data scientist uses a lot of different software tools, from cleaning and processing data to developing and training models for machine learning.", "TensorFlow helps data scientists navigate this workflow by creating a user-friendly framework to train models using Python, JavaScript or Swift. It then gives us the choice of how to deploy our work \u2014 be it in the cloud, in a browser or on our device. See more on this here.", "Community resources goes with the nature of the open source environment. TensorFlow also offers extensive tutorials and resources on how to best use their platform as well as community forums and help requests via GitHub and Stack Overflow. You can see more on this here.", "Libraries. If you haven\u2019t come across libraries before or have just never understood what they are \u2014", "So simply put, libraries are just a collection of functions that do things that we need to do all the time.", "There\u2019s a coding principle that if you\u2019re writing out the same of code over and over, you probably need to put it into a function. With this in mind, think of libraries as all the functions people have written over and over and, finally, someone thought \u201cIf I need this function, someone else probably needs this function too\u201d.", "Data scientists obviously have very repetitive parts of their jobs, and so there are many libraries available that contain all the necessary functionality to perform the job.

But to sum up for now, TensorFlow is a platform that ties a lot of other industry standard tools together to create a workflow that enables us to deploy end-to-end machine learning projects.", "I encourage you to keep Googling and compare other platforms such as PyTorch, Keras and Theano.
