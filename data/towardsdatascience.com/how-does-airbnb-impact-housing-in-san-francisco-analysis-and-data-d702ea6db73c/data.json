Indeed, these platforms have spurred aggressive debate with some like San Francisco enacting regulation [2][3]. At the same time, if many forces act on housing from local pricing trends to historical inequities, how much blame really lies with companies like Airbnb [4]? Using data, this essay examines how these platforms may be impacting the SF housing market and explores how regulations are shaping those trends.", "Note that this is a topic where data and policy intersect so this essay discusses the impact of a few regulations. Please understand that information provided here does not and is not intended to constitute legal advice. All content is for general informational purposes only and provided without warranty. Do not act on or refrain from acting on this information without first seeking professional legal advice in the relevant jurisdiction [5].", "First, one needs to define the \u201cshort term rental market\u201d in SF. This analysis uses Dec 4, 2019 data from Inside Airbnb so these results only apply to properties on Airbnb listed at that time [6]. With that sample in mind, this essay excludes hotels/hostels (8% of listings). Furthermore, as the SF Airbnb market has a number of properties that only allow long term rental, those with a minimum stay of over 30 days (4% of listings) are also ignored as they may not be subject to the same regulation as short term rentals [7].", "With these definitions in mind, who is renting out space on Airbnb? The popular worry is that, instead of locals leasing out a spare room, landlords with a network of multiple properties are moving an outsize amount of housing from the local long term rental market into short term rentals without living in the units themselves [8]. However, the data suggest that most hosts do not fit this definition: 75% only have one SF listing and very few (3%) have five or more*. Also, 89% of SF hosts report living in California, an unsurprising finding given that SF regulation requires that hosts \u201cspend at least 275 nights a year in the unit\u201d they rent [7]. So, with all of this in mind, the data suggest that most hosts likely live in California with only one or two listings.", "Still, even if most hosts are locals with just a few listings, that\u2019s not to say that potential \u201cabsentee\u201d landlords cannot be found. Consider that 11% of hosts report their location as something other than California. Furthermore, this \u201cremote\u201d group is more likely than those reported as living in California to have three or more SF listings as opposed to just one or two (p < 0.05)**. Combining these metrics, \u201cremote\u201d landlords with many (\u22653) listings are responsible for a sizable one 1 of 10 listings (11%) but they only make up one 1 of 50 hosts in SF (2%). Indeed, these hosts\u2019 impact can be extensive: 19 such \u201cpotentially remote\u201d hosts have 10 or more listings each. This suggests that many hosts do in fact lease spare space in the property in which they live but there may be a small number of absentee landlords with disproportionately large supply.", "Before moving on, it\u2019s worth mentioning that this essay is not necessarily claiming that all those rentals are illegal. Information online could be out of date, one simply could have a lot of rooms, etc. It\u2019s also worth highlighting that some outside the 2% identified above could also be illegal.", "Anyway, understanding that most Airbnb hosts are probably locals with just one or two listings but that there are a few \u201cpotentially remote\u201d landlords with many, what kind of supply does Airbnb take up? It is important to understand the kind of housing used for Airbnb to determine the type of supply that is lost from the long-term rental market. So, using data from the city, the zoning for each listing can be roughly determined [9]. A plurality (49%) fall into one to three family homes in residential housing or \u201cRH\u201d zoning (RH 1\u20133)***. This is in contrast to high density housing like apartments which are very unlikely within RH zones. In fact, as some non-RH zones contain a mixture of houses and other buildings, that 49% may be an under-estimate. This means that it is likely that around half of listings are rent out from houses, making it easily the most common type of property used.", "Once more, you\u2019ll want to take this with a grain of salt. Zoning laws in San Francisco are incredibly complex and the public location data available for rentals is not always precise so this finding should be considered approximate.", "Still, is it really true that all types of hosts are likely renting space within their one to three family houses? Even with this RH plurality in mind, the zoning usage across types of hosts is not uniform and further digging reveals that listings in RH zones are less likely to be from \u201cremote\u201d landlords with 3 or more listings (p < 0.05). In fact, only 24% of the listings from those potentially absentee hosts (with \u2265 3 listings) are in RH compared to 52% for other hosts. This significant result means that RH zone hosts may be more likely to actually live in their space while \u201cremote\u201d hosts with a network of listings are more likely to be active in other types of zoning like higher density apartments.", "Knowing that \u201clocal\u201d hosts are more likely to use RH zoning than \u201cremote\u201d hosts, what does Airbnb do to the SF housing market? It seems plausible that prior research are correct in that some Airbnb hosts are likely driving up prices through reduced supply, especially the small number of \u201cremote\u201d hosts with many listings who are more likely to be outside RH zoning (like in high density apartments) [1]. However, the result is not so simple when the host actually does live in the unit, especially for properties where it\u2019s not clear if those spare rooms would become long term housing supply if Airbnb went away. Consider that, of the RH zone listings, 39% are single family homes (without a subordinate unit) and are intended for only one \u201cfamily\u201d with one \u201cdwelling unit\u201d [11]. While it may be possible to long-term rent those spaces to non-relatives, it seems plausible that they could not enter into the long term market like a typical apartment. This is because the occupants are limited to only those who can to fit the \u201cfamily\u201d definition and, as RH-1 cannot have more than one kitchen, the space often cannot match the features of a typical apartment [10][11]. This means that Airbnb may have the dual effect of reducing supply in some types of housing (especially in high density housing) but platforms like Airbnb may also be unlocking otherwise unused space elsewhere in the market (especially RH single family houses).", "How should SF feel about these results? The argument around short term rentals requires nuance because services like Airbnb may be making one type of housing more affordable and productive while increasing costs in another. For locals renting out a spare room within a house they occupy, many rooms may simply go unused due to zoning restrictions if it weren\u2019t for services like Airbnb. In fact, the loss of Airbnb may not only result in the loss of economic productivity for those spaces but it may make home ownership in SF even more expensive and inaccessible because, given zoning restrictions, some lower income owners may have more difficulty establishing long term rentals to offset the cost of their homes. However, this effect of increasing access to home ownership is balanced by potentially absentee hosts with many listings who likely drive up costs for renters. Of course, if the spirit of the law were followed closely in San Francisco such that units really did need to be occupied by their hosts, this may be less of an issue. Alternatively, if zoning was more permissive, it is possible that RH-1 supply could become more useful for long term rentals. Still, to provide perspective, 11% of listings come from remote landlords with three or more properties but 19% of listings are single family homes with those restrictions (excluding those with a subordinate unit). So, there\u2019s a lot of good to come from short term rentals even if there are a smaller number of bad actors. Ultimately, it is up to the reader to decide if that trade-off is worth it.", "Code, data, notes, and works cited available on Github.", "Want more experiments at the intersection of data, design, and systems?
