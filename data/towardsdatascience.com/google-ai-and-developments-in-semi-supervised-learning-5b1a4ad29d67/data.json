Therefore it makes perfect sense to make an effort to stay updated on their progress. Yesterday, on the 10th of July in the Google AI blog the two researchers Qizhe Xie and Thang Luong wrote an article with the title Advancing Semi-supervised Learning with Unsupervised Data Augmentation. I intend to do my best to understand this article and interpret some of the possible consequences resulting from their findings.", "In their introduction they were talking of the silent revolution in Semi-Supervised Learning. I had to check out the source and I was interested to see that they had referred to an article by Principle Scientist at Google Vincent Vanhoucke in Towards Data Science called The Quiet Semi-Supervised Revolution written the 15th of May 2019.", "The next three days I will look at three questions.", "Day one: how is Google a frontrunrunner in the field of AI?", "Day two: which advancements is being made in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Unsupervised Data Augmentation and why is it important for the field of AI?", "Day three: how is the quiet revolution in SSL changing the industry?", "Today being day the first day I will start with Google.", "The story of how Google began seems so often told that some would say it does not need telling, so I will do my best to keep it short. From the Garage to the Googleplex they first built a search engine using links to determine the importance of individual pages. This company was called Backrub because the program analyzed the web\u2019s \u201cback links\u201d to understand how important a website was, and what other sites it related to.", "Going backwards to ensure that the classification of a website is correct with algorithms was Google\u2019s first innovation PageRank. It worked by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption was that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites. This is perhaps the best known algorithm used by Google, but it was not invented by the founders. In fact Google\u2019s founders cite Garfield, Marchiori, and Kleinberg in their original papers.", "Google was founded September 4, 1998, Menlo Park, California, United States. Several decades before their launch there had been some developments in another backwards-forward-looking field, backpropagation. The basics of continuous backpropagation were derived by Henry J. Kelley in 1960 and by Arthur E. Bryson in 1961 using the principles of dynamic programming (finding the shortest path in a graph using optimal substructure).", "It seems with progress we have to look back to make sense of the way forward or possibly the next fork in the road.", "I\u2019ve always been interested in arrival, and coming to a space, and even to looking back at where you were. -James Turrell", "Backpropagation, short for \u201cbackward propagation of errors,\u201d is an algorithm for supervised learning of artificial neural networks using gradient descent. Given an artificial neural network and an error function, the method calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural network\u2019s weights.", "More recently In 1986, through the work of David E. Rumelhart, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Ronald J. Williams and James McClelland is known for reintroducing backpropagation. This would later prove important to image search in terms of image classification. Especially when later Google was growing to become the most popular search engine and would introduce Image Search:", "So our co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin \u2014 like all other successful inventors \u2014 kept iterating. They started with images. After all, people wanted more than just text. This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world\u2019s attention. At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen. But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J\u00adLo wearing that dress. Google Image Search was born. -Eric Schmidt previous Google CEO quoted in Quartz magazine April 2015.", "At the time of Google Image\u2019s launch in July 2001, the site offered access to 250 million images.", "In the eyes of a search engine, the Web is essentially a body of words on billions of pages, along with the hyperlinks that connect the words. One of Google\u2019s big breakthroughs was to link those words efficiently, measuring relevance by the appearance of words on a page, and the number of hyperlinks pointing to that page, or its popularity [\u2026] Right now, most image search engines rely on keywords, or descriptive text that is linked to a photo in order to retrieve a list of results that match a Web surfer\u2019s keyword query. That method can be unreliable, however, if photos or images lack sufficient descriptions.-Stefanie Olsen, CNET 2006", "By 2010 the number of pictures in Google Image had reached more than 10 billion. It may have been clear at the time that they had to do something. That something was Google Brain.", "Google Brain is a deep learning artificial intelligence research team at Google. Formed in the early 2010s, Google Brain combined open-ended machine learning research with systems engineering and Google-scale computing resources. It began as a collaboration between Google Fellow Jeff Dean, Google Researcher Greg Corrado, and Stanford University professor Andrew Ng.", "When I was at Stanford in the 2000s, my PhD student, Adam Coates, came into my office with a chart showing that the more data you fed to a neural network, the better the neural network performed. We started looking for the biggest computers we could find. That discovery, and the idea of using distributed computing to scale up neural networks, led to the creation of Google Brain in 2011. Since then, deep learning has made great progress as we\u2019ve collected more data and created the powerful computers to make it work.\u2013 Andrew Ng quoted from WIPO Technology Trends 2019: Artificial Intelligence (p.9).", "The deep learning boom started with a 2012 paper known as \u201cAlexNet\u201d after lead author Alex Krizhevsky. The trio of researchers who authored the paper from the University of Toronto (including Geoffrey Hinton and Ilya Sutskever), entered the ImageNet competition to classify images into one of a thousand categories. AlexNet achieved unprecedented accuracy by using a deep neural network, with eight trainable layers and 650,000 neurons.", "They were able to train such a massive network on so much data because they figured out how to harness consumer-grade GPUs, which are designed for large-scale parallel processing. This demonstrated the importance of better algorithms, more training data, and more computing power.", "In 2012 a neural network created by Google learned to recognize humans and cats in YouTube videos \u2014 without ever being being told how to characterize either. It taught itself to detect felines with 74.8% accuracy and faces with 81.7%-Explore Machine Learning by Google", "In 2013 Geoffrey Hinton joined Google Brain. Two years after AlexNet won in 2012, Google entered the contest with an even deeper neural network and took top prize. The company had started hiring top-tier machine learning experts and acquire companies focused on the field of AI. One popular version used in recognising images is convolutional neural networks (CNNs).", "Taking input data you can classify different images. The company also has unrivaled access to large data sets. A 2013 paper described how Google was using deep neural networks to recognize address numbers in tens of millions of images captured by Google Street View.", "The 2014 acquisition of DeepMind (deep learning, acquired for $400 million) is a famous example, thus keeping at the forefront of neural network design. The company had created a neural network that learned to play games as well as a Neural Turing Machine (that can access external memory like a Turing machine). The company made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol, the world champion, in a five-game match.", "In 2016, Google created a custom chip called a Tensor Processing Unit specifically designed to accelerate the operations used by neural networks. TensorFlow the machine system now free for all combined with the Tensor AI chip. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, mentioned that Google is evolving from a \u2018mobile first\u2019 to an \u2018AI-first\u2019.", "Depicted you can see layers of a CNN together with Quantitative Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) a new interpretability method to understand what signals your neural networks models uses for prediction", "In June this year (2019) I wrote an article called Patents in The Field of Artificial Intelligence. Google does not feature as one of the companies with the most patents within the field of AI. In fact the top companies are in descending order from the largest: IBM (8,290), Microsoft (5,930), Toshiba (5,223), Samsung (5,102) and NEC (4,406). My article referred to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) report Technology Trends 2019: Artificial Intelligence. On the other hand", "\u201c \u2026Alphabet (including Google, DeepMind, Waymo and X Development) ranks 10th in the number of inventions filed, with 3,814 in total, it ranks 1st in terms of acquisitions of AI companies\u201d WIPO Technology Trends 2019: Artificial Intelligence (p.16)", "Google in a programming sense is still looking backwards to move forward. However due to its now over two decades of operation focused on classification and the way it is building an inclusive network surrounding new technologies, as well as its acquisitions, I would make a fair argument as to why Google is currently one of the frontrunners in the field of AI.", "I understand this was a teaser of sort, and as you understand I may not be able to fully answer the questions I have sketched in this article over the next days, however as always I certainly hope you stick with me for the journey.", "What is #500daysofAI?I am challenging myself to write and think about the topic of artificial intelligence for the next 500 days with the #500daysofAI.
