It is a platform I visit before checking out a new place to eat, or even after going to one I\u2019ve tried (just to see what everyone else thinks of it).", "To get started, you first need to request an API key. Once that\u2019s done head on over to the Documentations section and have a look at all the data points you can begin to source! Let\u2019s have a look at one:", "/cities This function retrieves details about each city. To search for Sydney we input the following:", "It\u2019s returned us JSON content which looks to be a dict. We\u2019ll visit how to extract the data points we want later in the article.", "Now let\u2019s get back to answering the question:", "Are Sydney\u2019s Top Restaurants Really Worth It?", "This is a fairly general question and can be interpreted in many ways, so as we begin sourcing our data points it\u2019s important we think about:", "Properly defining our problem, prior to designing the solution will help to save plenty of time. (Trust me, I\u2019ve run into that problem before)", "Without further ado, let\u2019s begin our first step!", "We will primarily be using the search function, which returns details on restaurants, allowing us to get a maximum of 100 restaurants, with 20 results per call.", "Below is a python script that pulls Zomato restaurant data and dumps it into a file for use later on:", "The parameters entered for search were found using other functions such as:", "In addition to that, I chose to sort the restaurants by rating in desc order.", "Based on my parameters you can see that I\u2019ve answered some of the questions in breaking it down (earlier on in the article \u2014 in case you missed it) i.e.", "The return value of search is the same as cities in that it returns a dict. Given, we\u2019d like to extract information on 100 restaurants but are only limited to 20 per call, what can we do? We grab each dict returned and append it to a list until we get 100 restaurants.", "Once we have the list, we write it into a file so we can use it later on.", "Our JSON file Top100SydneyDinners is now ready to get transformed!", "Before we do this, we should first know what our data looks like. To start let\u2019s return to our cities output earlier on and understand how that\u2019s structured.", "Do you want to have a guess?", "It\u2019s a dict, where one of the keys i.e. \u201clocation_suggestions\u201d has a value of type list and that list contains a dict with multiple key pairs", "Bit confusing, I know! But what\u2019s good about it, is it means it is a combination of dicts and lists, and we can use their corresponding methods to get the data we want.", "Now\u2026copying the Top100SydneyDinners over here would blow out this article, so here is a link to that file on my GitHub account. It might also be helpful to copy it\u2019s contents into a JSON Formatter so it\u2019s more readable.", "See any interesting data points there?", "Our goal here is to get the data we want out of JSON format and into a lovely, clean table for analysis.", "To start let\u2019s load in our JSON file, define the columns we want in our DataFrame and then create it!", "I did create more columns than needed (sorry, got a bit greedy with my data), but to answer our main question, the focal points should be:", "Next, we need a way to populate our currently empty DataFrame.", "To do so, we select the interested pieces of data from each restaurant (e.g. name, cuisines, etc.) and form that into a single list. Each restaurant will then have it\u2019s own list, and that will be appended as a row to our DataFrame.", "Let\u2019s have a look at the code below\u2026", "Remember, the JSON file consists of a list of dicts that were appended via the python script earlier on when extracting the data. Hopefully the code above is clear enough to understand, but if not I try to explain the nested for loop below:", "It may help to have the JSON formatted output opened, as you walk through these steps.", "Are Sydney\u2019s Top Restaurants Really Worth It?", "We\u2019ve retrieved the Top 100 restaurants for dinner based on their rating, but what we haven\u2019t done is look at their cost.", "We start by calculating the mean.", "We get an average of $107.90 for two people, where 66% of the total restaurants cost less than this. Does that seem right to you? Does the mean appropriately describe the centre of our average costs? Personally, it doesn\u2019t seem so.", "Let\u2019s visualise our data in a histogram to get a better idea.", "You see the data is skewed to the right (i.e. tail on the right side is longer than the left side), which indicates it would be more appropriate to use the median as our measure of central tendency rather than the mean. This is because the mean is sensitive to outliers, such as those values near 440 and 480, whereas the median is not. Once the data set is sorted, the median is simply the middle value.", "So, shall we calculate the median?", "Cool! So now we have the median cost as $80.00 and only 48% of restaurants lie below this value. That seems more reasonable, as our chosen measure of central tendency is now getting closer towards 50% of values being above and below it.", "However\u2026if you return to the histogram there are restaurants with an average cost for two around the $20 mark. Unless they\u2019re doing some sort of crazy special, I find this hard to believe.. so let\u2019s do some more digging.", "We grab the 10 lowest average_cost_for_two restaurants and view them in the DataFrame.", "Oops! Based on the cuisines column, it seems we included values for Ice Cream, Cafe Food and Coffee and Tea, which meant these restaurants were in fact cafes or desert parlours and not places for dinner.", "Let\u2019s take these out of our data set\u2026", "To do so, we create a list of values we want to remove (discardCuisines) and check if they exist in each restaurant\u2019s cuisines, this creates a Boolean vector. We want the Boolean vector to be True for values we\u2019d like to keep and False for those we don\u2019t. Plug that Boolean vector into our DataFrame and that\u2019ll filter out the restaurants we don\u2019t want.", "In Line 6 below, I invert all the Boolean values in discardRestaurants, as the restaurants to filter out had value \u201cTrue\u201d instead of \u201cFalse\u201d.", "Now that our data has been cleaned, let\u2019s compute some of the descriptive statistics again:", "As a result of removing the smallest values:", "What does that mean (pun intended)? When you tell your friends about the price of Sydney\u2019s Top restaurants, quote the median not the mean.", "Are Sydney\u2019s Top Restaurants Really Worth It?", "Well, with a median average cost for two people being $80.00, I\u2019ll let you decide.", "I hope this article was enjoyable and helpful.
