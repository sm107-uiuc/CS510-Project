Because anything measurable/countable under chance/random causes will always follow a normal distribution curve. Even if it was under the influence of assignable causes(not a normally distributed curve), still the central limit theorem would have held true. For now, we are taking this example for understanding the gist of this theorem. It is not practical to measure the height of all males and will try to infer the population mean with samples.", "Now we have 5 self-proclaimed estimation experts to estimate the mean with varying sampling choice:", "Remarks by the estimation Lord here are displaying negative sentiments about the estimation expert and his choice of sample size (n=2). The distribution of the 10 estimated means is also far away from a normal distribution. Now it\u2019s the turn for the next expert in line:", "Remarks by the estimation Lord here are displaying somewhat positive sentiments about the estimation expert and her choice of sample size (n=10). I think I am able to put some relevant ideas of the central limit theorem in your mind now \u2014 as the sample size increases, the estimation of population mean gets closer and closer to the actual population mean with decreasing dispersion/spread alongside a shape replicating a normal distribution (*of the sample estimated means). According to this, which one among the 03 leftover estimation experts will have the best estimate of the population mean with high confidence (low spread/dispersion of estimated means)-", "Yes, it is the last guy (doppelganger of Einstein).
