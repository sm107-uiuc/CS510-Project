But in my experience learning programming, finding useful tasks and projects to reinforce your skills is tough. This is especially true of programming for data analysis. Finding meaningful and interesting data is really hard if you don\u2019t know where to look.", "Luckily, there are plenty of great datasets and projects out there. When searching for your next project, it\u2019s worth considering a couple of things:", "With this in mind, I like to explore a mix of quick tasks, longer projects, and collections of datasets and problems. Here are 10 of my favourites.", "Description: Data scraping and analysis project using Python", "As a very popular used-item market, eBay has a huge amount of data about the ever-changing prices of all its items and listings. Getting at that data and analysing it is really useful if you want an advantage when buying or selling.", "There are a few ways of getting eBay data. I\u2019ve used both web scraping libraries like Python\u2019s BeautifulSoup, and the eBay API in a different Python script. Whatever approach you take, here are some things you can do with the data:", "I\u2019ve had a go at a couple of these, and I\u2019ve found it useful when gearing up to buy and sell on eBay. Try it, and perhaps you\u2019ll make a bit of extra money too.", "Description: Life automation project using Python and Todoist API", "If you have a digital to-do list, you can create a script to add and manipulate tasks programmatically. This has been a huge timesaver for me in the past and has helped me keep on top of tasks that don\u2019t repeat regularly.", "To get started with this project, I\u2019d suggest using Todoist as your digital to-do list. Todoist offers a straightforward API that\u2019s easy to use with Python, and some helpful documentation. You can then determine the conditions by which you want to add and manipulate to-do list items. You could:", "Once you set your to-do list automation script to run regularly, you should hopefully experience a surge in productivity. At the very least, you\u2019ll get some more experience under your belt.", "FizzBuzz is a very simple problem. But I\u2019ve highlighted it as a standalone project because I think every programmer should try it out and learn how to solve it. The problem is as follows:", "Print integers 1 to N, but print \u201cFizz\u201d if an integer is divisible by 3, \u201cBuzz\u201d if an integer is divisible by 5, and \u201cFizzBuzz\u201d if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.", "While it\u2019s a simple task, it still takes some thought for a novice programmer. There are different ways to solve it too, some of which are of interest to more experienced users. Learning good solutions to this task will help improve your problem-solving and your understanding of what makes good code.", "Description: Collection of quick programming problems", "In December of each year, the Advent of Code initiative uploads a new programming problem every day until Christmas. Can\u2019t wait until next Christmas? No worries \u2014 all the problems from each year are archived and available all year round.", "I like Advent of Code for a few reasons. The problems get progressively more difficult as the days go on, meaning there\u2019s something for everyone. They cover a broad range of tasks and skills too, exposing you to a variety of strange tasks and data. Some of these might challenge you and push you to improve your computer science knowledge if you\u2019re a self-taught programmer too.", "Description: Collection of mathematical coding problems", "Want to put your coding skills to work on interesting recreational maths problems? Project Euler is for you.", "Project Euler is a huge collection of mathematical problems aimed at programmers who want to sharpen their skills. These problems range in difficulty, but many don\u2019t require an expert understanding of maths. While Project Euler problems aren\u2019t data-focused, tackling them will no doubt reinforce maths knowledge and problem-solving approaches that will help with handling data.", "I recommend starting with some early problems from the archive.", "Description: Collection of interesting datasets from the R community", "In the R community, Tuesdays are an event! Every week on this day, a new dataset is released in the Tidy Tuesdays GitHub repository. These datasets vary widely in subject and are fun to explore and analyse no matter your preferred programming language.", "The social aspect of Tidy Tuesdays is also unique. Users are encouraged to share their visualisations and analyses each week with the Twitter hashtag #TidyTuesday. This creates a compilation of interesting takes on the same data, which are often a great inspiration for your own efforts.", "Description: Collection of larger projects, with prizes", "By now, Kaggle competitions are a mainstay in the data science community. Kaggle is a platform that hosts an online Jupyter notebook environment, as well as tutorials and thousands of free, real datasets. Kaggle also holds competitions where teams attempt to answer questions of a dataset using data science.", "The introductory competitions are well documented, but new ones appear on a rolling basis, sometimes rewarding the winning team with a large cash prize. It\u2019s worth taking a look at Kaggle in case you find a project that aligns with your skills.", "Description: Decision automation program using anything from basic logic to machine learning", "It\u2019s always satisfying to take the conclusions of your analyses and apply them to something useful. A recommendation engine can do exactly this. Based on some input and a few heuristics, you can make your life easier by getting a program to automate some of your everyday choices.", "I\u2019ve previously built a dashboard app with R Shiny that gave me suggestions of what to wear, given factors like temperature and formality. Although I used basic logic to do this, using external data and/or a statistical model is a natural next step. Whatever the approach or recommendation problem you choose, this project could save you time in the long run. Your frontend, backend and design skills will all get a workout too.", "Description: Gaining insights into your spending and saving with code", "If you track your spending or have a budget, you\u2019ve immediately unlocked a great project. Why not use your analytical knowledge to break down your spending, predict how much you\u2019ll save in the next year, or calculate forecasted returns based on compound interest?", "While some banking apps have budgeting functionality, I find they\u2019re never comprehensive or customisable enough for my liking. Your own financial analyses can go deeper by comparison, and be a useful project. The scope for saving money is huge when you finally quantify how much you spend at the pub.", "Description: Image editing using R packages", "Got a bunch of images that you want to edit at the same time? Perhaps to resize them for use on a webpage, or adjust their brightness because they were all a bit overexposed? Automate your image editing process with code!", "While editing images doesn\u2019t sound like data analysis, it\u2019s worth remembering that images are still data. They contain a lot of rich information and can be analysed programmatically for a variety of uses. Learning to work with them is therefore pretty valuable. It\u2019s also easier than you might think, too. I wrote a short tutorial about using the magick package in R for batch image editing, and the whole code is about 10 lines long!", "The best way to learn anything is to apply it to something you care about. Many of these projects have made my life easier in some way, and all have engaged me as I gained understanding. So open up a new project in your favourite language.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be a big project, and it doesn\u2019t have to make you money. It only has to be something new and fun.", "Who knows where it might take you.", "Want to read all my articles on programming, data science, and more? Sign up for a Medium membership at this link and get full access to all my writing and every other story on Medium. This also helps me directly, as I get a small contribution from your membership fee at no extra cost to you.", "You can also get all my new articles delivered straight to your inbox whenever I post by subscribing here.
