Computers can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d in the way we can, as they can only understand numbers, and defining rules on arrays of numbers is basically what any computer vision tasks boils down to (massively oversimplified).", "So, in today\u2019s article, I will quickly demonstrate the power of OpenALPR API to do the following:", "Once again, it\u2019s so easy for us to look at the image of a car, and in a second we\u2019d have information on all of the above points. For computers that task is a lot more complex \u2014 I dare you to install OpenCV and try to implement the logic by yourself if you disagree with me.", "Without further ado, let\u2019s see how to get things set up properly, what image I\u2019m gonna use, and finally, the source code.", "To start out, you\u2019ll need an OpenALPR account for which you can register here. I\u2019m on a free plan, and if I\u2019m not wrong it will enable you to make 1000 requests per month. That\u2019s not enough for commercial purposes, but it will definitely suit you well for exploration.", "If at some point in time you\u2019ll need more, here are the plans from which you can choose:", "It\u2019s not cheap by any means, but if you have a parking lot that serves 1M cars per month then I\u2019m guessing 2K isn\u2019t that much for a state of the art license plate reading system.", "Anyway, once registered you will get access to your dashboard, and within it, you can go to CarCheck API section to grab the API key:", "We\u2019ll need it later when making requests, but more on that in a bit.", "Cool, let\u2019s now see the image we\u2019ll use to test the API.", "I searched online for car images with a license plate that are free for non-commercial use (actually pretty difficult to find one where the plate isn\u2019t blurred). After some time I found a pretty decent image, and you can download it from this link:", "Nice, now we have the account created and we have the image. We\u2019re done preparation-wise. Let\u2019s jump into the good stuff.", "When it comes to imports, we\u2019ll only need two libraries:", "Yes, you\u2019ve read that right. You won\u2019t need to install any libraries to use OpenALPR, which makes potential deployment somewhere down the road that much easier.", "Now we\u2019ll declare two variables, one holing a path to your car image, and the second one holding the secret key, obtained by good folks at OpenALPR:", "And now comes the part we\u2019ve been waiting for. Here are the steps we need to take in order to read the license plate from a given image:", "It seems easy, right? Here\u2019s the complete code:", "Keep in mind that I\u2019ve split the url variable into two lines so the image is more readable to you. Also, note how you can specify the country parameter inside the URL to possibly get better results, if you know beforehand to which country license plate belongs to.", "As you can see, with just a few lines of code we\u2019ve managed to obtain so much useful information from the image. To someone unfamiliar with computer vision, developing a solution like this could require months and months of work, and it is questionable how satisfied would you be with the results in the end.", "And there you have it \u2014 in just a few lines of code we\u2019ve managed to perform state of the art computer vision work (well sort of, we just made a call to the API).", "I\u2019d argue that the color of the car is black, and not silver-gray, but that\u2019s irrelevant for our case.", "The free plan will suit you well to explore, but consider developing the full solution on your own, just for the fun. Maybe that will be the topic for some other time, so let me know if you\u2019d be interested in that.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
