AI is the future of many industries.", "For many, a direct route into the AI field is to pursue a career within Machine Learning(ML).", "Therefore this article covers the teachings given by Andrew Ng, in one of the many Stanford lectures on YouTube.", "More specifically, Andrew provides excellent advice on how you can successfully navigate a career in Machine learning.", "This article is relevant for most machine learning practitioners at different stages of their careers.", "After the completion of academic studies, machine learning students typically go onto work in machine learning jobs or take on further research in the form of a PhD.", "I, for one pretty much went into an ML role immediately after my MSc in Machine Learning. Typically AI roles are found in two types of companies: either big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, or young, exciting startup companies.", "One thing Andrew mentions is that regardless of which direction you take, you have to ensure that you conduct important and meaningful work. I\u2019ll expand later in this article as to what Andrew mentions in regards to the subject of important and meaningful work.", "But first, let\u2019s find out how to get a job in the first place.", "Jobs in machine learning are highly competitive, but you already knew that.", "What you might not be aware of are the qualities, and skills recruiters and employees are looking for in their ideal candidates.", "Andrew possesses years of experience working within AI teams and has led teams within big and small companies.", "\u201cAs the founding lead of the Google Brain team, former director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and now overall lead of Baidu\u2019s AI team of some 1,200 people, I\u2019ve been privileged to nurture many of the world\u2019s leading AI groups and have built many AI products that are used by hundreds of millions of people.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Ng", "Now here\u2019s what Andrew suggests recruiters are looking for when hiring for AI roles:", "Machine learning research jobs require individuals to have at least an average level of technical skills already acquired.", "Your average programmer knows about two-three programming languages, all to an intermediate level.", "Machine learning practitioners tend to have programming skills and are expected to be able to understand a suite of commonly used programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript and R.", "You might be asking why do you need to have practical knowledge in so many languages.", "Well, in my current role as a Computer Vision Engineer, I juggle between three different programming languages. I use Python to implement models (TensorFlow)and write scripts; I also use javascript to implement models (tfjs) and lastly, I integrate models and computer vision techniques into iOS applications, so I utilize the Swift language for iOS app development.", "After your stellar CV has been reviewed and you\u2019ve progressed to the next stage of the interview process, the following stages are typically a phone interview and an onsite interview.", "At both interview stages, you can expect to be quizzed on machine learning related topics. Be expected to explain the differences between variants of gradient descent; or what the unique characteristics of novel neural network architectures are.", "You\u2019ve probably spent a couple of years or more in some form of an academic institution and are used to the theoretically based method of examination that Universities and colleges adopt.", "On the other hand, recruiters are seeking exceptional candidates that do not only understand the theory of topics within machine learning, but they can apply concepts, techniques and ideas appropriately.", "For example, ensure that you understand at a conceptual level the description and benefit of Batch Normalization, but to stand out to recruiters, be sure to have Jupyter notebooks or GitHub repos of where you have utilized it.", "A practical method of proving your application of theoretical knowledge is to have two or more side projects in your portfolio. Side projects are one of the few opportunities you have to showcase your technical, creative and problem-solving skills.", "Some traditional roles do not require you to update your knowledge on either the field or industry is based in.", "In Machine learning, this is the exact opposite, new techniques are developed daily, more tools and libraries are updated weekly, and a large number of research papers are published monthly.", "In machine learning, you never stop learning. I\u2019m currently involved in the deep learning fields, and I utilize techniques from research studies and open source projects. Still, more often than not, there is a new shiny neural network that seems to have pushed the top-5 accuracy of a particular computer vision tasks and is now the latest state of the art technique.", "Recruiters and employers want to see that you won\u2019t be complacent within a role and stop seeking knowledge. Machine learning practitioners are usually at the forefront of emerging tech within the AI industry.", "AI is a field that encompasses other subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, neural networks, computer vision, image processing and many more other subfields.", "According to Andrew, both the strongest candidates for job roles and successful AI practitioners have a \u2018T\u2019 shape approach to their learning across the subfields of AI.", "This means that they have a broad knowledge in the majority of the subfields of AI and in-depth knowledge in a few areas.", "Using myself as an example, I undertook advanced studies in machine learning, computer vision and robotics. Through my studies, I gained basic knowledge in some key subfields of AI. Through my dissertation, personal projects and career path, I focused on three main areas, these are computer vision, natural language processing and deep learning.", "Academic institutions will approach the teaching of machine learning through the introduction of the basics across subfields. They will provide students with the ability to gain in-depth knowledge through optional courses, dissertations and coursework.", "Below are examples of what my \u2018T\u2019 shape knowledge path looks like after I finished Univesity and after undertaking my pwn projects and start a career.", "After the completion of all required courses in my MSc degree in ML, CV and Robotics, I gained basic knowledge across the principal subfields of AI.", "As I completed my dissertation and continue to progress in my career, my learning path has moulded to the T-shape path you see below.", "My specialization is in deep learning, which is a sub-field of computer vision.", "It so happens that you pick up more knowledge in neural networks, machine learning, NLP(image captioning) and image processing, as a result of the sub-fields overlapping and having related topics.", "Personally speaking, I have a long way to go before I can consider myself an expert in Deep Learning and Computer Vision.", "I\u2019ve mentioned \u2018in-depth\u2019 knowledge a lot, but what does it mean and encompasses. According to Andrew, in-depth knowledge is guided and defined by the following:", "Once again, undertaking personal projects in a particular subfield will deepen your knowledge and expertise. And not only will this make you a successful AI practitioner, but also you are more likely to be considered for more hands-on AI roles.", "Andrew recognizes the fact that individuals with machine learning expertise are in demand.", "This fact can make the abundance of choice quite a gruelling experience for some, and for others, it could result in wrong decisions made.", "The statements and lists below are from Andrew\u2019s advice to his students on how they should go about selecting a job to have a happy and meaningful career.", "In his lecture, Andrew hones in on specific key points and tips he believes they are crucial for individuals to consider when selecting a job role, and one particular area he focuses on is choosing an excellent team.", "There are certain factors that you need to consider when selecting a team, and they are:", "Andrew advises that you should look to work within a team where you can easily interact with its members. Generally, such a team contains (10\u201330) people. He advises that you should focus on how hardworking the team is and if their personalities and work ethic can positively influence you.", "The individuals within a team tend to be the people you will spend the majority of your time with. According to behavioural research, you are ultimately an average of the five people you spend the most time with.", "Before deciding to accept an offered role, be sure that you understand what it is that you will be working on.", "More often than not, job role descriptions on job boards do not reflect the nature of the roles and responsibilities of the actual job entails.", "Sometimes, the responsibilities are greatly exaggerated in job postings, which can lead to disappointments.", "Other times, job posting underplay the amount of work new hires are expected to take on, and this can lead to early career burn out.", "The best way to avoid disappointments and burnout is to speak directly to the manager you will be reporting to, get an idea of the expectation of tasks and delivery time.", "Also, talk to team members that are within similar roles and ask questions on their day to day activities.", "When Andrew first mentioned ignoring the company you are considering to work in, I was a bit confused. But after some further clarification, the message became clear.", "Companies have external reputation and recognition, and this is usually referred to as the brand of the company. The brand of a company is generally how a company conveys itself to the external world. The problem with this is that you typically only show your best side to external eyes, which makes your decision in choosing a company a bit skewed.", "As stated by Andrew, from general experiences, the brand of a company has a weak correlation to your personal experience in the company.", "When selecting a role in AI, team consideration has more weight in comparison to company choice. The same could even be said when it comes to choosing an industry to work in.", "To put it simply, the difference between an image classification machine learning project in an oil company and a medical centre is just a matter of the dataset used to train ML models and its application. ML skills are transferable across industries.", "Humans are creatures that are incentivized by internal and external factors, and when both are lacking, then we begin to have regrets, concerns and in some cases, go into a state of depression.", "\u201cTake a job you will not be bored in\u201d.", "I truly enjoyed Andrew\u2019s presentation on why jumping the gun on a role is necessarily not the best idea.", "The utilization of personal anecdotes and experiences of his students makes all his points and concern very relatable.", "During my job search, I turned a couple of offers which seemed great on paper but required a level of personal sacrifice that I wasn\u2019t willing to take.", "Also, some roles I turned down might have sounded great in the short term, but looking at where I wanted to be in the next ten years within my career, they weren\u2019t the best choice.", "I aspire to be an AI leader within a successful company, and this requires me to throw myself in the deep end a lot quicker than normal. Therefore being in a large team where I had low visibility, and no noticeable impact wasn\u2019t the best choice for me. Whereas, working within a startup that provides me with autonomy and an environment to learn (sink or swim more like) means my career development and growth is accelerated.", "Generally, pick a role that best suits your personal goals and long term developments.", "AI is a field where it doesn\u2019t necessarily pay to be a \u201cjack of all trades\u201d, meaning having shallow knowledge on all the subfields of AI is not the best approach to ensuring you have a long and successful career in AI or machine learning.", "Paying attention to gaining deep knowledge pays off in the long run, especially in a field like AI, where specification if often preferred.", "I\u2019m guilty of not having patience, but honestly, in a fast-moving field like machine learning, you almost feel like you are not absorbing information fast enough.", "But taking a more profound observation at individuals with long and successful careers, I have realized that it takes time to build true skills, expertise and knowledge within any of the AI subfields.", "That been said, our generation is accustomed to instant gratification, and the speed of acquiring knowledge is also a victim to our desire of seeing quick, tangible results.", "Throughout this article, the requirement of having a side project has been said to have many benefits to your machine learning career. The problem with side projects is that they have to be robust enough to show the level of skill required to impress external reviewers. To be able to create a side project with that level of impact requires a substantial amount of effort and time.", "So, having ten mediocre side projects is not better than completing 2\u20133 projects with real impact and provide an excellent showcasing of your technical abilities.", "According to Andrew, quality beats volume in this matter.", "Andrew\u2019s lecture ended with a focus on the key elements that contribute to an individual having a successful and long career in machine learning; they are:", "I learned a lot watching the lecture and writing this article, and I hope that you can take one or two actionable items from this article.
