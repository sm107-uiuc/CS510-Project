When it comes to complex NLP modelling, free text is black gold.", "NLP for businesses provide enhanced user experience ranging from spell-checks, feedback analysis and even virtual assistants.", "In certain situations, small businesses may create Whatsapp chat groups to relay information between members as a low-cost alternative to setting up systems to log data. Rule-based chat system on how the information is to be disseminated is agreed at the start of the chat. Consider the following example:", "We can immediately recognize patterns pertaining to sales order from different salesperson, separated by common operators such as \u2018/\u2019 and \u2018,\u2019. With a simple system (but prone to human spelling error) like this, we can analyze sales pattern of different products and different locations with the use of Whatsapp.", "There are many great resources online to convert Whatsapp data into a pandas dataframe. Most, if not all, makes use of Python\u2019s Regex library as a fairly complicated solution to split the text file into columns of the dataframe.", "However, my objective here is to target Python users who are beginners in string manipulation. For beginners learning Python, we have better familiarity with basic Python methods that does not come from external libraries. In this article, we will be using a lot of the basic methods in processing Whatsapp data into a pandas dataframe.", "Here is what we will be covering:", "If exporting messages directly from your phone is not your jam, you can try the following method:", "Otherwise, the easiest way to extract Whatsapp .txt file can be done by the following method:", "Once you\u2019re done, your text file should look something like this:", "The first thing we want to do is to make sure we know the location of your text file. Once we know its destination, we can set our working directory to the file\u2019s location:", "Once that is out of the way, we want to define a function to read your text file into a Python variable with the following method:", "The above function converts our text file into a list of strings that allows us to make use of .split() methods later on. But for now, there is some cleaning you need to do.", "Sometimes the data you extract may not be in perfect format due to multi-line texts. Consider the following situation using the same salesperson example from above that is already converted into a list:", "We can observe that \u2018Some random text\u2019 does not have the same usual format that every line of Whatsapp text should have. To handle such elements, let\u2019s first look at the pattern of Whatsapp text messages.", "Ignoring everything else after the date, it is obvious that unwanted elements do not have date objects in them. So we begin removing them by checking if they do contain date before the first \u2018,\u2019. We do this by utilizing basic error handling-technique.", "As you can see, we have removed about 100 elements that may pose a hindrance to feature extraction later on. It is just within most of our casual texting culture to not use multi-line texts unless we are sharing links with caption with our buddies!", "Now this is where you will be using your basic Python skills to extract features from the list that you will parse into a dataframe later on. First, we need to revisit the string pattern from the Whatsapp data.", "The first feature we would like to extract is the date. Remember that the date string occurs right before the first \u2018,\u2019. So we extract the element using the .split(\u2018,\u2019) method at index 0. We can write this beautifully using Python\u2019s list comprehension.", "Do note that I came from an R background and I am very used to using \u2018i\u2019 in for loops. Another way you can write the above code without using range() function is the following:", "In contrast, this is what is required using the Regex method just to check whether the string pattern is date.", "With that out of the way, we may proceed with the same logic when extracting both the time and name of the sender. Take note of the following pattern:", "Finally we want to extract the content of the message. This is a little bit tricky because certain lines do not contain any messages. Instead, they are system-generated messages depicted by the following:", "Notice that there is no additional \u2018:\u2019 after the first one that occurred at the time string. To put into perspective, consider the following .split(\u2018:\u2019) method:", "The element at index 2 is of interest to us. However, since system-generated messages do not contain the second \u2018:\u2019, extracting information at index 2 will produce an error. Therefore we will proceed with our second error-handling technique.", "You may choose to remove elements with \u2018Missing Text\u2019 later on.", "Now that we have 4 lists of features, we can finally create a pandas dataframe with a single line of code!", "And voila! Your data frame is ready for post-analysis! Notice the system-generated message that appear on the name column. You can conditionally remove rows with system generated message with the following code:", "There are many ways you can make use of a processed Whatsapp text data to conduct your analysis. From recreating yourself as a bot, using NLP for sentiment analysis to just plain simple analytics. Making use of Whatsapp data is great practice for any complex NLP projects to come.", "Basic string manipulation is enough to convert a text file into a pandas dataframe as shown above. If you are a newbie with Python(like me), it is better to get used to the basics than trying out new techniques that may prove a little overwhelming at first. However, Python\u2019s regex library is still an important tool for intermediate to advanced uses of text mining and data validation.", "Here is a great article explaining the concepts of the Regex library in Python along with its potential uses for data analytics and data science:", "Your home for data science.
