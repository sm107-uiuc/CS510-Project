My job became 100% remote and my hobbies were stopped. So I browsed thenews.im to kill my free time. I found this coronavirus API : thevirustracker.com. It provides worldwide insights about the covid-19 spread. They also have a nice dashboard about the world situation. So does the Johns Hopkins University with its dashboard. The main issue with these boards is that they are difficult to load on smartphones. They are loading heavy plots and maps take a lot of time to display.", "I wanted to have COVID-19 latest data available on my phone at light speed.", "I decided to start simple, very very simple. Here is the first version of the project:", "It could not be simpler. The data displayed are exactly the data thevirustracker.com is providing. It was ugly as hell but still, it was lightweight, and it answered my need. With this, I was able to have live insights on the pandemic growth within a second.", "As it was quite a handful, I shared the link with my family and my close friends. Few people have seen this yellowish version. But they were using it and gave feedback. My mother asked for a French version. Done.", "To be more inclusive I went one step ahead and I changed the page aspect. I used more contrasting colors for color blind people, I used as many HTML tags as possible for visually impaired users. As you already know, there are browsers that read out loud the web pages based on the underlying structure. For this page, it used to say \u201cNew section: Worldwide stats [...]\u201d. I changed the title blank division became an <h1> tag (ie. header first level). Now inclusive browsers are saying \u201cTitle: Worldwide stats\u201d, and you can navigate through the page based on this structure.", "This isn\u2019t much, and people providing public content should always keep in mind to be as inclusive as possible. Most of the time it takes no extra effort.", "From the first version, I found out that people wanted to have more insights on the spread evolution. I decided to add a line chart that displays trends for a country or more.", "On the left, you have a screenshot of this functionality. A first drop down list Add a country allows you to pick countries. A second one lets the user select the displayed data (number of cases, number of recovered \u2026).", "This figure aims at showing that version 2 was solving this new need. At this time users were able to compare countries against each other. You could see spread trends and estimate the upcoming situation. Data are directly loaded from thevirustracker.com, providing up to date numbers.", "To get further I added a button Log scale allowing the user to display a log view. It flattens the exponential aspect. This feature turned out to be very useful as the comparison between countries at different stages could be difficult on a linear scale.", "The line chart was handy to explore/compare trends but not for having precise insights on a country situation. I gathered from the second version feedback that users now wanted to be able to select a single country and to look at live data for this specific country.", "On the left, one can see the new feature: a map allowing the user to select a single country and to display detailed data.", "Information fields are identical to the first released version\u2019s.", "Among the feedback I received from friends and users, here is one that illustrates well how the project was living:", "Once the pandemic reaches several thousand humans, numbers became difficult to read. The font was too thin and numbers too close from one another. In his review, my friend suggested adding an extra-space to gain readability. Simple to spot, even simpler to fix. It has been warmly welcomed by users. It was a quick win!", "This fourth version (the last one to be detailed here) contains a few visual changes. Two buttons have been added to the user interface.", "The first one allows users to scale data by the number of humans. So case numbers become case percentages. This functionality seems useful, but it hasn\u2019t been much used. This parameter was not of principal interest among page viewers.", "The second button has played a huge role on the page\u2019s spread. It is a share button allowing viewers to copy the page configuration. From this stage, every user could set up the page and share its view to his network.", "On a personal note, I must admit I love to explore data. With the project spread my goals took a new dimension. I could have decided to stop at version 1 as my personal need was satisfied. But as my friends, my network and then as my friend\u2019s networks were using the page, I got a broader ambition. I wanted to improve the service the page was bringing. This is the reason why I monitored the page use.", "On a technical side, every time a user makes a change on the page, it changes the url. Combining this with Google Analytics I was able to see metrics like the:", "This is the link to the page: yleprince.github.io", "By combining the url constant updates and Google Analytics, I was able to have a clear overview of features being used and on user interests. It helped me a lot to prioritize tasks during the development phase.", "On the personal side, this project has been a great adventure. It\u2019s the first time a project of mine has reached that many users with a huge diversity of people. I started with an idea, and it has been a huge experience to see the result spreading around the world within ten days. In spite of the existing tools already available on the net, its simplicity and inclusiveness (smartphone, visually impaired people\u2026) has found its audience.", "Receiving feedback from people who do not know you is the best way to learn from objective reviews.", "I hope I have been able to share data and provide people with the information they wanted to find. This project was not meant to profit in any way from the pandemic. I invested nights of dedicated work to answer people wishes, I earned nothing else but constructive reviews and good vibes. That being said, the data presented in the project are the one that thevirustracker.com provides. Even if they are doing an excellent job everyone should consider several data sources. There are as many ways to count as there are countries.", "Here is the end of the story, I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed living it!
