If you frequently prepare a presentation then it means you are consuming your time with busywork. But why should you do something like grunt work if you can automate it?", "This is my second article about the automation of time-consuming works. You can find the other one that is about creating a pdf file with python by clicking here.", "This article consists of five parts.", "Now I\u2019ll show you the basics of creating PowerPoint slides with Python.", "python-pptx is a Python library for creating and updating PowerPoint files. This article is going to be a basic introduction to this package. If you want to learn much more about it, this is the official documentation page that you should check. Now let\u2019s install the package if you don\u2019t have.", "I suggest you use the pip install code line because this package depends on Ixml, Pillow and XlsxWriter packages. If you use setup.py installation method you will need to install these dependencies yourself.", "It is always easy to explain something with examples. For this purpose, I am going to use official examples in the first place. At the end of the article, I am going to build a basic PowerPoint presentation page by page. Let\u2019s start with the adding slide. To do this first we need to import the pptx package.", "We are going to use Presentation() to open or create a presentation. Let\u2019s assign it to a variable.", "Now we are ready to build our first slide. This slide will contain a title and a subtitle.", "Ok, we\u2019ve just created our first slide. Let\u2019s explain this code block row by row. You can think slide layouts like a template. There are nine slide layouts and we\u2018ve used the first one for this example. prs.slide_layouts[0] This means \u2018 I am going to use a title layout\u2019. So how do we know which one should we choose? This is all about Slide Master in PowerPoint. As you see below, the first item on slide master is \u201cTitle Slide Layout\u201d. This is why slide_layouts[0] gives us the title object. By the way, you can use a blank layout instead of the title layout.", "Secondly, we\u2019ve used the add_slide function to add a new slide that inherits the layout. slide=prs.slides.add_slide(lyt) By doing this assignment, we\u2019ve just added a slide layout that contains a title object (a big one!).", "After this step, we\u2019ve created a title variable. title=slide.shapes.title", "Next row is subtitle=slide.placeholders[1] . This means if you want to add a subtitle then you have to add a placeholder. With .text attribute, we can assign a string on a shape.", "The last step of our code block is exporting the pptx file. prs.save(\u201cslide1.pptx\u201d) saves the slides as pptx in our path. So here is the result;", "OK, we\u2019ve just learned how to add a slide, a title and a subtitle. Now it is time to add a chart and an image.", "Before adding new elements I should mention something important. Length classes. pptx package has a util module that contains utility function and classes like Lenght, Inches etc.", "Here you can find source code for pptx.util. You might think, \u201cwhy it is so important?\u201d. First of all, as you know, there are two default slide sizes. Standard and Widescreen.", "If you want to use a widescreen presentation, you should define slide sizes in the beginning.", "Besides that, as you will see below, we need to adjust objects to our working space. Okay, let\u2019s keep going. Now we need to define an image path to use it later.", "Okay, halfway through. In our first example, we\u2019ve used slide_layout[0]. This time we are going to pick the sixth layout which is blank.", "Well, we got everything we need. Let\u2019s add an image.", "We are going to define two variables now. These variables allow you to adjust the position or move if you need to.", "Okay, we are ready to add an image.", "pptx package supports adding or modifying charts. To do this we will use pptx.chart.data and pptx.enum.chart.", "First we need to define chart data.", "Let\u2019s add some categories and series.", "Now we need to define some measures. (left, top, width, height)", "We are now ready to add a chart.", "That\u2019s enough for the beginning. Let\u2019s build an end to end PowerPoint presentation.", "Ok, we are white-collar and our manager wants a fast presentation for tomorrow. Yes, you can build a presentation one by one if you want.", "Let\u2019s build an automated presentation program.", "First things first, let\u2019s import requisite packages.", "After importing packages I\u2019ve defined some variables. (Title and logos). Now we can create our first page. I am going to use a widescreen layout.", "I\u2019ve used shape.shadow.inherit = False to remove the shadow effect. A shape object also has a .fill property. It is the colour of the shape. The .line is a border around a shape that can have a different colour. Thus, I assigned same RGB codes for both of them. Here is the result:", "I\u2019ve just added a line chart with random variables on a blank slide. You can find chart types here.", "If you want you can add a plotly chart as an image. Let\u2019s see how to do that.", "We\u2019ve used a Plotly sunburst example.", "Finally, let\u2019s add a text box.", "There are two different text code blocks. First one is about textbox. slide.shapes.add_textbox(left, top, width, height) With tb.text you can add text inside the textbox. If you want to add another paragraph then you should use tb.add_paragraph().", "And finally, we\u2019ve finished our basic presentation. Maybe you just want to add a thank you page :)", "And do not forget to save :)", "As I said at the very beginning of this article designing a presentation is a time-consuming process. As a goblin said, \u201ctime is money, friend!\u201d.", "This is the basic example of creating a PowerPoint presentation with Python. You can define functions and run them when you need.
