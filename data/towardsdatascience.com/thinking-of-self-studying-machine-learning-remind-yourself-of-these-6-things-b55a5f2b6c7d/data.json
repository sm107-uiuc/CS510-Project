He told me about the project he was working on to use machine learning to try and understand student learning better. He was combining lecture attendance rates, time spent on the online learning portal, quiz results, plus a few other things. He\u2019d even built a front-end web portal to interact with the results.", "Ankit\u2019s work inspired me. It made me want to do better.", "Then a few more people started coming over and asking questions about how to get into machine learning. All from different fields.", "This is the hard part. I still see myself as a beginner.", "But the best mentor is someone who\u2019s 1\u20132 years in front of you. Someone who has just been through what you\u2019re about to go through. Any longer and the advice gets fuzzy. You want it when it\u2019s fresh.", "My brother is getting into machine learning. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying to him (and myself if I were to start again).", "The language doesn\u2019t really matter. It could be R, Java, Python, whatever.

Bonus points if it\u2019s geared towards teaching data science at the same time. DataCamp is great for this.", "It\u2019ll get hard at times but that\u2019s the point. Learning a programming language is like learning another language and another way of thinking at the same time.", "But you\u2019ve done it before. Remember when you were 3? Probably not. But people all around you were using words and sounds you\u2019d never heard before. Then after a while, you started using them too.", "Apply what you\u2019ve learned as soon as you can.", "No matter how many courses you\u2019ve completed, you\u2019ll never be 100% ready.", "Don\u2019t get lured into completing more courses as a sign of competence.", "This is one thing I\u2019d change if I went back and started again.", "Find a project of your own to work on and learn through being wrong.", "Back to your 3-year-old self.

But I encourage you to spend a few days doing research of your own and seeing what\u2019s best for you.", "As a heads up, three resources I\u2019ve found most aligned to what I do day-to-day are, the Hands-On Machine Learning Book, the fastai Machine Learning course and the Applied Data Science with Python course on Coursera.", "Bookmark these for after you\u2019ve had a few months Python experience.", "You\u2019ll see articles and papers coming out every day about new machine learning methods.", "There\u2019s no way to keep up with them all and it\u2019ll only hold you back from getting your foundations set.", "Most of the best machine learning techniques have been around for decades.

Then expand your knowledge as your project requires.", "3-year-old you was a learning machine (a machine learner?).", "In a couple of years, you went from no words to talking with people who had been speaking for decades.", "Because you practised a little per day.", "Then the compound interest kicked in.", "1% better every day = 3700% better at the end of the year.", "If you miss a day, no matter, life happens.
