Take customer reviews; whilst it may be useful to predict a review rating based on its content, it is often far more valuable to understand why customers are providing positive or negative reviews for a particular product or service.", "This can be used to create more effective marketing, inform future product development and even design customer support processes tailored to issues which are being identified through product reviews. Can a predictive model do all of this? No, it can\u2019t.", "In this post we will analyse thousands of companies\u2019 Modern Slavery returns to understand what commitments are being made by businesses to prevent Modern Slavery, we will then use advanced visualisation techniques to determine how different industries are responding to the risk of Modern Slavery both internally and in their supply chains.", "If you have read my previous posts on Medium, you may have picked-up on the underlying data being used. This relates to Modern Slavery returns submitted by several thousand UK and international companies since 2015. Why use this data? The below is an important, if sombering, digression into Modern Slavery and the measures put in place to prevent it.", "Modern Slavery is a huge issue. It is estimated that it costs the taxpayer \u00a34.3bn a year in the UK alone. As a crime, it has been placed second only to homicide in terms of harm to its victims and society.", "\u201cThe exploitation and enslaving of men, women and children across the world and within the UK is one of the most shocking crimes and one of the most profitable.\u201d", "Baroness Butler-Sloss, Lord Justice of Appeal until 2004", "It is estimated that 136,000 or (1 in 500) individuals in the UK is a victim of Modern Slavery and that there has been a 10-fold increase in levels since 2013. Crimes relating to Modern Slavery are abhorrent. Examples include labour exploitation, sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, organ harvesting and criminal exploitation.", "Victims are controlled by force, threats, coercion, abduction, fraud and deception.", "What is being done to prevent it?", "The Modern Slavery Act 2015 was introduced to combat Modern Slavery in the UK. Part of this act requires companies with a Turnover of more than \u00a336m to publish what they are doing to prevent Modern Slavery in their business and within their supply chains. As of April 2019, there are 8,700 statements identified as published.", "But what are companies actually doing? What are they committing to? What processes are they implementing? How are different industries approaching the issue?", "In order to understand what companies are actively doing and committing to doing, we will need to create an intelligent way of identifying such commitments in each Modern Slavery return.", "A typical return will include a lot of non-relevant information such as background on the Company and the Modern Slavery Act. Thankfully using the SpaCy NLP library, we can filter these out using its powerful matching features.", "The problem with text matching is that it can quickly become burdensome, even when using techniques like regular expression. The issue is all of the different combinations of phrases you need to consider when looking to find even a simple pattern. For example, we are interested in identifying phrases which contain statements like:", "However the below phrases would be of interest as well, how can we include these in our analysis without having to write code for every example?", "The matching engine in SpaCy allows you to use Part of Speech (POS) tags to match phrases to a specific pattern, for example, rather than searching for specific words, we could filter for a sequence of POS tags:", "This matching identifies the following phrase from a snippet from a Modern Slavery return:", "SpaCy even provides an online tool for helping to build and review the results of different rules:", "It does not take long at all to create a set of rules which produce good results. The below code implements these rules and returns the whole sentence where a result has been identified:", "Now that we have a set statements filtered for commitments and actions from company submissions what can this tell us about how different industries are responding to Modern Slavery?", "For this analysis we will use the fantastic ScatterText library developed by Jason Kessler.", "This uses a simple, yet powerful approach to find key words and phrases which separate two categories of text. The results can then be output easily into an interactive visualisation.", "The below code filters our modern slavery returns to two high-risk industries: Construction and Retail. It then creates a corpus of text for use in the scatter text visualisation:", "Once this is complete, we can run the below to create an interactive scattertext output:", "This plots the distribution of words by the two categories (in this case the Retail and Construction industries). Words at the top right are common across both categories, words at the bottom left are uncommon across both categories.", "It is the words at the top left and bottom right which show the key differences between the two industries in their approach to combating Modern Slavery. Clicking on a word reveals where it has been used within the corpus. This is useful to find the context and the reasons why certain words and phrases occur within one industry and not another. The full output is available to download at the end of this article.", "After just a few minutes of analysis, it is easy to find significant differences in the way the two industries are approaching the issue of Modern Slavery (items in bold represent the words on the chart which have been analysed):", "The value of being able to look across thousands of documents and instantly understand trends across industries is huge. It can be used to:", "Hopefully this article has been helpful in showing that some simple, but powerful NLP and visualisation techniques can unlock insights that are otherwise locked within unstructured data.", "The below Colab Notebook contains all the code used in this post:", "To view the interactive scattertext output please see the embed below:", "This is part of a NLP mini-series on analysis of Modern Slavery returns.
