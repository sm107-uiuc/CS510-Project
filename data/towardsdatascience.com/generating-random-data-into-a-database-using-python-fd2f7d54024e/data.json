Majority of the times we need to create a database to test some software that we\u2019ve built. To do this, we can use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create a mock database system. However, problems may arise if we want to test hundreds or even thousands of records. There is definitely no way we could write that many insert statements into our SQL scripts to meeting our testing deadlines for product deployment, that would be too tedious and time consuming.", "To help with this problem, our trusty friend Python comes to assist !", "As you may or may not know python is a scripting language that is well known for its plethora (abundance) of libraries. Python is also known for its ability to automate task using its very simple syntax.", "Even if you don\u2019t have what is required above, this article will ensure that you understand its content to help you further your Python career.", "So let\u2019s get into it !", "The python libraries that we\u2019ll be used for this project are:", "Other tools that we\u2019ll be using includes:", "Note: Different types of databases can be used however, for this article will focus on the MySQL connections. So, for any other database such as PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, etc. an alternate configuration will be required.", "First, we need those python libraries we spoke about earlier. Pip \u2014 Pip Installs Packages(PIP for short). PIP is the package manager for python and also what we\u2019ll be using to install our python packages.", "Note: Conda can also be used for those anaconda distribution lovers.", "We now have all our relevant packages installed from using the code above.", "First, we need to import our relevant libraries.", "The defaultdict (default dictionary) is from the collections package. This will act as our dictionary as it will provide additional functionality over a normal dictionary as we will see later on in this article.", "To generate our dummy data, we will first initialize our Faker instance that we\u2019ll be using to get our dummy data.", "We\u2019ll usefake_data to create our dictionary. defaultdict(list) will create a dictionary that will create key-value pairs that are not currently stored within the dictionary when accessed. Essentially, you do not need to define any keys within your dictionary.", "Now, let\u2019s decide on the kind of data that we\u2019re going to take from the Faker instance to be stored in the fake variable. An example of this data includes:", "We can access this data through different methods within the fake data instance.", "We\u2019ll loop a thousand times to access these methods and then add them to our dictionary.", "Note: Because defaultdict(list)was used, whenever we accessed a key we did not create, it will automatically be added with an empty list [] as its value.", "Now, since we have all our random data within our dictionary fake_data. We need to package this data into our pandas dataframe.", "The pandas dataframe provides many features for analyzing and manipulating data. For the purpose of this project we\u2019ll be manipulating this dataframe as a database entry.", "First, let\u2019s set-up our database connection ! We\u2019ll be using XAMPP as previously mentioned to start our instance of SQL .", "We\u2019ve successfully started our database. Now we will create the database that will house the table that will be generated by our python script using the code shown below.", "Look ! We started our MySQL database(MariaDB in this case) and created our testdbdatabase.", "Note: Root is my username. No password was configured (created) for my account however, there might be a prompt after mysql -u root where you will be asked to enter your password, if you had created one.", "As you can see, I am using the command line version of MySQL. The GUI version is also an alternative option.", "Now, our next step is to connect the database we created to our python code. To do this, we\u2019ll use the engine from thesqlalchemy library.", "The string in the create_engine follows the structure of the driver://username:password@host:port/database . As you can see, in my case I had no password, so it was left blank. The port can be specified but if you are using the default configurations of MySQL it\u2019s not necessary.", "Now that we have created our connection, we can now save the pandas dataframe directly to our database testdb.", "When the code above is executed, a user table will be created in our database with a thousand records being added to it.", "As you can see by looking at the data and the row number at the bottom left of our screenshot, we\u2019ve just generated a thousand records !", "The full code for this project is located in the gist below:", "A task that can be done is to increase the number of fake records generated by increasing the number of iterations in the loop.", "Note. We first need to delete our user table that was previous created by our script by using the query drop table user;", "Due to the output being too many records for my terminal, I will just illustrate the row count:", "The timestamp below shows how long it took to generate one hundred thousand records on my machine:", "Not a bad result right !", "We created 100,000 records in a database in simply 31 seconds. 31 seconds! Can you believe that, crazy right !", "We were able to create a database populated by common user data such as their first name, last name, date of birth, occupation and country. Not only did we create it, but we created it in a rapid timeframe. One of the benefits of this solution is that it is faster than many other solutions that I have come across. Please feel free to play around with the faker library. There are many other types of data that it can be used to generate.", "If you liked this article, sign up to receive emails whenever we post a new article.
