Since Python is where I have done most of my learning, I naturally chose that. The IDE I\u2019m using is Jupyter Notebook. I went a little above and beyond and made a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the dice roller and made it so you can pick the number of sides on the dice as well as the number of dice you want to roll because I like to challenge myself.", "It\u2019s a fun and simple little project so I decided to share how I went about it.", "For this part of the project, I imported 2 libraries: statistics and randint (from random). The statistics library is not needed for this project, but I think it\u2019s neat to use the library to gather statistics on any rolling you decide to do.", "Now we are ready to create our dice rolling function. For this function, there will be 2 required inputs: n and x.", "n will be the number of sides for the dice you are rolling.x will be the number of dice you are rolling.", "That\u2019s it! Simple enough. Now you can use this function to obtain dice rolls.", "Here is an example of what should show up when you run it:", "And, as previously stated, you can use the statistics library to gather statistics on your dice rolls.", "Here is an example of how you can use the statistics library to get statistics on your dice rolls:", "I had never tried to make my Python Code work in a GUI, so this part was new to me. After a little Google searching, I decided to use the tkinter library for this part of the project.", "Because this part was newer to me, I decide to exclude rolling multiple dice and kept the rolling to a singular die for simplicity.", "The next code snippet might seem a little convoluted for beginners. Here I am defining a window class. In the class, I am defining the different things that will appear in the window: an area to type in the number of sides on the die, a button to roll the die and all of the labels that designate what these areas are to the user by using text.", "Next, I define the roll function for the button. The roll function here, is very similar to the one we saw above, however there are a few additional lines so that the GUI will utilize the function.", "Finally, I define the window using tkinter, I add a title (the name title of the window that appears in the top part) to the window as well as the dimensions and the position on the screen the window will appear. The window.mainloop() is an event listening loop, so that our app is ready to respond to new input.", "Altogether, the snippet looks like this:", "Voil\u00e0! Let\u2019s input a 20 for the # of Die Sides and see what we get:", "Lucky number seven! It\u2019s nothing fancy, but it\u2019s a working Dice Rolling Simulator.", "If you are having problems writing the code or just want to copy and paste the code so you have the Dice Rolling Simulator, here is the GitHub repository link:", "Best of luck to you and thanks for reading!", "Your home for data science.
