Probability theory has its roots in the 1600s, when mathematicians Pascal and Fermat began to analyse the mathematics of games of chance. Pascal and Fermat contributed to not only mathematics, but philosophy and theology. Theologians and philosophy majors may recall Pascal\u2019s wager, which in simple terms frames that humans effectively bet with their lives as to whether god exists. We can see therefore, the wide-ranging impact of probability theory.", "We can consider that probability theory is a vast area to cover, but one that I believe can be both intuitive and easy to grasp, provided helpful examples are given. Probability theory is also an integral part of data science and understanding the basics in this area will provide a strong foundation for more advanced topics, such as regression and Bayesian analysis.", "In recent months, I have spent time reading a variety of texts on probability theory and statistics more generally, including Cooper and Weekes\u2019 seminal Data, Models and Statistical Analysis. Given that these texts are often a springboard for experiments and analysis, I felt it might be fun to convey some of the axioms covered by Cooper and Weekes into real-world examples. Given that Stranger Things won\u2019t be back for a little while yet, I wanted to take a tour across probability theory, using Dungeons and Dragons as a metaphor for the various axioms discussed.", "In this first post, I\u2019ll be covering what we mean by independent and dependent events within probability theory, as well as the binomial distribution, which is an essential part of any data scientist\u2019s toolkit.", "Within probability theory, we have both dependent and independent events. Cooper and Weekes define dependent events as those where the outcome of the first event impacts the outcome of the second. An independent event is therefore one where the outcome of the first event does not impact the second event.", "A perfect example of an independent event is two rolls of a dice; indeed this is a classic example from probability theory. In today\u2019s post, we\u2019ll give it a little D&D twist.", "Let\u2019s imagine we\u2019ve settled down at our weekly game of D&D. Our dungeon master hands out our die and we take a look at the twenty-sided one. We can note that if we roll it twice, the outcome of the first roll will not impact the outcome of the second. Unlike a lot of our choices in D&D, our first roll doesn\u2019t impact our next roll.", "Unlike the dungeon master, or that weird villager who was not at all helpful when your band of adventurers asked about the goblins by the bridge, the dice do not remember!", "By understanding the mathematics of probability, we can calculate the chances of two or more independent events and therefore two rolls of twenty in a row. The multiplication theorem for finding this out is as follows:", "If A and B are independent, then the p(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)", "Let\u2019s imagine that we need to use D&D\u2019s signature dice to make two rolls of twenty. On its own, the probability of a 20 roll is 1/20. The probability of p(A and B) is therefore:", "As you can see, the probability for this is pretty low! Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t need to make two rolls of twenty in our game.", "This is all well and good; we now know that our dice rolls don\u2019t influence one another. However, we also want to figure out how likely it is we\u2019ll achieve x number of rolls of a certain amount (n) of total rolls within the game. We know that how well we do in the game is defined by the rolls of our dice \u2014 and as anyone who has played D&D before, sometimes the difference between a 6 and an 8 can mean everything.", "Let\u2019s settle back down at the table and catch up with where we are. It\u2019s coming to the end of our adventure, and it\u2019s not looking good. We\u2019re cornered \u2014 things aren\u2019t looking good for our brave group of adventurers. We have four rolls left to make in the game. And we need to get 20 on three of those!", "Framing this within probability theory; we have n trials and we\u2019re aiming for x successes, or n = 4, x = 3.", "With probability theory, it\u2019s possible to understand how likely it will be for our brave adventurers to meet this task, or how cruel our dungeon master is being when it comes to these dice rolls (spoiler; pretty cruel). We can do so using the binomial distribution, which \u201cdescribes the probability distribution of the random variable number of times x occurs in n experiments\u201d (Cooper & Weekes, 1983).", "The equation for the distribution is as follows:", "If you\u2019re new to statistics the likes of n! can look pretty confusing. n! refers to factorials, which is when you multiply n by a descending series of natural numbers. So if n = 4, then n! is:", "In R, we can use the binomial function to find out how likely it is that 3 of our 4 rolls will be a success, e.g., we\u2019ll roll a twenty three times out of four. We know that the probability of rolling a twenty is 1/20. We\u2019ll use R\u2019s dbinom function, which takes the following values:", "The odds definitely aren\u2019t in our favour. This is one cruel dungeon master! For the brave among you, here\u2019s a text game built in R that requires you to roll three twenties out of four rolls in order to save the day for your pack of brave adventurers. Be warned; you\u2019ll probably die (no dice related pun intended). To play it, simply copy and and paste the code into your R console and type startGame()", "So, we\u2019ve learnt about how probability theory can be used to understand the chances of rolling two twenties with our dice, or more broadly, how the multiplication theorem works for independent events. We\u2019ve also learnt how the binomial distribution can be used to predict x successes in n trials. We also know our dungeon master is kind of mean, which isn\u2019t great news, but we adventure on nonetheless!", "It\u2019s been fun rolling the dice and all, but in our next game we want to shake things up. Our dungeon master has promised that she\u2019ll have some new character sheets ready for our players, but, as she\u2019s kind of mean, we don\u2019t get to pick our new class, instead we\u2019ll be taking one from the table at random. There are 6 sheets, 2 druids, 1 barbarian, 1 paladin, 1 warlock and 1 bard. We\u2019ll want to figure out the probabilities of getting each character class.", "In the next post, we\u2019ll look at dependent events and conditional probabilities to help answer this question. And we\u2019ll probably also ask why our dungeon master is so mean.", "Your home for data science.
