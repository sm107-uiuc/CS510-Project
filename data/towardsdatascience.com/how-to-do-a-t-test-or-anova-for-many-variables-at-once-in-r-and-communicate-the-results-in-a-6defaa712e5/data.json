Most of us know that:", "These two tests are quite basic and have been extensively documented online and in statistical textbooks so the difficulty is not in how to perform these tests.", "In the past, I used to do the analyses by following these 3 steps:", "This was feasible as long as there were only a couple of variables to test. Nonetheless, most students came to me asking to perform these kind of tests not on one or two variables, but on multiples variables. So when there were more than one variable to test, I quickly realized that I was wasting my time and that there must be a more efficient way to do the job.", "Note: you must be very careful with the issue of multiple testing (also referred as multiplicity) which can arise when you perform multiple tests. In short, when a large number of statistical tests are performed, some will have pp-values less than 0.05 purely by chance, even if all null hypotheses are in fact really true. This is known as multiplicity or multiple testing. You can tackle this problem by using the Bonferroni correction, among others. The Bonferroni correction is a simple method that allows many t-tests to be made while still assuring an overall confidence level is maintained. For this, instead of using the standard threshold of \u03b1=5\u03b1=5% for the significance level, you can use \u03b1 = 0.05m where m is the number of t-tests. For example, if you perform 20 t-tests with a desired \u03b1 = 0.05, the Bonferroni correction implies that you would reject the null hypothesis for each individual test when the pp-value is smaller than \u03b1 = 0.05 / 20 = 0.0025.", "Note also that there is no universally accepted approach for dealing with the problem of multiple comparisons. Usually, you should choose a p-value adjustment measure familiar to your audience or in your field of study. The Bonferroni correction is easy to implement. It is however not appropriate if you have a very large number of tests to perform (imagine you want to do 10,000 t-tests, a p-value would have to be less than 0.05 / 10000 = 0.000005 to be significant). A more powerful method is also to adjust the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg or Holm procedure (McDonald 2014).", "Another option is to use a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA). This is particularly useful when your dependent variables are correlated. Correlation between the dependent variables provides MANOVA the following advantages:", "This article aims at presenting a way to perform multiple t-tests and ANOVA from a technical point of view (how to implement it in R). Discussion on which adjustment method to use or whether there is a more appropriate model to fit the data is beyond the scope of this article (so be sure to understand the implications of using the code below for your own analyses). Make sure also to test the assumptions of the ANOVA before interpreting results.", "I thus wrote a piece of code that automated the process, by drawing boxplots and performing the tests on several variables at once. Below is the code I used, illustrating the process with the iris dataset. The Species variable has 3 levels, so let\u2019s remove one, and then draw a boxplot and apply a t-test on all 4 continuous variables at once. Note that the continuous variables that we would like to test are variables 1 to 4 in the iris dataset.", "As you can see, the above piece of code draws a boxplot and then prints results of the test for each continuous variable, all at once.", "At some point in the past, I even wrote code to:", "I had a similar code for ANOVA in case I needed to compare more than two groups.", "The code was doing the job relatively well. Indeed, thanks to this code I was able to test several variables in an automated way in the sense that it compared groups for all variables at once.", "The only thing I had to change from one project to another is that I needed to modify the name of the grouping variable and the numbering of the continuous variables to test (Species and 1:4 in the above code).", "Although it was working quite well and applicable to different projects with only minor changes, I was still unsatisfied with another point.", "Someone who is proficient in statistics and R can read and interpret the output of a t-test without any difficulty. However, as you may have noticed with your own statistical projects, most people do not know what to look for in the results and are sometimes a bit confused when they see so many graphs, code, output, results and numeric values in a document. They are quite easily overwhelmed by this mass of information.", "With my old R routine, the time I was saving by automating the process of t-tests and ANOVA was (partially) lost when I had to explain R outputs to my students so that they could interpret the results correctly. Although most of the time it simply boiled down to pointing out what to look for in the outputs (i.e., p-values), I was still losing quite a lot of time because these outputs were, in my opinion, too detailed for most real-life applications. In other words, too much information seemed to be confusing for many people so I was still not convinced that it was the most optimal way to share statistical results to nonscientists.", "Of course, they came to me for statistical advices, so they expected to have these results and I needed to give them answers to their questions and hypotheses. Nonetheless, I wanted to find a better way to communicate these results to this type of audience, with the minimum of information required to arrive at a conclusion. No more and no less than that.", "After a long time spent online trying to figure out a way to present results in a more concise and readable way, I discovered the {ggpubr} package. This package allows to indicate the test used and the p-value of the test directly on a ggplot2-based graph. It also facilitates the creation of publication-ready plots for non-advanced statistical audiences.", "After many refinements and modifications of the initial code (available in this article), I finally came up with a rather stable and robust process to perform t-tests and ANOVA for more than one variable at once, and more importantly, make the results concise and easily readable by anyone (statisticians or not).", "A graph is worth a thousand words, so here are the exact same tests than in the previous section, but this time with my new R routine:", "As you can see from the graphs above, only the most important information is presented for each variable:", "Of course, experts may be interested in more advanced results. However, this simple yet complete graph, which includes the name of the test and the p-value, gives all the necessary information to answer the question: \u201cAre the groups different?\u201d.", "In my experience, I have noticed that students and professionals (especially those from a less scientific background) understand way better these results than the ones presented in the previous section.", "The only lines of code that need to be modified for your own project is the name of the grouping variable (Species in the above code), the names of the variables you want to test (Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, etc.),2 whether you want to apply a t-test (t.test) or Wilcoxon test (wilcox.test) and whether the samples are paired or not (FALSE if samples are independent, TRUE if they are paired).", "Based on these graphs, it is easy, even for non-experts, to interpret the results and conclude that the versicolor and virginica species are significantly different in terms of all 4 variables (since all p-values < 0.05/4 = 0.0125 (remind that the Bonferroni correction is applied to avoid the issue of multiple testing, so we divide the usual \u03b1 level by 4 because there are 4 t-tests)).", "If you would like to use another p-value adjustment method, you can use the p.adjust() function. Below are the raw p-values found above, together with p-values derived from the main adjustment methods (presented in a dataframe):", "Regardless of the p-value adjustment method, the two species are different for all 4 variables. Note that the adjustment method should be chosen before looking at the results to avoid choosing the method based on the results.", "Below another function that allows to perform multiple Student\u2019s t-tests or Wilcoxon tests at once and choose the p-value adjustment method. The function also allows to specify whether samples are paired or unpaired and whether the variances are assumed to be equal or not. (The code has been adapted from Mark White.)", "Applied to our dataset, with no adjustment method for the p-values:", "And with the Holm (1979) adjustment method:", "Again, with the Holm\u2019s adjustment method, we conclude that, at the 5% significance level, the two species are significantly different from each other in terms of all 4 variables.", "Below the same process with an ANOVA. Note that we reload the dataset iris to include all three Species this time:", "Like the improved routine for the t-test, I have noticed that students and non-expert professionals understand ANOVA results presented this way much more easily compared to the default R outputs.", "With one graph for each variable, it is easy to see that all species are different from each other in terms of all 4 variables.", "If you want to apply the same automated process to your data, you will need to modify the name of the grouping variable (Species), the names of the variables you want to test (Sepal.Length, etc.), whether you want to perform an ANOVA (anova) or Kruskal-Wallis test (kruskal.test) and finally specify the comparisons for the post-hoc tests.3", "As we have seen, these two improved R routines allow to:", "However, like most of my R routines, these two pieces of code are still a work in progress. Below are some additional features I have been thinking of and which could be added in the future to make the process of comparing two or more groups even more optimal:", "I will try to add these features in the future, or I would be glad to help if the author of the {ggpubr} package needs help in including these features (I hope he will see this article!).", "Last but not least, the following packages may be of interest to some readers:", "Thanks for reading. I hope this article will help you to perform t-tests and ANOVA for multiple variables at once and make the results more easily readable and interpretable by nonscientists. Learn more about the t-test to compare two samples, or the ANOVA to compare 3 samples or more.", "As always, if you have a question or a suggestion related to the topic covered in this article, please add it as a comment so other readers can benefit from the discussion.", "Holm, Sture. 1979. \u201cA Simple Sequentially Rejective Multiple Test Procedure.\u201d Scandinavian Journal of Statistics.
