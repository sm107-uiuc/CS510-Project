It is a data partitioning strategy so that you can effectively use your dataset to build a more generalized model. The main intention of doing any kind of machine learning is to develop a more generalized model which can perform well on unseen data. One can build a perfect model on the training data with 100% accuracy or 0 error, but it may fail to generalize for unseen data. So, it is not a good model. It overfits the training data. Machine Learning is all about generalization meaning that model\u2019s performance can only be measured with data points that have never been used during the training process. That is why we often split our data into a training set and a test set.", "Data splitting process can be done more effectively with k-fold cross-validation. Here, we discuss two scenarios which involve k-fold cross-validation. Both involve splitting the dataset, but with different approaches.", "Each scenario will be discussed by implementing the Python code with a real-world dataset. I will also use some graphical visualizations so that everyone can understand what is going on behind k-fold cross-validation in each scenario.", "So, without further delay, you are all welcome to continue reading this article. I will also include the Python code hosted on my GitHub account and the dataset that I use here. So, you can use them to practise yourself.", "We will begin with the first scenario.", "Let\u2019s begin directly with an example. For this, I will use a very popular dataset called bike-sharing dataset.", "We will try to predict the correct number of bike rentals (\u2018cnt\u2019) on a given day based on other variables in the dataset. So, this involves predicting a number, not a class. So, this is a regression task in machine learning. Here, we use linear regression (learn how linear regression works behind the scenes by reading this article written by me). We use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the model performance metric to evaluate the regression model.", "After running the above code block, we get RMSE of 824.33. But this value depends on how we split our data into X_train and y_train. Here, we set random_state=42. According to that value, we obtained RMSE of 824.33. If we set random_state=0, we will obtain RMSE of 909.81. If we set random_state=35, we will get RMSE of 794.15. The reason behind getting different RMSE values is that each time we call the train_test_split function with different values of the random_state hyperparameter, it provides different sets of observations for X_train and X_test. So, what value do we accept as the RMSE? Is it 824.33, 909.81, 794.15 or any other value? As a solution to that problem, one would suggest that we could train the model several times with different values of random_state and then get the average RMSE value. But instead of doing this manually, we can automate this process using the Scikit-learn cross_val_score function.", "In k-fold cross-validation, we make an assumption that all observations in the dataset are nicely distributed in a way that the data are not biased. That is why we first shuffle the dataset using the shuffle function. Then we call the cross_val_score function. Note that we provide the whole dataset to this function. Here, we do not need to provide the split data as X_train, y_train because the splitting is done internally during the process. The cv hyperparameter represents the number of folds (here it is 5). By providing appropriate values to n_jobs, we can do parallel computations. We can distribute the evaluation of the different folds across multiple CPUs on our computer. If we set the n_jobs to 1, only one CPU will be used to evaluate the performances. However, by setting n_jobs=2, we could distribute the process of cross-validation to two CPUs. Finally, by setting n_jobs=-1, we can use all available CPUs on our computer to do the computation in parallel. This is a very effective way, especially when we have a large dataset and when we set cv to a large number, for example, 10.", "Let\u2019s see what is going on behind k-fold cross-validation when evaluating a model\u2019s performance.", "The general process of k-fold cross-validation for evaluating a model\u2019s performance is:", "Remark 1: The splitting process is done without replacement. So, each observation will be used for training and validation exactly once.", "Remark 2: Good standard values for k in k-fold cross-validation are 5 and 10. However, the value of k depends on the size of the dataset. For small datasets, we can use higher values for k. However, larger values of k will also increase the runtime of the cross-validation algorithm and the computational cost.", "Remark 3: When k=5, 20% of the test set is held back each time. When k=10, 10% of the test set is held back each time and so on\u2026", "Remark 4: A special case of k-fold cross-validation is the Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method in which we set k=n (number of observations in the dataset). Only one training sample is used for testing during each iteration. This method is very useful when working with very small datasets.", "Model parameters are the parameters which learn during the training process. We do not manually set values for the parameters and they learn from the data that we provide. In contrast, the model hyperparameters are the parameters that do not learn from data. So, we have to set values for them manually. We always set values for the model hyperparameters at the creation of a particular model and before we start the training process.", "Grid search is a popular hyperparameter optimization technique. It is looking for an optimal combination of hyperparameter values in a way that it can further improve the performance of a model.", "Using k-fold cross-validation in combination with grid search is a very useful strategy to improve the performance of a machine learning model by tuning the model hyperparameters.", "In grid search, we can set values for multiple hyperparameters. Let\u2019s say we have two hyperparameters each having three different values. So, we have 9 (3 x 3) different combinations of hyperparameter values. The space in which all those combinations contain is called the hyperparameter space. When there are two hyperparameters, space is two dimensional.", "In grid search, the algorithm takes one combination of hyperparameter values at a time from the hyperparameter space that we have specified. Then it trains the model using those hyperparameter values and evaluates it through k-fold cross-validation. It stores the performance estimate (e.g. MSE). Then the algorithm takes another combination of hyperparameter values and does the same. After taking all the combinations, the algorithm stores all the performance estimates. Out of those estimates, it selects the best one. The combination of hyperparameter values that yields the best performance estimate is the optimal combination of hyperparameter values. The best model includes those hyperparameter values.", "Let\u2019s see what is going on behind k-fold cross-validation with grid search.", "The reason behind fitting the best model to the whole training set after k-fold cross-validation is to provide more training samples to the learning algorithm of the best model. This usually results in a more accurate and robust model.", "Lets\u2019 get our hands dirty by writing some code to perform k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. This time, I will use the same bike-sharing dataset, but with a different learning algorithm. We will try to predict the correct number of bike rentals using a random forest regressor (learn how random forest works behind the scenes by reading this article written by me). This is still a regression task.", "Here, we tune 3 hyperparameters called \u2018max_depth\u2019, \u2018min_samples_leaf\u2019 and \u2018max_features\u2019 in RandomForestRegressor. So, the hyperparameter space is 3 dimensional so that each combination contains 3 values. The number of combinations is 192 (8 x 8 x 3). This is because max_depth contains 8 values, min_samples_leaf contains 8 values and max_features contains 3 values. This means we train 192 different models! Each combination is repeated 5 times in the 5-fold cross-validation process. So, the total number of iterations is 960 (192 x 5). But also note that each RandomForestRegressor has 100 decision trees. So, the total computation is 96,000 (960 x 100)! So, running the above code definitely takes about 5 minutes with 2 CPUs in the computer. If your computer has more CPUs (e.g. 8), you can set n_jobs=4 to get faster results.", "Here, the test score (RMSE) is 661.72 in y units. This number is much smaller than one (883.42) we previously obtained. Is RMSE of 661.72 still good? To find out this, let\u2019s see some information on bike rentals.", "This tutorial was designed and created by Rukshan Pramoditha, the Author of Data Science 365 Blog.", "Your home for data science.
