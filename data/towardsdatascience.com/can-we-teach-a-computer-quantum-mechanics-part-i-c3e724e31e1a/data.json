Quantum computers have been promised to bring with them untold computational power. Despite our best efforts however, we\u2019ve yet to see a physically realised quantum computer outperform it\u2019s classical counterpart. The road to quantum supremacy is a long one; fortunately this is not our first computational revolution. With the aid of resources and experience from the world of classical computing we can chart the path of least resistance to the development of this revolutionary technology.", "Part I of this blog will delve into the use of quantum mechanics to facilitate efficient computation. Then, as we seek to tackle the paradox of simultaneous control and isolation of quantum bits, Part II of this blog discusses how we intend to hand the problem over to machines through reinforcement learning.", "The story begins with our most fundamental theory of reality, quantum mechanics. Notoriously counter-intuitive, such a description predicts two phenomena which when exploited, form the basis of quantum computation.The first effect, superposition, can be thought of as when one physical system can simultaneously exist in multiple different states. This superposition persists until the quantum state is perturbed (e.g. measurement) resulting in the \u2018collapse\u2019 into a single classical state. Entering the quantum regime, our standard computation unit can be upgraded from a simple bit possessing a 0 or 1 state, to a qubit which can possess any possible combination of 0 and 1 states.", "The second effect is entanglement. Faithful to its name, such a process entwines two or more objects together, ensuring they share a correlated fate. Suppose we entangle two qubits, the state of each qubit is undefined. Mathematically, an independent description of each qubit is impossible, one is only able to describe the system as a whole. Consequently the collapse and measurement of one qubit in our pair instantaneously influences the state of the other.", "How are the phenomena of superposition and entanglement useful in efficient computations? Firstly, they allow us to produce a quantum mechanical analogue of a universal Turing machine. This is achieved by defining a set of operations, the finite sequence of which can perform any possible computation. Secondly, perhaps the most exciting prospect, is the leveraging of superposition to compute a large number of scenarios in parallel. Such computation capabilities lend themselves to the efficient solution of multi-variable optimisation problems \u2014 naturally arising throughout all industry sectors (see examples in finance and big data).", "We are currently at the beginning of our journey to quantum supremacy \u2014 having access to what has been termed noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ). One of the biggest impediments of these devices is decoherence, which sets an expiration date on every qubit. The information contained in quantum systems eventually \u201cleaks\u201d out into the environment until the system you\u2019re working with loses its quantumness, becoming effectively unusable.", "This results in a set window of time to perform quantum computations (see quantum error correction for getting around this problem permanently). Hence, time becomes a resource which must be spent efficiently to get the most out of quantum computing. Accordingly, research has focused on finding the quickest way to perform quantum algorithms. Finding this optimal solution is by no means an easy problem, and remains an open research question today.", "A particular formulation of quantum computation is provided by the circuit model. Here, unitary operations performed on qubits are represented with gates. Universal quantum computation does not uniquely define a set of gates \u2014 as such there exist many sets achieving this end. For our purposes we will focus on the gate set which consists of X, Z, H, CNOT. Such a gate set is not universal (under standard conditions), however it will allow us to access both superposition and entanglement states. Before we create our first quantum circuit we will introduce two ideas, each essential in developing an intuition for the types of operations to be performed by these machines.", "The Bloch sphere is an intuitive visual representation of a single qubit state. Superposition allows the system to be in an arbitrary linear combination of the 0 or 1 state. In bra-ket notation, which will be discussed in the following section, the classical 0 and 1 states of a bit are represented as |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. Thus we can describe the state of some system S as the linear combination of these two states:", "The coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 are known as probability amplitudes. Core to quantum mechanics is the ability of these coefficients to possess complex values, for example:", "In the above equation we present both \u03b1 and its complex conjugate \u03b1* which simply reverses the sign associated with the complex unit. Many of the surprising results of quantum mechanics can be attributed to our lack of intuition of complex probability amplitudes. The probability of the system being in either the 0 or 1 state is defined by the absolute square of the probability amplitude.", "Let us now summarise the key results of these equations in words:", "The Bloch sphere is a simple way to bundle these concepts together into an intuitive package (see Figure 1 below). The final constraint ensures all of the possible superposition states of the single qubit system exist on the surface of the sphere. When performing operations on our qubit we will explore the surface of this object.", "Bra-ket notation is the mathematical formalism that describes the action of operators (gates) on states, where the result of these operations allows our state to traverse the Bloch sphere. The following equation represents the action of an X gate on a zero qubit state:", "In words: applying the X gate on the computational zero state of the qubit transforms the state to the computational one state.", "On the sphere: the X gate sends the qubit state from the north-pole to the south-pole of the Bloch sphere.", "Now, let us examine what happens when we apply the X gate on the computational one state:", "In words: the X gate transforms the one state into the zero state. We see the X gate is the quantum analogue of the NOT gate in classical computing.", "On the sphere: the X gate sends the qubit state from the south-pole to the north-pole of the Bloch sphere.", "Combining each of these actions we can visualise the motion induced by this operation on the Bloch sphere.", "Equipped with our Bloch sphere interpretation let us examine the remaining single qubit gates. The action of the Z gate is given by:", "Examining the action of Z on mixed states:", "On the sphere: the Z gate travels around the equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere.", "Now let us examine the Hadamard gate:", "On the sphere: the H gate travels from the poles to the equator.", "Unlike the previous three gates we have examined, the CNOT gate is a two-qubit operation and hence does not permit an interpretation in terms of the Bloch sphere. We can represent two-qubit systems by simply placing an additional term next to our state \u2014 mathematically this amounts to taking a tensor-product. The state |01\u27e9 possesses two qubits, the first is in the 0 state and the second is in the 1 state. In a similar way as in the single qubit case, we can represent the two-qubit system as follows:", "Let us now examine the action of the CNOT gate on the space of two-qubit systems we have:", "It will be useful for the following section to generalise the notion of 1 and 2-qubit states to n-qubit states, let us illustrate such a generalisation by establishing the sequence:", "Now that we have detailed the actions of the key gates and the notion of multi-qubit systems, let us create our first quantum circuit!", "The quantum circuit model is a pictorial representation of a quantum algorithm, which splits the problem into common sub-processes, similar to the analogue circuit models in classical computing or electrical engineering. States are represented as horizontal lines which can be acted on by any gate within the set:", "Let us imagine we have three qubits in the state |111\u27e9 and we want to end in the final state |110\u27e9. An example computation achieving this result is presented below:", "Examining the input and output states of this computation we see this complicated diagram simply flips the state of the third qubit. A simplified computation achieving an identical result is as follows:", "Here we have applied our knowledge of quantum mechanics to simplify a toy example of a circuit. Let us examine what happens when we scale to an arbitrary number of qubits:", "It is not necessarily clear how one would determine U, generating an arbitrary final state S and whether this particular U is efficient. A natural question of automation arises: Is it possible to construct a model that takes an input output state pair and generates an efficient circuit facilitating this transition?", "Our subsequent research endeavoured to answer this question. Given the recent success of machine learning \u2014 revolutionising the fields of computer vision, robotics and many others \u2014 we sought to survey this space in order to examine possible paradigms and architectures that may have the ability to learn the structure of the computational landscape.", "It was soon apparent that such a problem could be cast similar to a video game. We have some initial state, a finite set of operations and a final state, we just don\u2019t know the best way to get there. With reinforcement learning claiming victories against domain experts in chess and Go it seemed natural to challenge physicists to find the path of least resistance in the generation of efficient quantum circuits.", "See Part II for our implementation.", "Your home for data science.
