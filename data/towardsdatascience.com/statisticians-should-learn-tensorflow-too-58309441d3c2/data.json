Specifically, TensorFlow Probability places an emphasis on Bayesian methods, which complements the PyMC3 library in Python that also implements Bayesian modelling and statistical analysis.", "I anticipate that this library will become increasingly important for statisticians going forward. With datasets growing ever larger, and a growing appreciation of the role of probability in time series analysis \u2014 TensorFlow Probability is quite effective at handling these two aspects.", "Before the onset of COVID-19, I had been running a side project on hotel cancellations. Part of the aim of this project was to run some time series models to predict the number of booking cancellations per week for a given hotel.", "However, a pure time series model has limitations in that it cannot account for the timing of extreme scenarios \u2014 i.e. a global pandemic which shuts down hotels and leads to a huge spike in cancellations. From this standpoint, models such as ARIMA or LSTM would still prove highly inaccurate if modelled on today\u2019s data.", "That said, what if the same data was modelled using TensorFlow Probability?", "When looking at this graph, we can see that while a line forecast is also given, the forecast is modelling on a posterior distribution to identify the range of outcomes. For instance, we can see that cancellations could potentially exceed 500 per week in an extreme scenario.", "This allows a hotel to ask \u2014 under what circumstances could a hotel see in excess of 500 cancellations per week \u2014 and what can be done to guard against this?", "TensorFlow Probability allows for uncertainty when it comes to making forecasts, and I anticipate this will be increasingly important going forward.", "As of TensorFlow version 2.0, Keras has become the default API for the library.", "Keras is used to generate deep neural networks quickly and intuitively. Such neural networks can be used for designing both classification and prediction tasks, as well as time series analysis with LSTM models.", "However, it is not necessarily well known that Keras is also capable of running in the R environment.", "This provides a powerful platform for combining fundamental statistical analysis with machine learning models.", "One example (as cited in the References section below) is using a Sequential model to predict blood glucose levels.", "The library comes with tools to visualise training and validation losses just as one can in Python:", "However, R users can also take advantage of the many statistical functions in R to facilitate the analysis. While libraries such as pyplot or seaborn in Python can also generate correlation plots for instance, this can easily be done using the corrplot library in R.", "In addition, R also comes with a handy library called MLMetrics that can easily calculate loss and accuracy metrics.", "From this standpoint, a statistician who wishes to avail of machine learning can easily use Keras to get the job done in R, as opposed to having to learn Python in order to avail of machine learning solutions.", "As of late, there is an increasing emphasis on making machine learning models interpretable. That is to say \u2014 making model output easily understood by humans.", "For example, DiCE from Microsoft\u2019s InterpretML library excels at this through generation of Diverse Counterfactual Explanations. For instance, suppose we are building a classification model to predict whether a customer will cancel their hotel booking based on different attributes, e.g. their country of origin, lead time, customer type, among other factors.", "In this example, DiCE has the ability to take instances where customers have not cancelled their booking, and generate counterexamples \u2014 i.e. a change in the feature parameters that would make it more likely that a customer would cancel their booking.", "When building a Sequential model using Keras, DiCE complements this by retaining the model training parameters \u2014 even if the data itself must be deleted after a certain period of time, e.g. due to data privacy regulations, etc.", "From that standpoint, machine learning is evolving to a point where the emphasis is on making results more intuitive and understandable \u2014 we have seen from this example that TensorFlow can complement other ML libraries very well in this endeavour.", "You may be a statistician, but can you say for certain that you will never need to build an algorithm across another discipline \u2014 e.g. Natural Language Processing or image classification?", "The beauty of learning TensorFlow and neural networks is that the model configurations can actually be quite similar across different domains.", "For instance, I was first introduced to the LSTM (long-short term memory) network through an NLP course. However, due to the sequential nature of this model (or the ability to understand dependencies between observations), I learned that the LSTM model can actually be quite effective when it comes to modelling volatile time series data. This model is not necessarily suitable in all cases \u2014 if a time series has a strong trend then more conventional models such as ARIMA tend to work better.", "However, I have found myself using LSTM for certain time series tasks, and therefore machine learning is still relevant to the time series discipline in this instance.", "As another example, learning how a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) can be used for classification tasks makes it easier to understand how to use the same network for image classification. In this way, understanding how TensorFlow neural networks operate can potentially open up knowledge of other disciplines as well.", "As someone who works with time series and statistical methods quite regularly, I have found TensorFlow to be very useful when using machine learning across these domains.", "I anticipate that as data loads grow ever larger \u2014 machine learning will increasingly be needed to process such information in a timely and efficient manner \u2014 while still allowing for an intuitive explanation of results.", "For these purposes, I\u2019m quite impressed with TensorFlow and it will continue to be a key reference in my data science toolkit.", "Disclaimer: This article is written on an \u201cas is\u201d basis and without warranty.
