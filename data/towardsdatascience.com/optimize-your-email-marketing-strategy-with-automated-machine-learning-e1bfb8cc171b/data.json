However, understanding the relationship between marketing budgets, actions and associated sales is challenging due to the many simultaneous and competing internal and external factors which influence sales (psychology, weather, mood, location, price, ads \u2026).", "Machine Learning techniques have shown promising results in this field due to their ability to map complex relationships on large datasets but their implementation is often a hurdle for marketers who lack the technical skills and background. On-boarding consultant Data Scientists is also expensive and inefficient as they lack the understanding of Marketing and the sector being marketed to in order to provide meaningful and actionable insights.", "At Mind Foundry, we believe that problem owners should be given simple yet reliable tools to build their own Data Science solutions which is why we have built AuDaS, an Automated Data Science team in box. In this article, we will see how marketers can use AuDaS to design their email marketing campaigns in order to increase their customer conversion and retention rates. We will use Corefactors.in\u2019s Data Set hosted on Kaggle. The 3 Email statuses we are trying to predict are \u201cignored\u201d, \u201cread\u201d and \u201cacknowledged\u201d based on the various attributes of the customers and the content of the email.", "After uploading the dataset into AuDaS, we are shown a snapshot of the data along with Machine Learning generated advice on how to clean and prepare it.", "For example, AuDaS has detected that the Email_ID column has no predictive power and can be dropped. It has also detected missing values in several columns and asks the user whether they wish to fill them in or remove them. By looking at the names of the columns we know that we can fill them in as follows:", "The Following images show how we can implement the advice in a couple of clicks.", "AuDaS automatically implements the advice for the user and simultaneously creates an audit trail of every single operation applied to the data at the bottom of the screen. The user can then go back to previous versions of the dataset and undo steps if necessary.", "AuDaS also automatically generates histograms and feature correlations to provide a high level overview of the data\u2019s structure to the user.", "For this Email Marketing data set we would like to predict the status of an email (ignored, read, acknowledged) based on the other attributes which means that we are trying to solve a classification problem.", "After specifying which column we are predicting (Email_Status), AuDaS provides a robust framework to build classification pipelines that can be generalised to other datasets without losing too much predictive power that is normally caused by overfitting. This involves:", "Advanced users can change these defaults to their preferred settings (N-fold, split, optimisable metric,\u2026).", "AuDaS will then use Mind Foundry\u2019s proprietary Bayesian Optimiser (OPTaaS) to efficiently navigate the millions of possible solutions to identify an optimal classification pipeline (feature engineering, model and optimal parameters) in less than 100 iterations.", "As it is performing this search, AuDaS provides full transparency to the user on the tested pipelines, models and parameter values as well as their associated performance statistics and feature relevance.", "For the specified classification model, the Word Count, Total past communications and Subject Hotness are the most relevant features for predicting the status of the email. The user also has access to a full audit trail of everything single model that AuDaS has tried.", "When the user is happy with model performance or has completed the 100 iterations, AuDaS will validate the model on the 10% balanced hold out and provide Model Health advice. In our case, the tests on the held-out data were consistent with the cross-validated tests during optimisation and the model health is good. This means that the user can be confident with the insights provided by the model and deploy it in production.", "The user can then upload a test set to predict Email Status outcomes, score the model or deploy it automatically via a RESTful API that can be integrated in to your product.", "AuDaS also provides the LIME explanations of the predictions which allow you to understand the contribution of each feature to the predicted outcome. A simple web app bellow shows how you might interact with the trained model:", "In our first run, our classification accuracy across all 3 classes was 51% which is better than random but not ideal. With our knowledge of the Email Status values 0, 1, 2 representing, ignored, opened and converted, to improve the performance of the model we can attempt to regroup 0 and 1 as their outcome is the same for the marketer. By regrouping the classes in the data preparation phase and retraining the model we are able to achieve a much better classification accuracy of 73.7% on the 10% hold out.", "A more complete tutorial can be viewed bellow:", "If you enjoyed this article and are curious to find out what else you can solve with AuDaS?
