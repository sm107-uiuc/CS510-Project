Created in 1996, it has withstood the test of time and is still one of the most useful approaches to clustering data points today. For fun, and to broaden my horizons, I took a stab brewing up my own DBSCAN class in python. If you are the type to skip to the end of the book, you can see my project in its entirety here.", "Clustering in DBSCAN is determined by categorizing data points into three types based on the relationship of a point to its neighboring points. The three types of points are Core points, Border points, and Noise points. A cluster is made by identifying a core point, determining if its neighboring points are core points or border points. A cluster is only expanded beyond a single point\u2019s neighborhood when the neighboring points are themselves, core points.", "Consider the above 2-dimensional points. Point A is an example of a core point. A core point, in this instance, is made when 4 total points are within a neighborhood. Point B and C are examples of border points. Border points may be in the neighborhood of a core point, but have fewer than 4 total points in their own neighborhood. Point N is an example of a noise point. It doesn\u2019t belong to a cluster or has enough points in its neighborhood.", "To fully understand a problem, I try to define a list of key concepts, write some loose pseudo code of the process, and spend a little time identifying time and space complexity.", "Minimum Sample \u2014 A user defined minimum number of points", "Epsilon \u2014 A user defined distance between two points", "Neighborhood \u2014 A space surrounding a central point, within epsilon distance.", "Core Point \u2014 A point that has a minimum sample of points, within it\u2019s neighborhood.", "Border Point \u2014 A point that belongs to at least one Core point\u2019s neighborhood, but does not have the minimum sample of points within its own neighborhood.", "Noise point \u2014 A point that neither belongs to a Core point\u2019s neighborhood nor has the minimum sample of points within its own neighborhood.", "Each point is being compared to every other point in our data set so I can expect O(n\u00b2) time complexity. Since I am only adding two new features per point, cluster and point type, our space complexity is O(2n) rounded to O(n).", "Clusters are made up of the neighborhoods of core points. So I know I need some modification of the nearest neighbors search function. Below is a snippet of my modified nearest neighbors search I settled on from my own class implementation.", "Distance is critical for figuring out the neighborhood of a point. Most datasets have more than 2 features that you may want to consider while clustering. Since I want to work with n-dimensional data points, I created a distance helper method to allow me the flexibility to work with multiple distance formulas. Working with the L2 norm opened up my neighborhood method from strictly being 2-dimensional to being fully n-dimensional.", "When starting with any new code, I like to set up a battery of unit tests to help define my user contracts. These can be modified as I identify any bad assumptions I made, but generally speaking, I define a test and leave it. This helps keep me consistent and ensures I\u2019m fulfilling my promises I make to the user.", "Though I can\u2019t predict every way a user might use my class, I can at least identify a few things I don\u2019t want a user to do. The first three tests are all about shaping usage. The first ensures that users don\u2019t instantiate my DBSCAN class with impossible or breaking values. The second test is to ensure that homogenous numerical data is the only data passed in. The third is to ensure that users don\u2019t attempt to call a method before data has been passed in. Lastly, the fourth test is a very basic functional test, making sure that any changes I make, don\u2019t break basic functionality.", "As I implement, I tend to grow my unit tests at the same time. You can see the full battery of unit tests I settled on here.", "With well-defined unit tests and pseudocode, this is arguably the fastest and easiest part. If there is a logical problem, as there was for my very first attempt, it becomes obvious through failed tests and large gaps in pseudocode. In my initial attempt, I was consistently over-writing clusters but I was able to figure it out quickly due to my initial groundwork and change directions before investing too much time. You can see a more in-depth writeup of my initial attempt, and its shortcomings here.", "At this point, all tests are passing, and my homebrewed DBSCAN is working as expected. For delivering on an MVP, that's good enough. But that is never quite enough for me, so I decided to compare it to a popular and commonly available library.", "Ouch, that's over 800 times slower than the commonly available library. It\u2019s tough to see that level of difference, much less admit it publicly. But after some research, it turns out my implementation is on par with other array indexing type implementations. There are a few additional techniques I can explore to improve the performance of my DBSCAN: spatial indexing and bulk neighborhood calculations. Sounds like a good topic for a follow-up article.", "My full implementation can be found on my Github. Want to chat about it? Connect with me on Linkedin.", "Your home for data science.
