In fact, there are just a few things we certainly know due to life\u2019s unpredictability. Unfortunately, uncertainty is naturally given and there is nothing we can do about it.", "But even if we cannot predict the future, we can still speculate about it, if we had a way to measure all the possible outcomes of an event and how likely they are to occur, then we could prepare ourselves better for that specific affair. These topics will be the leitmotiv of this first part.", "So now the important question is, will I have to take a nap today or not?", "Well, it turns out that I have been asking myself this question for a while, so I spent some time taking notes about the time I wake up every day:", "In this table we can see how many times I\u2019ve woken up at a certain time, except for 07:00 (means before 07:30) and 09:00 (after 08:30, if this happens I\u2019ll be late). We can see that in 150 days I\u2019ve just been late 3 of them!", "But then, how likely is it that I\u2019ll be late tomorrow?", "If\u00a0we\u00a0aimed\u00a0to\u00a0anticipate\u00a0the\u00a0future we would need to express the reality in way we can work with it, in a quantitative way. The mathematization of a random event (whose outcome is uncertain) is known as a probabilistic model.", "To be able to model a situation properly we will need to describe the possible outcomes (Late-On Time, all the possibilities make up the so called Sample Space) and specify a probability law. A probability law (or probability function) defines how likely is it to have a certain outcome for all the possible outcomes.", "This is achieved by associating a probability to every possible event (Late or On Time in this case). Probability can be interpreted in this case as a numerical value assigned to a certain event A that describes our beliefs, how likely do we think this event A can occur, but be careful! Just because we call it a belief doesn\u2019t mean it is subjective.", "Usually this belief is based on previous knowledge and due to this fact we could also define the probability of an event as its long-run relative frequency (how many times is it expected to obtain this event A proportionally to the number of experiments when it is very large).", "Although this interpretation is theoretically correct, the problem with this definition is that it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense in some cases like elections. In this case we cannot suppose that the candidates will be running for elections forever, hence we cannot say what will be its long-run relative frequency.", "The first step to create our own model is to define a sample space, what are the different possible outcomes when tomorrow morning I get to the office? Well, I can be either Late or On Time, so we can define a set containing those possible outcomes, this is the so-known sample space, often expressed with the capital Greek letter omega:", "In this case the sample space is trivial, but sometimes it can be a bugger to define. Think about tossing a coin twice, we could guess that we can have three outputs, two heads, head and tail or two tails. This is correct, but if we are talking about probability we have to think out of the box and step by step, taking into consideration every small detail and the nature of our experiment, in this case, tossing a coin twice will have four possible outcomes:", "A sample space must always be:", "In this case if we assumed that H means \u201chaving at least 1 head\u201d and T means \u201c having at least one tail\u201d our sample space wouldn\u2019t be correct, we might have some HT or TH and it wouldn\u2019t fulfil the first must, this sample space would not be mutually exclusive.", "This new sample space wouldn\u2019t collapse, but it is just not enough. With it we could obtain HH, HT and TH, but we are not covering the TT case. This sample space is not collectively exhaustive.", "Imagine now that the R means \u201cRainy day\u201d and S means \u201cSunny day\u201d, with this sample space we do cover all the possible outcomes of our experiment and it doesn\u2019t have any conflict, but the information we are adding is irrelevant and unnecessary (unless we wanted to know if weather can change the behaviour of coins). This sample space is not rightly granulated.", "As we already mentioned before, we can use our data to create a probability law. In this case we will infer it from the number of times an event A occurs divided by the number of times that we did the experiment (all the data we have for all the elements S that define our sample space) assuming that my future behaviour (in this case) won\u2019t be extremely different.", "We know then that the probability of being late will be the number of times I have been late divided by the total:", "Now we get it! Assuming my behaviour won\u2019t change much, I\u2019ll be arriving late around 2% of the times, 1 out of 50 days. Don\u2019t really know if my boss will really appreciate that\u2026", "We will not always have the same probability law, in the Late / On time case the formula works fine and we could infer some future behaviour, but it might not be the case for other situations.", "Imagine that you\u2019re throwing darts with some friends in a bar. What\u2019s the probability that your dart hits the centre for the first time? We have no previous data to predict whether or not you will miss, and even if we had we could just predict whether or not you could hit the centre (or other defined area) or not (as we would be taking notes of whether it was in or out).", "Instead, it is more accurate to assume that the probability that you hit any defined place B (let\u2019s say the centre) is equal to its area divided by the target area, which in this case would be sample space.", "This case can be somewhat difficult to understand without a previous knowledge of algebra, but don\u2019t worry as it is just an example to illustrate that defining a probability law is not just our long-run expectations.", "The sample space of this problem would be defined by any point of the target that is within the radius from the centre of the target. We can express the probability of having a dart hitting a defined space B is equal to its area (A) divided by the area of the sample space:", "In this first part, we have seen some examples of what probabilistic models are, how do they work and what defines them. We have also seen the tool that will help us work with the likelihood of the events within an experiment a mathematical way, probability, as well as the properties of an appropriated sample space.", "In the next part, we will talk about the basis on which the theory of probability is built, the probability axioms. We will also work with Venn Diagrams to dive into the set theory to understand better this uncertain world.", "Your home for data science.
