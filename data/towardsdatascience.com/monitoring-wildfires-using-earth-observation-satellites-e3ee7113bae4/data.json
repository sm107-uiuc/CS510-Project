In India, a significant majority (>90%) of wildfires originate from human activity such as timber harvesting, land conversion, slash-and-burn agriculture and socio-economic conflicts over land-use and property rights (Roy, 2003). However, in recent years extended conditions of drought, overexploitation for commercial purpose and conversion for other land-use has led to a considerable increase in wildfire size, frequency and associated environmental impacts. The losses reported by the government authorities are often underestimated. They are derived from the ground survey studies and field observations made by the Forest Survey of India (FSI). Due to the absence of quality statistical data on forest fire size, and total affected area, the extent of destruction caused by forest fires cannot be accurately estimated. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have made it possible to overcome such limitations in a cost-effective and timely manner by providing deep-level insights about the dynamics of response in forest ecosystems. Thus, our ability to detect, monitor, assess and predict fires at a global, regional and local scale has significantly improved.", "In February 2019, massive wildfires broke out in the Bandipur National Park gutting thousands of acres of forest land in the region (figure 1). The first instance of wildfire was reported on 21st February in the Kundakere range of the park, which then spread rapidly to nearby ranges due to strong winds. Reports suggest that the five-day-long wildfire was sparked by humans living in the vicinity of the national park. The preceding dry monsoon spell left plenty of flammable material in the under-story of the forest ranges. While wildfires are not uncommon in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and national park, the undergrowth which is mainly made of Lantana Camara, an invasive weed species, might have played a role in worsening the intensity and speed of fires.", "The Indian Space Research Organization reported the total burnt area to be 10,920 hectares. However, reports [1] have claimed that officials misreported the estimates to downplay the damage by the fires. For an accurate damage assessment of the 2019 Bandipur wildfires, earth observation satellites can provide valuable insight with regards to the extent and severity of the fires. This article reports on three key aspects \u2014 a) identification of fire-affected areas, b) classification of burn severity, and c) estimation of the total fire-affected area using Sentinel 2 multispectral satellite data.", "The energy dissipated by features located on the Earth\u2019s surface has unique characteristics. These spectral signatures allow us to examine a wide variety of terrestrial processes. Optical remote sensing tools utilize the visible and infrared sensors located on high-resolution earth observation satellites for studying forest fires. The near-infrared, mid-infrared and thermal bands are susceptible to changes in vegetation health. They are frequently used for an accurate evaluation of fire-affected areas and burn severity to support forest management activities. Green, healthy vegetation reflects radiation in the near-infrared (NIR) region. It absorbs red light in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Meanwhile, burn-affected areas expend more energy in the visible and shortwave infrared (SWIR) region while absorbing energy in the NIR region (figure 2).", "Normalized burn ratio (NBR) is the index that is used to measure burn severity by distinguishing areas that have been significantly altered in their spectral signature after a wildfire event. It is calculated using the energy intensity from the NIR and SWIR wavelength bands from the remotely sensed satellite imagery. The formula for NBR is similar to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is based on the intensity of light coming from NIR and red wavelength bands. NBR uses the ratio between NIR and SWIR bands. High NBR values reflect areas covered with healthy vegetation, whereas low values indicate bare ground and recently burned areas. Near-zero values represent areas that are not affected by the fire event.", "NBR for Sentinel 2 data is calculated as:", "Burn severity is a term used to represent the degree to which an ecosystem is impacted by a wildfire event. It is estimated as the difference between pre-fire and post-fire NBR derived from satellite images. To identify recently burned areas and differentiate them from bare soil and other non-vegetated areas, the difference between pre-fire and post-fire NBR, also known as the delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR) index is frequently used. Areas with high dNBR value correspond to a higher degree of damage or burn severity. In contrast, low dNBR values represent areas that are unaffected from the fire event or regions that have rebounded via regrowth of plant species following a wildfire incident.", "To monitor the fires, two satellite images of the same area , i.e., the region of interest are required. The image acquired closest in time to the fire event is termed the master image and the one most recently after as the slave image. By computing the NBR for the master image and subsequent slave images, the impact of fires can be analyzed [2]. Based on the difference between the master NBR image and slave NBR image (dNBR), the total burned area of the fire event can be determined, and areas impacted heavily by the fires can be delineated. Each subsequent slave image can be used to create a post-fire map at different points in time from the first fire map (master) and monitor the recovery progress by examining the response of the forest vegetation.", "Sentinel-2 is an earth observation satellite mission that has wide-ranging applications for studying the terrestrial environment. It consists of two satellites equipped with a state-of-the-art Multispectral Imager (MSI) that provides high-resolution optical imagery via 13 spectral bands at a global scale with a high revisit frequency rendering it a vital data source for land use land cover monitoring, atmospheric correction and cloud/snow separation (ESA). The Sentinel 2 Level 2B (L2B) data used in this analysis has been acquired from the Copernicus Open Access Hub. For developing the post-fire assessment map, two images obtained 10-days apart on 18 February 2019, i.e., master and 28 February 2019, i.e., slave are used (figure 3). The two satellite images have been pre-processed using the SNAP Desktop GUI which is developed on top of the SNAP Engine and is based on the NetBeans Platform. Developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), SNAP is a common software platform used for the scientific exploitation of the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 missions. The project page of SNAP and the individual toolboxes can be found at http://step.esa.int.", "Atmospheric correction is an important pre-processing step for determining true surface or Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance values. It is especially important when the analysis involves comparing satellite data at two different times for the same area. All Sentinel 2 L2 products available since April 2017 have had atmospheric correction already applied to them. The L2B product contains vector cloud and cirrus masks, which are created as a product of the atmospheric correction, however, applying the mask on all bands and the full scene is time-consuming. We, therefore, subset the product, but the vector products are lost by that operation. So, in our case, to preserve the information, a new band containing the cloud mask must be created. This is currently not possible to do using a batch processing method, so we need to add the cloud mask band to each product separately before using the GraphBuilder tool for pre-processing.", "Processing the data one by one would be very time consuming and inconvenient. We can use the Batch Processing tool available in SNAP to process all images at the same time. To use the tool, we first need to define the process we want to apply and all its steps. We can do this using the GraphBuilder tool. Another advantage of batch processing in GraphBuilder is that only the final product is physically saved, saving valuable disk space. A brief summary of the pre-processing workflow (figure 4) in GraphBuilder GUI is outlined below.", "Once both pre-fire and post-fire images have been pre-processed, we merge them to form a new product containing pre- and post-fire NBR bands. This task of juxtaposing the two spatially overlapping images using the Collocation Tool in SNAP allows us later to easily calculate the change in the pre- and post-fire NBR values. Before the change can be detected, however, we need to mask out the water bodies and clouds from the newly created image.", "NBR can be a robust measure for delineating burned areas. However, the index is sensitive to water bodies, and this can cause misclassification of image pixels. Lakes and rivers can show similar differences in NBR values in some cases and lead to false positives scenarios [3], i.e., pixels being classified as burned when they are actually not. It is, therefore, necessary to mask out pixels that represent water bodies, which can be detected using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). For this purpose, we will create a single combined water and cloud mask. The NDWI is designed to maximize the reflectance of the water body in the green band and minimize the reflectance of a water body in the NIR band [McFeeters, 1996].", "McFeeters NDWI for Sentinel 2 data is calculated as:", "At this point, we should have two NBR bands each corresponding to the pre-fire (Feb 18) and post-fire date (Feb 28). To identify recently burned areas, dNBR can be calculated by differencing the post-fire NBR from the pre-fire NBR. However, dNBR is an absolute measure of change, which can lead to issues in areas with low pre-fire vegetation cover, where the difference will be insignificant. To avoid such problems, we use the relativized burn ratio (RBR):", "RBR is calculated by making a small adjustment to the pre-fire NBR in order to avoid the equation to ever reaching infinity and fail (Parks et al., 2014). Once RBR has been calculated, we can use BandMaths tool to identify recently burned areas by creating a new band that will only contain pixels that have RBR values above a specified threshold. We can visualize the change in RBR values, which as we have established is the measure used for burn area assessment, by plotting the RBR band using either a GIS software like QGIS. Here, I have used Python to plot a map of RBR values (figure 5) using a suitable colormap and scale based on the range within which the RBR values lie. A histogram plot is a quick way to assess the range in which most of the RBR values lie. For our dataset, the RBR values lie mostly between -0.25 and 0.6, so I have used a range from -0.75 and 0.75 to create the change detection map.", "The second objective is to classify the areas that are burned based on the magnitude of change in RBR values between the pre-fire and post-fire period. Classification of burn severity can serve as an essential tool in aiding emergency efforts and assessing post-fire rehabilitation development. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has proposed a classification table to interpret the burn severity, which can be seen in the table below.", "In our data, the lowest value is -1.5, representing pixels that are not part of the forest ecosystem and correspond to other land use types such as built-up areas or cultivated farms. Some areas of the forest have RBR values that correspond to vegetative regrowth. Majority of the pixels in the dataset have a value close to 0 (mean value is 0.06) which corresponds to unburned areas. The burn scar showing fire-affected areas is clearly visible (figure 6) and is demonstrated by pixels with RBR values above 0.1. Within the affected area, quite a large number of pixels have been classified to a low severity burn zone. This might be caused by the time difference between two images. This time of the year is relatively dry, and some vegetation might have degraded, leading to magnitude of change in RBR values similar to a low severity burn.", "In our analysis, the RBR band can be further processed to create a new band that contains pixels corresponding to a low severity burn or greater (figure 7). Based on this threshold, the total burned area can be calculated as simply the area occupied by the all of the pixels multiplied by the resolution in the horizontal (longitude) and vertical (latitude) axes. To calculate the total burned area in our study region, we use the following formula:", "The total burned area estimated from the Sentinel 2-derived RBR between 18th February and 28th February, 2019 is 17, 501 acres or approximately 71 sq. km. The area estimated here is considerably higher than the one reported by ISRO. It compares reasonably well with estimates made by other independent authorities and research bodies [4, 5, 6].", "Wildfires can wreak havoc in a forest ecosystem. Satellites provide a cost-effective method of monitoring large-scale fires. In recent years, increased availability of mid- to high spatial resolution data optical satellite data from earth observation remote sensing missions have allowed researchers and fire management officials to carry out a detailed post-fire assessment. This article showcases the utility of normalized burn ratio (NBR) as a useful index for delineating fire-affected areas and burn area assessment using data from the Sentinel 2 mission. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS techniques can provide vital insight into the impact of wildfires on forest ecosystems. This has important implications for effective monitoring, planning and potential prevention management of large-scale forest fires worldwide.", "The pre-processing and image acquisition techniques used in this analysis have been adapted from the RUS Copernicus (https://rus-copernicus.eu/portal/) Training material (Code: HAZA02).", "Your home for data science.
