With \u201conly\u201d a 1\u20130 lead the leading team still knows that the opponents are only one goal away from tying the game and then potentially gaining the psychological edge. Hence the leading team is still on guard and protects the lead more efficiently. But a 2\u20130 lead seems pretty comfortable: even if the opponents score you\u2019re still ahead. That\u2019s why, the theory suggests, the team that holds the 2\u20130 lead are more prone than ever to be scored upon (again and again) and eventually lose the game.", "Is there any statistical merit to the theory?", "I used this Kaggle dataset \u2014 that includes detailed events from 9K games played in England, Germany, France, Italy and Spain\u2019s domestic leagues in the seasons 2012 up to 2017 \u2014 to try and add some data perspective to the popular theory.", "For each game in the dataset I got every goal scored and the side that scored it (home or away). I then generated every scoreline each game produced. For example, if a game ended 2\u20131, the scorelines that game produced might have been 1\u20130, then 2\u20130 and then 2\u20131. In the end of this process, there were 57 unique scorelines. Note that the scoreline 2\u20131 is different than the scoreline 1\u20132.", "I then subtracted the two numbers that comprise the scoreline to generate the lead. A positive lead indicates that the home team is winning (e.g., scoreline is 2\u20131, lead of 1 goal) and a negative lead indicates that the away team is winning (e.g., 1\u20132, lead of -1 goal). In order to be able to analyze positive and negative leads together, I compared the lead with the final result and assigned a \u201cwin/draw/lose\u201d from the perspective of the leading team. So if the scoreline at some point is 2\u20131 and the home team eventually won that\u2019s a \u2018win\u2019 for the leading team, if the away team won that would be a \u2018lose\u2019 for the leading team.", "An important note for the above methodology is that the same game can contribute multiple observations to our dataset, one for each distinct scoreline. As an illustrative example, if a team is leading 1\u20130 at one point of the game, then 2\u20130 and finally 2\u20131 at another point that contributes two observations of 1-goal lead and one observation of a 2-goal lead where the home team won.", "Finally, note that this methodology considers every possible scoreline within each game except draws.", "Here\u2019s the distribution of results for the leading team as a function of how big the lead is.", "Contrary to what the theory suggests (but probably not surprisingly) we see that the higher your lead is the higher your chances of winning the game! Teams that have a 2-goal lead are 94% likely to win the game compared to \u201conly\u201d 72% likelihood of winning the game with a 1-goal lead. Having a 3-goal lead pretty much guarantees winning the game (99.1% probability). There is only one instance of a team leading by 3 goals and losing the game: A game between Lecce and Milan in the 2011\u20132012 season for the Italian \u201cSerie A\u201d league, where Lecce was leading 3\u20130 at halftime but Milan came back and won the game 3\u20134.", "To get an understanding of the sample size of each bar in Figure 1 here\u2019s how many times each lead was observed. Note that the same lead can be observed multiple times in the same game.", "We can go one level deeper in our analysis and break down the probability distribution of results depending on the lead for the home and away team, i.e., compare the probability of winning the game when you\u2019re leading the game by 2 goals as the home team and the away team.", "Again, we see that the larger the lead the more likely you are to win the game both as the home as well as the away team. We also notice that the chances of winning the game are slimmer if you\u2019re the away team compared to a home team with the same lead. This makes sense if we consider that the home team has their fans\u2019 backing and hence might be more likely to make a comeback than an away team. A home team with a 1-goal lead is 76% likely to win the game whereas an away team with the same lead is 66% likely to win the game. The probabilities of winning the game with a 2-goal lead are 95% for the home team and 91% for the away. With a 3-goal lead the probabilities of victory are 99% and 98.5%.", "There is no recorded draw or loss for a team leading by 4 goals.", "OK, so no matter how we look at it, a 2\u2013goal lead is much safer than a 1\u2013goal lead, but can the theory that \u201ca 2\u20130 lead is the most dangerous lead\u201d get any statistical backing if we truly only consider 2\u20130 (or 0\u20132) scorelines and compare them to 1\u20130 (or 0\u20131) scorelines?", "A team is substantially more likely to win the game if they are 2\u20130 ahead compared to if they are \u201cjust\u201d 1\u20130 ahead. They are also virtually guaranteed to win the game if they are 3\u20130 up (Although, I\u2019m sure 2005 Champions League final Milan will beg to differ).", "So a statistical analysis of about 9K games across some of Europe\u2019s biggest leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) revealed no merit to the theory that a 2\u20130 lead is the most dangerous lead. The data suggest that the larger the lead the safer the team is.", "Can the theory find any support in other sports? Or maybe electronic soccer (PES and FIFA)?", "You can find the jupyter notebook with all the analysis here.", "Your home for data science.
