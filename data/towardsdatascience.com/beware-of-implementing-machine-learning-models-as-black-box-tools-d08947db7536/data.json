We shall consider a case study by using the cruise ship dataset cruise_ship_info.csv to build a model for recommending crew size.", "Now, suppose we want to build a model on a given feature space for predicting a target variable y.

We, therefore, were able to reduce the dimension of our feature space from 6 to 4.", "Suppose now that we want to build a linear regression model for predicting the \u201ccrew\u201d variable using the 4 predictor variables: \u201ctonnage\u201d, \u201cpassengers\u201d, \u201clength, and \u201ccabins\u201d.", "We would like our model to performs 3 important tasks on the input dataset:", "(1) Feature scaling using the StandardScaler() transformer;", "(2) Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction using the PCA() transformer; and", "(3) Model building using the LinearRegression() estimator.", "We can see that Python\u2019s sklearn package is well equipped to carry out most of the tasks for us. For instance we can combine the above 3 procedures into a single pipeline as follows:", "Before implementing the model, the user has to make sure they understand all the details of how the back end of the algorithm works. So for instance, you need to ask yourself the following questions:", "To build a machine learning model, the user will have to interact with the back end of the machine learning model by feeding data into the model. So as a user, you need to import your dataset, prepare the dataset, and then partition it into train and testing sets. .", "Now that you\u2019ve understood the details of how the back end of the machine learning model works, and you\u2019ve prepared your dataset, it\u2019s time to feed the data into the machine learning model. We would like to train, test, and evaluate our model using k-fold cross-validation. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is randomly partitioned into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. The process is repeated k-times. The average training and testing scores are then calculated by averaging over the k-folds.", "Here is the k-fold cross-validation pseudocode:", "Our model can then be implemented using the code below:", "In summary, we\u2019ve discussed the back end of a machine learning algorithm and why it is important that the user understands in all details how the back end works. Thanks to machine learning packages such as sci-kit learn, TensorFlow, PyTouch, Keras, and Caret, everyone with some basic understanding of data science and machine learning can build a predictive model. However, using any machine learning model as a black box without fully understanding the intricacies of the model will lead to a falsified model.", "Your home for data science.
