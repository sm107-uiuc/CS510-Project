How we deploy it, and with what intention, makes all the difference to the impact it has. Artificial intelligence (AI) is no exception.", "Netflix\u2019s recent documentary, The Social Dilemma dives into how commercial interests who profit from controlling our attention and altering our behaviour are exploiting technology, especially AI, to control us.", "While the potential for misuse is not a unique feature of AI, there are some unique reasons why AI models pose a more severe threat. As both a professional in the industry and its \u2018user\u2019, I have observed that opacity of models which power AI is a crucial risk we are taking.", "At the Deep Learning Summer School at the University of Toronto last year, I learnt that most AI models use machine learning, deep learning or reinforcement learning methods. Machine learning methods are based on advanced statistical modelling and are used for making better predictions. Deep learning and reinforcement learning use neural networks. Neural networks are multi-layer algorithms which mimic the decision-making structure in our brains. While not as sophisticated as the biological neural networks, these networks provide fairly real and detailed models of the process.", "The problem with both advanced statistical methods as well as neural networks is that the more complicated the decision making, the less clarity they can provide on how the model arrives at a particular result. It is nearly impossible to figure out which one or two of the several inputs fed to the model at the beginning drive these results. This is because most such analyses are observing new patterns and creating new insights.", "Scientific studies, especially in business and economics research, until this point started with an intuitive understanding of the way the world works and then used data to corroborate or dispute it. AI modeling operates on a different philosophy. We use big datasets to train algorithms and then expect such trained models to look at other large datasets for new insights about the way the world works. Such insights are valuable because they expand our knowledge of the world we inhabit through bringing to light patterns and relationships that we could not have discerned with the naked eye or pure logical thinking. Unfortunately, this is not equivalent to developing a better understanding of the world. These models and the insights they produce do not necessarily augment our understanding of why these patterns exist and what drives them. These models are opaque.", "There is an undeniable trade-off between the complexity of tasks these technologies address and the level of explainability of the methods. The more complex the application, the more difficult to explain how the model decides. The researcher, of course, has some control on the weights given to various features(variables) and the way these are combined to represent interactions. Yet, once the model is tuned into place, it does the magic, not all of which can be dissected back to which features mattered the most, in what way and why.", "In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007, I had the opportunity to work with a few different reserve banks. What scared us about the opacity of financial risk models is the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of policy measures taken based on results of such models. The models and their recommendations were far too complex to make sense of.", "Similarly, it is impossible to predict all the consequences of an action or policy designed based on black-box type AI (or in the earlier context, financial engineering models).", "The opacity of models was at the root of the very complexity that led to the financial crisis without anyone noticing. Just as complicated financial engineering models used to structure financial products obfuscated the actual risk of these products, black-box AI could be hiding critical interconnections that might unravel the entire system. A tiny but crucial malfunctioning nut can bring down a large but interconnected system \u2014 that is the economics of complexity, and it applies just as much to a technology-backed decision-making system as to the banking system with interlinked risks.", "In the last few years, there has been a tremendous push towards making AI explainable, removing model bias, and establishing ethics and principles for the ethical use of machine learning and AI.", "Explainable AI has become an indispensable part of the agenda for large technology companies such as Google, Tesla, Microsoft and many others who use AI for their mainstream business. It makes complete business sense to focus on it. Not only is it difficult to convince senior executives to take action based on the recommendations of a black-box software, but it is also nearly impossible to convince policy watchdogs of the safety of such AI. So, explainable AI has become a necessity.", "Slowly but surely, research on scientific methods of making AI models safer is also underway in universities and think tanks. Think Tanks such as OpenAI and Future of Humanity Institute are driving research and alignment on which methods could make AI models inherently safer, even those that cannot be completely explained. Others such as the Vector Institute in Toronto, and the Alan Turing Institute in the UK, are working on the policy dialogue around the safe use of AI models. For example, Ryan Carey, a Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford has leveraged his background as a medical doctor and is applying economic theories around agents\u2019 incentives to help create safer AI.", "As we make progress, we must remember that in these early decades of AI, the choices we make and do not make will have multiplier effects on the way AI and a world powered by AI functions.", "The lure of complex models is tremendous, yet, the only way for AI to have any meaningful impact is by embracing simplicity. We must insist on developing an intuitive understanding of what AI can do. We need to build models which not only churn out answers by swallowing large datasets but also help us advance our understanding of mechanisms by which our world works.", "Your home for data science.
