In addition to making predictions of the sale price of a home, we were asked to select another question to answer.", "The question I chose to answer was: What practical changes can be made to a home someone already owns to increase its quality? (If you\u2019re interested, the presentation can be found here.)", "During my presentation, I shared a heat map correlating factors to the overall quality of the home. Of those factors, I focused on the following binary variables:", "For each of these factors, I looked at the average quality of homes with and without these factors to understand their impact.", "Along with this heatmap, I also presented the following violin plots:", "The above plots show the distribution in quality scores of homes with and without a recent remodel (left), an attached garage (middle) or a paved driveway (right). On of the key takeaways of these plots was that to improve quality, the best feature to change was driveway type, followed by garage type, followed by recent remodel.", "One of my classmates noted that the variables most correlated to overall quality had the least impact on the change in overall quality and asked me why this was the case. At the time, I had no idea, so I decided to dig deeper\u2026", "If you\u2019re reading a statistics blog, you probably don\u2019t need me to tell you how the difference between two mean values is calculated. But just as a refresher\u2026", "The correlation between a feature and overall quality are calculated a lot differently. When you run the .corr() function on a pandas DataFrame (as I did), the default method is to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient (\u03c1).", "The equation for calculating the pearson correlation coefficient is:", "where E is the expected value or long run average of the input value.", "More intuitively \u2014correlation is telling you how well you can fit a line to the pair of variables. A score of 1 means you can perfectly fit a line with a positive slope, 0 means you can not fit a line at all, and -1 means you can perfectly fit a line with a negative slope.", "Let\u2019s take a look at three data sets with 6 samples each(a feature score of 1 indicates the home has the feature, a score of 0 means it does not have the feature):", "In each of these data sets, the difference in mean quality value is 2.67 and the quality is on the same scale \u2014 this is why the slope of the best fit lines (shown in red) are the same for the three graphs.", "However, the correlation scores vary significantly. The data set to the left can be nearly perfectly fit to a line while the data set to the right is not represented by its best fit line at all.", "To show more dramatically how correlation actually gives no information regarding the impact on quality of having a feature, let\u2019s look at two more data sets:", "In all of the above plots, the value of the correlation score is based entirely on how well the red best fit line represents the black scatterplot points whereas the difference in means is based on the slope of the red best fit line.", "The only way that the slope of the best fit line relates to the correlation score is that its sign is positive for a positive slope and its sign is negative for a negative slope. (All plots above have a positive slope which is why the correlation scores are all between 0 and 1.)", "Correlation scores can be a great tool when you are looking for values that are linearly related (for example: when you\u2019re creating a linear regression model). However, it should be clear that the score they are giving you is NOT how much a change in one variable impacts the other variable. To put it more simply, the colloquial definition of correlation (a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things) is not always what is being represented by the statistical correlation score.", "When you are doing exploratory data analysis, you should be sure to look at other metrics to understand how variables impact one another (for example, the slope of the best fit line).", "Your home for data science.
