I was still surprised to see the topic surface in an article by Lianne and Justin here in Towards Data Science. Reading that article inspired me to look at building a better prediction for the match.", "Using code shared on www.fightprior.com, I scraped MMA match histories for McGregor, Cerrone, and their opponents from Sherdog.com to get results for 15,000 matches.", "Even a casual fan knows \u2018styles make fights.\u2019 The Sherdog data shows how fights were decided but little information about how the fighters worked their way to wins and losses. What can we do to represent styles? Enter the Fox Sports UFC stats page.", "The counts of reversals (REV), submissions (SUB), takedowns (TD), and strikes (STR) are a way to quantify a fighters style. But there are two problems with this data: the table only has data for 139 fighters in the collected match history and only has current lifetime statistics.", "For example, Sherdog reports Conor\u2019s first match was a win over Gary Morris (Mar 2008) by TKO via strikes. But going into that fight Conor had (presumably) 0 strikes in his career history. To properly estimate the impact of model of strike totals on the probability of a win we\u2019d want those stats to be zero for that first match, and then for McGregor\u2019s second match, we\u2019d want the strikes from the first match included. Instead, we only have lifetime total strikes as of January 2020.", "Using the lifetime totals to build a model creates leakage from the future in record for old matches. The consequences are severe: the predictive success of the model may be overstated and the true relationship (if any) between these stats chance of success is not shown in the data.", "So, in real life, this data isn\u2019t fit for use. But for a prediction made with no downside for being wrong, it might be interesting to see how it performs.", "Lianne and Justin\u2019s article reports on a modified Elo rating process and estimates a probability of 82% that McGregor wins. Our first order of business is to verify that result with our smaller dataset.", "The PlayerRatings package contains multiple Elo ratings variations. To capture the complete evolution of ratings over time requires a loop, like so:", "The results are directionally in line with Lianne and Justin\u2019s work, showing McGregor\u2019s rating overtaking Cerrone\u2019s in 2013. The final ratings are McGregor at 2,550 and Cerrone at 2,451 implying McGregor\u2019s probability of winning is 64%.", "How good a prediction is that? We can take the pre-match ratings from the entire history and see how often they correctly predicted the match results. The code below generates the appropriate rating columns and merges in the career stats from Fox Sports to create the final analysis table.", "That establishes the baseline performance of correct predictions about 55% of the time. For the enhanced model, we\u2019ll use a logistic GAM via the package mgcv. The R code is straightforward:", "The gratia package\u2019s draw() function produces ggplot2 charts of the smooths from the GAM.", "Interestingly, the difference in ratings (diffRate) gives a linear relationship . . . presumably, the logistic link takes care of the nonlinearities for this driver. The difference in knockdowns (KDdiff) shows a very complex relationship to outcome that is directionally appropriate. The bivariate smooth on each fighter\u2019s wins shows that if each fighter enters the ring with similar win counts there is little impact on a fight\u2019s outcome.", "On the training sample this model correctly predicts matches 62% of the time. And does even better on holdout with a 63% accuracy, which is a 15% improvement over Elo ratings alone.", "That\u2019s somewhat disappointing even before acknowledging it\u2019s probably better than reality because of the use of lifetime stats for each fighter.", "With all of that done, we can assemble the data representing the McGregor-Cerrone match and learn that the GAM still favors \u201cNotorious\u201d (probability of McGregor win is 62%). That\u2019s two models on different data using different methods showing McGregor is likely to win. Looking for a third prediction, let\u2019s consider the published betting odds.", "The current betting line (as of 13 Jan 2020) is -325 on McGregor. Converting that to odds and then to probability, this is equivalent to predicting a McGregor win at ~75%.", "I\u2019m surprised that these odds are so favorable to \u2018Notorious\u2019. With McGregor having been out of the ring for an extended period of time (since Oct 2018) , Cerrone being active (although coming off of a two-fight losing streak) and the fight at a heavier weight (Cerrone is the larger of the two), I think \u2018Cowboy\u2019 has a solid chance at a win. Given the issues with the data feeding the GAM and the lack of performance shown by the Elo ratings I find both of those models unconvincing. And I believe the betting line has been swayed by McGregor\u2019s over representation in the press.", "Your home for data science.
