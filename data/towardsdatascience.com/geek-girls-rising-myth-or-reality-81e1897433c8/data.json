The survey that is in its third year now aims to offer a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The challenge is open to all and the notebook that tells a unique and creative story about the data science community wins a prize. The challenge description says -: \u201cThe challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners.\u201d", "This was an excellent opportunity for me to participate in the challenge and explore the dataset w.r.t women\u2019s participation in the survey, worldwide. The objective of the notebook was to analyze the survey data to answer an important question: is the women participation in STEM really improving, or is it just a hype? I employed my analytical skills to investigate whether things seem to be improving, or is there still much left to be done.", "I also won the best notebook award for all notebooks published prior to November 19th,2019.", "This article is a summary of the results and insights that I obtained while analyzing the dataset. You can view the original Kaggle notebook here.", "I analyzed the female participation in the survey under six different categories, namely:", "Analyzing women representation under these different categories gave me a fair idea of the nature of women\u2019s representation is the ML and DS realm.", "I began by analyzing the 2019 survey\u2019s dataset to get a big-picture.", "Note that if a country or territory received less than 50 respondents, they have been grouped into a group named \u201cOther\u201d for anonymity.", "Let\u2019s now see the insights obtained from the analysis of the six key areas \u2014 Gender, Country, Age, Education, Professional Experience, and Salary.", "The gender distribution in 2019 as compared to the last two years.", "Let us now look at the countries from where the female respondents come. The data will help us know the countries of maximum as well as minimum responses.", "Since India and the U.S had the maximum percentage of respondents, I also analyzed the data to find out if a similar trend was observed in the last couple of years too.", "Age is an important attribute for any demographic analysis, and some interesting results were obtained on analyzing the age variable.", "The age distribution of the female respondents in 2019.", "It has been rightly said that educated females form the backbone of society. Here is the analysis of the qualification status of the female respondents.", "Let\u2019s look at the various professional roles that females occupy in the industry.", "I combined some of the roles to create broader groups. For instance, Data Engineer and DBA/Database Engineer were clubbed together as was Data Analyst and Business Analyst.", "Even though some researches say otherwise, salary is a significant motivational factor in retaining and acquiring new talent. Let\u2019s see how well our ladies are paid in the Data Science space. I analyzed the general trend of the salary of female respondents in 2019 and then compared the trend with 2018 wages.", "To see if this pattern of salaries was exclusive to 2019 or was it a recurring phenomenon, I compared it with the 2018 Salary range. I did not include the 2017 salary data since it had more than ten different currencies.", "Some of the significant takeaways from this entire exercise can be summed up in six key points:", "So let\u2019s get back to the initial question \u2014 are the Geek Girls Rising? It\u2019s a mixed feeling. Some areas have shown improvement while a lot of work is required in others. Overall, things appear to be promising.", "Data science, in itself, is a combination of diverse scientific disciplines. It makes all the more sense to bring in people from different genders, backgrounds, and ethnicity who can bring in more creativity and allow knowledge, discoveries, and innovation to flourish.", "It will require a collaborative effort from society to make diversity and inclusion a vital part of the ecosystem. As women, we should make sure that we create an active support group to assist other women in the Data Science space. After all, Empowered women empower women.", "Your home for data science.
