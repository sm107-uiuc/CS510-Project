It might be due to children, as based on official statistics, in Czechia the average age of first-time mothers is 29 years (source in Czech). Carrying on to higher age groups, we can see local distribution modes corresponding to the mid-forties for both genders.

Ladies in their 20\u2019s are the most numerous age group among Females caught COVID-19 there. Moreover, for Austria there were more women in this age category than men. Regarding men exposed to the virus in Austria, gentlemen in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s were the most active group of COVID-19 importers to Czechia.

I\u2019ve got curious, which Czech regions the patients exposed to the virus in Italy were from.", "There were significantly more male patients contracted COVID-19 in Austria, except for the middle of March and the last week with just 8 cases total.

The same holds for Females vs. Males in their 70\u2019s. Moreover, Women in there 30\u2019s have less corona cases than women in their 20\u2019s. We\u2019ve mentioned already that n Czechia the average age of first-time mothers is 29 years, and the average age of all mothers giving birth is 31(source in Czech). Can having children lead to more efficient self-isolation and social distancing, resulting in the observed proportion of Females in their 30's? We\u2019ll check proportions of the age/gender groups in the general population later and will conclude then.", "We\u2019ve checked the gender of patients. And what about the overall distribution of COVID-19 patients per region?", "Oh, Prague\u2026 It should be noted that based on official stats, the overall population of the Central Bohemian Region is slightly higher than the population of Prague. Yet, the population density in Prague is more than 30x higher, which might mean significantly harder to social-distance.", "We\u2019ve seen \u201cWho\u201d (age distributions) and \u201cWhere\u201d (regions distribution) separately.

For instance, the Olomouc Female distribution is shifted towards younger Women, while \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem seems to have a slight shift towards older Ladies. However, according to the official population statistics, the average Female age in Olomouc region is slightly higher than the average age of Women in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem. Olomouc is known to be a \u201cstudent\u201d city with up to 1/5 of all people there being students from all over the country (reference in Czech). This observation will help us during the analysis of higher-risk groups.", "So, we\u2019ve been looking at \u201cWho\u201d and \u201cWhere\u201d, completely ignoring the timeline of the epidemic.

The logarithmic color scale would enable us to better see earlier stages of the epidemic, for more details about log-scale one can check the corresponding wiki page.", "We can see how the epidemic started in \u00dast\u00ed and Prague, then central and eastern regions became leaders in COVID-19 counts, and they keep being \u201cleaders\u201d till the time of writing this blog.", "We\u2019ve investigated total counts of positive cases per each region in time. Let\u2019s now check COVID-19 patients per age/gender groups in time.", "The detailed visualization enables us to check, for instance, groups of older people. We can see that in the beginning of epidemic men in their 60\u2019s had one of the highest daily counts of new COVID-19 cases among all male age groups at that time. We know that the Czech government implemented additional measures of protecting older people rather early on. And in the data we can see that for people in 60\u2019s the daily increase of new patients does not grow as it does for younger age groups. For a week or so the daily count of new cases count went down for people in their 60\u2019s. However, later the counts started to pop, especially for men in this age category the counts got closer to other age groups on the same date.

Next, let\u2019s check if data provide enough evidence against this hypothesis. If so, we\u2019ll reject the hypothesis. That\u2019s how statisticians often verify facts using data. And here goes a related joke.", "Details on how we\u2019re going to check this", "In this section I\u2019d provide a brief stats intro. Readers with a strong statistical background might wanna skip this section. On the other hand, I\u2019d be grateful for possible corrections in my description.", "We\u2019ll use data about Czechia demographics to compute proportions of each age/gender group. Using these proportions we\u2019ll compute expected frequencies of COVID-19-positive patients in each age/gender category. We would expect these frequencies if the null hypothesis was true, i.e., if every age/gender group was contracting COVID-19 evenly.", "Then we would summarize the discrepancy between these expected frequencies and the observed frequencies using one number, so-called statistic chi-square denoted \u03c72. The mathematicians know how likely different values of \u03c72 are if the null hypothesis is true. This would enable us to check how unlikely our data are if different age/gender groups contract COVID-19 evenly. Based on it we\u2019ll decide whether we should reject the null hypothesis.", "It\u2019s a good practice to agree beforehand, under which conditions we\u2019re going to reject the null hypothesis, otherwise, one might be tempted to project one\u2019s own beliefs into the interpretations of the results.

Coase once said,", "If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything.", "We\u2019ll see another joke about the test results interpretation shortly, but for everyone to fully understand it we need to refresh a definition of p-value.", "We\u2019ve discussed that statistic \u03c72 summarizes the discrepancy between what we observe and what we expect. The higher the \u03c72 value, the higher the discrepancy. In other words, the higher the \u03c72 value, the less likely our data are with the null hypothesis being true. P-value is the probability of getting our \u03c72 value or \u03c72 values even higher (i.e. values testifying against the hypothesis even more) while the null hypothesis is true.", "To sum up, the lower the p-value we get, the less probable our observations under true null hypothesis assumption are, and therefore the safer it is to reject the null hypothesis, which is denoted H\u2080.", "As mentioned already, it\u2019s good to agree before conducting a statistical experiment, what it means for the p-value to be \u201clow\u201d. It\u2019s common to set a threshold we\u2019ll compare the obtained p-value with. If the p-value would be less than the threshold, then the null hypothesis will be rejected. This threshold is called the significance level and is denoted \u03b1. Let\u2019s agree to test whether COVID-19 attacks all age/gender groups evenly with a significance level of \u03b1=5%.", "And here goes the promised joke about the interpretation of the results.", "If interested in refreshing technical details of the statistical test we\u2019re going to perform, one might wanna watch a short video from Khan Academy.", "We\u2019ve checked preconditions for the Pearson\u2019s chi-square test and then obtained p-value = 1.8*10\u207b\u00b9\u2076\u00b2. Therefore, we safely reject the null hypothesis with a significance level of \u03b1=5%.", "Let visually compare the observed COVID-19 age/gender proportions with the population proportions.", "No surprise we\u2019ve rejected the null hypothesis given such huge difference in proportions for people under 20.", "Let\u2019s now check each age/gender category separately.

You\u2019re unhappy with the result of your \u201canalysis\u201d, so you re-roll the dice. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re unhappy again, so you re-roll once more and this time you get the desired 6. However, the probability of getting 6 at least once when rolling three dice is 42%, not 17% anymore.", "Something similar happens if you test multiple subgroups of your data sample. The more subgroups there are, the more likely one of the subgroups is going to \u201cconfess\u201d by chance, as in the Coase\u2019s quote", "If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything.", "So, when repeating the same hypothesis test for multiple groups there\u2019s a higher risk of getting low p-value for some group by chance. In this case we would falsely reject a true null hypothesis. This type of error is called a Type I error.", "It can be shown that for a single hypothesis test with a significance level \u03b1 probability of Type I error is less or equal to \u03b1.", "If we\u2019d like to keep the probability of Type I error under \u03b1 in the case of multiple tests, we\u2019ll need to correct p-values before comparing it with \u03b1. The most basic correction is the so-called Bonferroni correction when for m tests each p-value is multiplied by m before comparing with \u03b1. Bonferroni correction is however very conservative and is known to often fail to reject false null hypothesis. In our case it\u2019d mean that risk of contracting COVID-19 is different for different age/gender groups, yet we fail to reject the null hypothesis about the risk being the same.", "This type of error is called a Type II error.", "We\u2019ll use Holm correction which is an improvement of Bonferroni correction, technical details can be found, e.g., in the wiki. It should be noted that the test is still rather conservative and still might lead to Type II errors.", "A note about per-group chi-square test", "Experienced readers have already noticed that by performing the chi-square test group by group we\u2019ll have a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom, which is just a squared normal distribution. Therefore, effectively we\u2019ll be doing something similar to z-test for difference in proportions, and therefore we must check corresponding preconditions, which we\u2019ve done.
