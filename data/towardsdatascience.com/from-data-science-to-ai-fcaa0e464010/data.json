If they do, the reason might be culture or Zeitgeist, the spirit of the times. If we dial back time by 30 or 40 years, an automated system to recognize your bad handwriting [sorry 10% of the population who actually have a lisible calligraphy] with a video camera would have still accounted for AI. \u201cA cybernetic eye capable of reading\u201d! Today OCR can be done on mobile devices and even though it\u2019s not always accurate, it\u2019s so common that it\u2019s not considered AI any more.", "Why is that something can shift out of being considered AI? Can the same happen for Data Science? For one, AI is a highly loaded term, with strong associations with science fiction, as well as with the very human ability to think and learn. These associations elicit emotional responses in us, either tied with our youth, our passions, or even our philosophical musings about what makes us human.", "Now\u2026 Did Data Science ever make you wonder about what makes you human? If not, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a much more precise term than AI and it doesn\u2019t have the same mystique.", "But there is more. Something much more concrete.", "AI is the ability of a machine to acquire and apply knowledge and skills, while Data Science is the systematic study and application of data by a human. A human can make use of Data Science to create components of an AI system. The opposite is only true in science fiction, only in a galaxy far far away AI systems are capable enough to carry out Data Science.", "And in between? When does a machine become intelligent?", "There is no hard threshold. AI needs 4 essential capabilities: perceiving, retaining as knowledge, thinking, and adapting. These comprise sensing, filtering, interpreting, storing, abstracting, reasoning, understanding, learning, and acting in an environment. The more developed these capabilities, the more intelligent the system will be. Hence, even a calculator has certain degree of intelligence. Analogously to the degrees of intelligence of dogs, dolphins, and any human. If an AI system outperforms humans, then it\u2019s often referred to as possessing superintelligence (besides very specific tasks, as of 2019 we\u2019re still very far from super-AI).", "So, why is AI then often also described as a vast technical field encompassing Machine Learning, Deep Learning, statistics,\u2026? One key reason is that the 4 capabilities of AI can be developed using these methods. If it is a human applying them it's Data Science creating AI; if it's a machine, then it's AI creating AI. For instance, when a Machine Learning system is being trained, it is done by the machine, hence it is an AI system solving a certain task. Data Science is everything else around the training. This also implies that a number of Data Science tools have some of the 4 capabilities of intelligence and can be defined as AI. As discussed above, whether or not one wants to call them AI or, for instance, \"hyper-automation\" depends on cultural factors.", "Data Science is not, however, the only approach to produce AI. It has been argued that evolution, quantum mechanics, and other still to be discovered methods also can produce elements of AI. Nonetheless, today there are strong synergies between Data Science and AI: while it is Data Science that actually makes things happen, AI provides us powerful tools and aspirational visions that show us the way.", "Your home for data science.
