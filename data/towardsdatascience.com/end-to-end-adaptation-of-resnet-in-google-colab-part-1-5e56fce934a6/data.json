Borrowing from Jeremy Howard (again), I really appreciate how he starts out with a few lines of code to demonstrate that training a deep neural network shouldn\u2019t be daunting. I wanted to do something similar with Google Colab.", "Without getting into the details of code and hardware requirements, in the beginning, I really wanted to experience how long it took to train, what the process looked like, and what the entire codebase of an \u2018end to end\u2019 network looked like, one that did the following four things:", "Enter Google Colab.

Scroll half way down to the section titled \u2018API\u2019 and click on \u2018Create New Token\u2019.

This authenticates you so you\u2019re able to obtain the dataset.", "I say this not in a facetious sense, but once you upload the JSON file, the code starts moving quickly and has likely blown past where you are on the page and has probably started training, looking like this:", "This will take a little bit of time but not that much, it\u2019s probably running on a high end GPU built for tasks like this.", "Wait for the code to finish training. It will output a line like this:", "Again, similar to how it was waiting for the JSON file above, the code is now waiting for you to upload a picture. Since it is only trained on dogs and cats, I would recommend picking one of these animals to test it out.

To the vast majority of the population around the world, this hardware is not locally accessible as they are cost prohibitive (thousands of $).", "We trained the model above with a dataset that was almost 1Gb in size, which took the Colab servers mere seconds to download. The time and bandwidth required to run this locally is also not accessible to most people worldwide.", "Teaching yourself about deep neural networks should not be hampered by the technology you have in front of you and you shouldn\u2019t need to imagine in your head how this is done on hardware.", "With the Colab notebook I provided, you can run this with a minimal internet connection and with a basic computer.", "But this is only part 1!
