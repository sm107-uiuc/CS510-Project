In the previous post, we have seen the basic and widely used Preprocessing techniques in the OCR system.", "In this part, we will cover the techniques of another most important phase of the OCR system, Segmentation.", "Segmentation is nothing but breaking the whole image into subparts to process them further.", "Segmentation of image is done in the following sequence : \u2192 Line level Segmentation \u2192 Word level Segmentation \u2192 Character level Segmentation", "For all the above-mentioned levels of Segmentation, we are going to use the Histogram Projection technique.", "Let me give you a brief introduction to the Histogram Projection method. Once the colored image is converted to the binary image, only black and white pixels are present in the image.", "In a binary image, pixels representing useful information are called Foreground pixels, and the pixels that are not foreground pixels are called Background pixels. We choose whether a foreground pixel should be white or black while binarizing the image.", "Horizontal Histogram Projection: In this method, we count the No.of foreground pixels along the rows of the image, and the resultant array is of the size equal to No.of rows in the image (Height of the image).", "Plotting horizontal_hist as a histogram looks like this", "Vertical Histogram Projection: In this method, we count the No.of foreground pixels along the image columns. The resultant array is of the size equal to No.of columns in the image (Width of the image).", "Plotting vertical_hist as a histogram looks like this", "Note: In the above image, foreground pixels are black, and background pixels are white.", "Now that we have understood Horizontal and Vertical histogram projections, we are ready to know how different levels of Segmentation is performed.", "General Rules of writing: We should leave enough space in between the lines.", "The idea is, If we Horizontally project the binary image,", "Rows that correspond to lower peaks in the histogram can be selected as the segmenting lines to separate the lines.", "2. Word Level Segmentation: At this level of segmentation, we are provided with an image containing a single line (segmented in the previous step) which consists of a sequence of words. The objective of Word Level Segmentation is to segment the image into words.", "General Rules of writing: We should leave enough space in between the words.", "The idea is similar to the previous step, but the only change is, here we have to project the image vertically (Sum is taken along columns) because we have to segment words vertically.", "If we Vertically project the binary image,", "Note: In the above pic, Foreground pixels are black pixels, and background pixels are white.", "I think you have figured out how the word segmentation is done in the above picture. Columns that correspond to lower peaks in the histogram can be selected as the segmenting lines to separate the words.", "For segmenting words, lower peaks should be selected in such a way that they should span through a certain width (threshold). This is because we\u2019ll find lower peaks which correspond to the gaps between disconnected characters within a word, which we are not interested in. As we know, the gaps between the words are greater than the gaps between the characters within a word, the threshold should be chosen in such a way that neglects the thin gaps between the characters within the words.", "3. Character Level Segmentation: At this level of segmentation, we are provided with an image containing a single word (segmented in the previous step) which consists of a sequence of characters. The objective of Character Level Segmentation is to segment the image into individual characters.", "This level of segmentation is optional, which depends upon the context where the OCR is being used.", "We can use the same idea which we have used for Word Level Segmentation by leveraging the small gap between the characters, i.e., by projecting the image vertically, we can segment the characters.", "In Character Level Segmentation, segmenting of characters is not straightforward because of the concept of ligatures in Cursive handwriting.", "What is Ligature ?? A Ligature is the link which joins the two successive characters in cursive handwriting.", "Now you might be thinking, What problem does this ligature create \u2026..right?In English script, we have two types of characters", "Thus the OCR system cannot differentiate the ligature with the curve from open characters and considers both valid candidates for segmenting. This problem is known as the Over Segmentation Problem.", "Note: In the above image, for segmenting, valid candidates are the ligatures (connections between u,m & m,n), and invalid candidates are those, which are a part of the open characters u, m, n (we cant segment in between the character)", "Till date, we have no perfect solution for this problem, but here is the basic and widely used method to overcome this problem. We assume Thinning is done to 1-pixel width. So possible sum in vertical histogram array is  \u2192 sum=0, if no foreground pixel is present in the column \u2192 sum=1, if either ligature or part of an open character is present in the column \u2192 sum>1, if part of a closed character is present in the column. E.g., o,p (has more than one foreground pixel in each column)", "In the above image, Columns marked in red have either vertical histogram sum=0 or sum=1. These columns are known as PSC (Potential Segmentation Columns).", "Following rules are followed to select the Valid Segment lines (doesn\u2019t always select a valid segment line, but a majority of times selects a valid one):-", "By following the above rules, we can segment characters correctly 90% of the time.", "In this 3-part series, we got a high-level overview of the working of an OCR System and covered the two most important phases of the OCR system Preprocessing and Segmentation.", "I hope you understood and enjoyed reading this !!!", "Any doubts, Suggestions, Corrections are Welcome.", "[3] Kurniawan, Fajri & Shafry, Mohd & Rahim, Mohd & Matus, Ni & Rakhmadi, Akmal & Mohamad, Dzulkifli.
