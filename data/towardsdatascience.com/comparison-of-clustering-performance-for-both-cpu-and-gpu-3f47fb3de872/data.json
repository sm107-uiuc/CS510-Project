These data points do not have initial labels. For that reason, clustering is the grouping of unlabeled data points into groups to figure them out in a more meaningful way.", "For a deeper look at clustering techniques, please visit MIT-edu notes.", "Throughout this post, the aim is to compare the clustering performances of Scikit-Learn (random, k-means++) and TensorFlow-GPU (k-means++, Tunnel k-means) algorithms by means of their execution times and print them in a comparison matrix by providing corresponding system specs. Since the content of the data is not the focus of this benchmark study, the required data sets will be randomly generated.", "The purpose of the k-means clustering is to partition some number of observations n into k number of centroids in a non-overlapping manner. The number of data points is expected to be as homogeneous as possible inside the cluster and as heterogeneous as possible outside the cluster. For more theoretical explanations, please kindly visit this webpage.", "Throughout this post, three different environments (2 different CPU-powered systems, 1 GPU-powered system) will be tested.
