Get ready for an in depth analysis of Words, Emojis, Numbers, Words, Links, Images, Videos, Audios and attachments", "A little bit of an overview before we dive into the breakdown of this WhatsApp conversation\u2026", "The first step was to download the conversation from WhatsApp. This can be done very easily from the app itself or the web server extension.", "A couple of things need to be noted about the cleaning process before we go into the ~juicy~ visualisations.", "The format of the text file imported is as follows:", "[day-month-year hour:minute:second] name : message \\newline", "The main goal of this first step was to create a \u2018csv\u2019 file from the text file originally downloaded. I replaced the closing and opening square brackets [] with a comma and the colon with a comma as well.", "I also deleted the emoji from the name of the sender for no particular reason, I prefer cleaner names. The resultant format of the file after cleaning is as follows:", "day -month -year hour:minute:second, name , message", "This is the format that I wanted to achieve in order to create the csv file, which will allow me to analyse the messages.", "Now that we have a beautiful \u2018csv\u2019 file with all the dates, sender names and messages, we can create a pandas dataframe to store all the information.", "The dataframe has the following structure: |date| name of sender|message|", "An essential step in the analysis is to be able to understand WHEN the messages are being sent. This needs to be done by easily handling dates, times, minutes etc.", "Python has an extremely useful library that was created just for this. A very easy conversion from a string type to datetime type can be achieved from the following line:", "Now, the format of my \u2018date\u2019 pandas column is specified, this is very useful because it allows for a lot of flexibility when using different date formats.", "Once we changed the \u2018date\u2019 column to datetime type, we can very easily extract any desired metric such as hour, month or year. I decided to create new columns that would contain the specific month and year that a message was sent.", "I used Plotly Express and Seaborn to plot the two following graphs. They convey that although my friend and I are very close, we don\u2019t speak particularly regularly on Whatsapp. There are a lot of intervals where not a single messages is sent for weeks at a time, and then days where we exchange over 80 messages. It seems to be that we have an all or nothing way of communicating.", "The year with the most communication was by far 2018, particularly in the last quarter. This makes a lot of sense because we were organising a trip around Europe. At the end and start of each year, the communication decreases because we both have exams and family holidays to take care of.", "The heatmap below and line graph above align in the information they convey.", "A heat map is a data visualisation technique that shows magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions.", "I chose to use two visualisations for the same time variables to ensure that I wasn\u2019t missing something hidden in one graph but clear in the other. I recommend doing this in most situations, as it provides a quick \u2018sanity check\u2019.", "These visualisations can be very easily achieved and a step by step tutorial can be found here.", "Given that the previous graph did not show a trend in our messaging style, I decided to break it down further by looking at hourly and weekly messages sent.", "I created a radar plot to visualise the frequency of messages because they are cyclical and I was fairly confident that there would be a strong trend.", "A radar chart is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point.", "I created columns with the weekday and hour of the day for each message sent.", "These graphs were richer in information and showed that there are days of the week and hours of the day when we talk more regularly.", "For the hourly chart, 95% of the shaded area falls between 5am and 6pm, this is fairly representative of our lifestyle as we are very active people. We mostly talk on weekends because of the long distance friendship and to catch up or organise trips.", "Emojis are an extremely popular form of communication and are often used to portray emotion or for comedic effect without having to type words.", "I was surprised to see that we had very little overlap in the emojis used, except for the laughing-crying emoji.", "There were a couple of interesting things I noticed when looking at this plot. Clearly I use a wider variety of emojis while she has her go-to emojis that never fail. I was surprised to see that she had more celebratory emojis such as the champagne and the Christmas Tree while mine rely more on reactions.", "Furthermore, I use emojis much more often than she does. In fact, I use more than double the amount. This makes a lot of sense because the language we speak and exchange messages in is not my first language. I rely more on emojis to convey my ideas or emotions, while she uses words more confidently.", "You can find a step by step explanation of how to create these subplots here.", "The most common messages sent by both of us were quite similar. I added a translation from french (just in case). The following line of code allowed me to very easily to go through my \u2018messages\u2019 column and find the most repeated ones. I am always in awe of what can be achieved in a single line of code.", "I was very surprised to find that the most repeated messages express our agreement about something.", "Conclusion: We agree on most things, very often, A LOT.", "I decided to take the matter one step further and look into the most repeated words used by the both of us.", "This was achieved (with more than one line of code unfortunately) by setting all the words to lowercase and using the \u2018Counter\u2019 function. This function keeps track of every single word and adds a unique +1 count every time a specific word is present in a message.", "The result of this counter function is saved in a new pandas dataframe \u2018wd\u2019 which I used for plotting the Word Cloud (in my opinion, the prettiest visualisation:)", "The WordCloud function uses dictionaries so I had to make a quick conversion before getting into the plotting.", "I learned a lot with this small project. It was the first time that I dealt with non-numerical data. There were a lot of bugs and things to keep in mind while writing the code such and french accents \u00e8\u00e9\u00ea, or the emoji library which was trickier to use than I expected.", "I was happy to see that this exploratory data analysis process conveyed very positive information about my friendship. All the emojis used portrayed positive or energetic emotions. The most frequently messages were used to express agreement.", "The single most used word, was Thank You = Merci.", "All the code can be found in the analysis.py file on Github here.", "If you like my work, I\u2019d greatly appreciate if you followed me on Medium here.", "If you have any questions, suggestions or ideas on how to improve, please leave a comment below or get in touch through LinkedIn here.", "Your home for data science.
