It describes the Julia implementation of ARIMA models using the Probabilistic Programming Language (PPL) Turing.jl, which provides great ease in defining probabilistic models. This aspect of Turing will become more obvious when we look at model definitions later on in the article. Furthermore, Turing supports the use of custom distributions for specifying models.", "Okay, so let\u2019s get straight onto it!", "We will use a dataset containing S&P 500 Adjusted Closing Values 1995\u20132015 with a monthly frequency. The dataset can be downloaded from here (MIT License).", "The following plot is obtained after running the code above. This is essentially how our data looks like, plotting the value at each time index:", "We split the data into training and test sets, taking 95% of the data as training set:", "We can see from the plots that the mean of the series rises towards the end. So, the series is not stationary. This is reinforced by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)Test for stationarity:", "Thus, we difference the time series in an attempt to remove the stationarity:", "This series seems to have a roughly constant mean, though this does not necessarily mean that the series is stationary. We use the ADF test once again:", "Success! We can safely assume this series to be stationary since the p-value is so low. We can now move on to selecting the AR and MA terms for our differenced time series with the help of ACF and PACF plots.", "The ACF and PACF plots obtained for our training data are as shown below:", "These plots can be construed in the following ways:", "Having both AR and MA terms in an ARIMA model is not very common. So, we will not consider this case. From the two points above, it seems that the model is more likely to have a Moving Average term. Nevertheless, we will consider two plausible cases for our ARIMA model:", "The notation for an ARIMA(p, d, q) model is defined as follows:", "We implement both of these cases and compare the models using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). This webpage\u00b9 is used as a reference for defining the ARIMA(1, 1, 0) and ARIMA(0, 1, 1) models below.", "Here, x is the original time series as we have accounted for differencing in the model definition itself. Note that we will have one autoregressive term since p = 1.", "As in the previous model definition, x is the original time series. Note that we will have one Moving Average term since q = 1.", "A point to be observed here is how the code written in Turing is essentially the same as it would be written on a piece of paper. This is evident from the model definitions above where one can understand these model definitions simply by looking at the code.", "The chain is sampled using the NUTS sampler. You can check out the docs to know more about NUTS and several other samplers that Turing supports. The code for sampling is as follows:", "To get the visualisations and the summary statistics for the parameters, you can have a look at them in the code here (Jupyter notebook) or here (.jl file).", "The Akaike information criterion (AIC) measures the relative \u201cgoodness\u201d of different statistical models. Thus, it can be used for the purpose of model comparison. The lower the value of AIC, the better the model is. Also, one must remember that the absolute value of AIC does not have much meaning, the relative values are what matter. Mathematically, AIC is given by:", "Using this formula, we can calculate the AIC values for our two models. This PDF\u00b2 has been used as a reference for calculating the AIC values of the two models.", "Clearly, we can see that the ARIMA(0,1,1) model is better.", "This brings to an end my article on ARIMA Models with Turing.jl.
