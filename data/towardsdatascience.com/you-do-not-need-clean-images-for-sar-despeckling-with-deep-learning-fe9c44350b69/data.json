But optical images are not the entire story!", "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an alternative imaging technique based on active illumination. Basically, the satellite sends a beam of electromagnetic waves and listens for its reflection from the ground. Clever processing techniques compare the transmitted waveform with the received one and can create an image representing how the ground reflected the wave. SAR has to be considered complementary to optical, as it offers capabilities unavailable for optical instruments. For instance, SAR can see through clouds because it works in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and so it cannot be stopped by bad weather.", "However, SAR images present much more noise than their optical counterparts, and it is no ordinary noise. This special kind of noise is called speckle and it is common to all coherent imaging systems such as SAR. A commonly used model considers speckle as a multiplicative disturbance, independent of true ground reflectivity.", "Since speckle is a very severe disturbance and limits the performance of tasks such as object detection or land cover classification, despeckling algorithms have been studied for almost 40 years. Today, deep learning promises a new generation of algorithms that can leverage the powerful representational capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recover the underlying ground reflectivity in a more faithful way.", "Supervised training of CNNs has proved to be very powerful in addressing a large variety of problems, including denoising, but it is fundamentally limited by the need for ground truth data. This is a critical issue for our goal of SAR despeckling because clean SAR images simply do not exist.", "Early methods bypassed this problem by simulating speckle onto optical images, or on datasets widely used for image recognition (e.g. ImageNet). This allowed having both the noisy version of the image and the corresponding ground truth.", "However, this is not optimal because the features of a SAR image can be significantly different than the ones of conventional images. This creates a domain gap between the data that are used in training and the real ones onto which the algorithm will be applied, and it results in artifacts that degrade the quality of the despeckled image. The figure below shows an example with a simple CNN trained in such a supervised fashion on synthetic data. We can see that some areas are oversmoothed and others present cartoon-like features.", "In the last year, significant progress has been made in the deep learning community to tackle the denoising problem without supervision. Approaches like Noise2Noise, Noise2Void, Noise2Self, and others, designed self-supervised methods that do not require clean images. Some methods, like Noise2Noise (and its extension to SAR images) require multiple realizations of the same scene, which can be cumbersome to acquire, register and be resilient to changes. On the other hand Laine et al. devised a Bayesian framework that allows self-supervised training from single noisy images. Speckle2Void brings this framework to the remote sensing world and tackles a few issues that appear when addressing SAR despeckling.", "Speckle2Void relies on blind-spot CNNs, i.e. special kinds of CNNs that have a hole in the receptive field corresponding to the pixel that we want to currently denoise. The idea is that the network should predict the value of the clean pixel from the receptive field. This works because if the noise is spatially uncorrelated, it is impossible to predict the noise component of the pixel. The hole in the receptive field is needed to make sure that the pixel itself is excluded from this operation, as otherwise, it would trivially copy its own value. This is done with a suitable architecture, as in figure, that uses standard convolutional layers but applies shifts to rotated versions of the image to limit the expansion of the receptive field to one direction.", "Before explaining how the training and denoising works, we must introduce the Bayesian model used to describe the noise and the conditional distribution of the clean image pixels given the receptive field. The whole goal of training, in fact is for the CNN to learn how to process the receptive field to return the values of the parameters of the clean pixel distribution that best fit the noisy observation.", "Noise is multiplicative and follows a Gamma distribution; the image pixel given its receptive field follows an inverse Gamma distribution whose parameters are estimated by the CNN. Finally, this implies that the observed noisy data follow a famous distribution called G0 that has been known to be a good model for heterogenous SAR images.", "During training the logarithm of p(y) is minimized to let the CNN learn how to use the receptive field to produce the parameters of the clean image distribution that best fit the noisy data. During testing, the denoised image is computed using the mean of the Bayesian posterior distribution, i.e.:", "While many SAR image models often assume that the speckle is spatially uncorrelated, this is not often true in real life, as the transfer function of the SAR focusing system introduces some correlation. This is bad for Speckle2Void because the CNN could find a way to exploit the correlation in the noise to replicate it, reducing the denoising performance. This problem can be addressed in two ways:1. decorrelate the speckle by using techniques such as the one by Argenti et al.;2. use a bigger blind spot! The width of the blind spot should be modulated to match the width of the autocorrelation of the speckle process.", "We can see how Speckle2Void strongly suppresses speckle noise while retaining image details. Critically, it does not introduce the kind of artifacts observed with supervised training because it learns how to extract relevant features directly from real SAR images.", "It is an exciting time for self-supervised methods and more and more applications are starting to benefit from directly using real data even when no supervision signal is available. Speckle2Void proved that it is possible to learn a powerful despeckling algorithm for SAR images even if no clean image can be observed.", "Your home for data science.
