Ted has been here since the very beginning, and there is nobody as well acquainted with where all the \u201cbodies are buried\u201d as him. Ted speaks in org-specific initialisms and can explain the historical context for every data discrepancy ad nauseum. Without Ted, the IT help desk would surely explode into a fiery mound of rubble.", "We all know at least one Ted; organizational pillars with a web of hyper-local company secrets. The information they guard is commonly referred to as tribal knowledge: details about the organization\u2019s processes, technologies and operations that are highly unintuitive, exceedingly complex, rarely documented and disproportionately impactful to the business. Tribal knowledge is a form of instance knowledge, the type of insight that has little worth outside the company walls but inside can seem mission-critical. The density of this tribal knowledge among individuals is often referred to as the bus factor; i.e. \u201cHow screwed will we be if Ted gets hit by a bus?\u201d While it is generally accepted that, from an organizational standpoint, tribal knowledge is bad for business, rarely discussed is how toxic a high bus factor is to the bearer.", "Before diving into how tribal knowledge contaminates an individual\u2019s skill pool, it would help to define what differentiates tribal knowledge from other types of knowledge. In this context, the polar opposite of tribal knowledge is skillful knowledge \u2014 that is, abilities and expertise that increase the professional worth of an individual and their capability to add organizational value. Skillful knowledge differs from tribal knowledge in several ways:", "There is a simple litmus test for whether or not knowledge is tribal: for a given role, could a person with more domain experience easily take over the role without being provided this knowledge? If they can, the knowledge is likely domain skills knowledge. If they can\u2019t, the knowledge is probably tribal.", "So why concern yourself with avoiding tribal knowledge in the first place? For many, the idea persists that possessing mountains of organizational secrets will equate to sustained value as a team member. Here are some very compelling reasons that may lead you to reconsider.", "The microservices evolution is everywhere in business. Modern systems and processes are architected to be modular and componentized wherever possible, making once indefinite elements of business suddenly disposable.", "Consider a retailer that uses multiple shipping carriers. At one time, each carrier would require a unique integration with the retailer\u2019s software, accounting processes, and vendor relations. This overhead multiplied over many carriers will inevitably foster a tangled web of code, process, and practice. It is also likely to create at least one tribal knowledge guru to navigate it all. Today, there exists a multitude of SAAS vendors that connect to hundreds of shipping carriers through a single integration. The complex ballet of old is replaced by a few lines of code and a single vendor on a balance sheet \u2014 and all that tribal knowledge is instantly rendered useless. In a world of modular design, the tribal knowledge guru can find themselves made obsolete at any moment and without warning.", "Back when my younger self was selling motorcycles, the first high performance 4 stroke dirt bikes hit the market. The first run of these machines were nearly impossible to kickstart; manufacturers were quick to release the second generation of bikes that started with much less fanfare, but if you managed to buy one of those very first bikes it required special skills to kick the motor over. So difficult was starting these bikes that only one single person employed at our motorcycle shop was able to get them started. He was our first-gen 4-stroke tribal expert.", "When we overpaid for a first-gen bike trade-in, you could bet he was the buyer. Whenever he came back from a motorcycle auction, it was guaranteed at least a few of those hard-kickers would be in the back of the truck. Even though there was little demand for the bikes (who wants a machine you can\u2019t start?) he had an admitted soft spot for them that clouded his judgment.", "Tribal knowledge has a way of skewing how we assess value. When niche instance knowledge gives us a leg up in connection with a specific process or tool, we are much more likely to favor that process/tool even when another alternative is objectively superior. This myopia is dangerous to the tribal knowledge expert in that it distracts from our true career trajectories and larger success. Through the haze of tribal knowledge, it can be painfully difficult for the guru to perceive that doing the job well \u2014 in this case, reselling motorcycles for a healthy profit \u2014 is what matters for lasting career success.", "A common phrase in programming is \u201cleave that problem for future us.\u201d As a rule, we only do the work we know we absolutely need right now; this leaves time to see how things play out in practice and adjust as needed.", "The problem with any complex system that is rich in tribal knowledge is that it begins to limit the size of the group that \u201cfuture us\u201d refers to. The more tribal knowledge that is required to do work, the fewer people are able to do it. Compassion for the next person to pick up the work will often motivate us to remove as many booby traps and minefields as possible. If compassion fails, at least our pride will usually ensure we leave things tidy enough to prevent being judged. But when tribal knowledge secures your role as that next person, it becomes easy to do our very worst work. Compounding matters is the human tendency to overestimate our ability to remember information over time. This can lead to cut corners in documentation, leaving future us without a roadmap.", "With the average U.S. worker now changing employers at least a dozen times in our adult life, long-term skills viability is a critical component to maintaining a sustainable career. Developing oneself as either a tribal knowledge guru or a skills-focused expert each demand a significant investment in time and sweat equity, but they return very different dividends. Consider how a Director of IT Support could choose to invest in their future:", "To be a tribal knowledge expert, this Director might make extraordinary efforts to involve themself in all affairs remotely associated with the IT Support department. It would be important to learn that the phone system aggregates log files daily and what the different log file prefix codes mean, understand how marketing uses 6 directed phone numbers to indicate campaign source channels, find the backstory on why the helpline software database has 2 different user tables, etc.To be a skills expert, the Director might invest time searching out literature, course work and case studies around technical team management, managerial psychology, and customer service strategy. It would also fall in line to regularly attend industry trade shows and vendor open houses, expose themselves to a variety of tools for call center phone systems, support analytics, and team management.", "In meetings, the tribal knowledge expert will become a local hero with a cornucopia of snap responses to very in-the-weeds questions such as \u201cThis spreadsheet looks off because the xyz table doesn\u2019t refresh on Tuesdays until 3 pm, due to of our contract agreement with abc vendor from 9 years ago.\u201d The tribal knowledge expert will gorge on the instant gratification of responding to every off-the-cuff trivial question the CEO happens to blurt out, and leave each meeting in a dopamine cloud derived from what-would-we-ever-do-without-you pats on the head.", "The skills expert at the same meeting will likely have no answer for what is wrong with the spreadsheet, and will need to investigate if it really matters (hint: it seldom does). What the skills expert will be more than prepared to weigh in on is a change of helpdesk software vendors, a new remote work policy for the team, or the workflow implications of a merger with a major competitor.", "When it comes time to interview for the next role at a new company, the skills expert will be able to speak intelligently on the latest trends in the industry, show informed opinions regarding upcoming choices the business will need to make, and walk an interviewer through the body of highly impactful work that comprises their career. The tribal knowledge expert, on the other hand, will find themselves lost outside the safety of the organizational domain. Their wealth of knowledge detailing why their previous employer\u2019s TPS reports could only be run after 4 on Tuesdays will be of little use in an interview, and conversations of the larger industry will be met with a painful-to-watch mental struggle, the expert searching for answers that are simply not coming.", "Our learning resources are genuinely finite, and every choice regarding how we invest in our skills will impact our marketability.", "If you find yourself acting as tribal knowledge guru (or on the way to becoming one), there are a few techniques that tend to help alter your path. Here, in order of application:", "Organizations generally recognize the negative impacts of high \u201cbus factor\u201d roles, however, idolization of the behaviors that lead to tribal knowledge is still deeply embedded in much of business culture. Shedding the weight of tribal knowledge dependency starts by attacking the cultural roots that allow this behavior to flourish.", "Encourages Tribal Knowledge: - \u201cWe couldn\u2019t run this place without you Sarah, you know more about the TPS system than anyone else alive!\u201d- \u201cYou need to make sure Ted is in that meeting or we can\u2019t discuss the IT implementation.\u201d- \u201cOur system is far too complex and unique for us to consider hiring outside consultants to help us, they just wouldn\u2019t understand what we do here.\u201d", "Encourages Skills Knowledge:- \u201cAlex, your work on the TPS system is amazing, we can now onboard new operators in less than a week!\u201d- \u201cMorgan is one of our best project leads, any member of that team is qualified to sit in on meetings because of how Morgan runs the department.\u201d- \u201cOur system is so intelligently designed that we can easily augment our resources with qualified developers, and rapidly add features the second we see a business opportunity.\u201d", "Taking every opportunity to define success with flexible, skills-focused solutions will go a long way to minimize tribal knowledge across the organization.", "Sustaining a Horcrux of tribal knowledge is as toxic to the bearer as it is to the whole of the organization. Learning to cast aside the false authority of domain-instance knowledge will create opportunities for true skills growth, improve career marketability and raise the quality bar for all the work you do.", "Your home for data science.
