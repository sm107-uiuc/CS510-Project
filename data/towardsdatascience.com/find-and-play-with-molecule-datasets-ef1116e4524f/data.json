It has helped make industrial processes more efficient in all industries, be it logistics or defense. Although the adoption of machine learning has been slow by pharmaceutical companies \u2014 they are surely catching up. In this article, I talk about some of the standard datasets which can be used by the data scientists to start working and contributing to this exciting union of Pharma and AI.", "Now the first question which comes in mind, is how to represent the complex molecular structures into machine-understandable representation?", "On the left, you see the molecular structure of a popular drug called Ciprofloxacin which is an antibiotic. In its raw format, it is not machine-understandable. So what is the solution? The solution is called Simplified molecular-input line-entry system or SMILES, in short.", "SMILES is a standard way of specifying the molecular structure of a compound into a simple string representation. The string representation of the structure in the figure above is OC(=O)C1=CN(C2CC2)c3cc(N4CCNCC4)c(F)cc3C1=O. One can easily convert these string representation(s) into 2D drawings \u2014 which makes it a popular description to be used both for ML models and visualization purposes. There are other ways to represent structures as well but SMILES is better since it is more human-readable and can be transformed into other representational types such as graphs.", "Since I am a data scientist and do not have a strong chemistry background, I would not go in-depth on how SMILES works. But one can go in more depth by reading the OPENSMILES documentation.", "In short, it is a really powerful way of representing structures and has the capability of representing different kinds of atoms, bonds, rings and even complex concepts such as branching and aromaticity.", "Let's dive into the open-source datasets which are out there? Shall we? \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c", "I am going to mention the three main SMILES datasets that have been used by me and are also very popular in the computational chemistry community.", "The GDB dataset has come out of the Raymond Research group at the University of Bern. There are 2 variants of this dataset: GDB 11 and GDB 13. Both of these datasets contain compounds that are small in nature (in terms of the length of the string representations). For the features, it just contains the string and does not have any other properties of the molecule.", "GDB 11: contains approximately 65k molecules and is of size 122 MB.", "GDB 13: contains approximately 977 million molecules and is of size 2.6 GB. It is also the largest small molecule dataset published currently.", "ZINC is a dataset of commercially available molecules. It has over 750 million molecules and is one of the standard sets used by research and biotech companies. In addition to the SMILES, it also holds other information about each molecule such as its physicochemical properties and commercial sales related information.", "The website which hosts the datasets also lets the user query interesting questions such as \u201chow many compounds have been used in clinical trials?\u201d and is known for its quick response time to queries. It is also very popular among the machine learning community with multiple research papers being published in drug discovery by treating ZINC as the baseline dataset.", "The ChEMBL dataset has been developed by the European Bioinformatics Institute and does not only provide the user with information about SMILES and its chemical properties \u2014 but also provides information about its activity and genomics. It has over 1.9 million compounds as part of the dataset. It hosts a set of molecules that have drug-like properties.", "Since the amount of features provided by ChEMBL is extensive, it is one of the most comprehensive public datasets in this domain. The dataset can be queried either using their web interface or using ElasticSearch. By querying using ElasticSearch, it offers the users more flexibility as to the features they want in their dataset.", "Since most of the machine learning community uses Python, I am going to talk about a tool that would help you play with the above-mentioned datasets in Python.", "The library is RDKit and it is an open-source and well-known cheminformatics library. One can install rdkit package using conda:", "Once the rdkit package is installed, given a SMILES string one can convert it into a rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object or in other words by converting it into a Molecule object which the user can call methods on to get additional features:", "This is just one feature that we have found but using RDKit, we can find other features such as the one-hot encoded vector of the string (Morgan Fingerprint), the total number of chemical rings, number of valence electrons, etc.", "Now, go out there and start playing with these datasets. There are innumerable opportunities \u2014 you could potentially generate new medicines for diseases or predict how active a compound is to a certain condition.", "I hope you find this article interesting and useful. If you did, please share it.", "Also, if you feel there have been datasets or libraries which are important, feel free to mention it in comments!", "Your home for data science.
