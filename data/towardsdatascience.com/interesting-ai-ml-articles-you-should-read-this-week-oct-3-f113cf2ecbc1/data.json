Regardless, Dan has provided a brief history of the relevance and impact the utilisation of GPU has had within the deep learning field.", "Dan expands on the impact that GPU had had on the acceleration of processing of image data by including the limitations of current hardware in processing sparse matrices.", "The reason for NVIDIA purchasing Arm as Dan alludes to in his article is that NVIDIA is setting up the groundwork to develop hardware that can process more complex data representation formats utilised in fields such as AI.", "This article is a must-read for the majority of machine learning practitioners. Dan provides critical insights and information into the future state of hardware ML Engineers utilise on a day to day basis might be shifting into.", "Six months is a short time, but in the machine learning industry, it can be more than enough for an individual to gain invaluable knowledge into having a successful machine learning career. Nicole Janeway Bills shares with Medium readers six lessons learned from her six-month experience as a Data Scientist.", "Within this article, Nicole touches on lessons learned through reading research papers, exploring Github repositories, listening to podcast and understanding the hardware component of the machine learning landscape.", "One of the key takeaways that stood out to me was Nicole\u2019s unorthodox method of generating new ideas through the examination of Github issues of machine learning libraries and packages. Apart from idea generation, Nicole shares additional benefits of exploring Github issues, which include understanding weak points of packages and gauging the level of activity of a package\u2019s developers community before committing to the utilisation of a package within project.", "Although the majority of the key takeaways are technical, Nicole\u2019s final learnings are focus on the human component of a typical Data Scientist work interaction. Nicole mentions the need for Data Scientist to identify social science cues for specific behaviours that might not be evident when exploring data associated with human or human-based activities. An understanding of external causation and correlations caused by human behaviours can provide intuition into unique methods machine learning solutions can be developed.", "Brian Merchant has written an eye-opening piece on the impact of automation on Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers.", "Most of us are eager to see a world where dull and mundane tasks are automated and handled by robots.", "The automated future for most machine learning practitioners is not born out of laziness but is derived from the applications of impressive knowledge, technical and mechanical prowess of engineers to solve repetitive tasks.", "We\u2019ve all heard of the job apocalypse that automation and AI are bound to start in the coming decades, but what many might be oblivious to is the injuries that humans are currently afflicted by as they try to keep up with their robot counterparts.", "Brian\u2019s article explores the topic of workplace injuries as a result of automation and the efforts of corporate giants such as Amazon, to silence the voice of the oppressed by the promise of a more efficient and quick delivery system, powered by robots and automation.", "Ran (Reine) has curated a list of intriguing ML/DL projects that are unique in their application and show great potential.", "Each included project is supplemented by a technical explanation of the intuition and methodology that was taken by the project\u2019s author. Ran includes resources that provide more information and insight into each project, so curious reader can explore each project and details further.", "The included projects have a variety of ML topics that they focus on, such as Natural Language Processing(NLP), speech recognition, image captioning, and image generation through GANs.", "Machine learning practitioners can find benefit in this article by using it as a source of inspiration for personal projects and learnings.", "The topic of hyperparameter tuning and optimisation is common in most machine learning practitioners handbook.", "Machine learning practitioners typically train a neural network and traverse through a set of values for learning rates, batch-size, the number of units in layers etc. This process can be meticulous.", "Sebastian Poliak has written on a different method to tuning models that might be relatively less cumbersome than the traditional grid or random search approach to searching the hyperparameter value space.", "Sebastian introduces the action of observing the bias and variance to tune models to their optimal performance. Sebastian\u2019s approach to systematically tuning models is supplemented with several easy to implement code snippets that demonstrate the effect of reducing bias and variance through several methods, such as increasing the number of neurons or adding regularisation to the network.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
