This relates to becoming a full stack developer.", "This is the core of development. You\u2019ll need a framework to build applications. The present and future of software is on the web, so we\u2019ll only discuss web frameworks.", "You need to choose one and commit. This is unsettling, but in the beginning, go deep in one rather than wide in several.", "Pro tip: You don\u2019t need to pick the framework that\u2019s hottest right now.", "Companies get stuck using the framework they originally chose, so it can be advantageous to choose something that was popular a few years ago. There will be less competition as new developers won\u2019t be learning it anymore.", "If you already know Python, it can be tempting to pick a framework that uses it like Django. That said, most data scientists (most people?) are hackers and can\u2019t write quality code. So picking a framework that requires learning a new language may not actually be harder.", "We started with choosing a framework, rather than a language because a frameworks allows building applications, even with poor coding skills. Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of easy wins on confidence and success.", "You\u2019ve already chosen a framework. So there are no decisions to be made here. Learn your framework\u2019s language.", "If you chose Rails, learn Ruby. If you chose Django, learn Python. If you chose Express, learn JS.", "I use the term \u201clearn\u201d very loosely!", "Do NOT try to master the syntax. That will take too long. Learn basic syntax on Codecademy, and then learn some object oriented programming.", "Now going forward, mentally compartmentalize the language VS the framework. They\u2019re not the same thing. Don\u2019t make that rookie mistake.", "Homework: Learn basic syntax, object oriented programming, and do a few beginner algorithm questions in your language.", "This is a requirement for full stack development in 2020.", "Disclaimer: You may temporarily bypass this step by learning to hack together responsive frontends in jQuery, and then pick up a frontend framework on the job.", "Assuming you choose to learn a frontend framework, just learn React. There are a number of frameworks out there with their own advantages, but enough companies use React that you can safely choose it.", "You don\u2019t need to become a frontend wizard. But learn to implement basic design patterns, and understand the difference between client-side and server-side code.", "Homework: Learn React basics and how to integrate it with your backend framework.", "Pro tip: How a product looks, IS the product. Making applications look nice is underrated.", "You DO NOT need the ability to create beautiful designs from scratch. You just need to be good enough to draw inspiration from (copy?) other websites.", "Imitation is the mother of all invention. And almost any company you join will have it\u2019s own style guide anyway.", "Homework: Build a nice looking splash page, inspired by other companies whose design you admire.", "If you\u2019ve worked in DS, you probably have no problem with SQL.", "But most web apps rarely use SQL directly. They almost always use a framework\u2019s or languages\u2019s ORM to interact with the database.", "This is a predefined API to execute common database transactions, exposed in a high-level programming language.", "Rails uses ActiveRecord. Python has SQLAlchemy\u2026", "And if you\u2019re not set on a specific database, choose PostgreSQL.", "Homework: Learn an ORM for your language or framework", "The bar is low here. Do not go too deep.", "No need to master GCP or AWS. You\u2019ll learn these faster on the job and they vary by company.", "Just figure out how to deploy your own applications on a PaaS like Heroku.", "Homework: Deploy an app on Heroku.", "Build some applications with what you\u2019ve learned. It\u2019s the best way to prove you know how to do something.", "Favour \u201cdoing and documenting\u201d over \u201cmemorizing\u201d.", "It\u2019s fine if you need to re-lookup how you did something. Software engineers are indexes, not robots.", "Anecdotally, a portfolio is more important than ability to do algorithm questions. Unless you want to work at Facebook or Amazon.", "Pro tip: Making your applications beautiful is a huge differentiator, even if want to be a backend developer. It will unconsciously bias the interviewers\u2019 opinion of you up.", "Homework: Build some apps which showcase that you\u2019re capable of all the above.", "If you\u2019re an AI PhD and capable of research-level ML, don\u2019t do this. My friends in HR tell me that $1M+ salaries await you.", "For everyone else, it can make a lot of sense.", "As ML continues becoming easier, it will eventually be swallowed by software engineering, aka \u201cproduct\u201d.", "This is intentionally very opinionated. Based on my experience it\u2019s the optimal way to make a successful transition.", "That said, this isn\u2019t gospel and you should act according your own research.", "If you cover all this, and already have DS experience, you\u2019re way ahead of most developers.", "Lastly, get a job as soon as you can.
