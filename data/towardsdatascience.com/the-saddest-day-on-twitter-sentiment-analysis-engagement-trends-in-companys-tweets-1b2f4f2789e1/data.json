The time has come to see in detail what insights could be drawn from this exercise in copywriting and communication. Apart from mentions, hashtags, emoji, and text, I was interested to see how our tweets perform depending on the day of the week.", "Because why bother tweeting on Sundays if everyone is on a phone-free brunch?\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Here is how the first few rows of the data frame look like before we started.", "We had 529 rows and 40 columns, but in an initial stage of the analysis we removed some of them (you can see the full data analysis in this notebook).", "The first step is to handle our favourite variable which is datetime! Anyone else still confuses strftime with strptime? \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It\u2019s like confusing the left and the right side, maybe we\u2019ll never cure ourselves of it.", "We\u2019ll split the column into date and hour and extract the name of the day of the week.", "What this allows us to do is to group the data frame by day and extract means for each day of the week.", "Notice how I\u2019ve so cleverly grouped by day_name (the human friendly name), but sorted by day which is a numerical representation. If you sorted by day_name you\u2019d get days sorted alphabetically, and that\u2019s not helpful. \u261d\ufe0f", "This is enough progress for us to plot the values.

Different values have different scales, compare for example impressions with engagement rate, and with a stretched out y-axis the chart might end up not very informative.", "Let\u2019s plot something, say mean engagements, retweets, and likes.", "What do we have here? A big weekend dip! \ud83e\udd14", "To better see the trends, we can normalize these values.", "Still a dip. But, now it\u2019s clear that all values follow the same trend.", "The big dip might be partially caused by very little data from the weekend, since we simply don\u2019t tweet a the weekend, with an assumption people aren\u2019t on Twitter so much.", "Let\u2019s get some insights about average daily impressions. We can easily get the mean values of impressions and the count of all tweets sent on specific weekdays by using aggregator function.", "The `week_impressions` data frame looks like this:", "If we just look at mean impressions, it seems like Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are the best days to tweet. But, what makes this chart unclear is that there are diffrent numbers of tweets sent each day and different mean values of impressions. What would make it clearer is to calculate and plot ratios of: number of tweets sent to number of impressions received per tweet.", "Now what we clearly see that the ratio of tweets to impressions indeed is the highest in the middle of the week.", "One thing we can do with these tweets is also calculate text sentiment. To do this we can use VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) a lexicon and sentiment analysis tool specifically designed to analyse sentiments expressed on social media.", "After downloading the vader lexicon we apply the Sentiment Intensity Analyser to the text column. It will return a dictionary with four values.", "Needless to say, the column will need some cleaning.\ud83e\uddf9 First let\u2019s see how many positive, negative, and neutral tweets we have overall.", "69 negative tweets?! And I thought I was such a hippie-positive tweet fairy. We\u2019ll examine them in a second.", "First let\u2019s create four separate columns, for each type of sentiment value represented as a number. This will be helpful for later calculations.", "Now, we can filter for negative tweets.

It might be that the same \u201cnegative\u201d tweet from our evergreen library gets sent consistently on the same day.", "That weekend is cheerful is probably a combination of: few tweets sent on the weekend overall, and if any, they tend to be lighter\u2014less \u201cbrainy\u201d and less transactional.", "Do any engagement metrics and variables correlate with each other? There is only one way to check. Calculate correlations.", "We can plot the correlation values, although with this many values it might create less rather than more clarity.
