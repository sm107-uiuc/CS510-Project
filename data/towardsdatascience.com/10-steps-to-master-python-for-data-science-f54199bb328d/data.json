Lists are enclosed within Square Brackets \u2018[ ]\u2019.", "A dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Unlike lists and other data structures like tuples or sets, the dictionary data structure has a pair of elements referred to as key and value. The dict() function can be used to assign a dictionary to a variable.", "The tuple data structure is similar to the list data structure where you can define a tuple with a fixed number of elements. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. This prevents any modification of the elements within a tuple as more elements can\u2019t be appended or removed from the specific tuple that is created.", "A set is a collection of unordered elements. These elements are not indexed as well. Sets can be defined by using the set function or by using the curly braces \u2018{}\u2019 with only one element.", "With all these basic concepts covered, we can now move on to the next section of the article.", "Now that you have a basic idea of the working of the various important aspects of Python as discussed in the previous sections of the article, it is equally significant to understand some slightly advanced topics in Python and conceptualize these essential concepts.", "By the following statement, I mean that you need to have a visual perception and intuition of how some of the advanced concepts work.
