This article will delve into adversarial machine learning and cybersecurity for neural networks and machine learning models in general.", "This article borros content from lectures taken at Harvard on AC209b, with much credit going to lecturer Pavlos Protopapas of the Harvard IACS department.", "\u201cPeople worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they\u2019re too stupid and they\u2019ve already taken over the world.\u201d \u2015 Pedro Domingos", "Neural networks are becoming more and more ubiquitous within the modern world, and they are often implemented without much consideration of their potential security flaws. This has led to a new field of cybersecurity which looks at the vulnerabilities of neural networks, and how we can protect them from being leveraged against us by hackers. Although this is a relatively serious matter, in this article, I will take a humorous approach to outline the vulnerabilities of neural networks which I hope the reader will find both fun and informative.", "In this article, I will give the reader a comprehensive introduction to the field of adversarial machine learning, whereby attempts are made to fool, poison, or manipulate machine learning models to in order to circumvent their intrinsic purpose, often for malicious purposes.", "The questions I aim to answer in this tutorial are:", "This issue is of greatest concern for neural networks due to their underlying architecture and learning procedure, so the majority of this article focuses on these networks, although other examples are given.", "You probably never knew, but you likely use neural networks every day without a second thought. Ever asked Siri a question? There\u2019s a neural network. Self-driving cars? Neural networks. Face recognition on your camera? More neural networks. Alexa? Once again, neural networks\u2026", "These are just the applications that are tangible, there are plenty of intangible applications of neural networks that people use every day. Whether it is the software program you use at work or just searching for a place to go to dinner that evening, you are likely using some form of neural network (I say that generally as there are copious different types of networks).", "The pervasiveness of these networks is only likely to increase, and there is a good reason for it. Neural networks are universal function approximators. What does that mean? It means that if my neural network has a large enough capacity (i.e. enough nodes \u2014 weights and biases \u2014 which can be modified) then I am able to approximate any non-linear function using the neural network. This is a very powerful statement, as I can learn essentially any function, no matter how complex.", "There is a price we pay for this though, and that is that networks can be rather sensitive to the inputs that you give them. Therefore, it is relatively easy to fool with the network if you know the right buttons to push, so to speak. By manipulating certain nodes of images it is easy to activate neurons associated with particular features, which can make the network give spurious outputs.", "This may seem relatively innocent, after all, as Ian Goodfellow shows in his seminal paper it is quite comical to see a neural network randomly turn a panda into a gibbon. However, the real application of these kinds of attacks can be quite daunting.", "Let\u2019s take the case of Alexa, say that you use Alexa to buy things on a regular basis. One day, a particularly smart hacker sits outside of your house (often called wardriving in the cybersecurity world) and hacks your Wifi \u2014 this is surprisingly easy to do with aircrack-ng if you have not secured your router properly or still have a default password.", "The hacker now has access to Alexa, which has security privileges to make transactions on your behalf, giving your verbal approval. If the hacker is smart enough, it is conceivably possible that they could fool Alexa into giving away all of your money to the hacker, just by pushing the right buttons on the neural network.", "This might terrify you, and you might be about to go and throw Alexa away. However, just because this is possible does not mean that it is easy. There are \u2018attacks\u2019 that can be implemented on neural networks, and most firms with smart engineers behind their products have at least considered that this might be a problem.", "We will now dive into how one might attack a neural network, the kinds of attacks that are possible, and how engineers and data scientists can help to protect their networks from these potential vulnerabilities.", "In this section, I will introduce the reader to the taxonomy of adversarial attacks.", "Essentially, attacks on neural networks involve the introduction of strategically placed noise designed to fool the network by falsely stimulating activation potentials that are important to produce certain outcomes. To really understand what I mean when I say \u2018strategically place noise\u2019, consider the following image developed by Google Brain to show how the same effect can fool humans. Do you think the picture on the left and the right are both cats? Or dogs? Or one of each?", "In terms of a classification algorithm which has decision boundaries, here is an illustration of how the network is corrupted by the introduction of the strategic noise.", "There are two main types of attacks that are possible: white box attacks and black box attacks. Grey box attacks arise in the cybersecurity field but are not present in neural attacks.", "A white box attack occurs when someone has access to the underlying network. As a result, they will know the architecture of the network. This is analogous to a white box penetration test of a company\u2019s IT network\u2014 these are routinely done in the corporate world to test the defensive capabilities of companies IT infrastructure. Once a hacker understands how your IT network is structured, it makes it much easier to sabotage. This is a situation where the phrase knowledge is power is especially true, as knowing the structure of the network can help you select the most damaging attacks to perform, and also helps to unveil weaknesses relevant to the network structure.", "A black box attack occurs when the attacker knows nothing about the underlying network. In the sense of neural networks, the architecture can be considered as a black box. Whilst it is more difficult to perform attacks on a black box, it is still not impervious. The underlying procedure for black box attacks was first described by Papernot et al. (2015).", "Presuming that we are able to test as many samples as we like on the network, we can develop an inferred network by passing a bunch of training samples into the network and obtaining the output. We can then use these labeled training samples as our training data and train a new model to obtain the same output as the original model.", "Once we have our new network, we can develop adversarial examples for our inferred network and then use these to perform adversarial attacks on the original model.", "This model does not depend on knowing the architecture of the network, although this would make it easier to perform the attack.", "As you might have already realized, these attacks are all software attacks, but it is actually possible to physically attack the network. I do not know of any implementations of this that have actually occurred, but several research studies have looked at using \u2018adversarial stickers\u2019 to try and fool the network. Below is an example.", "Clearly, this presents a potential problem for the mass adoption of self-driving cars. Nobody would want their car to ignore a stop sign and continue driving into another car, or a building, or a person. Do not be too alarmed though, there are ways to protect networks against all of these types of attacks, which I will get into later.", "All of the attacks we have discussed up to now have been evasion attacks, i.e. they have involved \u2018fooling\u2019 a system. A good example would be fooling a spam detector that guards email accounts so that you are able to get your spam emails into someone\u2019s inbox. Spam detectors often use some form of machine learning model (like a naive Bayes classifier) that can be used for word filtering. If an email contains too many \u2018buzzwords\u2019 that are typically associated with spam email (given your email history as the training data), then it will be classified as spam. However, if I know these words I can deliberately change them to make it less likely that the detector will consider my email as spam, and I will be able to fool the system.", "Another good example is in computer security, where machine learning algorithms are often implemented in intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or intrusion prevention systems (IPSs). When a network packet reaches my computer that has the characteristic signature of a piece of malware, my algorithm kicks in and stops the packet before it can do anything malicious. However, a hacker can use obfuscated code to \u2018confuse\u2019 the network so that it does not flag up a problem.", "As a final example, some researchers at MIT developed a 3D printed turtle whose texture was able to fool Google\u2019s object detection algorithm and make it classify the turtle as a rifle. This last one is a bit concerning given that Google\u2019s algorithm is currently used in many industries for commercial purposes.", "Poisoning attacks involve compromising the learning process of an algorithm. This is a slightly more subtle and insidious procedure than evasion attacks, but only works on models that participate in online learning, i.e. they learn on the job and retrain themselves as new experiences (data) become available to them. This may not sound like too big of a problem until we consider some examples of poisoning attacks.", "To go back to our IDSs example, these are constantly updated using online learning since new viruses are always being developed. If one wishes to prevent a zero-day attack, it is necessary to give these systems the capability of online learning. An attacker could poison the training data by injection carefully designed samples to eventually compromise the whole learning process. Once this happens, your IDS becomes essentially useless, and you are at much greater risk from potential viruses and likely will not even realize. Poisoning may thus be regarded as adversarial contamination of the training data. The same could be said of our spam detector example.", "This section has given us a broad overview of the kinds of problems we might expect. In the next section, we will look more closely at how to deal with white and black box attacks, the most common types of adversarial attacks, and the defenses one can use in their neural networks to ameliorate these security concerns.", "Ian Goodfellow (the creator of the generative adversarial network, and the one who coined the term) published one of the first papers looking at potential security vulnerabilities in neural networks. He decided to call this \u2018adversarial machine learning\u2019, which is relatively easy to confuse with the generative adversarial network. Just to make it clear, they are not the same.", "Ian described the first kind of attack, the Fast Gradient Step Method. This manipulates the sharp decision boundaries used by the classifier by the introduction of strategic noise, as we have been discussing up to now.", "There are a number of new attack vectors that have been developed over the past couple of years, the main ones being:", "To prevent this article for stretching on for too long, I will not go into the specific details of each algorithm. However, feel free to comment if you would like me to cover these in more detail in a future article.", "There are a number of methods that have been developed to defend neural networks from the various types of attack vectors that we have discussed.", "The best way of defending against adversarial attacks is through adversarial training. That is, you actively generate adversarial examples, adjust their labels, and add them to the training set. You can then train the new network on this updated training set and it will help to make your network more robust to adversarial examples.", "Regularization is always the answer. In this sense, it is the derivatives with respect to the data that we are regularizing. This acts to smoothen the decision boundaries between classes and makes it less easy to manipulate network classification using strategic noise injection.", "Mixup is a simple procedure that seems a little bit odd at first, it involves mixing two training examples by some factor \u03bb, which is between zero and one, and assigning non-integer classification values to these training samples. This acts to augment the training set and reduces the optimistic classification tendencies for networks. It essentially diffuses and smoothens the boundaries between classes and reduces the reliance of classification on a small number of neuron activation potentials.", "For those of you unfamiliar with the tale of Clever Hans, I recommend you give it a Google. The essential story is of a horse who supposedly was able to do basic arithmetic by stamping his feet a given number of times. However, it was later discovered that the horse was actually cheating and responding to the verbal and visual clues of the surrounding crowd.", "In the same spirit, CleverHans is a Python library that has been developed to benchmark machine learning systems\u2019 vulnerability to adversarial examples. If you are developing a neural network and want to see how robust it is, test it out with CleverHans and you will find get an idea of its level of vulnerability. This is analogous to using the Burp Suite to test for code injection vulnerabilities.", "As with any form of cybersecurity, you can always pay someone to hack you and see how much damage they do. However, you can make them sign a document which specifies limits on what the attacker is allowed to do. This gives you an idea of your level of vulnerability to an actual cyber attack. I have no knowledge of whether penetration testing firms offer these kinds of services at the current time, but it would not surprise me.", "I hope you enjoyed this article and now have a better understanding of this interesting new subfield of cybersecurity that involves the compromising of machine learning models through various attack vectors.", "This field is still very new and there are a plethora of research papers that can be found, most of which are available on arxiv, meaning that they are free to view by the public. I recommend you give a few of them a read \u2014 the articles in the references are a good place to start.", "For updates on new blog posts and extra content, sign up for my newsletter.", "[1] Panda, P., Chakraborty, I., and Roy, K., Discretization based Solutions for Secure Machine Learning against Adversarial Attacks. 2019.", "[5] Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Jha, S., Fredrikson, M., Celik, Z.B., and Swami, A.
