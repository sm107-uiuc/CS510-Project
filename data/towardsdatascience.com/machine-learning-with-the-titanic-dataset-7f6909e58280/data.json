For this reason, I want to share with you a tutorial for the famous Titanic Kaggle competition. If you follow this, you will have a reasonable score at the end but I will also show up some categories where you can easily improve the score. After you have finished reading you can take the model and improve it by yourself. If you are interested in machine learning, the dramatic sinking of the Titanic is a good starting point for your own data science journey. Good luck!", "If you are completely new to Kaggle, check out this tutorial for the set up process. You will find the data set and so on here.", "After you can loading the files in the Kaggle kernel:", "Which variables are in our dataset:", "pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)1st = Upper2nd = Middle3rd = Lower", "sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way\u2026Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsisterSpouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc\u00e9s were ignored)", "parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way\u2026Parent = mother, fatherChild = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepsonSome children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.", "In a first step we will investigate the titanic data set. Kaggle provides a train and a test data set. The train data set contains all the features (possible predictors) and the target (the variable which outcome we want to predict). The test data set is used for the submission, therefore the target variable is missing. Let\u00b4s have a look at the data sets:", "How I already wrote in the introduction, the target variable \u201cSurvived\u201d is missing in the test data set. All other columns appears in both dataframs. In sum we have 11 different variables which can be used as features to predict the outcome of our target. You can see at first sight that there are missings for \u201cCabin\u201d. Missings can irritate our algorithms, so it is important task to clean up the data in a first step.", "In the training data we have missings in the age, cabin and embarked column. In the test data set are missings in the age, fare and cabin column. We will concat both data sets and perform the data cleansing for the entire data set.", "20% of our age column is missings. Let\u00b4s have a look at the distribution:", "We don\u00b4t want to delete all rows with missing age values, therefore we will replace the missings. As you can see we have a right-skrewed distribution for age and the median should a good choice for substitution.", "One thesis was that the median of age differs for the passenger classes. Professional advancement usually comes with increasing age and experience. Therefore, people with a higher socio-economic status are older on average. If we split up by sex we see that there is still a difference because women are younger in general. In a last step I have checked the number of cases to ensure that there are still enough cases in each category. We will use these median values to replace the missings.", "We have just one missing fare value in the whole data set. Mr. Thomas was in passenger class 3, travelled alone and embarked in Southhampton. We will take other cases from people in this category and replace the missing Fare with the median of this group.", "There are a lot of missing values but we should use the cabin variable because it can be an important predictor. As you can see in the following picture, the first class had the cabins on deck A, B or C, a mix of it was on D or E and the third class was mainly on f or g. We can identify the deck by the first letter.", "There are significant differences in survival rates because guests on the upper decks were quicker on the lifeboats. We will group up some decks.", "There are just two missings for embarked. As we already tried for the fare case we can look up similiar cases to replace the missing value. It stands to reason that people who paid a similar amount, also had a class 1 ticket and were on the same deck, embarked from the same location. I also read in the Kaggle forum that you can google individual passengers, so i gave it a try:", "Regarding to the linked articles both embarked in Southhampton. Data science is about research, too!", "We have filled every missing value in our data set and didn\u00b4t drop a column yet. We used statistical methods for age and fare, created a new category for cabin and did some research for the missings in embarked. Let\u00b4s have a double check if everything is fine now.", "Feature engineering is an art and one of the most exciting things in the broad field of machine learning. I really enjoy to study the Kaggle subforums to explore all the great ideas and creative approaches. The titanic data set offers a lot of possibilities to try out different methods and to improve your prediction score. We will focus on some standards and I will explain every step in detail.", "Techniques we will use so far:- Binning continous variables (e.g. Age)- Create new features out of existing variables (e.g. Title)- Label encoding for non numeric features (e.g. Sex)- One hot encoding for categorial features (e.g. Pclass)", "As you can see, there are outliers for both age and fare. The range of values is much higher for fare compared to age. We will cut the distribution into pieces so that the outliers do not irritate our algorithm. For fare we will assign the same number of cases to each category and for Age we will build the categories based on the values of the variable. This is also the difference between cut and qcut. With cut, the bins are formed based on the values of the variable, regardless of how many cases fall into a category. With qcut we decompose a distribution so that there are the same number of cases in each category.", "On average, younger passengers have a higher chance of survival and so do people with higher ticket prices. Young people were probably rescued first and the people with higher ticket prices had access to the lifeboats first.", "There are two interesting variables in our data set which tells us something about family size. SibSp defines how many siblings and spouses a passenger had and parch how many parents and childrens. We can summarize these variables and add 1 (for each passer-by) to get the family size.", "One thesis is that families have a higher chance of survival than singles because they are better able to support themselves and were rescued with priority. However, if the families are too large, coordination is likely to be very difficult in an exceptional situation.", "We expect a correlation between ticket frequencies and survival rates, because identical ticket numbers are an indicator that people have travelled together.", "As expected there are some differences between the survival rates for each ticket frequency.", "The name provides us very important information about the socioeconomic status of a passenger. We can answer the question if someone is married or not or if someone has a formal title which could be an indicator for a higher social status.", "There are quite a lot of different titles in our data set. We only consider title with more than 10 cases, all others we will assign to the category \u201cmisc\u201d.", "This Kaggle Competetion allows us to use information from the test data set. At this point we would like to point out that for high scores you have to be creative with the data. It is almost like a hackathon. In a Realworld task, you would not normally have the opportunity to do this. We will identify family names of passengers. Then we can see if there are any family members that are present in both the training and the test data set.", "People with a Master\u2019s degree and women have survived significantly more often and, on average, have larger families at the same time. We assume that if a master or woman is marked as a survivor in the training data set, family members in the test data set will also have survived.", "In women with a family size of 2 or more, most often all or none of them die.", "The same applies for families of passengers with master in their title.", "Most algorithms cannot do anything with strings, so the variables are often recoded before modeling. Label Encoding maps non-numerical values to numbers. For sex, for example, 0 and len(sex)-1, which is, 1.", "This leads to another problem. Many algorithms assume that there is a logical sequence within a column. However, this is not always expressed by the numerical ratio. Therefore it is needed to one hot encoding the variables afterwards. The column Sex then becomes two columns Sex_1 and Sex_2, in which it is binary coded whether someone was male or female. So the algorithm can usually process the information better.", "For our first prediction we choose a Random Forrest Classifier. RFCs are easy to understand and proven tools for classification tasks.", "We still define the columns that we do not need to consider for modelling. For Embarked, for example, we have created dummy columns, so we can drop the original Embarked column. As training/test split we choose 75% and 25%. We train the algorithm with the training data set and then test predictive power with the test data set.", "The criteria in brackets for RFC are not mandatory, if you leave them out, default settings are used. The given parameters are already optimized so that our classifier works better than with the default parameters.", "Our predicting score is almost 86%, which means that we have correctly predicted our target, i.e. the survival rate, in 86% of cases. This is already a good value, which you can now further optimize. Please find below a viszualization of our random forrest tree.", "We made the entire journey in a small data science project. We explored the data, cleaned up the data, then we modified features and created new ones and in a last step we made a prediction with a random forest tree classifier. But there is still a lot to do, next you can test the following things:- Do other algorithms perform better?- Can you choose the bins for Age and Fare better?- Can the ticket variable be used more reasonable?- Is it possible to further adjust the survival rate?- Do we really need all features or do we create unnecessary noise that interferes with our algorithm?", "Below you find some great resources to start with.", "If you enjoy Medium and Towards Data Science and didn\u2019t sign up yet, feel free to use my referral link to join the community.", "Your home for data science.
