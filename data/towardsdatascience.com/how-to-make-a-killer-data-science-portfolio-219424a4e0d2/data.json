It\u2019s absolute torture if you are trying to find a job right now, as Data Scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st-century\u00b9 due to enormous competition, which is growing day by day.", "The reality is that unless you stand out and brag about yourself you are not going to make it happen. Hey, if you don\u2019t do it for yourself no one else will.", "This is what I told myself when I was hunting for a job and not getting anywhere by simply applying with CV and sharing LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.", "Everybody is busy with their own lives you need to make it special and demand the time. Then I thought having a killer portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills and interests is not a bad idea.", "But how do I do it?", "As Julia Nikulski mentioned in her post, as data scientists, we don\u2019t work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript or Flask that often. For a typical Data Scientist coding and creating a website is clearly time-consuming and no guarantee on the quality.", "After quick research on Google, I found hundreds of tutorials that can help you in building and deploying a decent one-page portfolio under 30 minutes. But they are not really of a killer standard quality and also I need to pay a small amount of money for domain and hosting services which I am not ready to do.", "I pledged myself not to invest a lot of time and effort in creating a website as it is just a sidekick but yet wanted to have a killer website that grabs attention and as I am particularly interested in NLP I definitely wanted to integrate a chatbot in it as it can speak out to the user that I show extra interest in NLP. To be precise my personal demands are", "No HTML / Java Script Code", "Single design for Laptop, Tablet and Mobile layouts", "If you are thinking my demands are impractical and maybe even greedy. But I promise you it is possible. You can see my portfolio here. It is definitely not achievable if you use only one source, you need to use 3 sources.", "Webflow to create the website, Landbot for chatbot and Canva for the logo. All these sources offer freemium services. I made sure to stick to free-range.", "The reason for choosing Webflow is because you can deploy your website with just a button click and with your name in the domain and free hosting service. For navigating to Chatbot, GitHub, Linkedin pages you can use buttons with the hyperlink. All free of cost. More on Lanbot and Canva in the next section.", "You can get an awesome portfolio website like this in 3 simple steps.", "Create a logo for your website.", "Though this is not mandatory I highly recommend making your own logo as it immediately brings feel for the user that he/she is entered in your realm.", "You can use canva.com to quickly make your logo from the available free logo templates. If you have a design ready in your mind you can get it done in less than 5 minutes and download as an image.", "Which you will be using later in Webflow while creating the website.", "Having a personal chatbot elevate your portfolio and makes it interactive and playful. If you are interested in the NLP field like me I consider its a must ad on.", "You have two choices here. One you can make a simple chatbot yourself in python that can have a chat about your education, personal projects, sharing your contact details e.t.c. The second one you can use free platforms like Lanbot and create a playful basic chatbot in less than 15 minutes.", "If you want to go with the first option and looking for some help you can follow the piece by Jere Xu", "For the second option (which I have used ) there are lots of platforms like Dialogflow, Collect.chat, Chatfuel, Morph.ai, Landbot.io e.t.c.", "The reason for choosing Landbot.io is because to the best of my knowledge this is the only platform that not only gives you JavaScript snippet for integration but also a hyperlink which I can use under a button for navigation.", "Creating a chatbot in Landbot is easy and self-explanatory once you are in. It works more of like if-else loops. If you need more information you can see Landbot\u2019s academy page.", "Landbot keeps track of the users and provide analytics on who used when, where and how.", "If you are in a Data Science field you know how useful the tracking data and information will be.", "You can see my fully developed chatbot here.", "In Webflow you can build a website by using drag and drop of inbuilt tools if you want to build a website from scratch or else better option is that you can select and clone hundreds of already built websites made with Webflow.", "You can see templates in the showcase tab. All you have to do is select of one of them that suits your style and taste and make sure you click on clonable to see only websites that are allowed to clone.", "Pro Tip: Almost all of the websites in Webflow are strikingly beautiful and I felt it very difficult to choose the best among them. It would help you if you write down the features that you are looking for to filter out easily.", "Make sure in the project settings you choose an appropriate domain name. I used \u2018tejesh-ai\u2019 with my name in it and upload the logo you have designed in the icon section.", "The portfolio that I have created is cloned from Jimmy Made things website. I have made a few changes to the cloned version by inserting my Logo and also by creating buttons to let the user navigate to my chatbot and Github.", "I have listed some of my selective projects in the work page using collections and designed a button for GitHub page navigation at bottom of each project.", "After all the changes just make sure how it looks on different layouts especially in mobile. If there are any position changes of the elements that you want to make get it done and hit on publish button on the top.", "That\u2019s it, you can copy and add the link now in your CV, Linkedin, Twitter and share it with the world.", "I know it's not easy to stand out of the crowd in this highly competitive Data Science field but doing little things like adding up a portfolio to your profile definitely gives you an edge. If somebody starts a conversation with you after seeing your portfolio don't be surprised.", "If you decide to make a portfolio please don\u2019t settle for mediocre UX designs when you have an option to make a killer portfolio easily.", "One piece of advice I would like to give is to keep your Portfolio alive. No matter what, the projects and works that you add are what people look into more than anything. So please keep updating the works that you do in your portfolio \ud83d\udc4b.", "Let me know if you have tried this and if you face any blockades, leave a comment in this post I will try my best to help.", "Your home for data science.
