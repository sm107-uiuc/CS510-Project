The first part will be about image processing basics (old school computer vision techniques that are still relevant today) and then the second part will be deep learning related stuff :)", "I personally understand it as the bridge between the virtual world and the physical world as we know it. It is the eyes that we implant on machines for them to \u201cgain consciousness\u201d and navigate our world in intelligent ways that\u2019s never been explored before. It is actually used in:", "There\u2019s TONS of other Computer Vision projects that\u2019s going on right now and undoubtedly, Computer Vision applications will proliferate and then seamlessly integrate into our daily lives \u2014 changing the way we live as we know it. So without further ado,", "With reference to the diagram above, assuming we have a digital image with dimensions 400 x 400, this means that our image is 400 pixels row wise (x direction) and 400 pixels column wise (y direction). So digital images are represented by a 2-Dimensional Matrix. Each individual pixel will then contain information (like intensity, data type, alpha value, etc) and the computer will understand how to interpret or process the image based on this information.", "Computer Vision algorithms existed since the 1970s and image operations can largely be divided into two main categories \u2014 Spatial Domain and the Frequency Domain. It may be helpful to understand which image processing methods are available so image pre-processing can be done before it is fed into Deep Learning algorithms so as to yield better results.", "Spatial Domain Methods \u2014 We deal with the digital image as it is (the original digital image is already in the spatial domain). Referencing the diagram above, because each pixel contains a certain set of information, we can manipulate and change this information based on certain techniques to achieve specific results. Methods include:", "Frequency Domain Methods \u2014 Unlike spatial domain methods, we first transform our image into the frequency distribution (with methods like Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform, or Z Transform), then we process the image. After that is done, we perform an inverse transformation and then get back a new image in the spatial domain.", "If we look at the diagram above, we can see that the original digital image on the left is very noisy (with diagonal lines running across the image). If we apply Fourier Transformation to this image, we can see that the image on the right (fftshift is applied so the zero-frequency component to the center of the array) has bright spots (\u201cpeaks\u201d) in the middle of the image. These peaks corresponds to the noise pattern on the left (those diagonal lines/edges running across the image).", "If we set these bright spots to intensity zero, and then perform an Inverse Fourier Transformation, we can see that some of the diagonal lines (noise) are faded away.", "As shown with this example, we can utilize image processing techniques (either with spatial domain methods or frequency domain methods) to perform pre-processing on images first before feeding it into your deep learning models. Additionally, some of the most popular traditional Computer Vision techniques include:", "I\u2019ve included links so you can click into it and read more about each algorithm. Next, we\u2019ll look at some of the common Computer Vision tasks that Deep Learning can help us with (and are being widely explored in the field) if traditional Computer Vision techniques are not sufficient.", "In a nutshell, Deep Learning is inspired and loosely modeled after neural networks of the human brain \u2014 where neurons are connected to each other, receives some input, and then fires an output based on weights and bias values. Common Computer Vision tasks that Deep Learning helps us with include\u2014 Image Classification, Localization/Saliency Detection, Object Identification, Detection and Tracking, Face Recognition, Scene Understanding, Image Generation and Image Analysis. Some of the most popular Deep Learning techniques (Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-Supervised) include:", "and many more. I\u2019ll try to give a quick overview of how Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) works (to keep this article relatively short and easy-to-read). If you\u2019d like to find out more about the other Deep Learning techniques, do try googling for them \u2014 GAN is really cool, it\u2019s something people are using in an attempt to generate Art :) Anyways, here goes (CNN):", "In a nutshell, it\u2019s like passing through a series of digital images through a series of \u201cstuff\u201d (more specifically convolutional layer, RELU layer, POOLing or downsampling layer, and then a Fully-connected layer for example) that will extract and learn the most essential information about the images and then build the neural network model. Then, once this model is trained, we can pass a testing image through this model and if this model yields good results, it should be able to predict what it is. If you rather not train your own models, there are various pre-trained models available online as well.", "Slightly irrelevant side note \u2014 I still remember training a neural network model with Google Collab in the school library and when then chased me out because they had to close I stood right at the library entrance to wait for my models to finish training coz I wanted the Wifi (\u3186_\u3186). So yeah point is, if you don\u2019t have the hardware (like a GPU) to train your models you might want to consider Google Collab Notebooks. You\u2019ll just need Wifi with it.", "A quick note about datasets \u2014 Generally, we use datasets to train, validate, and test our models. Popular Datasets Used:", "That\u2019s it for this article! As mentioned in various articles, I think integrating traditional Computer Vision methods with Deep Learning techniques will better help us solve our computer vision problems. Additionally, I know some of you lovely readers are deep tech researchers and practitioners who are much more experienced and seasoned than I am \u2014 please feel free to let me know if there\u2019s anything that needs correcting or if you have any thoughts about it at all.", "Your home for data science.
