Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship", "I think these three points are key factors for using PyCharm, but there are also many other great advantages: auto-formatting, advanced search, error checking, easy navigation, smart refactoring, profiling, coloring...", "If you have set up a deep learning environment on an Ubuntu machine, you know how hard it is to match versions of all those drivers, software, and libraries. If you have not faced any difficulty, congrats! But you probably have not updated any of your drivers, CUDA, or deep learning (Tensorflow, PyTorch\u2026) library yet, which means you can meet with this difficulty at any time.", "Deep learning frameworks (especially TensorFlow) are very aggressive on version updating, which may lead to an incompatibility with the CUDA version or NVIDIA Driver. Sometimes, it is very hard to match the release of these softwares. In addition, if you accidentally install different versions of NVIDIA or CUDA drivers at the same time, it might be complicated to deal and you may need to format your system.", "Docker solves these issues. You only install NVIDIA driver and the rest is managed by Docker containers.", "For example, you are working on TensorFlow, but you have seen that in the new version of PyTorch, there is perfect functionality for your task, and you want to try it. It is challenging to manage different frameworks (and different versions, too) in the same machine. With Docker, you can manage it. It abstracts the system above the hardware driver; therefore, you can run different versions of the frameworks and CUDA at the same time. It is similar to a virtual machine but not as heavy as that. There are many advantages of using Docker, but in this article, I am not going to tell those. There are already many great articles on the web that you can read and get information extensively.

Get familiar with the Docker environment (it may take up to one work-day to fully understand what is image, container, how to fetch from Docker Hub, and how Docker system works in general, but you will be rewarded).", "2.2. Download the Docker image of your favorite deep learning framework to the remote machine.", "Now, it is time to connect the PyCharm Python interpreter to the Python environment in the Docker container.", "1. Start the Docker container. Forward port 8022 (you can change this) to 22 (it is a must for SSH connection). Example:", "2. Using the terminal of the main OS, check if you actually forwarded your port 8022 to 22 of container.", "3. Set up SSH server in the Docker container.", "4. I was unable to SSH into root user in the container so I created another sudo user and established an SSH connection to it.", "5. Now, you should commit your container as a new image. Otherwise, you will lose all the updates you have made into your contanier when you terminate it. I generally add -ssh tag to the end of committed image.", "7. Start a new Docker container from the commited image.", "8. Check SSH status, it will be disabled when the container starts (but you can set it to start automatically when the container starts), start SSH server.", "9.

PyCharm is first connected to the remote machine, then the SSH connection is forwarded (by Docker) to our container.", "Before directly connecting from PyCharm to Docker container, you can test SSH connection with a program like Putty (again, be careful about the port number and username) to be sure everything is OK on the container side.", "Now you can develop your algorithm on PyCharm IDE as if your training is running on your local PC.", "If you have any question or improvement, please comment.", "Found this article useful?
