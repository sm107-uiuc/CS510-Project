We can see the number of addresses holding no less than 1 Bitcoin keeps rising.", "But what stops people like you from buying your first Bitcoin? Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, and volatility stops people from buying the asset. Price can drop and rise 10% in a few hours. No joke.", "So when should you buy Bitcoin? This is crucial for retail investors like you and me who don\u2019t have a huge sum of money. We can\u2019t afford to lose.", "How to Time your Buy-in?The simplest answer is\u2014 you don\u2019t.", "Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a common strategy to accumulate Bitcoin, and is gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency world. Instead of taking risks and speculating on the Bitcoin price, you spend the same amount of dollars on Bitcoin every month (or every week, or every day), regardless of the price.", "For instance, you buy $10 dollars worth of Bitcoin every day regardless of the price. You would probably miss out when the price hits the bottom, but it mitigates the impact of volatility on purchasing a huge amount of Bitcoin at once. It would also stop you from any impulse purchase.", "Na\u00efve DCA is the easiest risk-averse strategy to gradually accumulate Bitcoins. Nevertheless, sometimes you might sense that the price is too high, and you would want to avoid buying Bitcoin that day.", "While it is usually not a good idea to let your emotions drive your investment decisions, we could rely on some technical indicators to signal your buy-ins. You can then tweak your strategy a little and buy say $10 worth of Bitcoin only when the asset is considered \u2018oversold\u2019.", "Let\u2019s take the relative strength index (RSI) as an example. It is typically used on a 14-day timeframe, and measured on a scale from 0 to 100. Traditionally, the asset is considered oversold when RSI is lower than 30. Therefore, if you might leverage this \u2018buy signal\u2019 and only employ dollar-cost averaging when RSI < 30.", "In fact, this conditional DCA strategy usually performed better than na\u00efve DCA. The plot above shows the average cost in USD per Bitcoin should you started buying Bitcoins at different times using na\u00efve DCA or various conditional DCA tactics.", "Even if you started employing na\u00efve DCA at the end of 2017 during the \u2018cryptocurrency bubble\u2019, which is probably the worst time to invest in cryptocurrencies, the average cost of Bitcoin accumulated is no greater than $7,000. The price of Bitcoin at the time of writing (May 2020) is hovering around the $9,000 region.", "From another plot shown below, you could visualise the return on investment (ROI) should you start accumulating coins at different times with various strategies. A zero ROI means breaking even. In hindsight, ROI is positive no matter when you started employing DCA strategies.", "The downside of conditional DCA strategies is that the conditions that you come up with might be too stringent such that it does not happen frequently. Take the above-mentioned RSI as an example, RSI < 30 only happened ~10% of the time in history. This is not ideal for budgeting.", "Price volatility should not stop you from investing in the future. Many Americans already bought Bitcoin with their stimulus cheques from the government.", "Caveats: the past does not predict the future. You should do your own research before investing in cryptocurrencies.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
