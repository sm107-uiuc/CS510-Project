The first is local wealth creation: how do we ensure local investment creates wealth that stays in and is controlled by the local community? The second is data ownership: what are the alternatives to our current laissez faire data ownership model which returns control and oversight to stakeholders?", "Local data refers to data that generates value primarily when applied to the community that generates it. To an extent, all data is local. For example, your likes and interests are most valuable when used to more accurately targeted you with ads. If your data is used to target someone else, the data may be useful, but it will probably be less valuable. Thus, local data\u2019s value is not exclusively tied to locality, but primarily.", "As data becomes the most valuable resource on the planet, much of this value will emerge from its applications at the local level, be it at an individual, municipal or national level.", "Local wealth creation is intimately related to data ownership. For example, consider transport data. Services such as Uber and Google Maps collect huge amounts of data from people travelling within cities. Google, for instance, will has been known to send users on sub-optimal routes to map out parts of the city that they know little about. This data is then used to improve its service. Google can tell you about traffic delays, public transport routes, give directions, and estimate journey time. Uber uses similar data to predict demand for cars, connect customer journeys with ideal drivers, and thus ensure drivers end up in the best place to fulfil predicted demand.", "There\u2019s a lot going on here. Firstly, all this data is local. While understanding traffic patterns in London might be useful to test a machine learning algorithm modelled on Paris, no user would be able to navigate Paris with a map of London.", "Secondly, all this data is generated locally. This is obvious with the case of Google and sub-optimal directions, but there are less obvious sources too. For example, if 1,000 people drive down the same street every day, Google will be able to construct a normal distribution of journey time and predict when the street is most busy. Commuters, then, are generating data about their local environment which is being captured by a non-local entity.", "Thirdly, consider data access. Users don\u2019t access this data directly but experience the data through apps. This is good for the average person, but one should wonder why far away companies such as Uber know and control more about a city\u2019s transport network than the elected officials in city office.", "The value of this data is generated locally but flows to those who own and control the data. These data owners (such as Google and Uber) are probably not local and are unlikely to have any vested interest in the transport network of the city. For example, even if the network is very poor, these services can still be competitive because they understand the poor network better. Their advantage does not come from investment, but from extraction of data and the value opportunities data creates.", "There\u2019s no reason why local government couldn\u2019t collect and analyse this data instead, nor is there anything stopping them from creating their own apps to pass on these services. And by having local institutions manage local data, the data is used by those who have a vested interest in it, all while the value of the data remains locally held.", "One might argue, however, that value is always locally held \u2014 it\u2019s the convenience users experience from services. But, is it? For example, while Google may not charge for their services, they do use their services for advertising. On Google Maps, for example, a business can pay to appear up on the map. If local data was owned locally, advertising could be eliminated, or \u2014 as is more likely to be the case \u2014 the local business that pays Google to appear on the map could pay the local government instead (possibly at a reduced rate), keeping wealth within the local economy.", "We should also remember that local government isn\u2019t a for-profit venture. With profit taken off the table, local data could be analysed differently, unlocking new sources of value. For example, Google doesn\u2019t profit from using local data to plan better bus routes, but local government would certainly find value in these insights.", "Research into new models of data ownership is genuinely exciting right now. For good or bad, our current laissez faire model of data ownership is being challenged, and organisations such as the Open Data Initiative have begun doing excellent work into alternatives approaches such as data trusts.", "Data trusts, where the task of data stewardship including access and application is given to a specialist group of trustees, is just one model. We might see the establishment of data cooperatives (where individuals pool their data and all share in the value it creates) or data commons (where individuals pool their data, and anyone can access it). We might even see the establishment of bigger programs such as collective transparency (essentially, a massive data commons), possibly facilitated via blockchain technology.", "These models show that it is possible to imagine data ownership differently, while local wealth creation demonstrates the advantages local ownership of local data can bring. For all the convenience of Silicon Valley services, there\u2019s no reason to believe we can\u2019t achieve the same (if not better) at the local level, creating wealth and new insights that benefit the local economy and people.", "Your home for data science.
