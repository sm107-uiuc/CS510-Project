In this initial post, I highlight some of the main concepts and terminology in reinforcement learning. These concepts will be further explained in future blog posts with the applications and implementations in real-world problems.", "Reinforcement learning (RL) can be viewed as an approach which falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It is not strictly supervised as it does not rely only on a set of labelled training data but is not unsupervised learning because we have a reward which we want our agent to maximise. The agent needs to find the \u201cright\u201d actions to take in different situations to achieve its overall goal.", "Reinforcement learning is the science of decision making.", "Reinforcement learning involves no supervisor and only a reward signal is used for an agent to determine if they are doing well or not. Time is a key component in RL where the process is sequential with delayed feedback. Each action the agent makes affects the next data it receives.", "So far we have said that the agent needs to find the \u201cright\u201d action. The right action depends on the rewards.", "Reward: The reward R\u209c is a scalar feedback signal which indicates how well the agent is doing at step time t.", "In reinforcement learning we need define our problem such that it can be applied to satisfy our reward hypothesis. An example would be playing a game of chess where the agent gets a positive reward for winning a game and a negative reward for losing a game.", "Reward Hypothesis: All goals can be described by the maximisation of expected cumulative reward.", "Since our process involves sequential decision making tasks, our actions we make early on may have a long-term consequence on our overall goal. Sometimes it may be better to sacrifice immediate reward (reward at time step R\u209c) to gain more long-term reward. An example applied to chess would be to sacrifice a pawn to capture a rook at a later stage.", "Goal: The goal is to select actions to maximise total future reward.", "In reinforcement learning the agent makes the decisions on which actions to take at each time step A\u209c. The agent makes these decisions based on the scalar reward R\u209c it receives and the observed environment O\u209c.", "The environment receives the action from the agent and emits a new observation O\u209c and scalar reward R\u209c. What happens next to the environment depends on the history.", "History: The history H\u209c is a sequence of observations, actions and rewards up to time t.", "State: The state is the information used to determine what happens next.", "The key difference between the history and state is that the state is a function of the history. The states can be divided into three main types:", "Markov State: A state S\u209c is Markov if and only if", "What we believe what will happen next depends on the agent\u2019s representation of state.", "The environment is also divided into fully observable environment and partially observable environment.", "So far, we have defined how to set up RL problems but not how the RL agent learns or what makes up an agent. An RL agent can have one or more of the three major components:", "RL agents can be categorised into the following types:", "Each of these agent categories will be described in more detail in future blogs.", "There are two fundamental problems in sequential decision making:", "Since reinforcement learning is like a trial-and-error learning approach, the agent needs to learn from its experiences in the environment to make decisions without losing too much reward. It needs to consider exploitation and exploration with a balance between exploring new information and using known information to maximise reward.", "If you enjoyed this post and want to see more don\u2019t forget follow and/or leave a clap.", "Your home for data science.
