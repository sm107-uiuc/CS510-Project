Yet not only it survived but it is arguably the most common way of reducing the dimension of multivariate data to reveal sometimes hidden, a simplified structure that often underlies it. Others define it as a mathematical algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation in the data set.", "A vital part of using PCA in practice is the ability to estimate how many components are needed to describe the data.
