Topics include: Hypothesis Testing, PCA, SQL Joins, Bias/Variance, Random Forest, Cross-Validation."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["I have seen a lot of data science interview questions that ask you to \u201cdescribe [insert data science concept] to me as though I were a five-year-old. After talking this over with my sister, who is studying to become an elementary school teacher, we decided that this question is a bit hyperbolic, perhaps for emphasis or to be catchy. So I decided to keep the catchy title, but this article will be slightly more focused on explaining these concepts to an adult with a non-technical background. To keep with the theme, however, I have also created graphics to go along with each answer to depict the drawing I would accompany my explanation with if I had access to a whiteboard.", "For hypothesis testing, you first start with a question about a large group. For example, what is the average height of Americans? You guess it is 5 ft. 8 in. (just based on personal experience). You know that you cannot realistically measure the height of every single American, so you randomly pick a smaller group to measure (a random sample).", "To see if the average height of all Americans is really 5 ft. 8 in., you would conduct a hypothesis test! In this example, you would need to use a one-sample t-test, which has a specific equation that I will not go too deep into. The important thing to be aware of here is that you need to know the number of people you measured, their average height, and the standard deviation of their heights (a.k.a. how far away their heights are from the average).", "When you get a value (a t-value) from the t-test, you need to use a chart or program to evaluate whether or not you can conclude you are pretty sure \u2014 95% sure \u2014 that this is the average height of Americans. If your t-value is larger than 1.96 or less than -1.96, you would say that you reject your hypothesis that the average height of all Americans is 5 ft. 8 in. If it is in between that range, you \u201cfail to reject\u201d (this is statistics lingo) your hypothesis and conclude this is the actual average height of Americans.", "Sometimes you have a dataset where you have so many columns (variables) that it is hard to work with. Putting all of these variables into a model would cause it to run slowly and it would also be hard to visualize the relationship between your dependent variable (the one you are trying to predict) and all of your other variables at once. This is where PCA comes in!", "Heads up, I am definitely leaving 5-year-old level explanations for this one. Through some complex math (linear algebra), PCA transforms your variables into \u201ccomponents.\u201d The graph on the left is called a biplot, and it shows that component 1 and component 2 are made up of our original four variables. However, each variable is represented more in one component than another. The green (variable 2) vector, for example, has high values of component 1 but stays under 0.2 for its component 2 values. Thus, variable 2 is more of a significant part of component 1 than component 2.", "The goal here is to have a smaller number of components than the number of variables you have (so your model can run faster). Also, you want your components to retain as much information about the original variables as possible. To analyze this and choose how many of the components to put in a model, you would look at a metric called the explained variance ratio. This metric tells you the percentage of the total variance in the dataset that each component \u201cexplains.\u201d Hopefully, the first illustration in this section makes this idea a little more clear. In an ideal scenario, you would choose the number of components to include in your model by adding up each one\u2019s explained variance ratio until you reach a cumulative total of around 80% or 0.8.", "Finally, one more point for clarification: you lose some ability to interpret the results of your model when you are using PCA components. The best you can do once you figure out which components are meaningful in your model is to look at biplots, like the one above, to show how each of your variables contributes information to each of your components.", "Let\u2019s say you have a database, which is really like a collection of Excel sheets or tables. SQL joins are easiest to understand via example, so here is what the example tables look like:", "For this example, let\u2019s assume that there are some students whose information is in the student table, but they are not in the enrollment table because they are not currently enrolled in classes. Also, there are students enrolled in classes whose information we do not have in the student table. Here is what each type of join would tell you:", "So, the type of SQL join you want to use in your query (a.k.a. your code you send to the database to get data back) depends on the information you want to know. If you want to know the phone numbers of students who are enrolled in classes, use an inner join. If you want the names and year of every student, along with the classes they are in if they happen to be enrolled in anything, then you would use a left join.", "We are now venturing into modeling territory.", "This one is tough to explain to a non-technical audience, so bear with me.", "The bias/variance trade-off is a classic data science concept which states that there is an inherent trade-off between bias and variance when you are creating models. I will start with a description of both of these terms and then briefly explain why there is a trade-off between the two.", "Bias: A model that has high bias does not \u201cfit\u201d the data very well. That is to say, its accuracy is low on the data you use to make the model (the training data) and the data you use to test the model (for more on testing, see the cross-validation section). High bias indicates that there is something missing in your data or you are using the wrong model! Example: your data looks like a 2nd order polynomial (x\u00b2), but you try to use a linear model (x) for predictions, like in the top graph in the illustration.", "Variance: A model that has high variance is very sensitive to small changes in the independent variables of a dataset. This issue is associated with overfitting, where your model fits the data you train it with too well because it identifies noise (or randomness) in the dataset as being important when it really isn\u2019t. Thus, when you introduce new data it has not seen before, it has poor performance in prediction. Example: you fit your data that has a 2nd order polynomial (x\u00b2) relationship with a 20th order polynomial, x\u00b2\u2070 (see graphs above).", "The trade-off between these two issues exists because as you tweak your model to fit your data better, you are decreasing the bias but you necessarily increase the variance. The tension is between under and overfitting the model to the data you have collected.", "The image on the left is one of the most simple decision trees you could make. You start at the top and ask questions about your observation (a row in your dataset) and follow the tree down until you reach an outcome, which would be your predicted y value.", "It is easy with decision trees to overfit them to your data. The worst version of this would be if every outcome of your tree represented exactly 1 observation in your dataset.", "To solve this issue, Random Forest models are used. Essentially, a program will generate a bunch of Decision Trees, and each one will look a little different due to the randomness involved in where the model makes the decision splits. Then, the outcomes of all of these trees are averaged to get a final prediction. This method allows you to make smaller trees and reduce the variance of your model while keeping its accuracy, which is why it is very popular.", "And finally, a bit on validating your models.", "Cross-validation is a best practice when evaluating any kind of machine learning model. The image below shows how you would split your dataset if you wanted to perform cross-validation 3 times (3-fold cross-validation).", "For each split of the data above, you would build your model on the train segments and test your model (generate predictions) on the test set. Then, you can average the accuracy score for each split to get a good picture of how good your model really is. Data scientists do this because then they can use a smaller total amount of data and can test their model on a larger variety of data that the model has not seen before.", "When employers ask these questions, they seem to want to asses two things:", "I hope this article was helpful for you to see concepts broken down, whether you are trying to understand them yourself or better explain them to others. If you happen to have a kid who is around 5 years old, it would be amazing if you could explain one of these to them and let me know how it went. (I\u2019m guessing they may be just a tad confused.) Also, if any of these topics are still unclear to you, please let me know!", "Thanks for reading! Check out my second article in this miniseries here:", "Your home for data science.
