Landing your first data science role is no small feat. If you don\u2019t have the letters PhD after your name it gets even harder. If you scour the internet for entry level data science jobs, you will most likely feel frustrated with the lofty requirements associated with nearly everything you find. It seems like every job description you look at either says PhD required or minimum 3 years experience with machine learning. This begs the question, \u201cHow can you be qualified to work as a data scientist without experience as a data scientist?\u201d Thousands of people take data science courses either online or at a university. These courses are important for building skills, but they won\u2019t be the reason a candidate is selected for a data science job. There is no one way to make your way into data science, but I want to share some of the things I did to gain experience to be prepared to snag my dream job. There are many ways to get experience in data science whether you are a student about to graduate or looking to translation into data science.", "Finding an opportunity to collaborate with someone on an academic paper is a great opportunity to get experience in several important areas of data science. The downsides of doing research is that it isn\u2019t usually paid very well and it doesn\u2019t usually involve things like machine learning. Despite this, I highly recommend finding the chance to do research to boost your data science resume.", "There are two big reasons that doing research should seem attractive. First is the chance to work with data. Because of the nature of research, there is an opportunity to participate in the entire life cycle of data. Some of it, such as data collection, might not be applicable to your future career. Other parts, such as analysis and interpretation are valuable skills. I want to emphasize here the value of being able to interpret data and come to solid conclusions based on an analysis. It is a vital skill that is sometimes overlooked because it is difficult to test as a technical skill. Understanding how to interpret results is the difference between a data scientist and someone who can type \u201cfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\u201d. Working on academic research requires you to come to conclusions based solely on data in a similar way you must help make decisions in industry based on your results.", "Research also gives you the chance to learn how to set up experiments. The amount of influence you have on the experimentation varies based on who you are working with and how many people are working on a paper together. Asking a good question and setting up an experiment to answer it is what almost every academic paper is based on. This skill translates well to data science where you need to ask good questions and set up experiments using machine learning to answer them. Gaining research experience where you are at least helping to drive the research can help make you into a data scientist that can work autonomously and effectively without someone telling you what to solve or how to solve it.", "Finding research opportunities will require slightly different approaches for students and non-students. I have been successful at doing it at both stages. It is important to find someone that is researching something that you are interested in. Extend your interests beyond machine learning for a second, because the people researching machine learning are much fewer than those studying other subjects. Once you have determined what you might like to study, put together a list of people that have related interests. This is where things will differ for students and non-students. If you are a student, I suggest looking at your university. You can usually find a research assistant position that will pay you to do research. This doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go talk to professors who don\u2019t advertise open jobs though. Just diving into a lab of 50 research assistants won\u2019t quite give you the same experience as working one on one with a professor to do research. If you aren\u2019t a student I would reach out to anyone you want to. Send out emails explaining who you are, why you are interested in their research, and how you could see yourself helping. I work remotely with a professor across the country to help contribute to research. There really are no limits. The most important part for everyone is finding the right fit. Find research that is interesting to you, and you will be able to add a significant contribution to.", "This was the biggest help to getting me noticed before I secured a full-time job. The secret is that you don\u2019t have to have data scientist as a job title to do data science. Wherever you are working right now, whether it is an internship or a full-time job, find an opportunity to try something with machine learning. If you do it in a smart way, nobody will be mad if you fail, and you could make a lot of friends if you succeed. Most importantly, you will get some real world data science experience.", "There is no better experience to prepare you for a job in data science than actually working in data science. If you can find a way to do data science in whatever position you currently hold, that is basically the same as working in data science. If you can show you solved a problem wherever you work using machine learning then nobody is going to care what your job title was. They are going to ask you to tell them about that project.", "Another reason that this is good experience is that it shows creativity and problem solving abilities. There will not be anyone telling you what to use machine learning for or how to solve a problem. Similar to the experience gained through research, you can show that you can identify and solve problems creatively and autonomously.", "How you go about doing this is going to depend a lot on where you work and who your manager is. So instead of trying to show you a road map of how to work on machine learning projects at work, I will just tell you how I did it and give you a few tips.", "I was hired as an analytics intern the summer of my junior year. I really wanted a data science internship but was not qualified for one. I thought I was settling by just taking an analytics internship where I was sure my best case scenario was calculating p-values all summer. I was assigned a project looking at trends in sales. During the first 4 or 5 weeks of my internship I cleaned data and analyzed trends. Then I realized that I was way ahead of schedule on my project. I decided to go ahead and try some of the machine learning skills I had gained on my data to see if I could come up with something better than just trends. 2 weeks later, I went to my manager, told her what I had been up to, and showed her my work. It ended up being a very good internship for me and the company got a lot more than it had originally bargained for.", "So here are my takeaways and advice to do this:", "Working on data science projects on your own time has been preached over and over and feels a bit cliche to say. Well, its a cliche because it is true. Doing something cool on your own shows your passion and abilities to work with data that could come from anywhere. It has a different feel from something like Kaggle or a school project and can be very good experience for you.", "The best workers are those that do what they love. An employer wants to hire data scientists that love working on hard problems and solving them. The only people crazy enough to spend their free-time coding and building machine learning models are people who actually love doing it. If doing personal projects feels like a chore to you and you are only doing them to get a job, you might reconsider if you actually love what you are doing. If you do love working on little projects and build up a nice portfolio of them, that shows both drive and ability to your potential employers.", "Personal projects are also a great way to show off technical skills. You should always be trying to learn new skills. Doing a project based on things you are learning both solidifies your learning and can show off to others what you are capable of. As you do more and more projects, your skills will improve and you will be able to do more impressive things to add to your portfolio. Then, you can add your GitHub to your resume and have it act as a miniature technical resume to support your other experience!", "Getting started on a project is the hardest part. If you want to read a really good guide to how to find and complete a worthwhile project to add to your portfolio check out Tyler Folkman\u2019s article here. I will just go over a few key points that I think are important.", "When working on a project there are 3 big parts. You have the data, the modeling, and the results. First, find data that you are interested in. Try to find data that hasn\u2019t been used in a million other projects and that might hold some unique insights. Try to avoid copycat projects other people have done before. Once you find your data, build and evaluate several models to answer whatever your question is. Then, make sure you present your results in an interesting way. That can either be through a blog post, a nice notebook, or a slide show. Showing your project in a nice, understandable way is just as important as doing something cool.", "After you have done all of these things to gain some data science experience, you still need to present it well to get a job. No matter what you work on, you can make it sound either absolutely boring, or interesting and unique. Let\u2019s take a LinkedIn profile for example. You decided to do some research with a professor on whether sunscreen prevents skin cancer and got a cool paper published. Now you want to put it on your LinkedIn profile. You could add something like this:", "That\u2019s a fine thing to put on your LinkedIn. It may not exactly scream I am ready to be a data scientist though. Someone who had the same experience and is trying to get a data science job might want to put something more like this:", "Clearly this is not a perfect version of what you might write. But my point is this: if you did something that you feel makes you more prepared to be a data scientist, don\u2019t be shy about pointing it out. You have to make it obvious you have intentionally sought out experiences that will make you a good data scientist and present that well.", "There are so many ways to get experience in data science before your first job. Don\u2019t feel constrained to class projects and Kaggle competitions. Be creative and go do something fun with your data skills that you are interested in. Once you gain those experiences, make sure they are on display for people to see and read about. Then, don\u2019t be scared to apply for a job that requires a year or two of experience. You can probably make an argument you already have it.", "If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment!", "Your home for data science.
