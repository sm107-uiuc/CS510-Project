It helps us understand people\u2019s attitudes and feelings towards a particular topic.", "While people fear for the Coronavirus, most of us stayed positive. And surprisingly, people tweeted more positive words during the quarantine period, compared to negative words.", "By using the \u201cNRC\u201d lexicon, we can also label the words into eight types of emotions plus positive and negative terms.", "After assigning the labels, we can group the sentiments and generate a word frequency chart like the one below. Also note that some of the terms like music, and money can be found under multiple emotion labels.", "A few insights based on the emotion labeling above:", "Visualization of word relationships is important when doing text mining. By arranging the words into a \u2018network\u2019 graph, we can see how words are connected with one another within a dataset.", "First, we need to tokenize the dataset into bigrams (two-word).
