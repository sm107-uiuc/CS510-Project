Let\u2019s create new columns with data related to time:", "Well, no surprises. Majority of events happened from 7am to 10pm, having the transit pick-hours (8am and 6pm) the most complicated ones. Also, crashes occur less on weekends and at the end of the months (an interesting point that should be better investigated). Note that February is the month with fewer events. This is because it is the summer vacation season for Chileans and Santiago became usually \u201cdesert\u201d at this month.", "A great way to visualize data on GeoPandas is to aggregate data on small areas having a color schema showing us the volume of data present in that specific area. For example, fewer events will result in a light color (as yellow) and more events on a darker color as brown.", "First, we need to split the city into small zones (or polygons).

For that, the GeoPandas function buffer will be used. Note that a single event could be captured in more than one road, on intersections, for example. But we are assuming that this should be important, once all segments are impacted.", "Once we are working with angles in degrees, we must first convert meters to degrees. We can do it with a simple formula:", "and create a buffer for each crash event:", "Next, we need spatial-join roads and buffered crash points", "Below we can inspect the resultant geodataframe.

Doing that, we will have the segments aggregating the crashes. We will add the crashes and the severity index. This way, a fatal event for example, will be 5 times more important than a non-injury one.", "Note that this approuch is completely arbitrary and not scientific. It is only a personal metric used in this article to compare how danger is a road segment.", "Sorting the geodataframe we will get:", "Living in Santiago, this result makes a lot of sense.
