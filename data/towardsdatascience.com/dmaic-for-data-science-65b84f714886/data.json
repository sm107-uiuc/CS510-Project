While it\u2019s really cool that we can make pretty charts and graphs, how can we really show that they provide business value?", "To be successful, we have to learn to frame a data science task as a business problem and define how we can add value.", "I really got thinking about this when I was asked to consult on a potential data project. I was excited about what they were doing, but I wasn\u2019t sure how to get from the really cool idea to an actionable product to deliver to the end user.", "In researching how to create a valuable data product, I discovered DMAIC.", "We can use the data-driven, problem solving methodology DMAIC to think about how we can use data to produce value and improve processes.", "DMAIC is an acronym for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. It is a guideline for delivering sustainable and quantifiable results.", "Is it an exact data science development process? Probably not. But I find it very helpful to think about when you want to show why your analysis is valuable.", "Arguably, this is the most important step. If we can define the problem up front, before digging into any exploratory analysis, feature engineering, or modeling it will help us see the true opportunity \u2014 and to frame it in a meaningful way. To really provide value it can be helpful to think in terms of improving customer satisfaction.", "We need to ask ourselves some important questions to establish an end goal and business case for our project. These questions are also important to establish focus: we need to be able create an actionable product and deliver results on time.", "This step involves data collection: where to get the data and how much do we need are important points to consider here. Also important is data quality.", "How will you compare data at the end of the project to the beginning?", "Two major focus points: Reduce lead time and increase quality. Potential questions to ask here include:", "Finally, the data science part! In this step we can fit our normal data science workflow.", "Ask what are gaps in the current performance and the goal.", "Improve the project and implement the solution.", "This is the iterative step. How can we better the current process to improve your goal? How can we better the analysis of the last step to improve the metrics we previously defined?", "In this step we also identify, test, and implement the solution to the problem. If there is an obvious solution, focus on it. Don\u2019t overcomplicate it!", "Control the improvements: Make the changes stick.", "This final phase where we implement and monitor our product.", "Document your process. Implement a monitoring plan.", "Let\u2019s work through a hypothetical situation to see how we can use DMAIC to determine how we can add value as data scientists.", "We\u2019ll base this scenario on the past competition: Kaggle\u2019s Quora Insincere Question Classification and pretend that we are working as the data science team at Quora.", "As a quick background, Quora is a question answering site. And there is sometimes a problem of people asking questions with ill intent: trying to upset or offend other users. This is obviously bad, so we need to filter out those insincere questions and not let them get posted.", "Let\u2019s imagine a hypothetical and basic current process: There is a team of analysts who manually review each question. If they decide a question is sincere, it will be posted online, otherwise it is marked insincere and excluded from the site.", "This process sounds very labor intensive, time consuming, and inefficient. As the data science team we propose creating a machine learning model to improve the current process.", "In thinking about our hypothetical problem:", "At a high level, the problem with Quora questions is that some people ask questions that are considered toxic. Toxic questions are upsetting and offensive. They could lead to decreased use of the service, and low customer satisfaction. Therefore we need a system to flag and remove these questions.", "The current solution of manual tagging works, but it\u2019s not efficient. Since we\u2019re data scientists, we want to create a new system using machine learning.", "Thus, we have defined our primary goal: Identify and flag insincere questions using machine learning.", "We assumed the current baseline involves manual tagging of questions. While this is very time consuming and inefficient, it is effective and accurate.", "Our proposed solution needs to be faster, but also maintain the accuracy of the current manual approach. We need a way to measure accuracy. The competition used the F1 score, so we can also use this as our main metric. We can also measure analyst hours worked to monitor for efficiency improvements.", "The next steps are analyze and improve. Here we would work through our normal data science process creating and improving on a model to filter out the toxic questions.", "Finally, we are happy with our result so we implement the changes and enter the control phase. We monitor our solution and track improvements.", "If performance declines, we can plan to go back and reanalyze new data. Has there been a change in the types of questions asked or in the way they are worded? If so we might need to update our model.", "DMAIC is a helpful tool to add to our data science toolbox.", "It can be very useful for framing a data science problem in terms that business leaders and stakeholders care about and for ensuring that we stay on track and working towards creating a helpful data product.", "Your home for data science.
