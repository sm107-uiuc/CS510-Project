I wouldn\u2019t need to program all the rules, the machine would learn it for me. But I had no job.", "I started driving Uber on the weekends to pay for my studies.", "I loved meeting new people but I hated driving a car all the time. Traffic, stop, start, fuel do I have enough fuel I think I do, the air, the aircon, changing gears, you shouldn\u2019t go that way you should go this way, all of it.", "I studied machine learning. All day, five days a week. And it was hard. It\u2019s still hard.", "Uber on the weekends. Machine learning during the week. That was my routine. I had to learn. I must learn this, I can\u2019t keep driving, I don\u2019t know what my goal is yet but I know it\u2019s not driving. One Saturday night I earned $280 and got a $290 fine. -$10 for the night.", "9-months into my self-created AI Masters Degree, I got a job. It was the best job I\u2019ve ever had.", "Machine learning is broad. There\u2019s code, there\u2019s math, there\u2019s probability, there\u2019s statistics, there\u2019s data, there\u2019s algorithms.", "And there\u2019s no shortage of learning resources. Having too many options is the same as having no options.", "If you\u2019re serious about learning, set yourself up with a curriculum. Rather than spend weeks questioning over whether you should learn Python or R, take a course on Coursera or edX, start with math or code, spend one week planning out a rough plan, then follow it.", "For me, this was creating my own AI Masters Degree. I decided I was learning code first and Python would be my language. I searched far and wide for different courses and books and put the ones which interested me most together. Was the path I made the best for everyone? Probably not. But it was mine, that\u2019s why it worked.", "Once I had a curriculum, I had a path I could follow, there was no more wasting time trying to decide what was the best way to go. I could get up, sit down and learn what I needed (wanted) to learn.", "It wasn\u2019t strict either. If something came up which caught my interest, I followed it and learned what I needed as I went.", "If you\u2019re learning online and not through university, you should make your own path.", "Your grandfather\u2019s first orange farm failed.", "The soil was good. The seeds were there. All the equipment too.", "It was too cold. Oranges need warm temperatures to grow. Your grandfather had the skills to grow oranges but there was no chance they were growing in a cold climate.", "When he moved to a warmer city, he started another orange farm.", "12-months later, your grandfather was serving the best orange juice in town.", "You could have a laptop, an internet connection, the best books and still not be motivated to study.", "Your room is filled with distractions.", "You try to study with friends but they aren\u2019t as dedicated as you.", "I turned my room into a studying haven. Cleaned it. Put my phone in a drawer in another room, turned off notifications everywhere.", "I told my friend. My phone is going off until 4 pm, I\u2019ll talk to you then. He said okay.", "Friends are great when it comes to friend time but study time is study time. Can\u2019t do a whole day without your phone? Try an hour. Any drawer you can\u2019t see will work. Do not disturb should be a default.", "Fix your environment and let the knowledge juices flow.", "Problem 13 has me stumped. I\u2019m stuck.", "I wanted to get it done yesterday but couldn\u2019t.", "Now it\u2019s time to study but I know how hard I worked yesterday and got nowhere.", "I\u2019m putting it off. I know I should be studying. But I\u2019m putting it off.", "Aghhhhhhh. I\u2019ve seen this cycle before. I know it. But it\u2019s still there.", "The pile of books stares at me. Problem 13. I set a timer. 25-minutes. I know I might not solve the problem but I can sit down for 25-minutes and try.", "4-minutes in, it\u2019s hell. Burning hell. I keep going. 24-minutes in and I don\u2019t want to stop.", "The timer goes off and I set another. And then another. After 3 sessions, I solve the problem. I tell myself, I\u2019m the best engineer in the world. It\u2019s a lie but it doesn\u2019t matter. Even a small milestone is a milestone.", "You can\u2019t always control whether you make progress with study. But you can control how much time you spend on something.", "Can control: four 25-minute sessions per day.", "Can\u2019t control: finishing every task you start each day.", "Set the system up so you always win.", "I came to the conclusion. Learning is the ultimate skill. If I can learn how to learn better, I can do anything better. I can learn machine learning, I can become a better programmer, I can learn to write better. I must improve my learning, I thought. I began at once.", "I did the Coursera Learning How to Learn course. One of the main topics was focused versus diffused thinking.", "Focused thinking happens when you\u2019re doing a single task.", "Diffused thinking happens when you\u2019re not thinking about anything.", "The best learning happens at the crossover of these two. It\u2019s why you have some of your best thoughts in the shower. Because there\u2019s nothing else happening.", "When you let diffused thinking takeover, it gives your brain space to tie together all of the things it absorbed during focused thinking.", "The catch is, for it to work properly, you need time in both.", "If you\u2019ve set the system up so you do four 25-minute sessions of focused work, go for a walk after. Have a nap. Sit and think about what you\u2019ve learned.", "Once you start doing nothing more often, you\u2019ll see many things are valuable because of the empty space. A room is four walls around space, a tire is filled with nothing but air, a ship floats because of the empty space.", "Your study routine could do with more of nothing.", "You learn one thing and forget it the next day.", "You spend the whole weekend studying, go to work on Monday and no one knows.", "Someone asked me how do I remember things from books deeply? I said I don\u2019t. If I\u2019m lucky I remember 1% of a book I read. The magic happens when that 1% crosses over with another 1% of something else. It makes me feel like an expert dot connector.", "After studying something for a year you realise how much more there is to still learn.", "It doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s always day one.", "I was at the park the other day.", "There was a young boy running around having the time of his life. Up the slide, down the slide, in the tree, out of the tree, in the dirt, out of the dirt, up the hill, down the hill.", "He was laughing and jumping then laughing again.", "His mum came over to pick him up.", "He kept laughing as she carried him away, waving his blue plastic shovel.", "What is it that fascinated him?", "He was playing. He was having fun. The whole world was new. Our culture has a strict divide between work and play. Study is seen as work.", "You\u2019re supposed to study to get more work. You\u2019re supposed to work to earn money. The money buys you leisure time. Once you\u2019ve bought leisure time, then and only then can you be like Charlie and run around laughing.", "If you have it in your head study is work, it will be hell. Because there\u2019s always more to learn. You know how it goes, all work and no play.", "But suppose, you have the idea studying is the process of going through one topic and then to the next.", "Connecting different things like a game.", "You start to have the same feeling about it as you might have if you were Charlie going down the slide.", "You learn one thing, you use it to learn something else, you get stuck, you get over it, you learn another thing. And you make a dance out of it.", "I learned if you have structured data like tables, columns or data frames, ensemble algorithms like CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM work best. And for unstructured data like images, videos, natural language and audio, deep learning and/or transfer learning should be your model of choice.", "I connected the dots. I tell myself I\u2019m an expert dot connector. Dancing from dot to the next.", "Do this and you\u2019ll finish a study session with more energy than you started.", "This is the 3-year-old principle. Seeing everything as play.", "I wasn\u2019t. The best money for driving Uber was Friday and Saturday nights. People go out to dinner, to parties, to night clubs, I didn\u2019t, I was driving. I\u2019d go \u2019til 2 am, 3 am, come home and sleep until the sun woke me up at 7\u20138. I was a train wreck for two days. Monday would come and I\u2019d be in a different timezone. Tuesday got better and by Wednesday I was back where I needed to be. Then the cycle would repeat on Friday.", "This broken sleep schedule was unacceptable. My goal was to learn better. Sleep cleanses the brain and allows new connections in the brain to happen. I cut myself off from driving at 10 pm, 11 pm, got home and got the 7\u20139 hours. Less money, more learning.", "Don\u2019t trade sleep for more study time. Do the opposite.", "To study it well, to study anything well, you need to remind yourself.", "You can view the video version of this article on YouTube.", "Building nutrify.app, teaching ML @
