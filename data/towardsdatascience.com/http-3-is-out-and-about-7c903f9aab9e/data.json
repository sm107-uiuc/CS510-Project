HTTPS simple means the same protocols are used over an encryption layer for better privacy.", "For those who are familiar with the OSI (Open Systems Interconnections) Specification of the Internetworking/Communications, HTTP is an application layer protocol. Which means it has nothing to do with the underlying hardware structures or media. This makes it feasible to improve and upgrade the HTTP specification with increasing bandwidth and etc. You\u2019ll see how that happens soon!", "\u201cHTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.\u201dQuoted from Mozilla", "Client in this definition is the user agent. This could be a browser, program or anything that makes a call to a server using the HTTP protocol. The web server does the delivery or the serving of the requested content. The proxies coordinate the communication between the web servers and user agents.", "The functionality of the proxies as follows;", "In HTTP 1 or (1.1) simply the above tasks take place peacefully. Yet in 2009 a newer protocol HTTP 2 began to raise.", "HTTP 2 was put forward to address a few limitations that HTTP 1 met with the advancements of networking technologies and bandwidth.", "HTTP 2 gives a faster and secure (HTTP encryption is enforced in HTTP 2) web experience. You can have a look at this demo by the akamai cloud provider.", "This is a protocol that is yet to come (sort of). However, I noted that YouTube already uses HTTP 3 in the chrome browser (Not sure about others though!). How do I know? Because I use a plugin to see the HTTP protocol (HTTP/2 and SPDY indicator).", "The new specification also promises a faster, better, and secure web experience. But how?", "HTTP 3 intends to simplify the TCP handshake (it is a 3-way handshake, hi, hi again, ok you got my hi, alike.). The bottom line, the connections are established faster using the QUIC protocol, which is something new as well.", "The enhanced connection establishment promises better connection migration that occurs between wifi connections and mobile networks and etc. Note that this isn\u2019t the connection migration you see between routers in the same network. Much complicated and sophisticated.", "Lastly, QUIC also tries to upgrade the TCP slow start thus enabling high speeds to be achieved faster. QUIC tries to increase the congestion window exponential for this. This will be an important upgrade for gameplay in cases like Stadia and video streaming in UHD and above. Read more here.", "This might likely be the case of YouTube being super fast and plays HD from start-up without buffering. But don\u2019t quote me on that. The perfect specification might come out close to the end of this year.", "I hope you enjoyed reading my article on HTTP 3. Though I didn\u2019t go deep into the tech terms and the nitty-gritty details, now you know what might our future internet look like.
