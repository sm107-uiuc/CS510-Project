In this introduction story, I will guide you through the process of sign up, authoring and publishing the bot on your personal website with absolutely no code.", "Go to Power Virtual Agents marketing page and select Start Free. Sign in using your Microsoft work or school account or sign up, if you don\u2019t have one.", "Once you signed up and logged in you can give your bot a name. I call mine Lena.", "We first customize the greeting behavior of our bot. Click the Customize your greeting button on the Get started page.", "This brings us to the so-called authoring canvas where you can change the flow and behavior of your bot. Working with the authoring canvas is straight forward. Feel free to adjust the personality of your bot with your very own dialogs. Remove unnecessary steps as needed.", "As I want my bot to answer questions about me, I\u2019ve reflected that in the main greeting message. Click the save button when you\u2019re done customizing the greeting behavior.", "Next, select Topics from the menu. Consider Topics as the encapsulation of a dialog flow that handles a specific content \u2014 a Topic so to say.", "Power VA comes with two types of Topics. First, there are System Topics which you have less to no control over. These are the main building blocks of every conversation like greeting and goodbye. Feel free to explorer them later on.", "Second, there are User Topics you can build completely from scratch or base on the so-called Lessons. These pre-build User Topics are for showing you the concepts as a kind of interactive learning.", "We don\u2019t need them for now so we will turn all Lessons off.", "Now it\u2019s time to define our own User Topics. Instead of doing this from scratch we use the Suggest topics feature of Power VA. This feature is able to crawl any given website and try to \u201cguess\u201d the topics based on its content. The best example of this is a typical FAQ on a company or product website.", "For the purpose of this introduction, I\u2019m using my personal website that comes with a brief introduction and a short biography about me. Let\u2019s see what Power VA can extract from it. Feel free to use your own website or any other content on the web.", "Click Suggest topics, enter the website link you want Power VA to crawl and click Add. You can add multiple websites to get more suggestions. Click Start when you\u2019re ready.", "Depending on the number of websites and it\u2019s size, this process can take a couple of minutes as the progress message indicates.", "When crawling is done, Power VA tells you how many topics it suggested based on the content of the website. Click the Tab Suggested and see the extracts.", "As you can see from the screenshots, Power VA nicely discovered the most important information from my personal website and did a good job naming them.", "Now it is time to polish the results from crawling one by one. This includes deciding if we want to keep the suggestion and add it as a User Topic or if we want to delete it.", "Choose any of the suggestions and click its name to review the exact content that was discovered. In my example, you can see how it nicely extracted my bio. However, it doesn\u2019t know how users will ask for it leaving the Trigger phrases with a meaningless entry.", "We have to improve this by clicking Add to topics and edit.", "First, we review the crawled content and immediately notice that we have to update the name and remove the meaningless trigger phrase from the list.", "Furthermore, we add at least 3\u20135 distinct phrases that users might use to query this content.", "Tip: When writing the trigger phrases it is best to follow these simple rules:", "When you\u2019re done renaming and phrasing everything, click the Save topic button. Repeat this step for all other suggestions you want to keep.", "Before we can test our bot, we have to enable our newly added User Topics. For this purpose, we turn them all On using the Status toggle next to each topic.", "Now it\u2019s time to test our bot.", "Click Test your bot in the bottom left corner and say \u201cHi\u201d to watch your adjusted greeting dialog appear. Ask any other question and see if your bot understands it properly.", "Test the bot at your will and improve it on the fly. You can click the nodes on the authoring canvas next to your chat and edit them right away.", "Also, note the Track between topics toggle above the chat that when enabled, switches the context of the authoring canvas to the correct topic on the fly, allowing you to quickly improve your bot.", "Publishing our bot is super easy.", "Go to the Publish menu and hit the Publish button. Confirm the publishing and you\u2019re done. She\u2019s on!", "Before we finally use our bot we need to understand that it can be consumed on various different channels, like a Custom Website, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Facebook or even E-Mail. To discover those channels, click Go to Channels on the publishing page.", "For the purpose of this guide, we will add our bot to a Custom website by basically embedding it as an iframe. If you don\u2019t have a custom website by your hand, you can simply use the out of the box Demo website to showcase the result.", "Click Custom website and Copy the Embed code to your custom website.", "Alternatively, use jsfiddle.net if you want to test it without a real website. See the bonus section at the end of this article.", "I have chosen to embed the bot on my personal website as an experimental feature. With a little bit of CSS, which you find at the end of this article, it looks like below.", "Done! You did a great job!", "I hope this gives you a nice impression of what you can do with Power Virtual Agent. There is a lot more to discover but this is it for now.", "No website? Simply copy the iframe content from Power VA to the HTML panel in jsfiddle.net. Take the iframe styling from the second bonus tip and copy it over to the CSS panel. Click Run and see your bot in action.", "Right now embedding our bot in a custom website is done using an iframe which is very limited in terms of styling the content itself. The following snippet does style the iframe embed itself but not it's content.", "Your home for data science.
