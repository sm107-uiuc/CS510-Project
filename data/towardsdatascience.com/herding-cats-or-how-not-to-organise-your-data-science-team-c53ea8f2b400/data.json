Maybe free beer will work \u2026 [1]", "Dear reader, we need to talk. Much as I like this talk of free beer, I need to tell you that magic doesn\u2019t exist. Locking people away and hoping for the best doesn\u2019t generate results. There is no single formula for organising your data science team, just a series of choices with different trade-offs. In order to negotiate those trade-offs successfully, you need to have a hard think about what your data science team is for, and what kind of person you should be hiring. If you\u2019re not careful you might end up going through these stages of data science team grief:", "Stage 1: We\u2019ll put some smart people in what we\u2019ll call \u201ca Lab\u201d to do some vaguely defined stuff that we don\u2019t really understand.", "This is called research. Do you really want research? Really? Look, hiring a bunch of PhD-level ex-researchers and separating them from the business (or giving them \u201cspace to be creative\u201d, if you prefer) is more-or-less going to guarantee that they revert to training. This training will lead our data science researchers to frame the problem in the broadest, most technically ambitious way possible. They will then carve off a chunk of this problem, which they will proceed to heroically solve. They do this because that\u2019s how academics are trained. Unfortunately, though intellectually impressive, this probably won\u2019t actually improve anything in the business. That chunk of solution isn\u2019t going to be enough on its own \u2014 remember we\u2019ve been ambitious here! We\u2019re going to need to solve a load of other chunks to make a solution that\u2019s complete enough to be useful (and, in academia, justify a funding stream). How long will that take, you ask? Maybe a year. Or 3 years. Or 20 years. But hey! It\u2019s still impressive progress, right?", "Now that\u2019s fine if you\u2019re a Google or a Microsoft [2]. There are even some start-ups [3] that have been successful with this model, so I\u2019m not ruling it out. But is it what your business really needs?", "Stage 2: OK, we\u2019ve had enough of these clowns wasting company money! Time to get real!", "As it turns out, \u201cintellectually impressive\u201d doesn\u2019t help the bottom line. You might be able to get away with a hand-waving justification around \u201crecruitment\u201d or \u201csoft marketing\u201d but your C.F.O. is no-one\u2019s idea of an idiot. It\u2019s not going to work forever \u2014 time to get professional! Bring in the project managers!", "[Pause, while beanbags are removed and serious looking people move in. Jira is almost certainly involved somewhere.]", "If this goes well, and assuming that your project managers are competent, things will seem to improve from a manager\u2019s viewpoint. Projects will be associated with business problems, data scientists will be assigned to projects. Tasks will be ticked off, time will be accounted for [4] and you will finally feel in control!", "And then \u2026 things will unravel. You\u2019ll first notice that your best people gradually drift away. But maybe that\u2019s OK? Surely it\u2019s better to have second tier people doing something useful than have top minds engaged in mental frottage? However trouble lies ahead. Soon you\u2019ll start receiving complaints from other business units that your data science team isn\u2019t responsive enough. Finally, you\u2019ll notice that you\u2019re gradually slipping behind your competitors in those key business areas that are driven by data [5].", "So what happened? Unfortunately, you\u2019ve created a \u201cFortress Jira\u201d. By treating data scientists as mediocre software developers you\u2019ve raised the floor but lowered the ceiling. Your data science projects are not going to drift off into irrelevance any more. However, you\u2019ve locked the problem definition in early and subdivided the solution into easily foreseeable tasks. By limiting both the scope of the problem and tightly defining its solution, you\u2019ve locked out genuinely creative ideas. As a consequence, your best people are going to leave. And they\u2019ll take with them their ability to respond flexibly and imaginatively to the business problems that arise. At this point, you can shrug, and respond by making do with what\u2019s left. You can keep the tightly defined problems, and split the solutions into smaller tasks that can be assigned to the remaining people. However, your response to other parts of the business has now gone from \u201cHey sure! We can get highly intelligent person X to take a look at this!\u201d to, \u201cWe\u2019ll need to add this to the project queue, triage it against business objectives, have some meetings to understand the problem, break it down, get back to you with a plan, then actually do the work\u201d.", "And so, the complaints about responsiveness will start. In the final stage, without good people and with everything taking so much time, you\u2019ll fall further and further behind your competitors.", "[Cue wailing and gnashing of teeth.]", "Now, as you can probably tell, I really don\u2019t like this approach. However, there are occasions when it can work, at least in the short term. If we\u2019re honest there are situations where we don\u2019t actually need innovative solutions. You might, for example, be playing catch-up in an industry where data science techniques are mature and not changing rapidly. In this scenario, you don\u2019t need those highly creative, intelligent (and let\u2019s face it, mercurial) people. All that work has been done! You want people who can efficiently implement existing solutions. So you need to ask yourself, are these conditions true of your business? Because if they\u2019re not, and you go for a \u201cFortress Jira\u201d, you are going to get left behind by your rapidly innovating competitors.", "Stage 3: Fine, \u201cFortress Jira\u201d made me feel good initially, but it\u2019s not working out. What now?", "The next thing you can try is the \u201cembedded data scientist\u201d model. Here you take your data scientists and physically put them inside product and marketing teams. They\u2019ll be responsible for doing the data science work that those teams need, building whatever models are necessary to get products live. Your data science team will be super responsive, they\u2019re right there with the rest of the business. They\u2019ll definitely be working on relevant business problems because, hey! They\u2019re right there with the rest of the business.", "Of course there\u2019s a \u201chowever\u201d. Even though this is my absolute favourite way to work, it comes with its downsides. Firstly, though your data scientists might be maths geniuses and python whizzes, they\u2019re going to be embedded with product designers and marketing creatives. If you force your classic introverted data scientist into an environment filled with extroverts, it can be exhausting for them. However with a bit of thought, and flexible working practices, that problem can be overcome. A more difficult problem is that your data scientists are now responsive and independent. Whilst this sounds like a problem we all want, it comes with the downside that they will be independently scrambling to solve similar, or even the same, problems. To their product team this won\u2019t matter. However when you take a look at what\u2019s getting done, you\u2019ll find a whole mess of code duplication, repeated work and, ultimately wasted money. Eventually someone will say \u201cHey look, all these data scientists are doing roughly the same thing! Why don\u2019t we centralise everything?\u201d And so, back to \u201cFortress Jira\u201d. Right up until that\u2019s not responsive enough \u2014 at which point, back to the embedded model! Until someone suggests centralising everything again \u2026", "Cynical. But I\u2019m in my forties. It\u2019s allowed.", "So if even this model has its flaws, what do we do? Well now we understand the pitfalls of each, we can see that we have to make choices in an imperfect world. Are you making big bets on developing a revolutionary technology? Maybe the data lab is for you. Doing run-of-the-mill data science that has been worked out before? Then try Fortress Jira. Or are you a start-up rapidly iterating its product offering? Then the embedded data scientist is the one to go for.", "In reality the models don\u2019t have to be exclusive. It is possible to mix and match, and this is a subject we will return to in a later article.", "[1] This actually happened to me earlier in my career. Somehow beer, beanbags and pizza didn\u2019t fix anything, even in Shoreditch.", "[2] The scale of tech company investment in research is mind-boggling. See here for just NLP papers published in academia, never mind all the work that stays internal.", "[3] I have a friend in Venture Capital who passed up on a neural net company because it was too much about the research and he didn\u2019t understand the business model. In a sense he was right, but he still ended up being wrong \u2026", "[4] Needless to say, this often goes too far. I once worked with a project manager who claimed she could account for the activities of a data science team to the nearest minute. What these highly paid, ambitious professionals thought about being made to account for their toilet breaks was never clear to me. I think I can guess though.", "[5] This is a very real effect. I\u2019ve worked with a company whose revenue from its online operation was 6 times smaller than a direct competitor. It turns out that online operations are all about using that data well.", "Your home for data science.
