In other words, the class label of a test record cannot be predicted with certainty even though its attribute set is identical to some of the training examples. This situation may arise because of noisy data or the presence of certain confounding factors that affect classification.", "For example, consider the task of predicting whether a person is at risk for heart disease based on the person\u2019s diet and workout frequency. Although most people who eat healthily and exercise regularly have less chance of developing heart disease, they may still do so because of other factors such as heredity, excessive smoking, and alcohol abuse. Determining whether a person\u2019s diet is healthy or the workout frequency is sufficient is also subject to interpretation, which in turn may introduce uncertainties into the learning problem.", "Bayesian Learning is an approach for modelling probabilistic relationships between the attribute set and the class variable.
