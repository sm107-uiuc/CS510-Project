I found my friends in the form of books and I had this dream that I read about in science fiction books about robots, that at some point in time we would have robots around us who could ease our pain of being lonely. A robot, who could be my friend \u2014 who would be there for me and comfort me when I needed, who would love me.", "As I said, I was lonely.", "Thirty years and many technologies later we are heading towards a future with artificial intelligence in an exponentially accelerated way. Mitsuku and Sophia today can become something incredible tomorrow.", "I am an Empath and it makes me incredibly human and vulnerable to a fault. Would a machine ever be capable of empathising with me? Could it become empathetic \u2014 in a human way?", "When we talk about artificial intelligence we soon get to the topic of artificial empathy. There are different schools that have their very distinctive opinions about whether a machine can have or can ever develop empathy. Beyond the obvious \u201cyes, they can\u201d, and \u201cno, they can\u2019t\u201d there is the answer of \u201cwho cares whether it\u2019s fake when it looks real.\u201d", "In my opinion, it is more a question of finding the right terms than dissecting the technological capabilities, and it is more an ethical answer than a scientific one.", "Already when we are talking about intelligence and artificial intelligence, we are coming across some major differences that worth mentioning.", "Human intelligence\u2019s power lies in the fact that it is not limited to rational thinking. We are able to process information and we are also factoring in the unpredictability of the world. Our collective consciousness allows us to know what is right without trying to figure it out rationally.", "Our emotions play a huge role in our decisions and regardless of whether being biased is a good thing, we are weighing in with our sadness, happiness, love, hate, frustration to our rational decisions too. Our memories, triggered traumas, hopes and fears and personality have a huge impact on how we react to the world around us.", "Machines cannot do this, even if they wanted to. They cannot factor in a certain percentage of unique unpredictability, fear, trauma \u2014 because this is not how they work.", "Artificial intelligence is about observing humans, learning actions and reactions, amassing huge amounts of data and based on that creating replica signals. Deep-learning and self-teaching AI processes allow AI to work with and process incredible amounts of data sets \u2014 data so vast that it is incomprehensible with our limited human minds.", "Because machines are learning very quickly and are able to make quick decisions based on all the rational data sets, they are capable of producing the appearance of empathy.", "But empathy is not linearly related to the amount of data processed or the number of signals observed. Empathy is about identifying ourselves with the other person, based on our own experience, feeling what they feel, being able to predict their next feeling without signals.", "\u201cThe signals that people send are a tiny fraction of the internal narrative that they experience. You and I are both far more than the sum of what other people think we are by watching what we do and say.\u201d Jason Miller", "By definition from the Cambridge English Dictionary empathy means the ability to share someone else\u2019s feelings or experiences by imagining what it would be like to be in that person\u2019s situation. It is to have the power of mentally identifying oneself with and understanding fully another person.", "The definition does not make a distinction between human empathy or artificial empathy. Our definitions stem from our humanity \u2014 and whatever we create with our human capabilities will be deriving by default from human origin. So, whenever we talk about empathy in general, we mean the human ability. If we need to refer to something else \u2014 in this case, the artificial empathy we are teaching machines and machines are teaching themselves to \u2014 we need to clarify that we are talking about artificial empathy.", "When it comes to human empathy, there are two gaps here that machines cannot fill:", "\u2026we are not thinking machines that feel, we are feeling machines that think.", "To fully understand humans, we need to start by understanding what makes us human in the first place. It\u2019s the feeling we have, not the thoughts we think. And exactly what makes us human, makes it impossible to comprehend us fully, as our consciousness is an exceptionally complex, everchanging, flexible structure \u2014 and as such not similar to any machine construct.", "For starters, we are not rational beings. Our consciousness is not driven by our brain or rational thinking, it\u2019s not a linear and logical construct \u2014 it has some rational cues, but it\u2019s more layered than that.", "Our consciousness is defined by how we experience the world, driven by our five senses, sight, sound, touch, taste and smell \u2014 combined with the emotional reactions to the senses. No machine can ever experience the world as humans do, no machine can replicate the interlinking sensory experiences and our emotional responses to them. No machine will ever feel real hunger or thirst or urging sexual desire, or fear of losing safety or anxiety from a future event, such as death.", "Our consciousness is also shaped by our collective consciousness, our collective intelligence, memory, culture \u2014 that goes beyond the individual perception. We have manifestations of it in our society in the form of values, norms, collective moral. It is represented in our interpersonal communication, in stories, conversation, lore, jokes. In metacommunication and other subtle signals, such as understanding symbols, sarcasm, tone and understanding that sometimes the lack of a sign is the sign itself. For example, in a conversation situation, an unresponsive face to a shocking fact is as much a sign as pupils dilating with fear. Our consciousness is present in the beliefs, hopes, faith systems that we created, and we stick to. They are not logical, they are not reasonable, but they are there and they are solidly ingrained in our collective thinking.", "Empathy is usually needed when we are interacting with others, when we are communicating, informing, teaching, supporting each other. Our communication is unique and impossible to replicate because of all the layers, the complexity and the uncertainty of our consciousness is considered to be the basis for all interactions.", "You can\u2019t teach a machine to communicate like humans, and a machine cannot learn to communicate like humans on its own either. Because when we do it the human way, we tap into the collective and individual consciousness and this is not available for machines, they are not part of the club \u2014 and we cannot ever involve them fully.", "It\u2019s not a technological question, it\u2019s a question of the interpretation of empathy. It\u2019s not about believing that a next-level machine evolution can learn to already have empathy, it is more about stating that human experience cannot be ever replicated \u2014 if it was possible, we would be degrading our capacities to something measurable, calculable.", "It\u2019s about as Henry Kissinger puts it in his article in The Atlantic, how consciousness should be defined in a world of machines that reduce human experience to mathematical data, interpreted by their own memories?", "We have something immeasurable and unique, that can be called magic or can be defined as soul.", "And when it comes to machines, I doubt that us humans would be able to create something for a machine that we can\u2019t understand a hundred per cent. And that is so intangible that its existence can even be denied and cannot be proven scientifically.", "And it\u2019s even less probable that a human-made machine could produce something that cannot be described by its capacities \u2014 that is deriving from data, algorithm and logic.", "Machines cannot have a human soul; they cannot learn to feel or have human instincts, they cannot reproduce the versatility and unpredictability of human magic.", "They can have artificial empathy, but it will be as different from human empathy as a plastic flower from the real one. It can be close, very close \u2014 but it will always be appearance only, never the real thing. And I personally wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.", "If you want some more, sign up for my weekly newsletter.", "Your home for data science.
