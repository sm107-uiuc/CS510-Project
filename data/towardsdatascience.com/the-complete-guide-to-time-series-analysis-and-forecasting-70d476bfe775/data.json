For example, it would be interesting to forecast at what hour during the day is there going to be a peak consumption in electricity, such as to adjust the price or the production of electricity.", "Enter time series. A time series is simply a series of data points ordered in time. In a time series, time is often the independent variable and the goal is usually to make a forecast for the future.", "However, there are other aspects that come into play when dealing with time series.", "In this post, I will introduce different characteristics of time series and how we can model them to obtain accurate (as much as possible) forecasts.", "Learn the latest time series forecasting techniques with my free time series cheat sheet in Python! Get code templates of statistical and deep learning models, all in Python and TensorFlow!", "Informally, autocorrelation is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.", "Above is an example of an autocorrelation plot. Looking closely, you realize that the first value and the 24th value have a high autocorrelation. Similarly, the 12th and 36th observations are highly correlated. This means that we will find a very similar value at every 24 unit of time.", "Notice how the plot looks like sinusoidal function. This is a hint for seasonality, and you can find its value by finding the period in the plot above, which would give 24h.", "Seasonality refers to periodic fluctuations. For example, electricity consumption is high during the day and low during night, or online sales increase during Christmas before slowing down again.", "As you can see above, there is a clear daily seasonality. Every day, you see a peak towards the evening, and the lowest points are the beginning and the end of each day.", "Remember that seasonality can also be derived from an autocorrelation plot if it has a sinusoidal shape. Simply look at the period, and it gives the length of the season.", "Stationarity is an important characteristic of time series. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. In other words, it has constant mean and variance, and covariance is independent of time.", "Looking again at the same plot, we see that the process above is stationary. The mean and variance do not vary over time.", "Often, stock prices are not a stationary process, since we might see a growing trend, or its volatility might increase over time (meaning that variance is changing).", "Ideally, we want to have a stationary time series for modelling. Of course, not all of them are stationary, but we can make different transformations to make them stationary.", "You may have noticed in the title of the plot above Dickey-Fuller. This is the statistical test that we run to determine if a time series is stationary or not.", "Without going into the technicalities of the Dickey-Fuller test, it test the null hypothesis that a unit root is present.", "If it is, then p > 0, and the process is not stationary.", "Otherwise, p = 0, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the process is considered to be stationary.", "As an example, the process below is not stationary. Notice how the mean is not constant through time.", "There are many ways to model a time series in order to make predictions. Here, I will present:", "The moving average model is probably the most naive approach to time series modelling. This model simply states that the next observation is the mean of all past observations.", "Although simple, this model might be surprisingly good and it represents a good starting point.", "Otherwise, the moving average can be used to identify interesting trends in the data. We can define a window to apply the moving average model to smooth the time series, and highlight different trends.", "In the plot above, we applied the moving average model to a 24h window. The green line smoothed the time series, and we can see that there are 2 peaks in a 24h period.", "Of course, the longer the window, the smoother the trend will be. Below is an example of moving average on a smaller window.", "Exponential smoothing uses a similar logic to moving average, but this time, a different decreasing weight is assigned to each observations. In other words, less importance is given to observations as we move further from the present.", "Mathematically, exponential smoothing is expressed as:", "Here, alpha is a smoothing factor that takes values between 0 and 1. It determines how fast the weight decreases for previous observations.", "From the plot above, the dark blue line represents the exponential smoothing of the time series using a smoothing factor of 0.3, while the orange line uses a smoothing factor of 0.05.", "As you can see, the smaller the smoothing factor, the smoother the time series will be. This makes sense, because as the smoothing factor approaches 0, we approach the moving average model.", "Double exponential smoothing is used when there is a trend in the time series. In that case, we use this technique, which is simply a recursive use of exponential smoothing twice.", "Here, beta is the trend smoothing factor, and it takes values between 0 and 1.", "Below, you can see how different values of alpha and beta affect the shape of the time series.", "This method extends double exponential smoothing, by adding a seasonal smoothing factor. Of course, this is useful if you notice seasonality in your time series.", "Mathematically, triple exponential smoothing is expressed as:", "Where gamma is the seasonal smoothing factor and L is the length of the season.", "SARIMA is actually the combination of simpler models to make a complex model that can model time series exhibiting non-stationary properties and seasonality.", "At first, we have the autoregression model AR(p). This is basically a regression of the time series onto itself. Here, we assume that the current value depends on its previous values with some lag. It takes a parameter p which represents the maximum lag. To find it, we look at the partial autocorrelation plot and identify the lag after which most lags are not significant.", "In the example below, p would be 4.", "Then, we add the moving average model MA(q). This takes a parameter q which represents the biggest lag after which other lags are not significant on the autocorrelation plot.", "After, we add the order of integration I(d). The parameter d represents the number of differences required to make the series stationary.", "Finally, we add the final component: seasonality S(P, D, Q, s), where s is simply the season\u2019s length. Furthermore, this component requires the parameters P and Q which are the same as p and q, but for the seasonal component. Finally, D is the order of seasonal integration representing the number of differences required to remove seasonality from the series.", "The main takeaway is: before modelling with SARIMA, we must apply transformations to our time series to remove seasonality and any non-stationary behaviors.", "That was a lot of theory to wrap our head around! Let\u2019s apply the techniques discussed above in our first project.", "We will try to predict the stock price of a specific company. Now, predicting the stock price is virtually impossible. However, it remains a fun exercise and it will be a good way to practice what we have learned.", "We will use the historical stock price of the New Germany Fund (GF) to try to predict the closing price in the next five trading days.", "You can grab the dataset and notebook here.", "As always, I highly recommend you code along! Start your notebook, and let\u2019s go!", "First, we import some libraries that will be helpful throughout our analysis. Also, we define the mean average percentage error (MAPE), as this will be our error metric.", "Then, we import our dataset and we previous the first ten entries, and you should get:", "As you can see, we have a few entries concerning a different stock than the New Germany Fund (GF). Also, we have an entry concerning intraday information, but we only want end of day (EOD) information.", "Then, we remove unwanted columns, as we solely want to focus on the stock\u2019s closing price.", "If you preview the dataset, you should see:", "Awesome! We are ready for exploratory data analysis!", "We plot the closing price over the entire time period of our dataset.", "Clearly, you see that this is not a stationary process, and it is hard to tell if there is some kind of seasonality.", "Let\u2019s use the moving average model to smooth our time series. For that, we will use a helper function that will run the moving average model on a specified time window and it will plot the result smoothed curve:", "Using a time window of 5 days, we get:", "As you can see, we can hardly see a trend, because it is too close to actual curve. Let\u2019s see the result of smoothing by the previous month, and previous quarter.", "Trends are easier to spot now. Notice how the 30-day and 90-day trend show a downward curve at the end. This might mean that the stock is likely to go down in the following days.", "Now, let\u2019s use exponential smoothing to see if it can pick up a better trend.", "Here, we use 0.05 and 0.3 as values for the smoothing factor. Feel free to try other values and see what the result is.", "As you can see, an alpha value of 0.05 smoothed the curve while picking up most of the upward and downward trends.", "Now, let\u2019s use double exponential smoothing.", "Again, experiment with different alpha and beta combinations to get better looking curves.", "As outlined previously, we must turn our series into a stationary process in order to model it. Therefore, let\u2019s apply the Dickey-Fuller test to see if it is a stationary process:", "By the Dickey-Fuller test, the time series is unsurprisingly non-stationary. Also, looking at the autocorrelation plot, we see that it is very high, and it seems that there is no clear seasonality.", "Therefore, to get rid of the high autocorrelation and to make the process stationary, let\u2019s take the first difference (line 23 in the code block). We simply subtract the time series from itself with a lag of one day, and we get:", "Awesome! Our series is now stationary and we can start modelling!", "Now, for SARIMA, we first define a few parameters and a range of values for other parameters to generate a list of all possible combinations of p, q, d, P, Q, D, s.", "Now, in the code cell above, we have 625 different combinations! We will try each combination and train SARIMA with each so to find the best performing model. This might take while depending on your computer\u2019s processing power.", "Once this is done, we print out a summary of the best model, and you should see:", "Awesome! We finally predict the closing price of the next five trading days and evaluate the MAPE of the model.", "In this case, we have a MAPE of 0.79%, which is very good!", "Now, to compare our prediction with actual data, we take financial data from Yahoo Finance and create a dataframe.", "Then, we make a plot to see how far we were from the actual closing prices:", "It seems that we are a bit off in our predictions. In fact, the predicted price is essentially flat, meaning that our model is probably not performing well.", "Again, this is not due to our procedure, but to the fact that predicting stock prices is essentially impossible.", "From the first project, we learned the entire procedure of making a time series stationary before using SARIMA to model. It is a long and tedious process, with a lot of manual tweaking.", "Now, let\u2019s introduce Facebook\u2019s Prophet. It is a forecasting tool available in both Python and R. This tool allows both experts and non-experts to produce high quality forecasts with minimal efforts.", "Let\u2019s see how we can use it in this second project!", "The title says it all: we will use Prophet to help us predict air quality!", "The full notebook and dataset can be found here.", "As always, we start by importing some useful libraries. We then print out the first five rows:", "As you can see, the dataset contains information about the concentrations of different gases. They were recorded at every hour for each day. You can find a description of all features here.", "If you explore the dataset a bit more, you will notice that there are many instances of the value -200. Of course, it does not make sense to have a negative concentration, so we will need to clean the data before modelling.", "Therefore, we need to clean the data.", "Here, we start off by parsing our date column to turn into \u201cdates\u201d.", "Then, we turn all the measurements into floats.", "After, we aggregate the data by day, by taking the average of each measurement.", "At this point, we still have some NaN that we need to get rid of. Therefore, we remove the columns that have more than 8 NaN. That way, we can then remove rows containing NaN values without losing too much data.", "Finally, we aggregate the data by week, because it will give a smoother trend to analyze.", "We can plot the trends of each chemical. Here, we show that of NOx.", "Oxides of nitrogen are very harmful, as they react to form smog and acid rain, as well as being responsible for the formation of fine particles and ground level ozone. These have adverse health effects, so the concentration of NOx is a key feature of air quality.", "We will solely focus on modelling the NOx concentration. Therefore, we remove all other irrelevant columns.", "Prophet requires the date column to be named ds and the feature column to be named y, so we make the appropriate changes.", "At this point, our data looks like this:", "Then, we define a training set. For that we will hold out the last 30 entries for prediction and validation.", "Afterwards, we simply initialize Prophet, fit the model to the data, and make predictions!", "Here, yhat represents the prediction, while yhat_lower and yhat_upper represent the lower and upper bound of the prediction respectively.", "Prophet allows you to easily plot the forecast and we get:", "As you can see, Prophet simply used a straight downward line to predict the concentration of NOx in the future.", "Then, we check if the time series has any interesting features, such as seasonality:", "Here, Prophet only identified a downward trend with no seasonality.", "Evaluating the model\u2019s performance by calculating its mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE), we see that the MAPE is 13.86% and the MAE is 109.32, which is not that bad! Remember that we did not fine tune the model at all.", "Finally, we just plot the forecast with its upper and lower bounds:", "Congratulations on making it to the end! This was a very long, but informative article. You learned how to robustly analyze and model time series and applied your knowledge in two different projects.", "I hope you found this article useful, and I hope you will refer back to it.", "To learn the latest techniques for time series analysis, checkout my free cheat sheet:", "Reference: Many thanks to this article for the amazing introduction to time series analysis!", "Your home for data science.
