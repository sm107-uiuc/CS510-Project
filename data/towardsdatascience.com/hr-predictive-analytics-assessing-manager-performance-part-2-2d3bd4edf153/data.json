After completing the data exploration process in Part 1, I am diving into the application of machine learning model into the usecase. The dataset is taken from Keith McNulty\u2019s post where he had shared this use case along with the dataset.", "Step 5: Define Training and Test Dataset", "I will build the model on the training dataset and validate the computed model on the test data set. This means the model will train on all the data fields including the performance group. The training dataset will enable the model to decide which factors are contributing to the changes in the performance group. Model evaluation on test dataset means we will hide the performance group column of the test dataset and ask the model to predict the performance group level for each row of data in the test dataset. The partitioning of the data into training and test dataset is random. The random sample is generated using sample () function along with the seed function ().", "Step 6: Build the Ordinal Logistic Regression Model", "Now I will build the model using the training dataset. As we know the dependent variable (the variable that we are studying) is the performance_group variable. I have created an upper/basic model which includes all the input variables in relation to the single dependent variable performance_group.", "The table displays the value of coefficients and intercepts, and corresponding standard errors and t values. The interpretation for the coefficients is as follows. For example, holding everything else constant, an increase in the value of yrs_employed by one unit reduces the expected value of performance in log odds of -6.2. Likewise, the coefficients of peers and quality can be interpreted. The AIC is a measure of information loss and model fit. In the next step, I will use the automated feature selection technique to determine the optimum number of features that produce the best AIC score.", "Step 7: Automated Feature Selection using Step AIC", "In Step 6 I had created the ordinal logistic regression model using all the input variables. The idea here is to simplify the model by selecting only the important input features that help predict the performance. In order to do automated feature detection, I have used the stepAIC function() inside the MASS package.", "So after the transformation, a revised StepAIC model has been created that uses only 5 input variables: manager_hire, group_size, test_score, high_hours_flag and yrs_employed.", "Here I have created a table that shows the features ranked by importance.", "There are five important variables that influence performance :", "After building the model and interpreting the model results, I have evaluated the model using confusion matrix. The evaluation of the model is done on the test dataset where the performance_group value is not hidden in the test dataset. We use the model predicted score to compare with the actual score to come up the confusion matrix results.", "The confusion matrix shows the performance of the ordinal logistic regression model. For example, it shows that, in the test dataset, 4 times bottom probability category is identified correctly. Similarly, 69 times medium category and 0 times high category is identified correctly. We observe that the model identifies high probability category poorly. This happens because of inadequate representation of high probability category in the training dataset. Using the confusion matrix, we find that the misclassification error for our model is 36%. This shows that the overall model fit is not very strong and this could be for varied reasons. One of the primary reasons is the nature of the dataset which is heavily skewed towards managers in the middle performance group.", "The interpretation of the logistic ordinal regression in terms of log odds ratio is not quite straight forward. Here I have tried to explain the model results in plots.", "The first figure shows that managers who are directly hired increase the likelihood of classification into bottom group and slightly reduce the likelihood of classification in top and middle performance group.", "The second plot is very interesting as it shows the interaction of 2 features on performance. The top left section shows that with an increase in team size, a manager who has been internally promoted increases the likelihood of classification in the top performance group in comparision to a direct hired manager. With an increase in team size, a direct hire manager increases the likelihood of performance level to be in the middle category (see 2nd right part of the plot)", "The article has two key takeaways. First, ordinal logistic regression comes in handy while dealing with a dependent variable that can be ordered. In the field of HR , we could apply these principles to study Employee Wellbeing for example. Interpreting the log likelihoods of the features can be tricky and difficult. Using the graphical method, it is easy to understand the individual and joint effects of independent variables on the likelihood of classification.", "Your home for data science.
