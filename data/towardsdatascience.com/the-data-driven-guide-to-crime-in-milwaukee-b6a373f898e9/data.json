To the best of my knowledge, this work is the first public exploration and analysis of this information.", "This is a comprehensive guide which includes: I) a detailed assessment of the relationship between crime rates and time, II) an evaluation of weapon used in crimes, and finally, III) a geospatial analysis that demonstrates where crime has occurred across the city.", "Disclaimer: The following data and figures represent crimes that were reported.

Crime reports for criminal damage, locked vehicle entry, and vehicle theft share a similar pattern, with a sharp spike in reports occurring at 8:00 am. Unlike other crime patterns that peak in the morning or mid-day, assault offense and robbery reporting are low in the morning and peak in the late evening.", "The above figure indicates a slight variation in crime reports across the week. To test whether the amount of crime reported is related to the day of the week, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the data. The test yielded a p-value of 0.287, which did not break the pre-defined significance threshold (p < 0.05).

While crime reporting is highly variable, it generally increases across the month.", "There has been a steady decrease in total crime reporting shortly after its peak in 2006. In 2018, the total reported crime was down nearly 40% compared to 2006 levels. However, this trend is not unique to Milwaukee. According to The Pew Research Center, crime levels in the United States have been falling drastically since the early 1990s (read more here).", "In Total Crime Reports per Year by Crime Type Crimes, we see a clear and steady decrease in theft and criminal damage across time. Conversely, the number of reports of assault offense has increased since 2006, when total crime reporting was much higher. Despite substantial changes in the total amount of crime reported, sexual offense, arson, and homicide levels appear constant over the years.", "Out of the 667,025 crimes reported considered in this analysis, 277,580 reported weapon use.

The data was then exported location data to Texas A & M GeoServices, who donated their world-class, state-of-the-art geocoding services to this project.

Then, location-based (geospatial) crime maps of Milwaukee were created. Note: the location data may represent where the crime occurred or where the crime was reported.", "To develop our intuition for areas where many crimes occurred in 2018, a density-based map was created in which the area is divided into hexagons with a radius of 0.5 miles (0.8047 Km).

In particular, two continuous high-density (purple) regions stand out, one slightly north-west of the center of the city, and the other slightly south-west of the center.", "To better visualize the prevalence of crime by crime type, a mapping was produced with hexagons colored according to the crime most prevalent withinin the respective area:", "In the above mapping, we see that assault offense is the most prevalent crime across Milwaukee for 2018. We also notice that locked vehicle entry is prevalent on the east side of the city, above and below the Port of Milwaukee.", "In order to identify location-based clusters (groupings) of crime, the supervised machine learning algorithm: Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) was implemented. OPTICS is a density-based clustering algorithm that allows us to accurately identify clusters, even though geographic features such as roads, lakes, and neighborhoods may influence where crime has occurred. Read more about OPTICS here & here.", "High-density regions were searched on the basis of containing 1,000 or more crimes (minPts = 1000) that occurred within close reachability distance to one another (contrast parameter xi = 0.0037) were identified.", "OPTICS was set to identify clusters of 1,000 or more crimes occurring The reachability plot and convex cluster hulls plots that justify our clustering selection are available above and below, respectively.", "Finally, we plot the clusters to a map of Milwaukee:", "The above figure displays four OPTICS-defined crime clusters in Milwaukee for 2018.

The results indicate that documented crime has been aggressively declining over the past thirteen years, largely due to decreases in theft. However, despite this trend reports of assault have been increasing. Historically, crime demonstrates a yearly low in February and peaks in July and August. Twenty-four hour trends in reported crime indicate elevated levels between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, while no relationship bewteen crime and day of the week was observed.", "Geospatial analyses map 2018 crime data to Milwaukee and demonstrate that assault is the most prevalent crime across the majority of the city.
