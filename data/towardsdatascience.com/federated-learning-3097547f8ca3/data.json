Federated Learning enables mobile phones to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all the training data on device, decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud. This goes beyond the use of local models that make predictions on mobile devices (like the Mobile Vision API and On-Device Smart Reply) by bringing model training to the device as well.", "The goal is a machine learning setting where the goal is to train a high-quality centralised model with training data distributed over a large number of clients each with unreliable and relatively slow network connections.", "This new field consists of an ensemble of techniques that allow ML engineers to train models without having direct access to the data used for the training and avoid them to get any information about the data by the use of cryptography.", "This framework relies on three main techniques:", "In this article, I will cover Federated Learning and its application for predicting Boston Housing prices.", "With the rise of many famous libraries like PySyft and Tensorflow Federated. It has become easier for general developers, researchers and machine learning enthusiasts to create a decentralised machine learning training model. In this project to train a dataset based on the aim to predict housing prices of the properties listed in the city of Boston, I have used PySyft \u2014 a Python library for secure, private Deep Learning. PySyft decouples private data from model training, using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) within PyTorch.", "While training the Deep Learning prediction model, the data is securely saved locally with Alice and Bob. For a private training, I used a Federated approach where the ML model is trained locally with on-device capability of mobile devices owned by two parties Alice and Bob. With the rise of computer performance of the mobile devices, it has become easier to train ML models with much more efficiency.", "PySyft is a Python library for secure, private Deep Learning. PySyft decouples private data from model training, using Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) within PyTorch.", "In order to install PySyft, it is recommended that you set up a conda environment first", "You then need to install the package", "The following Python libraries were used for the developing the project.", "We have trained the neural network for more than 100 epochs to get good results. By creating a total batches of 8 the records we were able to get good results. Learning rate for was set at 0.001 to use stochastic gradient descent as the optimiser for the network. As of now PySyft only supports the SGD optimiser for the Back propagation algorithm to calculate the error and updating the network parameters.", "Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimisation algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point.", "The next step involves reading the dataset into the Jupyter notebook and preprocessing it before training the neural network with the data. Preprocessing the data helps us to get more understanding about the dataset and helps us to select the best features that could help in predicting the results from the input.", "In the project we have used the most common Boston Housing dataset to train the neural network. We are predicting the prices of the various kinds of housing properties based on the different pricing features. Some of them are listed below. You can find the dataset here.", "Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970.", "We now have to define the Neural Network architecture for the model using PyTorch. The deep learning network consists of 2 different hidden layers and involves use of Relu activation function for all the layers in the network. The input layer consists of 13 different perceptrons which corresponds to each of the input feature for the training dataset.", "Bob and Alice are the two people who are involved in the whole cycle. For simulation purposes we send batches of dataset to all the network clients who interacting with the application using the global ML models.", "We can see that with the PySyft library and its PyTorch extension, we can perform operations with tensor pointers such as we can do with PyTorch API (but for some limitations that are still to be addressed).", "Now we connect with the workers named Alice and Bob for training the neural network with the data available with the parties.", "Thanks to PySyft, we were able to train a model without having any access to the remote and private data: for each batch, we sent the model to the current remote worker and get it back to the local machine before sending it to the worker of the next batch.", "There is however one limitation of this method: by getting the model back we can still have access to some private information. Let\u2019s say Bob had only a single data record on his machine. When we get the model back, we can check with the updated weights for the data with which Bob trained retrained the model.", "In order to address this issue, there are two solutions: Differential Privacy and Secured Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). Differential Privacy would be used to make sure the model does not give access to some private information. SMPC, which is one kind of Encrypted Computation, in return allows you to send the model privately so that the remote workers which have the data cannot see the weights you are using.", "You can checkout the whole project with the Jupyter Notebook available below. I have also left the link to the Federated Learning project which is available on my GitHub repository below.", "If you are interested in learning more about Secure and Private AI and how to use PySyft you can also check out this free course on Udacity. It\u2019s a great course for beginners taught by Andrew Trask, the founder of the OpenMined Initiative.", "Check out the project on GitHub", "I am a final year Computer Science and Engineering student in India and have been coding since past 5 years. After working on several Machine Learning and iOS development projects, I am learning the new technique of Federated Learning because the next decade of how you train the Deep Learning model on mobile devices depends of the Federated protocol.
