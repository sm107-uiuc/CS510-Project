Data Science is a career that\u2019s hottest, hardest, most challenging, most rewarding, and full of top-notch minds. Your journey is bound to be full of fun, challenges, enlightenments, and achievements (big or small). New papers are published daily or even hourly. New techniques and experiments are developed regularly. New ways of thinking become the new norm. And what seems magical before, are proven feasible.", "But getting into Data Science is not easy. Far from it. The learning curve is brutal. There is so much to learn: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Algorithm, Optimization, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Software Engineering, DevOps, \u2026 The list goes on and on.", "Some people may have some background in math or statistics, which will definitely help. Yet you still need a solid foundation for software engineering to be efficient and be successful in your career. But this is not a problem, you say. After all, we live in an era of booming online education. There are plenty of courses paid and free we can choose. True, but this is precisely where the problem is. The biggest challenge for self-education these days is not lack of education resources, but hard to find the best or most relevant ones.", "What is CS50? It is the introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University by Professor David J. Malan. It is the largest class at Harvard with 800 students, 102 staff, and a professional production team. It offers both an on-campus and an online course. I\u2019ve taken the online one, but it\u2019s already THE best computer science course I came across, period. Let me tell you why:", "The CS50 staff has the capability of knowing precisely what you do and do not know before each lecture (in that they have zero expert blindness). So the speech will not mention anything you are not familiar with. It smoothly guides you through key concepts of computer science and makes it seem obvious. It raises questions from time to time and later addresses them with a more in-depth explanation of the concepts. You\u2019ll have plenty of \u2018a-ha\u2019 moments, and it almost felt like watching a suspense movie.", "The course covers most of the critical computer science elements: C, Python, Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Engineering, Resource Management, Web Development, etc. It delves down deep enough so you can understand all the essential concepts while also know where to look if you want to dig deeper.", "CS50 has many ways to teach and keep you engaged. You\u2019ll play a game to understand different sorting algorithms, receive a rubber duck to experience the famous Rubber Duck Debugging, watch experiments of \u2018array of lights \ud83d\udea5\u2019 to learn data structure, even eat a delicious breakfast \ud83c\udf5e while exploring the idea of pseudo-code. (One of my favorites is where David J. Malan uses a Yellowpage phonebook to explain binary search and tears down half of the book and throw it away. A definitive moment in CS50 indeed. )", "The learning experience is so fun you\u2019ll feel the time fly by without noticing it. Some of the problem set it gives are quite challenging, yet not impossible. And you\u2019ll feel so proud of yourself once you cracked it. You\u2019ll probably fall in love with the joy of problem-solving. If you are stuck, there is an online community on almost every social network platform (Twitter, Reddit, Stack Exchange, Facebook, etc.) where you can get help.", "Puzzle days, office hours, CS 50 Fairs, the final project \u2018All-nighter\u2019 hackathon (free breakfast at IHOP if you stay up all night), lots of activities designed to get you familiar with the \u2018developer culture\u2019 and better prepare you for the software engineering world.", "How great is a computer science course if they don\u2019t use the software tools they developed themselves? Over the years, CS50\u2019s staff has developed a series of tools/software to help the students write code, submit homework, check their code quality/syntax, tidy up code styles, and even generate color-coded code documentation in PDF form! These are all neat and useful \u2018training-wheels\u2019 as David J. Malan puts it and will help you get up to speed.", "But, please don\u2019t just take my words for it, see what YouTube CEO Susan D. Wojcicki said about her experience:", "Being a great course, CS50 is also very relevant to Data Science. It helps you lay a solid foundation of software engineering for your future career:", "So essentially nothing taught in the course is not somewhat useful to you, and the foundation it helps you build will go a long way.", "Once you finished the course, you\u2019ll be more knowledgable and confident to continue your Data Science journey, and I\u2019ll point you to a couple of possible directions from here:", "CS50\u2019s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript", "Teaches you the most relevant and progressive web programming tools like CSS, Javascripts, React, Flask/Django, by the talented TF Brian Yu. Link here.", "Jeremy Howard\u2019s Fast.ai course to Start a \u2018Top-down\u2019 Approach for ML", "Fast.ai is fantastic and unique. It enables you to build state-of-the-art deep learning models within the first lesson with less than ten lines of code. Then it delves down deeper and deeper on the how and why. The only prerequisite is one-year of coding experience, which CS50 would have already prepared you with.", "Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning Course at Coursera", "Another great Machine Learning course, but a \u2018Bottom-up\u2019 style. It smoothly explains the math fundamentals first and gradually builds up the knowledge to piece together complicated machine learning models from scratch. I have an article that explains the difference between Andrew Ng and Jeremy Howard\u2019s different approaches to machine learning education and recommend a potentially efficient way to learn.", "Corey Schafer\u2019s YouTube channel, Python and OOP Tutorials", "As good as it is, CS50 only covers the generic and basic concepts of Python. You\u2019ll need more in-depth knowledge to code efficiently for your data science projects. For this, I recommend Corey Schafer\u2019s YouTube channel. He is one of the best Python educators I came across to explain complicated ideas in a crystal clear way. Not one second of his videos is wasted. The content is concise, to the point, and highly condensed. He has playlists for basic Python, SQL, Matplotlib, Git, and Object-Oriented Programming.", "Learning Data Science is never a breeze, and I hope this article will help a little in alleviating the pain and make your journey a bit more efficient and fun. You can visit this link for all CS50 related courses on edX (just search \u2018CS50\u2019). If you know other courses and resources that are also great, please feel free to leave a response so others can also see. Thanks!", "Found this article useful?
