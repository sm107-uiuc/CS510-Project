It used a Confluence-based tool \u2014 which name I forgot by now \u2014 to split projects into a hierarchy of tasks.", "In my next jobs, I adapted some of the methods. They proved their necessity as our umbrella project were nearing its final phase and the overall pressure increased. In those last days before the Go Live, we had a lot of spontaneous meetings. They made me left my tasks in the middle of the progress, and it was not so easy just to start from the same point where I\u2019d been interrupted.", "Why bother keeping notes at all, isn\u2019t it pedantic? And what it has to do with efficiency and productivity, doesn\u2019t it take even more time?", "Let\u2019s imagine a typical office day \u2026", "I just wanted to grab my coffee. But since we had one kitchen for quite a number of people, it always ended up in an unavoidable small talk. I am generally quite an introvert. Each social interaction pulled in all my not so rich social abilities. It therefore cost me some time to drive my emotional involvement down and get back to work.", "Furthermore, we had a very visitor-friendly data science office. The door stood open all the day. A lot of people came to say hello, and talk about the sunny weather. Such a high level of office socialization had a price. And this price was our concentration.", "A \u201crecovery\u201d lasted 10 to 15 minutes, before I could come into the full concentration again. And there are used to be numerous talks during a day.", "And, indeed, we had lots of meetings. When you know that a meeting is coming in half an hour, you won\u2019t possibly start anything big and needing your full intellectual engagement.", "Jupyter notebooks became my favorites because of these challenges. If I have to stand up and go, I leave an intact track of my experiments with the data, successful and failed ones. I would like to give your some insights.", "After migrating from my Mac to an iPadPro, I temporarily switched from Jupyter Notebook to Google Colaboratory Research. It has a similar interface. I used only essential buttons in Jupyter, and they seem to be on the same place in Colab.", "I actually wanted to use Juno, but after I read a couple of how-tos, I was not so enthusiastic anymore. I stumbled over Colab, and I now use it in a browser. I only have to warn those working with huge amounts of data. You should check, how fast Colab can handle big volumes. For now, I won\u2019t advertise for it.", "Since comments inside the code are not for progress tracking, I keep my notes in a different tool.", "I did not try a lot of apps for keeping notes, but after having started with OneNote, I did not feel like looking for an alternative. It allows me to organize notes into folders, and it offers lots of formats for attachments.", "Since I was in charge of checking the data consistency between two platforms that were run parallel during our hybrid migration, I often had to keep at hand tons of .CSV or Excel files. In OneNote, I could insert them directly into the notebook.", "A desktop version also had a formatting style to highlight code chunks that I often saved directly into OneNote. My last favorite feature was timestamping. I could see when I\u2019ve started the task and when I was finished with it. It was possible to quickly estimate the duration of each task. Good for me and for the project manager too.", "My working diary used to look like this:", "I misused OneNote as a backup tool too. I saved multiple files with my intermediate results. I could always get back to the older version by accessing my diary.", "A big choice of icons, especially, the to-do icon, help to highlight important stuff when the notes grow too large.", "The iOS version that I was using to write this article, misses timestamps (only dates are available) and inserting code chunks. Nevertheless, I liked working with it again and I can only recommend it.", "I would like to start with OneNote. Keeping notes has disciplined me and made me plan my day at the end of the previous one. It spared me time in the next morning. During the day, I added ad hoc tasks.", "So, let us start with an example. For some illustrative parts \u2014 like codes chunks \u2014 I took very simplified pieces to have a common ground for each reader.", "Imagine, I need to visualize the actual coverage of the Google geotargeting locations. It is a collection of locations with their ZIP codes that are supported in the Google targeting tool. If a ZIP code is not included, then you cannot customize your campaign and target it for a particular location.", "So, on the previous evening I put down the following tasks in my OneNote:", "You may have noticed that I am working in the Data Science notebook. I could have other notebooks too. I put a calendar week number in front of the title of each entry in my working diary. It came handy during the days we worked agile, and our workload was broken into two-weeks scrum sprints.", "Apart from being distracted, you may also run into problems during a task. If you keep track of all work you\u2019ve done during the day you don\u2019t have big troubles recollecting why you\u2019ve stopped doing something and switched to some other task instead.", "We could not download the geotargeting locations. I\u2019ll show more details in the next section.", "Let\u2019s put a failure notice near the task we wanted to do originally and make it strikethrough instead of marking it as done.", "Then we think the situation over and add a few to-dos that we need to get the data we want. After the first one is done, we have some results. We write them down. In a nutshell, it seems that the original path to the data was outdated and we have to find the new path. Since the data will be actualized every now and then, we have to find a universal method to get the relevant data each time we want.", "We move to the first subtask, finish it and put some intermediate result here. After the lunch, we may reflect on these HTML snippet and begin the BeautifulSoup task to automate the process of acquiring the actual data path.", "Let\u2019s look what happens in the \u201cback-end.\u201d", "From the technical point of view, my task was to download the data from a URL. The URL ended with \u201c.csv\u201d, which was a good sign. Still, when I added a simple check \u2014 a list length \u2014 the result looked somehow ridiculous. Only 1713 ZIP codes available on the entire Earth? That just cannot be true!", "So, we print the zero line that should have included column names. It throws something that makes no sense in the situation. If we print the next row, it does not look meaningful either.", "We try to make Colab notebook to show the complete output by importing the IPython package, but it does not work. We move it a few cells down. Copy and paste the output in the iOS Notes and have a look at it again. Still no clue.", "We send a simple request and check the response which turns to be a 404 error. The page does not exist.", "We could have directly start with the BeautifulSoup package and automate the parsing of a correct URL. But instead, we make a simple step, shorten the URL and open it.", "We see the page which is one level above the target page in the hierarchy. We discover that it hosts paths to more than one .CSV file: one with retired locations and one with still working ones.", "Thus, we would not only need to parse one URL from the parent web page, but also parse the right one.", "We request the parent page, print the first 1000 symbols to make sure that we got some data we can start with. The output looks good.", "Finding all links on the page works good as well.", "Then we try to get only links containing a \u201c.CSV\u201d part, but it does not work. We experiment with different syntax and keep them all there. If a meeting is announced in the middle of the process, it is easier to come back and not to start the methods we\u2019ve already rejected.", "For instance, one output says that we used a non-iterable type of data. We check if it is true and the type is NoneType. We get yes and try to convert it to strings. It works.", "We adjust the if-condition and it throws two relevant links. Still, we need only one. So, we check for the link text \u2014 this is also the button label \u2014 and add one more if-condition to select only the link which leads to the latest locations. We can now save it and go to the task that was originally planned for today: visualizing the data.", "We mark the to-do box in OneNote as completed!", "Conclusion: we let the code grow gradually and organically, \u201cbackuping\u201d each phase.", "I hope you\u2019ve got an idea of my progress tracking methods. In the next section, I\u2019ll summarize them on a more abstract level.", "You can use these tips if you work with Jupyter, Juno, Google Colaboratory Research, Kaggle, or R Studio. For the last one, you\u2019ll have to activate the Markdown.", "How to avoid losing important information, if you get distracted in the office quite often?", "I do not put the entire code in one cell. These chunks help you to minute your manipulations with the data. After each chunk comes the output part, where you can display your preliminary results.", "As soon as a meeting is over, you can rush to your code and refresh your memory by looking at the outputs.", "I do a lot of copy-pasting. If a part of code does not work properly, I do not delete it completely, but copy the problematic part into the next cell. And then I change it step by step, one change per time. Always copy and paste after each single change. I can always go back to any code cell, and make a new copy of it, and adjust another parameter or use another function, etc.", "I keep the copies that have proven not to work to be able to access their error message later. And to prevent myself from losing track of what I\u2019ve already tried.", "I keep all working copies to be able to choose between the best ones.", "I reserve the cell on the top of each notebook for package imports. For each new package loaded into the notebook on the fly, I later add the import statement in the top chunk.", "This helps to keep the other chunks working if you run only a handful of them. For instance, you started to plot with pyplot, then in a while you\u2019ve added seaborn, but your import statement quickly gets lost somewhere in the middle of the notebook. The next day, you get back to it and want to run only the lines using these packages, but it throws an error, and you have to look for an import statement or write it ad hoc. It ends up with lots of repeating statements throughout your notebook.", "In addition to the import statements, everything that you won\u2019t touch during your experimenting comes on the top too, for instance, command lines suppressing scientific notations.", "For each new trial, I rename the objects used for the same result. If I pull some external data into data frames, different data each time, I do not give the same \u201cdf\u201d name to all data frames. This can cause confusions. Each new command involving an object, named generically, will override the previous command that did some transformation to the similar object. If you somehow go back to a code chunk in the beginning of the notebook, you\u2019ll get unexpected result, since the notebook appeals to the last saved \u201cdf\u201d data frame.", "It only does not apply to figure objects, since the pyplot show command will override any other figure, currently stored in the memory.", "Commenting with adding # in the beginning of a line and leaving meaningful notes will save your precious time in the future. Do not make another diary out of it \u2014 put down only information that shortly explains usage of a function or method.", "Adding hash tagged comments is essential if you are finished with building a code and want to save it for future application a few weeks later. You would not be happy to comb through your OneNote to find an explanation for using one package instead of the other.", "In the final version of my notebook, I separate chunks with headlines to let them catch my attention even if I get nervous and scroll down too fast to read the code itself.", "Since I did not quite follow all my own best practices in the example above, here is a screenshot of my notebook that I used to build a viz for another TDS article:", "Of course, if you cannot concentrate in the office, it may worth it to talk to your boss. A data scientist should have a couple of hours per day at his disposal to work without interruptions.", "A storyteller. Ph.D. in comm science. Statistician, given up to my writing passion.
