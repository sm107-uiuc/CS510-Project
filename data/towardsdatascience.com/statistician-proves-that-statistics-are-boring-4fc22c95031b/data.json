It\u2019s going to get a bouquet after the performance, it\u2019ll usually even get its own Greek letter (typically \u03b8).

Ready?", "Let\u2019s suppose that all you know is that one of the trees is 23m tall. Can you please tell me your estimate for the true average height of all the trees?", "We\u2019d have to guess 23m if this is our only information \u2014 if we guess anything else, we\u2019re just makin\u2019 stuff up. 23m is all we know, so we have to guess 23m. To get something else, we\u2019d have to be incorporating more information (which we don\u2019t have in this example) or we\u2019d have to make assumptions\u2026 at which point we\u2019re again dealing with something other than facts.", "All right, let\u2019s try another one!

You don\u2019t even need a course!", "Here\u2019s the punchline of several textbook chapters\u2019 worth of statistics covering method of moments estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and all their cousins: It turns out that the answer at the end of the proof rainbow is the same answer you just came to intuitively! In 99%+ of cases you encounter in real life, just treating your sample as if it\u2019s your population and going with whatever\u2019s in it is how you get the best guess. You don\u2019t need any special courses. Taa-daa, we\u2019re done!", "It\u2019s a lie that you always need statistics; you don\u2019t. If you\u2019re just trying to make a best guess to get inspired, analytics is the best option for you. Shrug off those p-values, you don\u2019t need the unnecessary stress.", "Instead, you can choose to live by these principles: More (relevant) data is better and your intuition is pretty good for making best guesses, but not for knowing how good those guesses are\u2026 so stay humble.", "However, don\u2019t for a moment think I\u2019m bashing my discipline.
