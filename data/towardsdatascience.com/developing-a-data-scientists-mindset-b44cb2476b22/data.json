These resources advise to learn Python or R, master data munging\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["I\u2019ve seen so many fantastic resources about how to get started from ground zero and transform yourself into a hireable data scientist. These resources advise to learn Python or R, master data munging and cleaning, understand effective and intentional data visualization, or maybe even to study machine learning.", "All of these skills are priceless, and different combinations of them are often required to become an industry-ready data scientist. However, mastering these skills does not mean the battle is over. A data scientist, along with possessing some of the technical skills listed above, is expected to analyze day to day company activity from a perspective that is unique to everyone else\u2019s on the team. When a data scientist is made aware of an event (a need for a new KPI, an upcoming feature to be released to production, a recent increase in customer drop-off, a new marketing campaign, etc.), they have a duty to ensure that any data generated by that event is accounted for, AND used to its full potential.", "For example, can we come up with some creative, domain-specific ways to measure the success of that new feature release? Can we analyze data and isolate a source event or sequence of behaviors that precede the customers leaving a website? Can we reasonably prove that marketing strategy A was better than strategy B?", "It is of utmost importance to maintain a data scientist\u2019s mindset. A wonderful way to capture the essence of this mindset is through the two juxtapositions that make up the complex responsibilities and thought processes of a data scientist.", "\u201cDetermination drives the data scientist to get all worth that they can out of the data, and adaptability keeps the data scientist honest.\u201d", "A constant reminder that I pose to myself is, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in yourself, who will?\u201d Nobody knows your work better than you do. Nobody believes in your work like you do. Nobody will truly know when your findings are ready to be presented like you will. No one will know when your model is ready to be deployed to production like you will. You were hired on for your specific skills that bring unique value to your company. It is your responsibility to make sure that all of the work you put out is honest and possesses integrity. When you need to be determined and advocate for your work, you must do so. You can do this in a myriad of ways, but here are a couple examples:", "On the flip-side, a data scientist must be willing to take one for the team when it is time. If there is a priority shift in the company, they should be able to switch gears quickly and transfer focus to whatever important task is at hand. A data scientist should always be willing to learn new things \u2014 whether that be a new domain (such as consumer finance, outbound email marketing, civic technology) or a new business intelligence software. A data scientist should be determined, but should never let the pursuit of their research keep them from seeing when it is time to shift focus. Sometimes, it may even be time to drop a project completely, if the business side decides there are more important priorities, or that a current project is deemed a dead end. A data scientist should always do their best to be adaptable in ways such as:", "I know that being determined and being adaptable aren\u2019t necessarily exact opposites. But, the essence of these two traits really balance themselves in a way that makes a more well-rounded data scientist. The determination drives the data scientist to get all worth that they can out of the data at their disposal and gives them the confidence to believe that those findings are accurate, valuable, and worth being heard. The adaptability keeps the data scientist honest, prevents them from becoming stagnant in their education and skill development, and (in my opinion) makes them overall more pleasant to work with.", "All techies learn very quickly in the industry that communicating your thoughts, concerns, and new ideas about projects can be extremely difficult\u2026 especially when trying to talk to someone who is not in the same field as you are. However, one of the most demanded \u201csoft skills\u201d in data science is effective communication, because data scientists are storytellers. When it\u2019s time to decide which sector of the company to focus on next quarter, a data scientist will need to come up with a narrative to justify which focus would yield the most benefits for the company. When a data scientist develops a model to help predict consumer behavior, he/she must communicate to the stakeholders why that model could positively impact revenue. A data scientist must be able to uncover the most complex and deep insights, but that is not the end of their task. A great finding only gets you so far! They must morph these insights into full-blown stories and actionable items that pull business counterparts in and convince them of the insights\u2019 actual value. Being articulate can be a tough task to master, but here are some ways to practice:", "Being able to explain what you found is obviously a very important part of a data scientist\u2019s workflow, but more important than talking is the ability to ask questions and listen. A data scientist should always be asking questions to their business counterparts. Although they are not the ones writing the code, the business counterparts (product owners, directors, executives, etc.) are the ones who possess valuable and fundamental domain-specific knowledge that will help the code gain value. The business counterparts aren\u2019t the ones analyzing the data. But, they are the ones generating it, or at least have a part in the data being generated, and they have indispensable industry knowledge that will help your analyses immensely. Likewise, a data scientist should always be asking questions about his/her own work. What will happen if I have a 0 or NULL there? Am I missing data? Do these numbers make sense? Numbers speak louder than words, so listen! Here are a couple of good opportunities to be more inquisitive in your work:", "Similar to the previous traits mentioned, being articulate and inquisitive are not mutually exclusive. But, the two traits really compliment each other in a way that turns a data scientist into a force to be reckoned with. The articulation gives the data scientist the ability to connect with coworkers and clients from a variety of backgrounds; it also allows them to provide more powerful, relatable explanations and presentations. The constant inquisition pushes the data scientist to constantly maintain the quality of their work, and to continually pursue excellence.", "The field of data science is so beautifully broad. There are new languages, packages, software, and algorithms being released every day, and there is no sign of that slowing down. With all of these new tools constantly popping up, there is always pressure to keep your skills up to par. Regardless of which tools you focus your time on, if you constantly check your mindset, you will be all the better data scientist for it. Be determined, yet adaptable. Be articulate, yet inquisitive.", "Your home for data science.
