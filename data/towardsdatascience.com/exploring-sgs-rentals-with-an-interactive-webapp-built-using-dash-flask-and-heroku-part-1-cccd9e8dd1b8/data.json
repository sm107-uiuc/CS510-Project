On one hand, you want your work to be appreciated by a wider audience, not just your fellow technical peers but also your non-technical ones. Maybe you want to share it with your friend who is curious about DS but may not fully understand the codes, simply because he/she has never actually dived that deep.

I built this. Isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d", "I was at one point feeling like this with my most recent project. I decided to take it to the next level by building a fully interactive Webapp \u2014 even though I\u2019ve never built one before \u2014 where users can play with the data, build their model, pick their important features and get back a certain prediction/results.", "Finally, I succeeded \u2014 building my first ever ML Webapp. You can check out the app HERE. This is an app about exploring rental properties in Singapore \u2014 where I\u2019m staying.", "The app consists of 3 sections", "A. The first section that allows users to play with the data by specifying min & max rental rates, then choose the features and the property type they are interested in and the app returns back some interactive visualizations", "B. The second section allows users to propose a hypothetical property and the app will attempt to predict its rental rate using on a model built in-situ by the users via some guided questions", "C. The last section allows users to propose a hypothetical property, specify which attributes are important to them and the app returns most similar properties to the one proposed based on the established criteria", "I used Flask as my Webapp framework to create my server-side Python program, Plotly Dash to serve my interactive visualizations, and the usual suspects Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn as tools to build up parts and parcels of my program. Last but not least, I used the free app-hosting site Heroku to deploy my work.

You can check out its official website here http://flask.pocoo.org/.

Take a look at the codes for the form below:", "***There are a few explanations to help you understand this form better:", "On top of the main page, your template folder should contain other templates (for example the one returned by one of the view showing the result of whatever your model is trying to forecast). I use two other templates, one \u2014 prediction_result.html \u2014 for returning the answer of Section 2 and the other \u2014 filtering_result.html \u2014 for returning the answer of section 3. I also use various more templates to return some error page with instructions to the user, whenever certain conditions of the program are not met.
