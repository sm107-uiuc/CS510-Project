Do the researchers present a different face than the big tech companies?", "I totally understand why people are flocking to the Neural Information Processing Conference these days. Sure, selling out in 12 minutes is a problem, but the show here shows tremendous promise for the impact of machine learning. I stand by machine learning being one of the tools we can use to out-innovate many global problems (I think it can be a bit naive to think we can out-conserve things climate change).", "The highlights of the conference are all tracked on the vibrant Twitter community calling out the best results and asking questions of dubious moments. There is also a substantial discussion thinking about where machine learning is going in a technological and humane sense. Considering the negative press machine learning can tend to get in mainstream media, this event really delivered on a community trying to do the best it can for society and keep others in check (If only some more of this could be applied to the peer review system that got many of the individuals here).", "There is a huge push among the researchers here for accountability. I was presenting a poster on \u201cObjective Mismatch in Model-based Reinforcement Learning\u201d at the Deep RL Workshop, and the crowd was very receptive to the idea that some of our underlying assumptions of how RL works may be flawed.", "I also happened to be presenting my poster next to a researcher at Google pushing for more metrics of reliability in RL algorithms. This means: how consistent is the performance papers propose when they claim a new \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d across environments and random seeds. This realistic robustness may be the key to getting these algorithms to be more useful on real applications (such as robotics which I will always bring up as a great interpretable platform for RL).", "The highlight comment between our two posters was from Oriol Vinyals (a pretty famous researcher in the area), on what happens if we compare current RL baselines to humans solving the tasks? We guessed that humans would both solve reasonable tasks faster and more reliably \u2014 so we still have a ton of work to do as an industry!", "Additionally, there\u2019s a slew of examples of researchers questioning why people are engaging on sensitive topics. Force on the ground countering dangerous trends in our field is the only way for big companies to take note.", "Reinforcement learning has proven itself as a capable tool for learning how to act in structured environments, so how do we use this to improve health? Me and my new friend Stephanie Chan (A Google AI Resident from the neuroscience side of things), came up with the idea of applying RL on lab mice to examine different diet, medicinal, and activity patterns. Many medical labs use mice as a precursor to human experiments, so it\u2019s the logical starting point. I\u2018m thinking about sending some emails to biology students at Berkeley that may be crazy enough to give this a shot with me. I\u2019m in because it\u2019ll merge my professional interests of RL with my personal passions of longevity and wellness. Any thoughts?", "The problem would essentially be formatted as RL figures out the best way to optimize a subset of biomarkers in mice. The environment would have actions be a set of combinations of (diet, activity, and medications), and the reward would either be lifespan (sparse reward) or biomarkers (harder to analyze continuous reward). How hard can it be?", "Federated learning is designing systems in the cloud that can merge private data (e.g. patient data) on a central server to improve learning metrics and outcomes (e.g. medical image detection). Research in this area is applying to an area closely tied to cybersecurity and the medical system, both of which are already difficult to work with at times.", "That being said, federated learning becoming a standard would be huge. As of now, most hospitals share surprisingly little data because of privacy agreements. Who doesn\u2019t want their scans anonymously compared to a nation-wide database by a computer? It adds safe, quantitative analysis to the human side of the medical system.", "I also am going to add that creating general structures for how our data can 1) be used to help a bigger system while 2) not being personally tied to our identity is the correct direction for data use. Most companies buy and sell our data all the time, so being able to maintain privacy while using the data is a huge win.", "Here is a summary from Nvidia just a little earlier this year on federated learning.", "Federated learning yells out to me as a huge promising direction in the learning community. Learning is changing the world because of its ability to make connections in datasets, and federated learning is a structured system to apply learning to large society-scale problems that previously have been inaccessible due to a lack of infrastructure.", "Coffee and Nature. I totally loved my brief stay here, and am coming back.", "More? Subscribe to my newsletter on robotics, artificial intelligence, and society!", "Your home for data science.
