They are particularly important in Finance, Trading, Health, Conversations and decision making in general. For a long time, however, we have been looking for ways of offloading the actual numeric operations to machines (moving arithmetics and algebra to calculators) or use machines to more efficiently look for the numbers we need (filtering and sorting to Excel).", "As soon as we knew how to arrange marbles, we invented the abacus. We have calculators and more advanced tools for most forms of computation. In NLP, we use information extraction to pull out the relevant numbers from text. But how do we contextually understand numerical relations in text?", "When scoping out a NLP solution, some numeric capabilities are likely required of your model: this may mean anything between adding a whole bundle of models to handle the numeric part of the solution or no change at all.", "Can the current best in class NLP models deal with such questions? If so, how well? Do they need to?", "In this article, I will arm myself with the findings of about a dozen recent NLP numeracy papers and try to answer those questions.", "This is a non-technical intro to the topic and the state of Numeracy in NLP. Part 2 will explore some of the details of the different solutions and bring up more technical terms. Here is my agenda:", "Part 2: How to be good at math if you are a Transformer:", "Does any of this matter? In almost all applications, there are cases where numbers play a crucial role. These are cases where numeric quantities and operations provide crucial information about the content/outcome of the text without being expressed in the semantics of the text. Let us look at some use cases:", "So far, for question answering, the answer needed the answer to be pretty much spelt out in a document for a QA system to give it back to us. If we ask: \u201cWhat are financial services companies with market value over USD 100mn?\u201d Likely, for an answer, we will need an article titled: \u201cList of companies by market value\u201d and would receive back the whole list without any further reasoning over it. The systems I describe below provide techniques for obtaining an explicit list as an answer. This has profound implications for domain-specific datasets, where QA systems need to do a lot more heavy lifting than when searching the web \u2014 the internet has a lot of redundancies in information which makes finding answers easier there than in a domain-specific set of documents where information may only occur once.", "Typically, we might want to compare a set of statements to either confirm the reinforce each other, they are contradictory or independent of each other. Different sources of information can express the same statements very differently, in ways that simple comparisons often fail to match them. comparing words or embeddings is not good enough. The task of entailment can help here, two sources:", "Commonly, chatbots aim to either collect information from the user to perform certain task, e.g. restaurant reservation or to provide information back to the user, e.g. find a good answer to a question by the user by using a FAQ database or the customer history. Again, if these include reference to numeric operations, traditional chatbots may struggle. Examples where the tools in this article will help are:", "From the above, you might notice a range of numerical concepts used: from sorting, through addition, counting etc. It turns out, NLP models perform significantly differently on tasks of different complexity.

The challenge for NLP is to translate the vagueness and frivolous nature of language to the stern and concrete numeric form.", "Here is a list of common numeracy tasks NLP needs to deal with. This is a summary of the main types covered by the DROP [Dua, et al., 2019] and EQUATE [Ravichander, et al., 2019] datasets which we will look at in more detail later. Note that this is an oversimplification trying to capture the main items pertaining to numeracy in text", "Before we can answer whether we are good or bad at numeracy, we need to establish a framework for testing that. In this article, we will focus on two types of reasoning over text: Question answering and Natural Language Inference.", "The task of answering questions (typically reading comprehension questions), but abstaining when presented with a question that cannot be answered based on the provided context.

The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus is a crowd-sourced collection of 433k sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information. Definition taken from the dataset page, consider checking out the paper too", "NLI for Numeracy The equivalent dataset for numeric reasoning here is EQUATE [Ravichander, et al., 2019]. They focus specifically on numerical tasks by selecting statements from several different sources: RTE (existing NLI datasets), CNN, reddit, additionally they generate synthetic examples (StressTest and AWPNLI). They use the cases where numerical operations are crucial to the statement. They then ask crowdworkers or experts to provide a paraphrased or contradictory statement. Several datasets are created, here is the final breakdown.", "Like with traditional NLI tasks, the outcomes are one of three options, with some exceptions where only entailment and no entailment are available.", "Here are some examples from the paper:", "To demonstrate how we can measure numeracy, we will use some results from using BERT [Delvin, et al., 2019] for prediction. BERT is now commonly used as a baseline model architecture for measuring NLP performance. The choice comes mostly from its accessibility and name recognition.", "Consider BERT\u2019s performance on the above two tasks:", "In short, standard NLP solutions do not fare well in numerical challenges without help. Fear not, though, help is coming\u2026", "Here, I will provide a brief overview of the results achieved since BERT. Please note, that the next article will deal with explaining the differences between the mentioned models, this just outlines some conclusions.", "The results are also very different by the type of operations needed. When matching objectives with solutions, therefore one can consider which types of tasks are relevant. Please note, that I use results from DROP as proxies here as it is the most widely used dataset. However, this means these are purely QA based outcomes and may not translate exactly to other tasks.", "Evidence suggests that (see table above for summary results):", "As we see from the evidence, the answer as to what can be done is rather nuanced, hence further consideration is needed based on the use case that applies.", "This was the non-technical part of a two part series on NLP numeracy.
