If x[n] in the input to an LTI system with impulse response h[n], the output y[n] is given by convolution operation: Gee, nice equation, but what does it mean, we asked\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["The way we teach and learn convolution is convoluted :)", "Remember how we learnt it? If x[n] in the input to an LTI system with impulse response h[n], the output y[n] is given by convolution operation:", "Gee, nice equation, but what does it mean, we asked. And we got the visual flip, slide and multiply accumulate!", "Say I give you two sequences:", "And I ask you for the convolution output. What would you do? Especially if you don\u2019t have Matlab or Octave or Python. Would you evaluate the y[n] = \u2211\u2096 h[k] x[n-k] equation for the above two sequences?", "Instead, just fire up your regular calculator. Multiply the two numbers (that you get by reading the sequence right to left): 21200121 x 1003003. The result (21263784963363) that you get (again, readout digits right to left) is the convolution output! That is right, convolution from just plain regular multiplication. Don\u2019t believe me? Try it out!", "To cross check if the answer is right, here is the convolution output using Python\u2019s scipy.Signal:", "Of course there is nothing surprising about this to many of you who understand what Convolution really is. After all, the multiplication pattern we have for numbers that are sequences of 1s already hint at this:11 x 11 = 121111 x 111 = 12321 1111 x 1111=1234321 and so on. Recognize the pattern? Convolution of two square waves produces a triangle.", "So why does this multiplication trick work, and why not for all sequences? It works because the convolution operation is as fundamental as multiplying two sequences. How do we multiply two sequences? By making them as coefficients of a polynomial of course! Say we have two sequences [a0, a1, a2] and [b0, b1, b2]. Create polynomials (a0 + a1x + a2x\u00b2) (b0 + b1x + b2x\u00b2)", "You can now read out the convolution output as coefficients of the resulting polynomial.", "When does the multiplication trick not work? When any of the coefficients of the output polynomial becomes larger than 10. Because convolution doesn\u2019t \u201ccarry\u201d digits like in decimal representation.", "Another check: convolution of a length m sequence and length n sequence has output length of m+n-1. A length m sequence is a polynomial of degree m-1, so the higher order term will be x\u207d\u207f\u207b\u00b9\u207e * x\u207d\u1d50\u207b\u00b9\u207e= x\u207d\u207f\u207a\u1d50\u207b\u00b2\u207e. If a polynomial has degree (m+n-2), it has m + n \u2014 1 coefficients.", "That gives us the intuition. After all, we learn algebra in school while we learn convolution only in Signals and Systems 101 during Engineering. Why not build on what we have already learnt and are comfortable with?", "That is not to say the flip and multiply isn\u2019t useful. That interpretation is extremely useful when you look at 2D convolution. You can visualize it as flipping (both horizontally and vertically) your 2D kernel, overlapping it on the first sample (top left corner) of your 2D data, then simply drag the kernel down till you reach the last row of first column, reset to top row of second column, drag down. Rinse and repeat until you reach the sample at last column last row. Here is a quick and dirty Python code convolving a 8x8 input with a 4x4 kernel:", "The way the equation y[n] = \u2211\u2096 h[k]x[n-k] is setup is also an important building block to understand digital filters and doing computations with the discrete Fourier transforms. However, while we must be trained on the rigor, we mustn\u2019t lose our intuition along the way.", "By the way, I could have finished this post in one paragraph, saying convolution is the same as polynomial multiplication. But where is the fun in that?!", "Your home for data science.
