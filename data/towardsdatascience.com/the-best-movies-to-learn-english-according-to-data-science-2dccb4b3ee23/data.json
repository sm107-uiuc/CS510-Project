If you type \u2018best movies to learn English or Spanish\u2019 on Google, countless recommendations will show up. Most of those recommendations come from personal choices, which is good; however, as a data science enthusiast, I turn to data to answer questions. This time is no exception, so I\u2019ll analyze the top 3000 movies to answer the question, \u2018What are the best movies to learn a foreign language?\u2019", "To find the best movies to learn a foreign language, I compared the vocabulary used in dialogues among the 3000 most popular movies according to IMDb. You can find how easy or hard is the vocabulary in your favorite movie by searching them in the box below. There you\u2019ll find the rank and vocabulary covered in movie dialogues. The higher the vocabulary coverage the easier to understand a movie (movies in the top 10 have the easiest vocabulary among all the movies analyzed). Some movies on the list may not be suitable for you, so please check their description on IMDb first.", "I also ranked the 3000 movies for intermediate (CA) and advanced (CB) level as I did in previous articles for episodes of Friends, Game of Thrones, The Simpsons, The Big Bang Theory, Breaking Bad, and SpongeBob. The movies furthest to the right have more basic vocabulary on each level. At the same time, the movies on top are the most popular in each column. Hopefully, you\u2019d be able to find popular movies you like that use basic vocabulary in their dialogues.", "I also made a similar ranking of best movies and shows available on Netflix and Disney+ that are great for learning a foreign language. Check them out in case you have a subscription in one of them.", "In case you\u2019d like to know more about how to learn languages by watching TV shows and movies, I wrote a complete guide explaining how I learned 3 languages so far by watching TV.", "Now let\u2019s compare top-rated movies, so you\u2019d know which popular movies would be hard and easy for you to understand.", "You might\u2019ve heard that children\u2019s movies like Toy Story are easier to understand than movies from other genres. We\u2019ll verify if this is true by comparing the vocabulary covered in the movies Toy Story, Batman Begins, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Titanic and Stuart Little. The heatmap below shows the vocabulary coverage for the five movies.", "In the first column, we see that the box for the movie Toy Story has the lightest color indicating that it has the lowest A-level vocabulary coverage (87.4%) among the five movies. Although Toy Story is meant for children, the character \u2018Buzz Lightyear\u2019 throughout the movie tends to use particular phrases like this one:", "I\u2019m stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxyfrom the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.", "Maybe it\u2019s easy when you see words written like above, but if English is your second language or you study English, listening to those phrases won\u2019t be so easy to understand.", "So no doubt why Toy Story has the smallest A-level vocabulary coverage. The results also suggest that the movies with the highest coverage at the A and A+B levels are Titanic (89.8%) and Stuart Little (96.1%), respectively. That is, it\u2019ll be easier for a learner with B1 level to understand the movie Titanic compared to the other films listed, while Stuart Little would be the best movie to watch for people at C1 level. Also, note that when we count the C1 vocabulary in the third column, the coverage slightly varies, since the C1 vocabulary level is barely mentioned in movies.", "If you checked the heatmap carefully, you might\u2019ve noticed that coverage values in the A or A+B levels among movies aren\u2019t so far from one another (2.4% gap in the A column and 4.7% in the A+B column). However, the effect a small 1% vocabulary coverage has on English comprehension might surprise you.", "According to the National Center for Voice and Speech, the average conversation rate for English speakers in the United States is about 150 words per minute. One percent coverage lower represents 1 unknown word every 100 words. That is, the 2.4% gap between Toy Story and Titanic at A-level vocabulary coverage indicates that Toy Story\u2019s dialogues have around 3 more unknown words per minute than Titanic. The percentage may seem little, but this could determine whether you would have fun watching movies or a hard time trying to figure out what a character is saying.", "To answer the question \u2018What are the best movies to learn a foreign language?\u2019, we may need the help of a huge movie fan who watches tons of movies regularly. Such people may be hard to find; however, movies\u2019 dialogues transcribed by movie fans are available online. Once I collected the movies\u2019 transcripts, I could read them one by one to find the best option among them, but it could take me months to read 3000 transcripts.", "Fortunately, there are tools like CountVectorizer that can tokenize each transcript for us. Tokenization breaks the raw text into words called tokens. For example, the famous Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s line \u201cHasta la vista, baby\u2019 in the movie Terminator can be split into four tokens: \u2018hasta\u2019, \u2018la\u2019, \u2018vista\u2019, \u2018baby\u2019. In this way, it\u2019s possible to build a table that tells us the vocabulary used in each movie. This is easily explained in the following picture.", "Each cell represents the number of times a word was mentioned in a movie. In the table above, the term \u2018able\u2019 was mentioned once in Movie 1 and 3, but it wasn\u2019t mentioned in Movie 2, then the value assigned is 0. That\u2019s how we find all the words said in each movie, but to determine the best movies to learn a language, we also need to know the vocabulary level used in movies\u2019 dialogues.", "Vocabulary is one of the most critical factors in achieving enough comprehension of movies, so this analysis aims to determine the movies covering most of the vocabulary at the English levels A1-A2 (A) and B1-B2 (B), according to Oxford\u2019s word lists. For the analysis, I used the Oxford\u2019s 5000 list, which provides words classified by levels from A1 to C1 that every English learner should know.", "Movies that often use A-level vocabulary in their dialogues would be easy to understand for people with at least B1 level, while movies with the highest A+B vocabulary coverage would be perfect for learners at C1 level. That being said, let\u2019s find the top 50 movies for learners at B1 and C1 levels!", "By using Python, it was possible to obtain the vocabulary coverage for all the movies collected as we did before for the five movies. The distribution of the A-level vocabulary coverage for the 3000 movies is presented in the following histogram.", "According to the above histogram, many movies covered around 90% A-level vocabulary, so people at B1 level would recognize 90% of movies\u2019 dialogues. However, as we said before, every percentage in coverage matters, then it\u2019ll be much better to recommend movies with the highest coverage (represented by the shortest bar on the right). Note that the smallest bar contains about 200 movies with at least 93% coverage, but not all of those movies would be the best option for you (say, you just don\u2019t like the movie\u2019s genre or the movie isn\u2019t attractive enough for you). For that reason, I had to make a trade-off between vocabulary coverage and movies\u2019 popularity (following the IMDb ratings) to come up with the top 50 movies. The following are the 10 most popular movies with at least 93% A-level vocabulary coverage.", "Are any of these movies good enough for you to watch?", "The rest of the top 50 movies are listed at the end of the post, in case you want to check if your favorite movie is in it.", "The second histogram shows that more than 1000 movies cover around 94% A+B-level vocabulary. However, the most attractive group of movies to watch at C1 level offer at least 96% coverage. The following are the 10 most popular movies with at least 96% A+B-level vocabulary coverage.", "As you might expect, many movies already recommended for B1 level would also be recommended for C1 level, but I didn\u2019t include them to avoid repetition in the top 50. If your level is C1 feel free to watch any of the movies previously recommended for B1 level.", "Finally, a few observations on how I worked with the data:", "If you\u2019d like to see the code behind this analysis, you can find it here. Keep in mind that vocabulary is not the only factor in obtaining a good understanding of movies. Pronunciation, accent and speech pace might increase or decrease your level of comprehension as well.", "Top 50 movies for learners at B1-B2 level (at least 93% A-level vocabulary coverage)", "Top 50 movies for learners at C1 level (at least 96% A+B-level vocabulary coverage)", "Your home for data science.
