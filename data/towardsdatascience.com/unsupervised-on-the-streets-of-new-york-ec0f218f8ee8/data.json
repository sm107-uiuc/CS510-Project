There have been academic papers done on the changes in neighborhoods and one of the more recent Ellen & Ding (2016) was the benchmark with which I compared my model.", "Taking a data science approach, I wanted to ask a very specific question:", "The most important feature of this project to understand is that this is unsupervised learning. This means that the target variable was not provided for the model. So instead of predicting an already decided outcome, the model would be taking the data and coming to its own conclusions. In the end, I will compare this to the findings from the academic paper I referenced.", "The best data set for this type of work was the U.S. Census Tract Data and through some research, I found a study on diversity done at Brown University (Longitudinal Tract Data Base \u2014 LTDB). The study collected and compiled census and American Community Survey (ACS) information from 2000, 2010, and 2012.", "The types of data were naturally split into two different data sets. General demographic data was built into the census itself. This included age, family size, race, and ethnicity. The survey data included much more detailed information \u2014 immigration status, types of employment, and income. All of these features are included for every census tract in the four boroughs. A combination of these two datasets would be the most productive in terms of identifying gentrification. The project continued in the following way.", "The first step was processing the 2000 U.S. Census Data and the first on the list of steps was isolating New York City. I did this with a helper function I created so that I didn\u2019t have to put the function definition in the code. To understand this code fully, you need to know that Staten Island was not included in this study. Its distinctive characteristics in terms of racial makeup and population density made it the outlier of the group.", "So with a quick function, I was able to isolate the four boroughs of New York City out of all the counties of the United States. Next came the percentages of the overall population that I wanted.", "Then I split the data into two categories, people data, and housing data. The people side could include cultural heritage (ie. Russian, Puerto Rican, Irish\u2013descent), while the housing would tell us details about the details of the buildings and homes (ie. Rent vs Own, Multi-Unit Building vs Single Family Homes).", "Since gentrification is about change then total counts would not do much to inform the model. I needed a clearer picture of these neighborhood transformations and that meant finding out how the ratios had changed. I needed to find the percent changes and to do that I needed to find the percentages of the start date.", "Using the total population as the denominator I quickly made a function to calculate how much of the population fit these subsets. This applied to both the housing and people subsets. This would help answer some of the more specific questions.", "What was the percentage of the population that was white? African-American? How many people owned their homes? What was the percentage of blue-collar vs white-collar workers? Unemployed? First I had to make these lists manually. They were all uniquely named so I had to sort them but once I did I saved the column names as lists.", "The below function allowed me to take the percentages while also dropping the now unneeded full count columns.", "This process was repeated for the 2010 Census Data. The two data sets were then combined. Next came the most important part, which the entire project would be based on \u2014 calculating percent change.", "The increase or decrease in the percentage of a population will be the driving factor in the unsupervised learning model. It was a combination of two functions. The first pulled the columns from each data set, both 2000 and 2010, and saved them as a zipped file. The second takes the percent change and saves it as its own column.", "This may lead to some values of infinity but that can be replaced easily.", "Both of these processes are repeated for the sample data. At the end of this long data cleaning and preprocessing, we have a data frame that contains the percent changes of each census tract in New York City. Next, we moved on to the exploration portion of the project.", "For the data exploration part, I used a combination of Python\u2019s Seaborn Package and Tableau. For the Python portions, I will include the accompanying code.", "There are several metrics that you can measure gentrification. Changes in white or non-white populations and changes in median income. My exploration focused on these things.", "My first step was to check out the distribution.", "There are several things that you can take away from this graph. First, is that there is a higher count of census tracts with positive non-white population changes than there are for white populations. Secondly, you can see that while the more census tracts are seeing increases in their non-white populations the tracts with increases in their white populations are seeing huge increases.", "I also wanted to do work with spatial data so I made the following graphs on Tableau. The first showcases the census tract with the largest increase in the white population.", "Bedford-Stuyvesant has the top four spots with more than a 2000% increase in the white population in that neighborhood. The dark blue spots are all in Bedford -Stuyvesant. The last metric we spotlighted is the change in income. This is best demonstrated with a map of Manhattan.", "Central Harlem is inside the red circle. According to the census data, the median income per family has gone up over 250%. This is an incredible amount and cannot be accounted for with wage increases. It can only be explained by a new group of people moving in with far more wealth than those that had lived there previously.", "The next step in the process was the creation of clusters. Clustering is an unsupervised classification technique that takes a look at all of the data and makes groups based on similarities in their features. In a two dimensional space, a centroid model looks like this.", "However, for my dataset, we are looking at more than 100+ features. That is very hard to visualize and just as hard for a cluster to do its work. Using all of the features meant trying to create clusters in a 108 dimension space. At that point, the distance between points in a cluster meant nothing. So I had to use subsets.", "I tried three separate models, each with three different subsets of features. The first was Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), KMeans, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For a detailed explanation into clustering, check out this blog about clustering from Analytics Vidhya. The best model was chosen based on its Silhouette Score. Which takes into account its distortion and inertia. Basically, how tight the clusters were and how far apart they were from each other.", "The final results ended with PCA with a certain subset being the model with the best Silhouette Score.", "PCA, using the second subset, had the best Silhouette Score and was chosen as the final model. Here are some spatial graphs of those results.", "The cluster had the deficiency of not being able to make assumptions on a census tract\u2019s future status. The data was all about population changes but did not include anything about the original state of the 2000 census data. This meant that the cluster only had knowledge of the final state of a census tract and not make assumptions on what a neighborhood that may be vulnerable to gentrification would look like.", "In the cluster\u2019s model, most of northern Brooklyn has suffered from gentrification. This is a product of the rezoning laws and rapid development Brooklyn has seen over the time frame.", "In keeping with unsupervised learning, the clusters are not assigned labels by the model. Rather they are assigned grouping numbers. It is only during the analysis that I assign the titles to each cluster. The easiest is the null values that are assigned to places like parks, heavy commercial districts where there are a small number of residents, or prisons (in the case of Riker\u2019s Island). Next were the \u2018Stable\u2019 tracts. The designation received here does not definitively indicate what the level of gentrification is in 2010 but rather that there has not been a significant change in any of the populations or income levels. The \u2018Mixture\u2019 label is the most complicated to understand. Since the model does not look at possibilities, I cannot classify this as tracts that are vulnerable to gentrification. This group required a study of their placement in the city. My domain knowledge is much stronger for Manhattan than it is for Brooklyn so I will use that cluster plot to make my next point.", "In the map of Manhattan above, take note of the dark grey areas. They include places on the Upper East Side, Midtown, and Battery Park City. As a group, there isn\u2019t much reason why they wouldn\u2019t be in the \u2018Stable\u2019 group. However, we must keep in mind that the time frame the model is working with is 2000 to 2010. In September 2001, Battery Park City became uninhabitable due to the fires still burning at the World Trade Center. So it went from a very high-class neighborhood to mostly deserted. The other neighborhoods like the Upper East Side and Midtown seem to be misclassified. That is why the label of \u2018Mixture\u2019 was applied. It acted like a catchall for the tracts that didn\u2019t fit into any of the other categories.", "The \u2018Gentrifying\u2019 cluster shows a stark picture. Areas with sudden increases in income and white population or large decreases of a non-white population show up. The Lower East Side and Harlem are obvious classifications. However, Hell\u2019s Kitchen was surprising. While not known as a historical minority neighborhood it was largely commercial until development began in earnest.", "The next step was to take a qualitative look at the similarities and differences between the model\u2019s classification and the metrics established in Ellen & Ding.", "In the model above you can see how much more the clustering model identified a census tract as gentrifying. Northern Brooklyn, including Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant, are almost all accounted for here. But in the map generated by the metrics of that group is much smaller.", "In Manhattan, the headline is the census tracts that Ellen & Ding did not identify as gentrifying that the cluster did. While they did agree on much of the same neighborhoods, the cluster model also identified northern Manhattan \u2014 Washington Heights and Inwood as gentrifying.", "Keeping in mind that while this data is from 2000 to 2010, with some information coming from the 2012 ACS, the results are pretty clear. New York has seen a major amount of gentrification with Brooklyn having more than 17% of its census tracts gentrified. Brooklyn is still undergoing major gentrification in 2020 and the results have not yet become clear.", "The next steps for this project would include working with the census data from 2020 and the most recent ACS data. It will be interesting to see how the other boroughs have been developed and whether there are any new hotspots for gentrification.", "If you would like to talk more about this project or connect, you can find me on LinkedIn.
