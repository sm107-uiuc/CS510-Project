These reviews are key for product managers to better understand their customers. In this tutorial we will use RapidMiner and Python to do topic modelling on Amazon reviews.", "The data we are analyzing comes from kaggle. The total data set consists of 564.033 reviews. Besides the review text body text of the article, we also get some more describing attributes like time posted, Helpfulness and User & Product IDs. In this article we will focus on the text itself.", "For run time reasons, we will sample down the number of reviews to 10,000.", "As usual in analytics, we need to preprocess our data a bit. For this analysis we first want transform everything to lower cases with the Transform Cases operator. Later we also want to remove Stopwords like \u201cthe\u201d. These words are not useful in detecting distinct topics in our data. If they contribute to our modelling it is usually a negative point \u2014 i.e generating a \u201cgeneric\u201d topic or similar.", "We further remove all words which occur less than 50 times in the documents. This helps us reduce runtime while still having good results.", "To detect the topics we run a Latent Dirichlet Analysis, or short LDA. This is an algorithm tasked to find topics in data sets. We do this using the Extract Topics from Documents (LDA) operator from RapidMiner\u2019s Operator Toolbox extension. The implementation behind this is from MALLET, which is also available in R&Python.", "The LDA algorithm got a few parameters to set. Besides preprocessing decisions we need to define the number of topics to search for, the priors of the Dirichlet distribution and the number of optimization iterations. In this example we will focus on a qualitative analysis of the number of topics. For the priors we use MALLET\u2019s auto-tuning of parameters and for the iterations we use 1000.", "If you want to do a quantitative optimization on hyper-parameters you can use the model diagnostics which are exposed as a performance vector. The problem here is that most performance measures are usually getting better the more topics you add. It\u2019s somewhat like the problem in clustering, where the in-cluster distances go down, the more clusters you add. Thus, I decided to do this qualitativelyand look atthe clusters using word clouds of the most important words.", "What you can clearly see in the word clouds is, that some topics seem to split into subtopics the more you add. When selecting 6 topics you can see that Topic_5 is a mixture of generic amazon and product related topics. This topic splits up into Topic_0, Topic_3 and Topic_5 if you go for 12 topics. Similarity, you can see that \u2018coffee\u2019 and \u2018tea\u2019 was ine topic in the 6-topic setup, but gets two in the 12.", "The decision on which topics you want to take should of course be aligned with your business goals. If you are interested to track the number of tea reviews individually, you should not opt for the 6. topics review.", "We have seen how you can implement topic modelling, but often the question is: Why should I do this in a business?", "Applying topic mining to your customer or internal data can easily and quickly enable your analytics teams (even the domain experts and business analysts) to visually identify causalities and correlations in the data, and help them solve challenging business problems like customer churn and employee satisfaction.", "The most popular of application are:", "Let\u2019s have a look at some of the most common ways to move forward from here.", "Having topic assigments at hand you can put this into common BI-Tools. Is there a specific region where topics cluster? Did we have a problem on a specific weekend? All of these questions can be answered retrospectivly from the data.", "Sometimes you are interested in single topics. You want to know if the \u201cdelivery time\u201d topic is raising over time. By doing a time series forecast on the number of documents per day associated to a topic, you can create an alarm signal. The signal notifies the user or responsible business unit that there is a spike in \u201cdelivery time\u201d as topic and possible bottle-neck in the delivery process, allowing the business to resolve this issue and maintain good service.", "Of course, you can use these topic distributions now to further analyze your text data:", "In this article we\u2019ve used Topic Mining on Amazon Reviews. As you can see this technique can be used very quickly and generates understandable results.
