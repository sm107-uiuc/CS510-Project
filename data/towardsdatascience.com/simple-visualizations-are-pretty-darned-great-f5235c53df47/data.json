But on a very recent team off-site event, it struck me that I\u2019ve grown super comfortable with it, which is a very peculiar feeling since I really should be improving such a flaw.", "The event that triggered this realization was a UX summit hosted by our group\u2019s director 2 org chart levels above me. There were maybe a hundred-ish people present, comprised of all the UXers in our product area, so there were designers, researchers, writers, and engineers in the mix, in (roughly) that order of population. I think there were 2 quant UX researchers in the room, myself included.", "Part of the activities of the event involved a series of 10 3-minute lightning talks, and I was one of them. People talked about things they learned or did, doing research at conferences, interesting new features they worked on, frameworks for organizing research, etc. I, being totally on brand, was talking about the process my team had established to set and monitor success metrics for feature work.", "As I watched all the presentations that day, I realized that everyone was using pretty graphics, visualizations, photos, even video clips, to tell whatever story they were telling. The folks with design backgrounds were especially remarkable in that regard, using some of most amazing design graphics and adorable gif accents.", "Meanwhile, I had black text on white background, in default Google Slide font. The only nod to design I had was a title card copied from a template from the UX team. In retrospect, there were definitely many places where a graphics of timelines, example metrics plots, etc., would have been easier to understand. But it just didn\u2019t occur to me during the weeks of lead-up to cut a much longer talk down to just 3 minutes. All I had words, and whatever came out of my mouth in that blur of 360 seconds.", "While this story is primarily speaks to my lack of prioritization of design and aesthetics when it comes to presentations, I assure you, this character flaw applies to any charts that I make. Spartan is a good way to describe things and it\u2019s something I need to work on.", "The most important part of our role as data people is communicating our findings and results out to someone else. Whether it\u2019s to empower a decision-maker, help a team reach consensus, or giving information to a customer, it all requires communication. If we fail in that final step, it doesn\u2019t matter if our results were perfect oracles. Visualizations are often very important to that communication process. A well made image, even a very simple one, can get a point across much better than just words.", "The now-famous \u201cFlatten the curve\u201d graphic is perhaps the most salient and memorable example of a \u201csimple but powerful viz\u201d in the past couple of months. A nice look at the history of the graphic is here, btw.", "Similarly, some statements can only realistically be made comprehensible with visualizations, such as election maps, network maps. There\u2019s too many data points to easily summarize with words.", "So, suffice it to say, it\u2019s never bad to have visualization skills in this role. I can\u2019t think of any situations where being a master at data visualization would be a detriment.", "The surprise is how far you can get with very very little of such skills, here\u2019s the few tools I use to get by in life.", "Probably 99% of my charts that are made for work are made with a spreadsheet. I might wrangle a bazillion rows of data with complex SQL and code at the start, but the final presentation step is usually small enough to fit into a simple spreadsheet, with maybe with a pivot table so that I can play, format, and augment the final charting result.", "The remaining 1% of the time is when I have to lean on some more powerful external tool in Python or similar. It\u2019s so rare I have to look up documentation for plotting even a line chart every time I do it. I have no idea how to use D3 nor many other powerful tools out there. But I manage to limp on despite my limitations!", "If I had to guess, over 70% of my charts are simple line graphs that you can spew out of Excel in a maximum of 6 key strokes on Windows (ctrl-a, alt, n n, 1, enter). They inserted a \u201c1\u201d into the command chain at some point when they added too many features on the ribbon, how annoying.", "Most of my presentation charts look like the above \ud83d\ude1c. The dotted vertical \u201cLaunch\u201d line is my one fancy viz trick. I have to do pre/post analysis too much.", "Another 20% of the charts I produce are just variations of bar charts, horizontal or vertical. The remaining bits are variations of area charts (which are just colored stack lines anyway), stacked bar charts, and occasionally I will use candlestick charts to approximate error bars. I almost never project things into the future so I never really make line-graphs-with-error-bounds charts, which are hard to make without specialized packages.", "Most times, with proper labels, a chart resembling one of the above is enough to get whatever point I need to get across. Things are trending upwards, present metrics are similar to historic levels, we didn\u2019t break the system with the launch, etc. Caveats such as \u201csmall sample size, so error may be large\u201d, are communicated with voice-over, footnote, or by adding it to the title.", "This works really well for semi-formal team work, where we need to look at a data point or trend quickly, make a decision, and then never look at that same chart again (we\u2019d maybe look at an updated chart in the future). It\u2019s already enough work to mangle data into a suitably chart-ready format (binned, normalized, artifacts trimmed out, etc), that the marginal gains of refining the presentation aren\u2019t worth it.", "For more formal presentations with higher ranking stakeholders, I\u2019ll put in extra effort into the surface styling for presentation reasons. Upgrades usually include sure all titles, axes and legends are extra clear, line thicknesses/dashes added to add/remove emphasis, anomalous data points have explanations attached in footnotes, etc.", "At the end of the day, an aesthetically pleasing graph is more memorable than a really ugly one with the same content. You also don\u2019t want little flaws to distract away from your main message.", "When I get need to get really fancy for presentation purposes (admittedly rare), I usually break out the Annotated Line Chart, like below. It\u2019s a way to put more context around a frustrating time series. Again, all done with just transparent colored blocks and text boxes in Excel or Sheets. This is me try-harding, and pretty much the upper limit of my artistic abilities.", "I\u2019m recreating the example chart from memory in Photoshop because it\u2019s annoying to artificially create squiggly long lines in a spreadsheet with arbitrary inflections where I want. The point of this graph is to simply provide context for sales volume over across time. Since there were a ton of things going on all the time, sometimes overlapping, it was impossible to figure out what time periods were similar enough to compare.", "All the annotations and boxes are done by manually, it\u2019s a huge investment in time, so it\u2019s reserved for times when the payoff in understanding is needed. The my color sense is particularly poor, so things become very ugly when I need to include 6+ colors in a single chart and they all can\u2019t look the same but also can\u2019t clash with each other. Ick.", "Despite the costs, hand-writing annotations onto a chart is INFINITELY less painful than wrangling the independent data systems I need to combine to get this to work. Some of those data points only exist in people\u2019s heads or random spreadsheets.", "Simple visualizations are good at getting one or two points across clearly, because there\u2019s a limit to how much information they can encode. You can cram a little bit more in with clever hacks like annotations and colors, but there\u2019s still a limit.", "Beyond the simple stuff, there\u2019s a handful of more complicated things that I pull out as needs arise, but I find that they serve a different purpose. Maps, Sankey diagrams, network flow diagrams, animations, the complexity of those visualizations mean that they take time for people to digest them, or they\u2019re designed for exploration. They enable analysis and understanding in certain situations, but they\u2019re not useful in my personal day-to-day.", "Thanks to not being familiar with the details of making these visualizations, I mostly rely on pre-built versions to make them. Excel\u2019s mapping functionality is surprisingly robust (I\u2019ve done enough ZIP->FIPS mapping in my life to ever want to do it again), there\u2019s some libraries to make Sankey diagrams as needed. Funnel drop-off diagrams I just slowly make by hand or hack a bar chart to do it.", "Sometimes I\u2019ll just color a grid of numbers, like for a cohort analysis\u2026 and just read it as a zoomed-out graphic. It\u2019s close enough to a visualization for my brain to analyze without having to actually do the work of making something. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to see patterns just by looking at the shapes of numbers.", "When I think of really cool vis that I\u2019ll never be able to do, I think of the work that often comes out of places like the NY Times data team, and Guardian, or the stuff that gets featured on Flowingdata.", "Many of those are complex designs that show many hours of work put into every last pixel displayed. Even simple line and bar charts are usually crafted with design elements that are well thought out, the colors carefully chosen, axes and labels carefully colored to be unobtrusive yet visible, etc.", "It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have time to make such beautiful graphics, I literally wouldn\u2019t be able to create one on my own given a thousand free hours to try. Best I could do would be to slavishly imitate, and probably fail at it.", "But at the least, I can sit here in my chair and appreciate the little details that I know someone had spent some time on, because default settings (if a default even exists) never look perfectly effortless.", "Considering how simplistic my Lv 2. stuff is, you might wonder just how far can you get away with it.", "As an example, here\u2019s what I refer to as the best (i.e. most impactful) chart of my 12+ year career thus far. It\u2019s a \u201cfancy\u201d double graph-bars AND lines! Recreated again in Photoshop, but the original was done in Excel many years ago, so imagine it in all it\u2019s blocky, jagged, default red/blue glory. Details are changed to obscure the origin since my memory is flawed, and it\u2019s not nice to randomly wave around anyone\u2019s customer retention data in public.", "The story behind this chart is this: I was asked to do a \u201cwhat drives retention\u201d analysis by my boss because some investors asked about it. After spending weeks doing lots of data cleaning and then a big regression analysis, one factor that no one was really paying attention to came out. The results of analyzing that factor became this chart, which essentially says \u201cHaving Net Positive [specific kind of] Activity when it\u2019s time to renew the subscription implies really high retention!\u201d.", "The reason why I call it \u201cmy best chart\u201d is because this one simple chart got people talking. Product people quickly realized they could make changes which could move \u201cNet Activity\u201d 1 or 2 units for many customers. The company hadn\u2019t really thought about moving the Net Activity stat much, they had considered it just an organic property of the system. People got excited, they started experimenting, within months they hit upon really great feature designs targeting that metric that resonated with users.", "Suddenly metrics company-wide were growing 40% YoY when things had been stuck at 15% for a while. We had struck the product development equivalent of an oil well, and the chart had been our initial map. It was nuts. We also didn\u2019t know how long it would before the extremely high growth would last. People kept asking me about it and I had no way to model unprecedented growth. It ultimately lasted close to 18 months before things calmed down. Wild.", "I totally realize that I got totally lucky here. Finding a chart with this level of impact happens maybe once or twice in an entire career. A lot of pieces I have no control over aligned for this to happen, including uncovering a sorely neglected aspect of a popular product, management and engineering and product all excited to test the idea, and people hitting upon useful designs and features that moved the needle.", "But it managed to come together just that one time, and it all came from just a CSV dump from a big SQL query at the end of a giant pipeline, and finally thrown into Excel. It didn\u2019t even have annotations aside from axis labels. The noisy far extremes of the graph (where retention goes nuts due to small sample size) was left in all their noisy glory. I\u2019m pretty sure I left the chart with the default Excel colors of blue and red.", "I\u2019m pretty sure that at the time, I knew the chart was saying something important, but had figured it would be another throwaway chart. I was showing it to people to get a sense for refinements I needed to make for a polished version\u2026 But it pretty much went viral from there, so I never had the chance to clean it up. Oh well.", "Originally published on Counting Stuff, Randy\u2019s free weekly newsletter covering the more mundane, important parts of data and tech.", "I stress about data quality a lot.
