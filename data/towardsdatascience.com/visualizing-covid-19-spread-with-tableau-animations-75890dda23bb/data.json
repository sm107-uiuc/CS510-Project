Ever since watching this video, I\u2019ve been interested in time-based animations like the \u201cracing bar chart\u201d shown in the video, as well as animated maps.", "Since COVID outbreaks are highly linked to geography, I\u2019m going to create some animated maps and racing bar charts to see what we can learn. Along the way, you\u2019ll learn how to blend datasets with Python and create time-based animations with Tableau Public. If you just want to skip to the completed project, check it out here.", "\ud83d\udea8OBLIGATORY PUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORY \ud83d\udea8 Stay away from crowded beaches, and go make a friend with a backyard pool instead \ud83d\ude09 (as long as they\u2019ve tested negative of course\u2026and they don\u2019t invite other friends\u2026you know what, just take a relaxing bath instead)", "I will be using two datasets here:", "I\u2019d like to visualize not only what counties have the most cases, but also which counties have the highest infection rates by percentage. Although places like Florida, California, and New York have high numbers of cases (sheerly due to having higher populations), do they necessarily have the highest infection rates by percentage?", "The NYT dataset doesn\u2019t include information about county population, so I\u2019m going to merge the two datasets into one using Python and pd.merge(). If you\u2019re not into Python, you could also accomplish this by using a SQL JOIN or a VLOOKUP in Excel. Before we do that, we first need to clean the data to get it in the most desirable format for merging.", "I won\u2019t bore you with all the details of cleaning the data - if you want to see the entirety of my data cleaning, check the Github repo here. However, I did encounter a few unexpected roadbumps.", "Louisiana has parishes instead of counties, and Alaska has no consistency whatsoever with county names like \u201cSkagway Municipality,\u201d \u201cNome Census Area,\u201d and \u201cDenali Borough\u201d. This made isolating the names of these areas so Tableau could correctly identify them to build the map a ~fun~ (read: two painful hours) task.", "Note that I\u2019ve performed an inner merge, meaning that the two datasets will only be joined on rows where the values for county and state match, and all the unmatched rows will be thrown out. Now our data looks something like this, with only the rows we need:", "Tableau is one of the most powerful data visualization platforms out there, and their free version Tableau Public has all the features we need to complete this analysis. Tableau\u2019s team and Paul Isaacs have done a much better job than me explaining how to actually build animations and racing bar charts, so I\u2019ll defer to them for the how-to and focus more on what insights we can extract from the data.", "Let\u2019s begin by visualizing COVID-19 cases by county with an animated map, as I\u2019ve done below.", "When I first created the map, the contrast between the colors was too small, with geographically small counties like New York County (basically just Manhattan) and a handful of others in dark red. To make the map more interesting to read and show a greater color gradient, I set the max value (the dark red you across in California and New England) so that 20% of counties would be shaded in dark red. (The 80th percentile of the number of cases happens to be 513 cases.)", "A few observations about this map stick out to me right off the bat:", "Let\u2019s look more closely at the top 10 counties by number of cases.", "According to Worldometer\u2019s analysis of COVID cases and deaths in New York City, the average infection fatality rate is 1.4%. It\u2019s all too easy to see a number like 1.4% and assume it holds true everywhere, which would make comparing the number of cases and deaths by county completely uninteresting. In other words, it\u2019s easy to assume:", "In the chart above, we begin to see that that\u2019s not the case. For example, Los Angeles County is ranked #2 in number of cases but #3 in number of deaths. On the other hand, Middlesex County is ranked #6 in number of cases but #4 in number of deaths.", "Perhaps Los Angeles County has more available hospital beds and greater access to quality medical care than Middlesex County, so fewer people who contract COVID reach critical stages. Another possible explanation is that Los Angeles County has a much higher percentage of young people, who are less at risk of dying from COVID, and therefore more willing to venture out, which puts them at greater risk of contracting COVID. An older population might be more resistant to go out in public, but when they contract COVID, they\u2019re more likely to die.", "The same trend is evident when looking at the state level below. California is ranked #2 in cases but #7 in deaths, while Massachusetts, on the other hand, is ranked #7 in cases but #3 in deaths.", "Although case numbers continued to climb at alarming rates in places like New York and Los Angeles, a statistic I hadn\u2019t heard in the news was what percentage of these counties\u2019 populations were actually infected. I used the data from the census bureau to create the map and bar chart below.", "The clustering of dark red counties seems to shift dramatically away from major metropolitan areas and into rural areas with lower population density. Suddenly, Los Angeles County looks fairly under control, while Arizona, Mississippi, and a smattering of counties in the Midwest look devastated.", "Imagine the devastation that these counties with 5+% infection rates are going through, then combine that with the fact that these places likely have less access to high-quality medical care than, say, LA or New York, and we\u2019ve got a pretty grim scenario on our hands.", "Disclaimer: I don\u2019t share any of these insights to make light of what\u2019s going on in cities like LA and New York with high numbers of cases. I simply wanted to point out some facts that reveal another story that has not been featured in the limelight: the story of rural areas with less access to quality healthcare who may be suffering more than most of us city-dwellers can imagine.", "In the classic racing bar chart (shown above), the #1 ranked bar takes up the full width of the screen, with every other bar taking up a width proportional to the #1 ranked bar. Currently, however, the x-axes are fixed for all of the racing bar charts, making the resolution too low to see what\u2019s really happening before April.", "There\u2019s a tutorial for how to fix this here which works for non-aggregated raw data, but since our raw data is pre-aggregated, their fix with WINDOW_MAX doesn\u2019t work. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to make it work!)", "I downloaded this dataset from NYT\u2019s Github page on July 1, 2020, and quite a lot of cases and new trends have emerged since then that have not been captured with these animations. At the moment, I\u2019m using Tableau Public (Tableau\u2019s free offering), which doesn\u2019t allow for live connections with datasets. If I upgraded to the full version of Tableau Desktop, I could set up a live connection with NYT\u2019s Github page so that the data updates automatically every day, and the visualizations update to match.", "This dataset has ~280k rows, so every time you zoom in or out on the map, the whole map needs to be redrawn, making the interface very laggy at times. I don\u2019t know if this is fixable with Tableau, but I\u2019d love to learn if anyone else knows how.", "Hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this analysis, even it was a tad depressing\u2026to view the full visualization, check out my Tableau Public profile here, and I look forward to seeing what you observe as well!", "Your home for data science.
