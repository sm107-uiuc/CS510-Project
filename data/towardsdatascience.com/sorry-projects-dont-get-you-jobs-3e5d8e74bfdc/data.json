The Conclusion: The role Data Science projects plays in the job hunt.", "There is huge misconception about how aspiring Data Scientists actually get that lucrative Data Science position, and it has to do with projects.", "By projects I mean trying out some latest Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithm on Jupyter Notebook and uploading the work on Github as if that will eventually win the hearts of hiring managers.", "But guess what? They aren\u2019t going to read much code from your personal projects. And if you think this way, you have what I call the Project Mindset.", "The Project Mindset: (noun) the mindset that doing more and more ML projects and putting them on your resume will eventually get you that high-paying Data Science job, which in reality, will impress not many people.", "How do I know this? Because I was that sucker myself. I spent precious time before applications executing many different projects to expand my \u201cportfolio\u201d. And I got very far with projects \u2014 having completed some that gained recognition from prominent figures in the data field.", "But now, working as a Data Scientist in San Francisco, I see how wrong I was, and worse, how so many people are following the steps I took. This is a story warning you about projects, and the realities about where projects will take you (spoilers, not very far).", "PS: Keep in mind that I only applied to Data Scientist positions in San Francisco of California. So what I have to say might not apply to your region or the position you are applying for. And this is a one-man\u2019s perspective (actually two, as you\u2019ll see below). But there\u2019s also a generalizable aspect to this story, because I see people around the world are awed by the (false) allure and potential of \u201cprojects\u201d.", "Before I applied for Data Science positions, I spent 4\u20135 weeks working on my project, since that\u2019s what I thought was the right course of action. Being a professional pianist, I wanted to do something on music. That led me to Neural Networks, specifically LSTMs being using to generate new music.", "I spent two full weeks reading academic papers on the subject, which looking back, I understood maybe 30% of. But within that 30%, something really bugged me. I felt that some researchers on AI-generated tunes didn\u2019t possess deep domain knowledge over the foundations of music. This was seen in the way they created new sounds through super complex Neural Network architectures that seem to didn\u2019t reflect how real musicians compose music.", "This bugged me so much that I decided to create an algorithm from scratch, based on the Hidden Markov Model. After about 800 lines of pure python code, I developed my own music making algorithm. I called it Pop Music Maker.", "Pop Music Maker would essentially take in musical data as input, decompose the notes, find statistical relationships among those notes, and recreate a completely new pop song based on those statistics.", "I wrote about my machine on TowardsDataScience.com, and within few days, the article blew up. Thousands of people started reading it each day, especially after when someone posted my article on HackerNews. By the time I realized what was happening, the article was trending on Twitter and LinkedIn. It came to the point where Travis Oliphant (creator of Numpy and founder of Anaconda), and Ben Lorica from O\u2019Reilly Media shared my content on their own social media.", "With gained popularity, hundreds of people used my algorithm on a daily basis through a flask website that I created. This led to constant crashing of my website since the AWS EC2 instance where my code was deployed was too small to handle the large traffic volume. Some on the internet started calling me a liar since the website wasn\u2019t available when they wanted to give my algorithm a try.", "Soon, these criticisms quickly devolved into a full-on heated controversy on many social media websites. Some researchers with Ph.Ds raged on about how completely mistaken I was in my Bayesian-based approach. Others came to my rescue, defending my work (including Ben Lorica). Simply put, I reignited the holy war of Bayesian vs. Frequentist Statistics on parts of the internet.", "At first I decided to apologize to those who felt insulted for some reason, and I asked nicely how I could improve my methodology. But after days of apologizing, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I became mentally exhausted from the debates and just wanted to shut myself away from the internet. I turned off all my electronics.", "I tell this story because you would assume that despite the controversy, having this project on my resume would help me get that Data Science job. Conclusion: it didn\u2019t. Other than one person from a small startup reaching out, no one actually cared. In the grand scheme of things, the fiery heat that I faced was just a tiny spark that fizzled away by strong winds of Bay Area tech.", "More importantly, people in the hiring committee didn\u2019t really test me on projects. Because the hiring process is not based on how many projects you have done. This is a common assumption I see in many Data Science applicants.", "Don\u2019t just take it from me; during my TDS-Exclusive Interview with Jeffrey Li from DoorDash, Jeff said this about pitfalls seen in aspiring Data Scientists:", "\u201cThe biggest pitfall I\u2019ve seen in most Data Scientists on the market is being able to connect the machine learning model to the business impact. So a lot of very very smart people build this very complicated five layer neural network that makes great prediction that scores very highly. But then when we dig into the business impact of the specific model, they usually have a little bit of trouble answering that.\u201d", "If Data Science hiring is not based on projects, what is it based on? It is based on what people from the hiring side refer to as the \u201cIntelligence Testing\u201d.", "I really don\u2019t like the term \u201cintelligence\u201d because it is a word that implies biological endowment (you either have it well or you don\u2019t). But unfortunately I\u2019ve seen it used frequently \u2014 and secretively \u2014 in the tech hiring world.", "I hear all the time, \u201cThat person was not intelligent/smart enough for the technical role\u201d in some form or another from the back channels. I first heard about these expressions from my close friends who are Software Engineers in the Bay Area of California.", "To me, this term felt very oppressive and ethereal. But after reflecting for a long time on this word \u201cintelligence\u201d used in the tech world, I began to understand what it actually means. And by understanding what it means, I found that there was nothing \u201cbiological\u201d about it \u2014 meaning anyone can improve with enough preparation. More importantly, I discovered the secret sauce for cracking the Data Science interviews.", "Intelligence testing is the basis for all hiring process. It is what undergirds technical challenges, take-homes, and whiteboard-ing questions. There are four main elements to the testing. These are:", "The first third are the most important. The fourth is good to have, and will be asked once the hiring manger gets enough signal from you on the first three components. But all four are designed to extract signal on your potential and capability for the technical role ahead.", "Quick word: The four skills below are very important, but so are understanding of statistics, coding, and SQL. I assume that this is an obvious truism that everyone knows, so I won\u2019t go into the knowledge fundamentals here.", "Analytic mindset refers to the ability to break down one giant problem into digestable parts that can be addressed sequentially. In short, it\u2019s building a mental road map with multiple checkpoints that ultimately lead up to a final solution.", "This part of intelligence is measured in either a practical coding challenge or a theoretical business/product problem. The manager will shower you with a problem statement that from the start might feel open-ended. This is intentional, as the end is not the point of this testing. So it doesn\u2019t matter if your solution actually works or not. The main point is to evaluate your aptitude in coordinating a multi-step plan to tackle a complex problem.", "This ability is tested because in the actual Data Science role, there will be problems that are too complicated to be brute-forced into a solution. Strategic road maps have to be drawn, with advantages and disadvantages outlined for each step related to impact on the business or the technology stack. But to even get there, the Data Scientist needs to possess a flexible and strategic mind to generate various working solutions with identifiable checkpoints.", "For applicants trying to get better at this skill, tackle as many Leetcode problems as you can. Read up on Data Science product questions as well. An example of a product question is:", "A meal delivery company is releasing a new app with a new UI. The goal is increasing deliverers\u2019 earnings by increasing their number of trips. Outline a testing strategy to see if the new app is better than the old one.", "Variable extraction refers to how many relevant variables you can come up with to address the problem at hand. For instance, I gave you this scenario: \u201cThere are 2 elevators in a building and some people are complaining that one of them is slower than the other. What do you need to know to confirm if the complaints are legitimate or not?\u201d", "These kinds of thought experiments are usually asked by product/non-data folks who are not familiar with data science but want to gauge your \u201cintelligence\u201d. And by intelligence here, they are specifically evaluating how well you can come up with variables needed to address the issue that the interviewer him/herself would also think about.", "But how can you and the person you\u2019ve never met before be aligned in cognitive processing? The good news is that 99% of variables for these experiments (I think) fall under these categories:", "The reason why variable extraction is important is because it gets to the heart of experimentation. Conducting experiments requires relevant variables for testing, and if you can augment the accuracy of the test by coming up with even more appropriate variables that your manager hasn\u2019t thought about, that\u2019s an extremely valuable skill.", "You can improve on this particular aspect of intelligence by messing around with as much different data as you can. Mess around with time series data, mess around with geography data. Whatever broadens the knowledge frontiers of data familiarity.", "Edge case detection usually comes after you work with your hiring manager on the first two components. After getting enough signal from the first two, the manager will then throw you a curveball. He/she will come up with some way to completely overthrow the the road map you\u2019ve come up with and the variables extracted for tackling the problem.", "This is a tough part of the interview, as you\u2019ll feel rattled by your the holes of your logic being exposed on the spot. Calm yourself and listen closely to the hints the managers are throwing at you. Usually they\u2019ll have some answer already in mind that you have to pry open, and they will throw bread crumbs that lead you toward the answer in their own head.", "They throw such curveballs that derail your thought process to see how well you perform in situations that you haven\u2019t encountered. In practice, there will be hundreds of edge cases that you haven\u2019t thought about in your Data Science workflow, especially if your work is live in production.", "How to practice: You really can\u2019t practice for this. When it happens, take a deep breath, ask questions to clarify if you need to, and follow the bread crumbs.", "The last element is optional, and usually comes at the end of the technical interview if there is time left. This skill builds on top of the first measurement of intelligence testing (analytic thinking). Once you come up with a particular method in mind, the manager will ask if there is a better way to solve the problem than the one you came up with.", "They do this as all data science work in industry is a rough at first, and needs several iterations for improvement. But this is only after first rough draft of the work is completed. That\u2019s why this aspect ranks lower than the first three, I argue.", "I believe that projects do serve functions in the beginning of the application phase. To me, they address the following:", "But after the initial screenings, projects carry little weight. There are three reasons for this:", "Stressing on my last point, what you need are external validations to the work that you\u2019ve completed. In other words, getting an AUC of 83% in your machine learning project shows very little signal to the managers on your potential as a future Data Scientist. But saying that hundreds of people tried your machine may provide more meaningful context to the numbers that you are presenting.", "Still not feeling convinced by what I have to say? Then as a final point, hear from the Director of Data Science Institute at Columbia University, whom I also interviewed for TDS Interviews:", "Director Jeannette Wing: \u201cThere are certain techniques and ways of problem solving that computer scientists do on a daily basis. Some are:", "1. How do I design an algorithm to solve this particular problem", "2. How do I decompose this particular problem into smaller pieces", "3. How do I define layers of abstraction", "4. How do I define interfaces between components", "This collection of problem solving techniques and collection of ways one approaches a big system or a big problem \u2014 this is what I mean by thinking like a computer scientist.\u201d", "Then there is the Lead Data Scientist at IBM where I asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the most important trait of a Data Scientist?\u201d.", "His reply: One thing that everyone at IBM has in common is that they\u2019re consultants. They need to be able to work with the client. They need to be in meetings with executives and be able to talk intelligently about solutions.", "If you liked this article, please follow my Medium profile.
