So overwhelming to the point where the newly interested people will give up. Want further evidence? This Reddit thread, titled \u201cDoes anybody else feel overwhelmed looking at how much there is to learn?\u201d presents some example of this.", "However, what if instead of throwing these toddles into the wild and letting them survive on their own, we, the community, instructors, mentors, friends, and leaders, could soften the fall and change the way we are introducing these novices into the field of data.", "If I were to start today my decision to learn the basics of data science and ask Google how to become a data scientist, I\u2019d probably close my browser, and cry under my desk. For starters, the term \u201cdata science\u201d is broad, and it encompasses things I have no idea they exist. Let\u2019s take a look at this.", "See this? It\u2019s a lot! How is this supposed to motivate someone? Moreover, what I see here \u2014 and this is my opinion\u2013 is some sort of roadmap and a checklist with arbitrary completion percentages that are supposed to state how much of a data scientist you are.", "Sidenote: this image is from 2013, and some of the technologies presented here are outdated. Also, I\u2019m not saying the picture is wrong; it provides very valuable information on how to get started. What I wanted to illustrate is it might cause some frustration to someone who wants to get its hand dirty with data.", "In reality, and this is what I have learned during my career, if someone\u2019s title is \u201cdata scientist,\u201d I\u2019m sure that their day to day tasks or daily business is about one particular topic, for example, risk assessment, churn analysis, data visualization, being an SQL God, and so on.", "Which brings me to my first point.", "What if instead of suggesting all this vast amount of information, websites and \u201chow to become a data scientist\u201d guide to the newcomer, we try to pinpoint or at least approximate, what exactly prompted and motivated them to join our wonderful world of data.

But, did you notice how I use the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d? By that, I meant us, the community, and mentors I mentioned a couple of paragraphs above. Therefore, my message here is that if you, someone who is currently in the industry, is ever in the position of helping, mentor, tutor, someone, please consider doing it. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll appreciate it.", "The second point I want to bring to the table is that regardless of the chosen field of work, we should always make it clear that the ultimate goal of a data person is to find answers to questions. I believe, and again, this is my opinion, that amid the chaos of the hype, libraries, fancy methods and such, we have lost track of the essence of the field. This lack of focus is somehow understandable, and it even happens to me sometimes. We keep seeing all these new toys being release, and we want to implement them right away and to get the best accuracy scores. Nonetheless, let it be clear that at the end of the day, your boss and enterprise wants to know, how much money the company will gain or lose today, which tone of green is better, or whether the user is a spammer or not.", "So please, next time someone asks you what\u2019s the key to being a data scientist is, try to include the words \u201cquestion\u201d and \u201canswers\u201d in your response.", "And to the beginners, take it one step at a time, and keep in mind that no one knows everything.", "Your home for data science.
