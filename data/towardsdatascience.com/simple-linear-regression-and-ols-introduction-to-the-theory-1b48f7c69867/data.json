By applying regression analysis, we are able to examine the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this article, I am going to introduce the most common form of regression analysis, which is the linear regression. As the name suggests, this type of regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between the variables of interest.", "Linear regression is used to study the linear relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (X). The linearity of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is an assumption of the model. The relationship is modeled through a random disturbance term (or, error variable) \u03b5. The disturbance is primarily important because we are not able to capture every possible influential factor on the dependent variable of the model. To capture all the other factors, not included as independent variable, that affect the dependent variable, the disturbance term is added to the linear regression model.", "In this way, the linear regression model takes the following form:", "are the regression coefficients of the model (which we want to estimate!), and K is the number of independent variables included. The equation is called the regression equation.", "Let\u2019s take a step back for now. Instead of including multiple independent variables, we start considering the simple linear regression, which includes only one independent variable. Here, we start modeling the dependent variable yi with one independent variable xi:", "where the subscript i refers to a particular observation (there are n data points in total). Here, \u03b20 and \u03b21 are the coefficients (or parameters) that need to be estimated from the data. \u03b20 is the intercept (a constant term) and \u03b21 is the gradient.", "In simple linear regression, we essentially predict the value of the dependent variable yi using the score of the independent variable xi, for observation i.", "To be able to get reliable estimators for the coefficients and to be able to interpret the results from a random sample of data, we need to make model assumptions. There are five assumptions associated with the linear regression model (these are called the Gauss-Markov assumptions):", "The Gauss-Markov assumptions guarantee the validity of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for estimating the regression coefficients.", "As mentioned earlier, we want to obtain reliable estimators of the coefficients so that we are able to investigate the relationships among the variables of interest. The model assumptions listed enable us to do so. Based on the model assumptions, we are able to derive estimates on the intercept and slope that minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR). Minimizing the SSR is a desired result, since we want the error between the regression function and sample data to be as small as possible. The coefficient estimates that minimize the SSR are called the Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) estimates.", "In this article, we will not bother with how the OLS estimates are derived (although understanding the derivation of the OLS estimates really enhances your understanding of the implications of the model assumptions which we made earlier).", "The OLS coefficient estimates for the simple linear regression are as follows:", "where the \u201chats\u201d above the coefficients indicate that it concerns the coefficient estimates, and the \u201cbars\u201d above the x and y variables mean that they are the sample averages, which are computed as", "Now, we have defined the simple linear regression model, and we know how to compute the OLS estimates of the coefficients. How do we interpret the coefficient estimates? Here, we will consider a small example.", "Assume that we are interested in the effect of working experience on wage, where wage is measured as annual income and experience is measured in years of experience. To study the relationship between the wage (dependent variable) and working experience (independent variable), we use the following linear regression model:", "The coefficient \u03b21 measures the change in annual salary when the years of experience increase by one unit. Because more experience (usually) has a positive effect on wage, we think that \u03b21 > 0.", "In this example, we use 30 data points, where the annual salary ranges from $39,343 to $121,872 and the years of experience range from 1.1 to 10.5 years. As you can imagine, a data set consisting of only 30 data points is usually too small to provide accurate estimates, but this is a nice size for illustration purposes. Let\u2019s make a scatter plot to get more insights into this small data set:", "Looking at this scatter plot, we can imagine that a linear model might actually work well here, as it seems that the relationship in this sample is pretty close to linear.", "Next, let\u2019s use the earlier derived formulas to obtain the OLS estimates of the simple linear regression model for this particular application. By using the formulas, we obtain the following coefficient estimates:", "and thus, the OLS regression line relating wage to experience is", "The \u201cwide hat\u201d on top of wage in the equation indicates that this is an estimated equation.", "Now, how do we interpret this equation? We can use this equation to predict wage for different values of the years of experience. When we suppose that experience=5, the model predicts the wage to be $73,042. For a person having no experience at all (i.e., experience=0), the model predicts a wage of $25,792.", "Next to prediction, we can also use this equation to investigate the relationship of years of experience on the annual wage. A person having one extra year of working experience, is expected to see his annual wage increase with $9,449. This means that (as we expected), years of experience has a positive effect on the annual wage.", "To finish this example, let\u2019s add the regression line in the earlier seen scatter plot to see how it relates to the data points:", "I hope this article helped you with starting to get a feeling on how the (simple) linear regression model works, or cleared some questions up for you if you were already familiar with the concept.", "Your home for data science.
