Some might think that risky but we believe in openness, and our ability to execute, so we\u2019ll take the risk.", "We\u2019re still in our very early stages, so our sample isn\u2019t huge, but it is very granular, and contains by now hundreds of experiments. So this will be the first in a couple of posts. A summary of its three key points:", "Jupiter cares about user privacy. So our data lake contains nothing about the demographics of our users (only a separate, anti-fraud system does). It also contains nothing on users\u2019 financial lives outside the Jupiter app.", "What we do have is extremely rich, anonymized data on user behaviour within Jupiter \u2014 in the few months of being live, roughly 1,000 data points per user already, for almost 1,000 active savers.", "Within those data points are the results of more than 300 experiments in using messages and prompts to induce people to save more. Those experiments have varied over more than two dozen dimensions, including six different kinds of games, social cues, reward size, time to respond, wording, channel and so on. So our sample remains limited on one dimension, but comes from a system designed to capture exceptional granularity in behaviour and speed and variation in running experiments.", "Jupiter is trying to make people save more now. Our methods are integrally linked to taking action. So we have built two machine learning models, to predict:", "Right now the models we\u2019re using are fairly standard regressors and boosted trees/forests (apologies for violating the startup hype code of \u201cpretend you have crazy amazing AI models\u201d \u2014 if you don\u2019t know it by now, 99% of those are a notebook with maybe 5 lines, including \u201cimport sklearn\u201d).", "We train the models on our complete data, after a little cleaning, e.g., to remove internal users, and to exclude the onboard boosts and messages (since for this purpose we are interested in users\u2019 later behaviour). The models achieve accuracy levels of ~0.7, putting them below simple tasks or ones with huge datasets, but above, say, Facebook\u2019s hate speech tagging.", "After training the model we use \u201cSHAP(ley) values\u201d and decision-tree importance scores to understand the relative importance of different features. A \u201cfeature\u201d means some characteristic of a user \u2014 how many times they have opened the Jupiter app, or when they opened their account, or when they last saved, and so on. The importance scores and SHAP values then tell us, \u201chow much did this particular feature affect this prediction?\u201d", "On the prediction model, when trained as a gradient boosted tree:", "Some of this we did not expect. It turns out the ratio of monetary payoff to required save size has no feature importance at all. Neither did the raw size of the payout. We haven\u2019t tested extreme values \u2014 it is quite possible that tiny payouts or extreme save-payout ratios will have an effect. But roughly half of our boosts already wash their own face at a 1% fee on AUM, i.e., the save::reward ratio is above 100 (most often achieved by using game tournaments and other \u201cfirst N\u201d type boosts).", "So within a reasonable and cost effective band of reward, how often users had previously had an emotional payoff, and how much saving was becoming a habit, mattered the most for whether they could be induced to save again.", "That\u2019s for point-in-time modelling. When we turn to the frequency model, i.e., predicting if users will be valuable over time or not, we have similar results. For this, we classify users into five buckets based on saving frequency, and then using their frequency of other, non-saving actions, the model predicts what class each user falls into. We find:", "One question here might be if we are just finding some innate and implicit feature which is, \u201chighly predisposed to saving\u201d. If we had a slimmer set of data and were using it in fewer ways, we would be less confident. But:", "There\u2019s more to explore in the future. We\u2019re still just starting to understand the clustering of user behaviour.", "When we run K-means we find the optimal number of clusters around 8\u201310, but we still need to understand what those clusters are (simple projections to low-dimensional representations aren\u2019t immediately intuitive). We\u2019ll also be interrogating small changes in behaviour over time and any insights from connections among savers (via Jupiter\u2019s \u201csaving buddies\u201d feature).", "In the meantime, I\u2019ll round off by saying we were definitely surprised by how little the \u201crational\u201d payout ratios mattered compared to prior emotional connections. We were almost as surprised by how much more readily people conducted unplanned, spontaneous saves, once they had an emotional connection and some ease with the act, than they were to setting up automated, passive investments.", "The whole theory and practice of improving financial security has, for decades, been focused on getting people to be virtuous \u2014 to set up an automated deduction from their saving, with a little emotional pay off once a year when they saw their balance. That hasn\u2019t moved the needle on savings rates anywhere. Maybe it\u2019s time to think differently?", "Your home for data science.
