Its importance can\u2019t be overstated and you\u2019ll find it in almost every quantitative empirical study\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Cronbach\u2019s Alpha is the dominant measure of scale reliability in psychology and the social sciences. Its importance can\u2019t be overstated and you\u2019ll find it in almost every quantitative empirical study you\u2019ll read. Surprisingly, there hasn\u2019t been a single article published on Medium covering its application in Python. On top, none of the common data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or Sklearn feature Cronbach alpha measures. This article will show you exactly how to do it.", "First, I\u2019ll explain some of the theory and math behind Cronbach's alpha. Then, we\u2019ll quickly get to hands-on coding.", "Whenever we use multiple items to measure a latent (non-observable) construct, we call this set of items a scale. For example, in a business context, we might want to find out our customers\u2019 attitude towards a product P. This would be really helpful to know for marketers. However, contrary to constructs like weight (f.e. 50kg), revenue (f.e. 1 mio. $) or attendance (True/False), we can\u2019t measure attitude directly.", "Simply asking them \u201cWhat is your attitude towards product P?\u201d seems like a good solution at first. However, since it\u2019s up to your customers to define what attitude actually is, you won\u2019t get reliable results this way. Instead, you should define the construct yourself and attempt to measure it using multiple, objective and observable measures. If a customer rates a product as \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d, \u201cexciting\u201d, and \u201cuseful\u201d, that might be a measure of attitude, even tho the word itself wasn\u2019t even used. Arguably, you can use these 4 question as a scale that measures attitude.", "To make sure we did a good job at constructing the scale, we need to use some quality measures. In general, we want to test a scale for validity and reliability. A scale is valid if it actually measures the construct it\u2019s supposed to measure. It\u2019s reliable if it measures the same thing every time.", "Cronbach\u2019s Alpha is a measure of reliability. To be exact, it tells us how internally consistent our scale is. This is the degree to which all items in a scale measure the same construct. If \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d, \u201cexciting\u201d, and \u201cuseful\u201d all contribute to measuring the same thing, Cronbach\u2019s Alpha will be high. If, however, we tried to measure attitude using the adjectives \u201ctasty\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, \u201cdepressing\u201d, and \u201ccold\u201d, I assume Cronbach\u2019s Alpha would be low. The items don\u2019t really seem to line up. And this is exactly what Cronbach\u2019s Alpha helps us with. It answers the question: Do the items I picked to measure a construct line up?", "Cronbach\u2019s Alpha ranges between 0 and 1. A higher value indicates a higher internal consistency. In general, a Cronbach\u2019s Alpha of 0.7 or more is considered acceptable. Now, let\u2019s get into how these numbers come about. Feel free to skip this part if you want to get into coding directly.", "This is the fomula we need:", "Here, N is the number of items (questions) and r is the mean correlation between the items. Let\u2019s get back to the example to understand what this means. Assume we asked 6 customers for their opinion of product P. Then we calculated the correlation between the measures of \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d, \u201cexciting\u201d, and \u201cuseful\u201d. Assume there are the results:", "We can see that all correlations are high. This should lead to a high Cronbach\u2019s Alpha. The image below illustrates how to apply the formula to the data.", "We got a Cronbach\u2019s Alpha of .965, which is exceptional!", "We\u2019re done with the math (kind of)! Let\u2019s get into coding!", "Let\u2019s write our own function for calculating Cronbach\u2019s Alpha. First, let\u2019s import pandas and numpy.", "Now, what do we need to \u201cteach\u201d the function?", "This is how you can do it:", "If we use the function with the sample data, we get this output:", "The result is 0.966. With the manual calculation, we got 0.965. This is very likely due to rounding.", "Look, I need to tell you something. There is another approach to calculating Cronbach\u2019s Alpha that is much better suited for numpy calculations. However, there is a reason I haven\u2019t told you yet. The approach you just learned is much more intuitive and easier to understand. On top, unless you are using very large datasets, which are uncommon in survey statistics where Cronbach\u2019s Alpha is mainly applied, you won\u2019t have any trouble with the function above. I won\u2019t cover this other approach in this article. However, I encourage you to build on your new knowledge and do some further research yourself.", "Anyways, I hope this article was helpful to you and taught you a new statistical concept and/or improved your workflow!", "Thank you very much for reading!", "Your home for data science.
