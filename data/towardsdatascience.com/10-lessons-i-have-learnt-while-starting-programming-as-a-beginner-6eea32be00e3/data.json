I started programming in some sort of fast track. I was in a Data Science Master and we had a few months to learn enough Python to make some sort of decent machine learning system for our graduation project, on top of passing the compulsory Python course. As I mentioned in a previous article about my Business background, learning programming when you have no background in Computer Science is not impossible but it is not easy either.", "When I was considering a professional career in Data Science, I spoke to three different people with quite some experience in programming. All three advised me against trying to do a Data Science Master due to my lack of programming skills. They were not entirely wrong. Learning how to code requires discipline, motivation, resilience and hard work.", "However, some programmers are extremely good at their job and have been through the hell of coding and back. They know the subject in details, which makes them stick their nose up a little, sometimes, especially towards complete beginners. They can also be a little patronizing, on purpose or not, and they might doubt your abilities. Do not get frustrated or upset each time they mention something as if you should know it, and you obviously don\u2019t. And do not take it personally. It is not about you (the same way it was not about me with the three programmers I mentioned above), it is about code. Own your vulnerability, kindly and proudly ask for help and thank them sincerely each time they answer your questions.", "You can\u2019t change people but you can effect a change in them by your behavior.", "Everything needed to be assigned, everything needed to be told\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0computer, nothing could be assumed. It was like learning a new language where indentations, commas, colons and dots could make or break your day.", "However, I realized that the most important aspect of trying to think like a programmer is learning how to solve problems using programming. It\u2019s a skill that you keep developing, not as you program, but as you solve problems with programming. I strongly believe that problem solving is also where the creativity of the programmer gets into play.", "\u201cThe biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.\u201d \u2014\u00a0V. Anton Spraul", "Knowing the rules and applying the rules is fundamentally different. When I started programming, the basic exercises seemed stupid and it sometimes felt like if I understood the concepts, I did not really need to practice as much as my teacher was asking. I was entirely wrong. 70% of my class failed our first Python exam because they did not put the time in the exercises. I passed it, not thanks to talent but thanks to the number of hours I had put doing the recommended exercises, despite my assumptions.", "The best programmers are not the ones with the most \u201ctalent\u201d but the ones that solved the most problems with programming. I personally believe that talent is slightly overrated, and even more since I read the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.", "\u201cPractice isn\u2019t the thing you do once you\u2019re good. It\u2019s the thing you do that makes you good.\u201d\u2015 Malcolm Gladwell, Outliers: The Story of Success", "I sometimes hate programming and get so frustrated that I start wondering about the purpose of all this, questioning my own goals and even my own existence. Programming has the property of being extremely logical while sometimes seeming absolutely not logical at all, because we just can\u2019t see what we are missing.", "It\u2019s okay to hate it sometimes, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help, beg on Stack Overflow or go get a cold beer in the fridge and watch a dumb sitcom to cool down for 20 minutes. But if you have to push yourself every single time you are programming and you do not feel any excitement each time you manage producing the output you aimed at, maybe you should reconsider whether programming is really a skill you need and want to learn.", "I know a lot of people who started learning programming with R or Python. R is a logical choice if you need to create statistics and pretty plots in just a few lines. The starting cost is lower and results can be seen in the short term.", "I started with Python and R, as they were both the main languages important in the Data Science world (and kindly chosen by my teachers).", "I found it a lot easier to learn a language when I could directly relate it to what I wanted to do with it in the first place. In my first Python course, even though all the basics were covered regarding syntax, functions, variables, and common concepts, nothing was directly related to data science. We were not even shown how to load a CSV file in pandas. As much as I would recommend that course to anyone, this type of teaching can get very redundant and you might loose patience or motivation when all lessons seem so detached from your goal.", "While learning the basics remains crucial, I would try to learn goal related tasks rather early in the process. For instance, data cleaning and data exploration in Data Science are tasks that can be started rather early in R and in Python with a little help from documentation and Stack Overflow. Seeing output that you can use later helps you keep your motivation and gives you a tangible proof of your progress.", "I am terrible at organization, honestly, but I was very lucky to start programming in a degree where structured notebooks were provided. I found it very comforting to have somewhere to go back to when I forget how to fix something I had fixed a week ago. Many programmers aim at saving code and solutions to different issues to save time but also to be able to review the type of problem solving solutions they have built or used in the past.", "\u201c For every minute spent organizing, an hour is earned.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin", "I used to be very worried about the fact that I forget syntax all the time and that I only remember the syntax of functions and methods I use almost daily. However, syntax is documented everywhere and even super experienced programmers forget syntax. Again as long as you understand syntax, there is no need to know all of it by heart. Obviously you\u2019ll be a faster programmer. But a programmers who knows all syntax but has very little problem solving skills is rubbish compared to a programmer who has very strong problem solving skills but keeps checking the pandas page to remember how to read a CSV file.", "As a \u201cJunior\u201d programmer, I had the tendency to avoid taking risks by purposely choosing tasks and user stories that did not seem too complex and remained \u201cat my level\u201d, whatever that meant. While I was enjoying myself for a while in my cozy comfort zone, I was not improving and learning as much as I could as a developer. Nowadays, if I am not mindful, I will start doing the same and will try to avoid working on a task when I do not see the answer clearly before even starting. However, complex tasks that seem slightly out of your reach allow you to learn and grow much more than comfortable tasks.", "There is a moment to stop watching videos and to stop reading programming books passively and that moment is rather sooner than later. Passive tasks like watching or reading can be a little addictive since they can require minimum effort. However, I know that after watching videos for a few hours, my brain disconnects and start thinking about the Netflix series I watched the day before and how much I would feel like eating 4 cheeses pizza at that exact moment.", "I am repeating myself, but this is the biggest advice I can ever give. Learning by doing brings much more results than learning passively, especially when it comes to programming.", "Programmers learn programming by programming, and then programming some more.", "For more articles about programming, data science, and leadership, follow me on Medium and Twitter to get notified when a new article is out.", "Your home for data science.
