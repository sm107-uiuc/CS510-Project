I sat for it today, and it turns out I passed. Yes, today. I\u2019m writing this guide right after the exam, fresh, and it\u2019s the most up to date as it can get.", "For the record, Microsoft Azure Fundamentals is one of the most common and entry-level certifications for most of Mircorost\u2019s Azure Certifications. Wait, but what is Azure? I hear you ask. That\u2019s what this article is about. I\u2019ll be going through Azure to everything you would need to pass this exam successfully and acquire skills to showcase yourself in the industry. I\u2019ve outlined answers to common questions I had when I started.", "Give yourself 5 days after reading this, and you'll have your name on the certificate too. If you\u2019re not ready just yet, you might want to save this article for later and return to it.", "Let\u2019s get started with the questions.", "To understand Azure, first, we need to understand Cloud Computing.", "Cloud Computing is nothing but the delivery of computing services over the internet, otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.", "Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.", "There are different cloud service providers, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. While Google has Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon\u2019s got Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft\u2019s cloud offering is called Azure.", "According to Microsoft, Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. Emphasis on the continually expanding part. In the few years I\u2019ve been in the industry, I\u2019ve seen rapid development, and it gets easier for us, the data scientists.", "I don\u2019t want to overwhelm you, but you may have a sneak peek of Azure\u2019s offering as of now. I haven\u2019t used many of them, so don\u2019t worry about the details, we\u2019ll slowly get to them.", "The first reason \u2014 I recently moved into a new job, and the team uses Microsoft stack for everything. And since we work with data at scale, everything we do is in the cloud, i.e., Azure. Hence to me, it made sense to dive deeper and understand Azure once and for all. Most companies are moving into the cloud, and it would be useful for you to understand these concepts.", "The second reason was just, why not. I prioritize the ability to get the work done over any form certificate. But it took me only 15hrs of preparation, spread across 5 days, and didn\u2019t cost me a penny (I\u2019ll tell you how to, in a while), so why not!", "If you\u2019re not sold with my reasons, Microsoft provides some researched statistics too.", "So if you want to understand cloud better, want to showcase value to your (prospective) employer, and got a few hours to spare, why don\u2019t you get certified too? Especially since you\u2019ve already gotten hold of my guide. ;)", "As you can see, Microsoft offers role-based certifications that let you establish yourself as a professional in a particular role. Since I\u2019m a data scientist, I\u2019ll look into the Data Scientist certification profile; similarly, one could look into the profile that best suits their role.", "But here\u2019s the thing: irrelevant of any certification you pick, Microsoft Azure Fundamentals AZ-900 has been listed as the starting point. This is an optional start for those new to Azure and covers all the basics, which helps all role-based certifications later.", "This makes AZ-900 the most common certification, especially amongst beginners.", "Note: The examination content gets updated constantly, and all external courses, resources you would find will no more be relevant. The most recent update happened in November 2020, a month before writing this in December 2020.", "According to the most updated exam, there are specifically 6 skills being measured for the examination with an approximate weighting (very important).", "These skills measured can be loosely considered the syllabus for the examination, and the examination question more or less followed the weightings as indicated. A thorough understanding of cloud concepts, solutions from Azure, when to use what, their commitment to privacy and compliance to policies, and the costs involved take up more than 90% of the overall content.", "Now that you know all particulars regarding the exam let\u2019s get to the most important question of them all.", "Microsoft has used location-based pricing, which means depending on your location, the cost can vary from $55 to $120 (in USD). You may check the costs associated with your location.", "However, I did it free of cost, and you can too.", "Microsoft organizes the Azure Training Day multiple times a year (more on this later), and if you attend one of them, they waive the examination fee. You need to use the same email you used to attend the event, and voila, you get your examination cost to big fat zero!", "Now that you know everything about Azure Fundamentals let\u2019s get into how you can prepare for it?", "I highly recommend you to stick with the same too. The mock tests and external paid courses are absolutely unnecessary. Trust me; it\u2019s easier than you think.", "As you would notice, I used only these 2 resources and booked my examination on Day 3. The plan is simple as it can get; let\u2019s quickly go over the resources.", "This is typically a 2-day webinar held by the Azure Training team to help more professionals get familiar with the Azure cloud platform. You can check for the next scheduled event from this link. They have these multiple times a year.", "In my opinion, these are the best way to get started. Everything you need would be explained clearly by the trainers, and you get to ask questions to them and clarify any doubts you may have.", "Think of it as a crash course into the content to have a good overview of what you will be tested upon. If not for these, I wouldn\u2019t have even attempted the exam. They talk about what\u2019s tested on the examinations and were helpful to kickstart my preparation.", "If the webinar were the crash course, the learning path would be the in-depth text tutorial. Yes, I said text! I personally like text materials because they let me skim through and take notes easily at my own pace.", "I spent the next 2 days going through the learning path, solidifying all the concepts I listened to on the training day.", "There are questions to check your understanding at the end of each learning path, and by logging into your Microsoft account, you may save your progress (like I did above).", "If you went through both the above resources, you will naturally feel comfortable about the exam and don\u2019t have to waste money on any mock tests or additional courses.", "Bonus Tip: Though practical experience is not required for this examination, knowing Azure Portal and the interface was helpful for me. So if you\u2019re not familiar with the Azure Portal, feel free to create a free trial account and play around familiarizing yourself with the icons and the overall offerings of Azure.", "The last day I essentially spent familiarizing myself with the exam environment. The exam duration was roughly about 2 hrs and was broken down into several sessions in this order,", "The time remaining from each session cannot be carried forward, and in the end, you would only be evaluated in the 60mins of the actual examination.", "Since I opted for the online proctored exam, I had to ensure that the system and other requirements are met. Please run the setup and check if it works well on your laptop. The exam cannot be taken from a Ubuntu machine, and it doesn't work with corporate network/firewall settings. So, in the end, I had to borrow my sister\u2019s personal laptop for the exam, so please be aware of such limitations.", "We would need government-approved ID proof (Passport, Driving License, etc.) to match the certification profile name. In addition to that, we need to click photos of ourselves and the exam environment for verification. A real person would be on the other side, proctoring the exam, so you can always reach out if you need something.", "As for the exam contents, I don\u2019t want to spoil you with exact questions, but my whole intention of this guide is to encourage and support you to learn and acquire the skills and do well in the exam. Trust me; if you go through the resources I\u2019ve listed above, you\u2019ll be well and good.", "You would be required to answer somewhere between 40\u201350 objective questions. The time was more than sufficient, so feel free to mark questions to review later on in your second round.", "As you finish the exam, you would be prompted with the result instantly. \u201cCongratulations, you have successfully passed the exam!\u201d was the greeting on screen. I truly wish you receive the same!", "And within an hour, the certificate (signed by Satya Nadella, oh yeah!) was waiting in my certification profile.", "I\u2019m a data scientist, not a cloud developer. I use the cloud to run my machine learning pipelines and deliver insights at scale. This certification gave me a better understanding of the Azure platform, and I know which offerings to use when. As data scientists, we need to be familiar with the cloud and scale our work with the ever-growing data.", "I have my eye on the Azure Data Scientist Certification too, so maybe you would hear about my experience somewhere in the next year. I believe this guide was comprehensive, and I answered most of your questions, but if you\u2019ve got more questions, please leave a comment here. I\u2019ll definitely answer, and it would be best helpful to everyone else too.", "For more helpful insights on breaking into data science, honest experiences, and learnings, consider joining my private list of email friends.", "If you value articles like these and want to support me as a writer, consider signing up to become a Medium member.
