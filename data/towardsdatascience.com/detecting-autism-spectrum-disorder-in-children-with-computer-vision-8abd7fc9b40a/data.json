It can also be used to help experts diagnose autism.", "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins in early childhood and lasts throughout a person\u2019s life. Specialists believe that people with ASD have distinct facial features that can be used to help diagnose their ASD and even correlate with ASD severity. This correlation can be used to train a CV model to detect ASD using those unique facial features.", "The goal is to provide a free preliminary diagnostic tool that can aid parents in their decision to pursue further ASD testing. It\u2019s important for models that have significant real-world impacts to represent their results responsibly and use Bayesian statistics to explain their meaning.", "Approximately 25% of children with autism are undiagnosed. Diagnosing ASD is a complicated and expensive process that not every family can go through. Getting the right kids to the right specialists is crucial to reducing the number of undiagnosed children and the burden on families.", "I want to emphasize that my goal is not to diagnose ASD. Rather, I want to use the power of CV with the rationale of Bayesian statistics to help parents decide if they should take their children to an ASD specialist.", "All of the code is available on GitHub and the data is available on Kaggle.", "Version 5 of the Kaggle data set has 2940 images that are evenly split between two classes: autistic and not autistic. The images are of varying sizes but they are already cropped to show only the child\u2019s face.", "The data set has an age distribution of approximately 2 years to 14 years, but a majority of the pictures are from younger kids ages 2 years to 8 years.", "The gender ratios are close to their respective populations. Males are diagnosed with autism 3 times more than females. Thus, the distribution of male to female pictures in the autistic class is close to 3:1. In the not autistic class, the ratio is much closer to 1:1.", "The ratio of white children to children of color is 10:1. This is close to the real distribution in America at 7:1.", "The model will be based on VGG Face, Oxford\u2019s deep facial recognition model.", "To extract the facial features needed to detect autism, the new model will use the same architecture and weights as VGG Face. This is an example of feature-representation transfer learning. This type of transfer learning is used when the source and the target domains look for similar features but make different inferences based on those features.", "The Oxford model is trained to identify underlying facial features to recognize unique faces. The new model also wants to identify underlying facial features but to detect autism.", "Although accuracy was used to measure model performance during training, sensitivity and specificity are more important to consider for Bayesian predictions.", "The model achieves 85% accuracy on the validation set after 44 epochs. The model starts to overfit around epoch 60.", "Edit August 2020: There is an error in this table. False-negative should have the false-positive value and false-positive should have false-negative value. Everything that follows is still correct information but with incorrect numbers.", "Sensitivity and specificity are used to quantify how often the model predicts false negatives and false positives.", "Sensitivity is the true positive rate. It measures how often a positive prediction is correct.", "Specificity is the true negative rate. It measures how often a negative prediction is correct.", "The model achieves 76% sensitivity and 85% specificity.", "Bayes rule is critical to understanding results produced by any Machine Learning (ML) model.", "It is important to remember that models are fallible. A positive result from a model does not mean a positive result in the real world. Instead, this new information, like a predicted positive, should be used to update our prior knowledge about that event.", "The probability of a random male having autism is very low, around 2.7%. This is the probability of a male having autism prior to knowing any other information. Thus, it is called the prior probability.", "A model prediction provides new information that should be considered in conjunction with the prior knowledge when making a decision.", "Bayes theorem can be used to quantify how much this new information should affect the prior probability. This updated probability is called the posterior.", "Using the model\u2019s sensitivity and specificity, the posterior probability for a positive prediction can be calculated. For males, a positive result increases the probability of having autism from 2.70% to 12.34%. For females, the probability increases from 0.66% to 3.27%.", "Truthfully presenting model shortfalls allows for better open-source contributions and overall better data science.", "As always: better data, better model.", "This model is trained on images of children mostly ages 2 years to 8 years. Thus, testing on children outside of that range will give less accurate results.", "The ratio of white children to children of color is 10:1. This lack of training data for children of color means that results will be less accurate for them.", "Diagnosing autism is a difficult and expensive process. Fortunately, the correlation between facial features and autism means that a CV model can be trained to detect it. Using Bayesian statistics, the results from this model can be reported responsibly and parents can make more informed decisions about their child\u2019s health.", "Your home for data science.
