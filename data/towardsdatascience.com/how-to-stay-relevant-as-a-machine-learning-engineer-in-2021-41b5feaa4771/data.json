Daily developments and progress pushes the frontier of ML and AI just that bit further.", "As a practising machine learning engineer, it can be challenging to keep up with the pace of developments that occurs within the industry. I find that complacency, even for a short period, can set you back months or years behind the frontier of ML.", "This article details some of the steps I\u2019m taking in 2021 to stay relevant to the industry in terms of expertise and general domain knowledge. Most of the steps are an extension of critical strategies that have worked tremendously well for me in 2020.", "Feel free to use or make modifications to some of the strategies presented in this article. And if you have plans and strategies that have worked for you in your efforts in staying relevant within the ML industry, do share in the comment section.", "Success isn\u2019t always about greatness. It\u2019s about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come", "One of the main lessons I learned in 2020 is that nothing beats consistency, not talent and not even luck.", "Writing over 150+ Medium articles in 2020, and publishing at least 3 AI/ML/DS articles a week over the year made me realise that if you stay consistent, it is possible to accumulate invaluable experience that produces results that can\u2019t be replicated through luck.", "In past articles, I\u2019ve alluded to some of the reasons I write on Medium and also the benefits realised as a Machine Learning Practitioner. Through the creation of a regular writing and learning routine, I\u2019ve been able to deliver content on the Medium platform continuously.", "This brings us to the first strategy I\u2019ll be incorporating in 2021 to stay relevant within the ML industry. My plan for staying relevant is to transfer the notion of consistency and regime to my accumulation of ML related knowledge.", "As a Machine Learning professional, you come across novel algorithms, models and techniques every day.", "Most times, to leverage these new algorithms and techniques, you are forced to learn how they operate and function. So, you could argue that ML practitioners are continually learning. However, in 2021, I am making it a habit.", "One notable method which I\u2019m using to educate myself and enrich my knowledge in machine learning is to set a measurable goal.", "The goal is to read and understand at least 30 deep learning research papers in 2021.", "For me, this means reading and understanding the content of a new research paper every two weeks. My approach is to spend at least an hour a day on a research paper. I\u2019m not sure if reading 30 research paper is considered a lot or not, especially for someone more concerned with the engineering of deep learning models as opposed to the study or research.", "What I\u2019m sure of is the papers I aim to read are centred around deep learning solutions to computer vision tasks, such as Object Detection, Pose Estimation, Semantic segmentation and more.", "How will reading research papers help me stay relevant within the ML industry?", "In 2020 most of us found ourselves with more time in our hands, typically as a result of the lockdown measures imposed in major cities around the globe. With my time, I explored some of the earliest major convolutional neural networks released by pioneers within the deep learning field.", "My exploration of these CNN architectures involved reading research papers, understanding the algorithms and techniques presented and in some cases implementing the CNN architectures using TensorFlow.", "Some of the architectures I explored were AlexNet, LeNet, GoogLeNet, PoseNet etc. Transfer learning within machine learning removes the complexity involved in implementing, training and developing conventional CNN architectures.", "To gain a deeper understanding of deep learning network architectures, it\u2019s beneficial to visit original research papers and make an attempt to understand the reasoning behind techniques.", "Going as far as to implement algorithms and network architecture from scratch will provide any ML practitioner with a more profound understanding of the deep learning domain.", "ML practitioners that can read research papers and extract the necessary information to develop an algorithm or neural network architecture are highly sought after across the ML industry.", "And this isn't going to change in 2021.", "The ML industry has tons of practitioners that have successfully transitioned from other non-related domains into machine learning and data science roles.", "In most job postings for entry-level positions, the requirement for an ML related qualification from an institution is removed, so long as you can showcase the relevant expertise and knowledge within tools, programming languages and problem domains.", "Lately, at least in the last couple of years, online ML certifications have been used as a method of filtering through candidate pools for jobs and also leveraged as a method of recognition of expertise within specific tools and applications.", "I\u2019ve been battling with the thought of pursuing a certification in the tools and libraries I use within my day to day role. I already have an MSc degree in machine learning, computer vision and robotics.", "Still, there\u2019s something I find intriguing and exciting of undertaking a challenge and getting recognition for completing the challenge.", "So in 2021, I\u2019ll be obtaining two certifications that are relevant to my profession as a Computer Vision Engineer.", "The first is the TensorFlow Developer Certificate, and the later is the Google Cloud ML Engineer Certificate.", "Currently, TensorFlow is my ML library of choice. I utilise various aspects of the TensorFlow library, mostly for implementing and training deep learning models and embedding ML models into edge devices using the TFlite library.", "I also leverage Google AI platform for my hobby projects. So obtaining certifications within tools and libraries, I utilise daily seems rather logical.", "How does gaining certifications help ML practitioners stay relevant within the industry?", "Certifications that are provided by companies and organisation that offer the conventional tools, libraries and computational resources that we as machine learning practitioner utilise, act as a validation of your skills and expertise from a direct and relevant authority.", "What better way to prove your expertise in TensorFlow than an actual certificate verifying your expertise from TensorFlow. The same goes for Google and Amazon.", "Certifications enable ML practitioners to stay relevant within the industry as it requires ML practitioners to explore the latest versions of tools and libraries.", "Some ML practitioners have graduated from University years ago; their knowledge on implementing intelligent systems using Prolog or some other mechanism might not be relevant and applicable to today\u2019s intelligent systems.", "Undertaking a certification is a sure way to validate that your current knowledge and expertise are in alignment with the present time and expectation of the industry.", "Some certifications don\u2019t even last forever. The TensorFlow certification expires after three years, and this means ML practitioners have to retake exams and tests to regain certificates.", "In 2020 I\u2019ve realised the importance of creating an embodiment of your expertise and experience within an industry.", "Forms of embodiments that show expertise are articles, ebooks, physical books, podcasts, video course, and certificates. Since I became an ML professional, I\u2019ve explored just one the forms of embodiments of expertise, and this is writing Medium articles.", "My journey so far, experience and learnings are translated into Medium articles that other individuals within the ML/Data Science community can learn from.", "One of my significant achievement of 2020 was my role as a Technical Reviewer for the book: The Computer Vision Workshop.", "Working with authors and editors on this book allowed me to realise the importance of creating a granular and detailed embodiment of expertise and domain knowledge.", "In 2021, I\u2019ll be working on releasing an ebook that is centred on the implementation of Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks using TensorFlow 2.0.", "This ebook will be another digital form of the accumulation of my expertise, knowledge and experience so far.", "Working on this ebook will require me to revisit the fundamentals of architectures and algorithms I wish to write about. Essentially, I\u2019ll be going back to the foundations of deep learning.", "How does writing an e-book help ML practitioners stay relevant within the ML industry?", "Machine Learning is a broad field that encapsulates some of the major approaches and techniques that solve typical day to day problems, and contribute to a larger field, that is, Artificial Intelligence.", "Writing an ebook on deep learning enables you to revisit the foundations and fundamentals of domains, algorithms and techniques. Just by writing technical Medium articles, I\u2019ve had to return to research papers that introduced critical methods and ideas.", "Composing a long-form content such as an e-book will require substantial research effort, primarily if I aim to teach and educate individuals with little to no knowledge of machine learning.", "Conducting such research can improve most ML practitioners knowledge within particular domains. And will most likely make you a subject expert. Well written and informative ebooks tend to establish domain authority for the author.", "But you don\u2019t have to write an ebook to realise any of the benefits I\u2019ve mentioned in this section. Why not start with writing short Medium articles, then move onto longer-form articles.", "If there\u2019s one aspect of my learning and career journey that has proven a worthwhile investment in terms of time and cost, it will have to be creating and completing personal projects.", "Since my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering, I\u2019ve always had a project that I was working on in my spare time. Every project solved a pain point in my life.", "Whether it\u2019s building a platform that can present the best club for me to go to on a Friday night based on my Spotify playlist or building an Airbnb replica for University dorms.", "Undertaking personal projects has propelled me to heights that typical academic studies can\u2019t. One of my major personal project of 2020 is a smartwatch application I built to track hand movements. Read more about it here.", "In 2021 I will be working on more personal projects, which again relate to pain points around my day to day activities.", "One of the projects I\u2019ll be undertaking is the creation of a virtual fitness personal trainer with the capabilities of answering health and fitness-related questions.", "Mainly, I\u2019m undertaking this project as a method of filling the skill gaps within my skillset on language modelling and NLP techniques. I\u2019m probably late to the chatbot hype, but I\u2019m always intrigued by the capabilities of large scale language models like BERT and GPT-3.", "The thought of understanding the inner workings of these language models and the method by which they can be trained and leveraged for real-life applications excites me as an AI enthusiast and ML practitioner.", "How does working on a personal project help machine learning practitioners stay relevant?", "Machine learning is a technological mechanism that\u2019s enabled through a variety of tools and manifested in different forms of application.", "What this means is there are several unconstrained methods by which ML applications can be developed. These methods involve different programming paradigms, languages, tools and libraries.", "Undertaking personal projects is a proven method of expanding your skillset to encompass some of the various languages and tools that enable the development of ML applications.", "For example, as a professional Computer Vision Engineer, I utilise TensorFlow, Python and the Swift programming languages to complete my day to day ML tasks.", "But to keep up with the industry and maintain relevancy, I explore the implementation of deep learning models using PyTorch and learn other programming languages such as Java/Kotlin.", "For many, personal projects fill the void of experience and expertise between studies and a machine learning role.", "A relevant ML practitioner is one that\u2019s equipped with a versatile and robust skillset. ML models can exist on large devices, microcontrollers and the cloud. Therefore, ML practitioners must have the required experience and skillset to implement and deliver ML capabilities in various platforms.", "The plans and strategies documented in this article might work very well for me, but there\u2019s no guarantee that they will work as well for you.", "Suppose you are an ML practitioner reading this, I urge you to take some key points and actions from this article and create a set of strategies that apply to you in terms of your goals, availability and capabilities.", "Below is a summary of the actions I\u2019ll be taking in 2021 to stay relevant within the ML industry.", "Use the comment section to share your plans and strategies you will be using to stay relevant within the ML industry in 2021 and beyond, I\u2019m sure myself and others can learn from you.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
