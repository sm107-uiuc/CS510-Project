The origin of this quote goes back to 2003, in Dasu and Johnson\u2019s book, Exploratory Data Mining and Data Cleaning, and it still true to this day.", "In a typical Data Science project, from importing your data to communicating your results, tidying your data is a crucial aspect in making your workflow more productive and efficient.", "The process of tidying data would thus create what\u2019s known as tidy data, which is an ideal first formulated by Hadley Wickham in his paper. So my article will be largely a summarization or extracting the essence of the paper if you will.", "From the paper, the definition given is:", "Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning)", "To break down this definition, you have to first understand what structure and semantics means.", "> Structure is the form and shape of your data. In statistics, most datasets are rectangular data tables(data frames) and are made up of rows and columns.", "> Semantics is the meaning for the dataset. Datasets are a collection of values, either quantitative or qualitative. These values are organized in 2 ways \u2014 variable & observation.", "If you didn\u2019t get any of that, I recommend you reading the paper mentioned as it has examples and tables that illustrate it better.", "Nonetheless, the 3 rules of tidy data help simplify the concept and make it more intuitive.", "As you can see from the image above is a great visualization of this framework for tidy data. The data frame you see in the image might just look like tables of values you see everywhere, but you have to understand that data doesn\u2019t come in that form naturally, sometimes data is collected and stored separately, and your job is to aggregate them together in one table.", "To appreciate why tidy data is so important, you have to encounter what messy data looks like.", "With tidy data defined, messy data would basically be any kind of data that isn\u2019t following the above framework.", "To narrow it down, the paper gives 5 common problems of messy data:", "The importance of tidy data ties is simple. With a standardized framework for how your data should look, you spend less time on data cleaning and wrangling, and more time to focus on answering the problem at hand.", "It\u2019s also a good practice to have your data in this format, which makes it reproducible and it\u2019s easy for others to understand.", "Another more technical reason is that the concept of tidy data is complemented with the tools in R to work with. Since R works with vectors of values (R functions are vectorized by nature), you\u2019re able to naturally apply your tidy data to the tools used.", "There are amazing libraries in R that complement the tidy data philosophy. They help you tidy and clean your data efficiently and swiftly, which you can utilize by loading the package tidyverse in R.", "After running library(tidyverse), you\u2019ll see something similar to this. To perform data cleaning and data tidying, the main libraries to use would be tidyr and dplyr.", "A brief intro to these two libraries:", "dplyr \u2014 Grammar of data manipulation, with 5 verbs(functions) that helps you solve most of data manipulation challenges", "tidyr \u2014 set of functions to help you get tidy data. It\u2019s the successor to reshape2(which uses melt and cast). It has 5 main categories", "To see these functions in action, read chapter 12: Tidy Data from the free book, R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham!", "To know more about the packages, read about them on their website.", "The philosophy of tidy data isn\u2019t all that clear if you just read about it. Along with any other concepts, to understand it better, you would have to apply it and do some hands-on work to see it in action.", "Moreover, to really appreciate the power and usefulness of the tidy data tools, you would have to get your hands dirty and work on some messy data. Most data you encounter in places like Kaggle or other websites are all already tidy data, so make sure you find data that is messy. Or if you\u2019re brave, you can scrape data from the web and tidy the data yourself. That\u2019s a great challenge to develop your data science skills and become a better \u201cdata cleaner\u201d.", "A great way to practice your tidy data skills is to participate in the Tidy Tuesday challenge, which is a weekly social data project by the R for Data Science online community.", "Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be \u201ctamed\u201d, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other\u2019s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community! As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!", "Read more about it at their GitHub repo.", "Thanks for reading my article.
