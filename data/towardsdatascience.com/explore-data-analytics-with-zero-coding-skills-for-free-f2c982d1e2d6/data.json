Does it sound complicated and yet simple enough? Understand the logic behind models but don't know how to code? Apprehensive of spending too much time learning to code before jumping on the bandwagon?", "Worry not, there are some awesome tools available for free for non-coders that can help develop complicated models in no time. These tools are completely free for personal use, extremely easy and intuitive and can help one practice without the hassle of learning how to code.", "I am an amateurish coder but a big machine learning enthusiast. I can code but I avoid it as much as I can (Thank God for that Recording Macro option in Excel), till the point I cannot avoid it.", "I was working on developing a model for forecasting traffic on a road and had to try a lot of things when I started looking for non-coder resources and found these gems. I am discussing the best three I found. Again, these are open source for individual users but have priced versions for commercial uses.", "Please be aware, although these tools remove the need for coding, your understanding of models, basics of data preparation, and statistics should be above the bare minimum. The reason is that when you code, you exactly know what is being done and how, while in most of these tools, default parameters are preloaded, and sometimes the code is not visible to the user. Thus it is easy for model errors to go unnoticed in case the user does not do a thorough QA.", "In addition to this, these tools will not tell you which data cleaning technique to use, which model to build, or which statistic to compare instead, the tools will let you do all the above tasks easily and give you more time to think and analyze data.", "Now that you have read all the warnings let us directly dive in.", "This is by far, the best tool in the open source domain.", "Knime is a very intuitive platform that helps create models using drag and drop nodes in a workflow kind of environment. It is built on python, has widgets for data input, data cleaning, modeling (regression, clustering, classification, Neural Networks, etc), statistics, and majorly used representations.", "It is has a desktop version (I love it) and a Server version for people who want to develop and deploy these model workflows on the web. Installing Knime on your machine is fairly easy, and using it is even more. Below is an example of an NN Model.", "There are nodes for every action needed to build a Neural Network. Importing the data, partitioning it, feeding a part to a learner, a predictor (test set), and then a scorer for checking the accuracy of the model. Parameters can be set in nodes that are connected to each other using connectors and can be executed in sequence.", "Orange is an open source machine learning, data visualization, and analysis tool. Orange also works on widgets arranged in a workflow pattern and has some specialized libraries for specific tasks (time series, bioinformatics, etc).", "Orange\u2019s UI is more fluid but its node list is less exhaustive than Knime. It has numerous visualization options and can produce decent data analytics. It is built on python and can help create and evaluate models for regression, classification, NN, clustering, time series among other things.", "Bluesky is an R based tool that can be used for data modeling and visualizations. It is open source and available for desktops. It has a rich GUI and it can help ease the learning curve for R newbies as for each function the R code is visible.", "BlueSky lacks workflow style architecture & node functionality. Instead, it has functions listed under tabs similar to MS Office ribbon tabs. The beauty of BlueSky is that it is built on R which is an incredibly powerful language for statistical data analysis. It has command editor and as the code is completely visible to the user, it is extremely easy for users to modify the code as they like it. It ensures that regular users of R can save a considerable amount of time using this application.", "There are numerous data analytics tools available in the market but most of them are not open source. This makes it difficult for individual users who are still in the exploratory phases of data science.", "These three tools are my top favorite to dabble with small Data Analytics problems. They can save an immense amount of time for newbies who might be daunted with the idea of learning to code.", "This list is based on tools available in late 2019. I will update this if I find any more similar tools. I hope you find this story helpful in beginning your journey into Data Analytics!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I write about things I love and feel deeply about. I dabble with books, women, injustices, politics and anything that interests me. **We are legends every day**"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
