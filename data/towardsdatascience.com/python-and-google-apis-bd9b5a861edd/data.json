To use python, you can run the code for this article on this webpage, online and free, nothing needs to be installed. Anyway, if you want to go deeper and become a python expert, we recommend you install Anaconda.", "But first of all, some basic concepts so we are all on the same point. You will need to know what an API is and what a JSON is.", "Let\u2019s begin with the easier one: a JSON is nothing more and nothing less than a way of structuring information inside a text so that many programming languages, tipically JavaScript but also many others, can read and understand that information. A tipical JSON works with the \u201ckey\u201d: \u201cvalue\u201d format. Here is an example of a JSON object:", "Now that we know that, what is an API? Well, API stands for Application Programming Interface. My way of understanding the meaning of those words is that when some (software) developers make a really cool program/app, they sometimes think that other developers may want to use it too, or at least some parts of it, so they create the API-part of the program with which you can interact with. So in a few words, an API is more or less equal to the program but you use it inside a script. There are many free to use APIs, but also many others that are not.", "Now to begin using google APIs, you will have to go to Google Cloud Platform and create a free account. Steps are super easy to follow so I am going to skip them, but after you finish them you should see something similar to this when you click on your Google Console:", "Now if you click on the three bars icon on the left, APIs and services and library, you will see all the APIs that Google has available. For simplicity purposes we will focus in those related with Google Maps, but we encourage you to explore and try any other that catches you attention.", "Once we click on see all on the right of the Maps section, we can see all the APIs related to the Google Maps, so lets use the Distance Matrix API.", "Make sure that you have the API enabled. If not, just click on Enable and you\u2019re good to go. After that, click on Documentation since there is all the information you will need to learn how this API works.", "Once inside the Documentation, click on the left to open the Developer guide. Note that these steps are the same for all the APIs.", "Now there are two things that we need: the API key and a url we will have to build. You will find your API key on the three bars icon on the left, APIs & services, Credentials. Now let\u2019s get into building the url, which is a bit trickier. All the APIs work more or less the same, you build an url and send it with your API key to request some information and then you catch that information. The way the url needs to be built is specified on the developer documentation of the API. In our case, our url will look like this:", "Where outputFormat needs to be changed to one of the options, either json (recommended) or xml, and the parameters the API accepts are specified down below, which in our case are the origin point and the destination point we want to get the distance from, expressed as latitude,longitude, and finally the key parameter to point to our instance of the Maps API. Typically you will have to build the string of the url separating the parameters by an & but luckily python has our back covered with the requests package that automatically adds the parameters to the url. So if you go to to Repl and paste the following code, you will get distance between those points. Make sure you change the API key with the one you got on the previous step.", "Notice that we changed the outputFormat and that in our case we used coordinates, but there are also other possibilities as the documentation indicates. Try to change the origins and destinations coordinates to a different location and see the output. After running the code, you should see something similar to this:", "Now lets add some explanation of the code: the first part imports the python packages used to get the API information, next we define the parameters for the url and the url itself and after that we use the get function inside the requests package, giving it the url and the parameters to retrieve the information. Also we add a check to verify that all is ok (if the code is 200, it is). Finally we print the information we get and convert it to a python dictionary, which is a python object very similar to a JSON but with the difference that python can access its keys easier. Now notice the different use of [ ] and { } in the output. Here we use square brackets to have a list of values for a key and curly brackets to nest those keys.", "You can try to access a key of the dictionary. Just type on the console result['destination_addresses'] and you will get the information (value) stored in that key.", "In this guide we used Distance Matrix API because it is simple to use and simple to understand, but you could use others to get directions, elevation, information about places and there are also others related to Google Analytics, Google Cloud Architecture or even Machine Learning!", "I hope this guide helps you understand how easy to use yet powerful are APIs and gives you ideas of how to combine them for your future projects. Please let me know in the comments if you have any question or ideas you want to share.", "Your home for data science.
