In this story, I am going to share a few things I think everyone already in this field or seeking to enter this field should adopt.", "As data people, we have to know and accept that there is no one way of doing something. We have to avoid sticking to one particular method of doing something but rather, explore the many many tools, frameworks, libraries and packages available to us for specific use cases. Don\u2019t stay committed to one thing, use what makes your work easier and faster. If there\u2019s currently nothing available for you, create something, reach out to like-minded people in your community and build something together. It may be of help to hundreds or even thousands of people in the future. Do not be scared to start, seek help when the need arises and put your creativity to test.", "Learning is a never-ending process and as such, you can never know too much. Curiosity is an essential attitude every Data Scientist, AI or ML engineer needs to develop. There is nothing shameful in not knowing something and knowledge can only be found when sought. Develop the habit of asking questions or seeking clarity every time the need arises. It shows you are highly interested in the topic and proves you are willing to learn more to gain more knowledge. As people who work by making inferences from data, we always have to be sure we know how to get our work done, what we need to do to get our work done and why we do certain things to get our work done. Asking technical questions about your work or project from your colleagues or supervisor will help you so much in understanding the core concepts of what you are working on and guide you towards getting your work done.", "One of the most important things for aspiring Data Scientists, AI or ML engineers is consistency. It is very difficult to be on a learning track for so long especially when things seem to be on a stand-still. Know that every one has a breakthrough time just as every flower has time to bloom. Keep learning, stick to a learning plan and don\u2019t go against at all costs. Your breakthough will come but make sure to be ready for it when it comes. Everything you learn as a beginner is the things you will use the most in industry so don\u2019t skip the first steps. Sooner than you expect, you\u2019ll be industry-ready if you keep consistent with learning.", "Most of us in this field write code on daily basis. There might be a few people in this field whose specific job tasks doesn\u2019t include writing code but for the majority of us who spend many hours per day writing code, we need to take up a group of ethics that make us stand out as elegant and good programmers. Code ethics are basically an accepted way of writing code that make our work look neat and organized. There are numerous benefits of adhering to code ethics and the most common ones are that it gives you the feel of being a professional programmer and identifies you an organized person. There are many code ethics but I think the basic ones every programmer need to know are:", "Just be simple with a comment eg:", "As a Data scientist, AI or ML engineer, you are only as good as what you learn. Reading blog posts, articles or papers on topics you find interesting in your field will help you so much in widening your knowledge and learning new things. Read often and keep yourself updated with posts from good writers.", "Landing Data Science, AI/ML jobs most often involves the process of taking a coding test. It can be very overwhelming and difficult especially if you are not prepared for it. The best way to keep yourself prepared for a coding test is to test yourself on daily basis. This not only helps you improve your skills but also makes you fast and time conscious. There are many platforms on the internet where you can take coding tests but the one I am most familiar with is HackerRank. Make it a point to take at least one test a day and you\u2019ll be very good with coding tests as time goes on. Also, you can look out for mock interviews or have a friend or colleague interview you once a while. This helps build your confidence for real interviews and prepares you for some of the likely questions you\u2019ll be asked in an actual interview.", "A good portfolio as a Data Scientist, AI or ML engineer should comprise of personal or professional projects you have completed, your accomplishments, professional goals and objectives, skills, interests and educational background. A solid portfolio makes you stand out amongst others and easily makes you desirable by recruiters and employers.", "Associate yourself with people with similar interests as you and keep in touch often. Reach out to those people to ask for help or to share ideas. Get interactive with some people you look up to and ask them for tips and other questions that can help you on your path to becoming a Data scientist, AI or ML Engineer.", "In most companies, Data scientists, data engineers, AI and ML engineers work together as a team and as such, anyone aspiring to enter this industry needs to equip him/herself with some team work skills that can help bring progress in the team. Team work skills may be in the from of soft skills and technical skills. Soft skills mainly refer to communication and relation to other people in your team, be it colleagues or supervisors. Technical skills are the core skills applied to work to bring in maximum progress. Learning how to use tools for distributed version control such as Git and Github is very essential for working in a team as it gives everyone in your team the liberty to work together as a team whilst away from each other physically. You can learn about using a distributed version control system like Git and Github from this article by Anne Bonner.", "As a Data Scientist, your domain knowledge is your super power. \u2014 Derek Degbedzui", "Data Scientists will work best if they work in fields of expertise. A Data scientist who studied banking and finance will work best in a financial company and a biological science trained data scientist will equally perform best in a company that works in the biology sector. Data science is the fastest growing and most diverse field today, you do not need to have a BSc or MSc in computer science to be able to pursue a data science career. No matter the field you find yourself, you can work as a data scientist if you truly want to. Spread your wings, help out as a data scientist in your domain. Switching domains to one where you have very little knowledge about greatly reduces your value as a data scientist in that field. A data scientist trained to work with financial data is almost useless in a company that needs a data scientist to handle climate or geospatial data. People may argue that \u2018every data is data\u2019 but as a data scientist, you have to know that understanding your data is key to making any working progress with the data.", "Thank you for taking your time to read this article.
