At the document level, one of the most useful ways to understand text is by analyzing its topics. The process of learning, identifying and extracting these topics across a collection of documents is called topic modeling", "There are several existing algorithms you can use to perform the topic modeling. The most common are Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) In this section I give anoverview of the techniques without getting into technical details.", "Latent Semantic Analysis, or LSA, is one of the foundational techniques in topic modeling. The core idea is to take a matrix of what we have \u2014 documents and terms \u2014 and decompose it into a separate document-topic matrix and a topic-term matrix. The first step is generating our document-term matrix.", "A frequently used methodology in topic modeling, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word\u2019s presence is attributable to one of the document\u2019s topics. LDA is an example of a topic model and belongs to the machine learning toolbox and in wider sense to the artificial intelligence toolbox.", "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF )can be applied for topic modeling, where the input is term-document matrix, typically TF-IDF normalized.

Common examples of root cause analysis in manufacturing include methodologies such as the Fishbone diagram. To perform RCA using machine learning, we need to be able to detect that something is out of the ordinary, or in other words, that an anomaly or an outlier is present. The root cause analysis process is outlined in the following diagram.", "The machine learning model is trained to analyze topics under regular social media feeds, posts and revews. An outlier can take the form of any pattern of deviation in the amplitude, period, or synchronization phase of a signal when compared to normal newsfeeed behavior.", "The algorithm forms a prediction based on the current behavioral pattern of the anomaly. If the predicted values exceed the threshold confirmed during the training phase, an alert is sent.", "Performing root cause analysis using machine learning, we need to be able to detect that something which trends. Trend Analysis in Machine Learning in Text Mining is the method of defining innovative, and unseen knowledge from unstructured, semi-structured and structured textual data. It aims to detect spike of events and topics in terms of frequency of appearance in specfic sources or domains.

The autoencoder is an unsupervised artificial neural network and one of tis main uses is its ability to detect outliers. Notice that outliers are observations that \u201cstand out\u201d from the norm of a dataset. Then, if the model trains with a given dataset, outliers will be higher reconstruction error, so outliers will be easy to detect by using this neural network.", "Representing visually the content of an NLP model or text exploratory analysis is one of the most important tasks in the field of text mining. From data science and NLP point of view we not only we explore the content of documents from different aspects and at different levels of details, but also we summarize a single document, show the words and topics, detect events, and create storylines. In many cases, there are some gaps between visualizing unstructured (text) data and structured data. For example, many text visualizations do not represent the text directly, they represent an output of a natural language processing model e.g. word count, character length, word sequences.", "Single-variable or univariate visualization is the simplest type of visualization which consists of observations on only a single characteristic or attribute. Univariate visualization includes histogram, bar plots and line charts.", "In the chart below we can see the distrubution of polarity on a scale -1 to 1 for customer reviews based on recommendations.", "Wordclouds are a popular way of displaying how important words are in a collection of texts. Basically, the more frequent the word is, the greater space it occupies in the image. One of the uses of Word Clouds is to help us get an intuition about what the collection of texts is about.", "Let\u2019s suppose you want to build a text classification system. If you\u2019d want to see what are the different frequent words in the different categories, you\u2019d build a Word Cloud for each category and see what are the most popular words inside each category.", "Looking at the most frequent words in each topic, we have a sense that we may not reach any degree of separation across the topic categories.
