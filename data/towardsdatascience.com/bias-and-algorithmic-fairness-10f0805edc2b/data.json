I cannot be alone with that admission?", "This is not going to be an academically and legally comprehensive discussion of the topic but a personal documentation of my experience and journey. To get a more detailed understanding of the legal implications of fairness and accountability in AI I recommend following Dr. Sandra Wachter and reading, e.g., \u201cA Right to Reasonable Inferences: Re-thinking Data Protection Law in the Age of Big Data and AI\u201d", "I experienced the first challenge to my understanding of the role of data science when the fading hype could no longer excuse the machine learning black box. Model interpretability has entered my thinking from an unexpected direction: my stakeholders. Stakeholders cared more about the detailed workings of models than most data scientists did! This doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t aware of the black box but I dealt with it from a risk mitigation mindset. (Cross-validation, extensive testing of model input and output, logging and monitoring, constraints on model usage, lot\u2019s of good faith, fail fast and try again\u2026)", "I did and still see data science as experimentation in production. But while I previously thought the black box just needs safeguards to make sure predictions make sense, I now see why some model interpretability is desired not only for accountability but also to have actual confidence that predictions make sense. To restrict the Artificial Stupidity of the ML black box we need model interpretability to define when it\u2019s safe to score well behaved input data and when it\u2019s better not to score i.e. previously unseen input data.", "ML is well-suited and powerful for the interpolation of a decision space. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too easy and tempting to use ML to extrapolate decisions into unsafe territories of new and unseen data which was never part of model training and model validation.", "While the ML black box became only a grey box in my day to day work, model interpretability has provided me with needed confidence and improvements to our ability to constrain artificial stupidity, keeping our models within well understood safeguards. This means that it is sometimes better not to provide a score.", "A very simple but extremely powerful way to achieve this is by fitting an independent Gaussian Mixture Model on your training data for confidence boundaries of your decision space. If your model input is not within the confidence boundaries of your GMM simply don\u2019t return the model output.", "At the moment, I am hopeful that model interpretability will be addressed further by the scientific and technological advances of the data science domain on the one hand and I am comfortable to own the responsibilities of model interpretability as a data scientist on the other hand.", "While model interpretability is a responsibility owned by the commercial data science function itself, data ethics and algorithmic fairness cannot be owned by data science alone! Why? Because fair models are a tradeoff against accurate models and striking that balance has implications making it a senior leadership responsibility. Hopefully when you reach the summary at the end of the article this starts to make more sense.", "The reality is that any data point which is generated or derived from human behaviour is intrinsically tainted by the seemingly endless list of our human biases. Just to call out a few:", "In-group favouritism and out-group negativity: a preference for people in our own social group versus a bias to punish or place burdens upon an out-group. Biases which play important roles in prejudice and discrimination.", "Fundamental attribution error: when we tend to attribute someone\u2019s behaviour to an intrinsic quality of their character rather than the situational context.", "Negativity bias: when we emphasis negative experiences over positive ones which has important impacts on social judgments and impression formation.", "Stereotyping: when we expect a member of a group to have certain characteristics without having actual information about that person.", "Bandwagon effect: when we do or believe things because many other people do so.", "Bias blind spot: our tendency not to see our own personal biases.", "All our data is biased because the world is biased.", "Addressing bias in data science is an extremely complex topic and most importantly there are no universal solutions or silver bullets. Before any data scientist can work on the mitigation of biases we need to define fairness in the context of our business problem by consulting the following Fairness Tree:", "Navigating the fairness tree according to your business problem is no easy task. As an example (adapted from here) imagine you want to design some ML system to process mortgage loan applications and only a small fraction of applications are by women.", "Identifying a suitable definition of fairness is just the first step. The next step is to select a suitable mitigation strategy for biases. Again, mitigating bias is a complex topic and there is, again, no universal approach or silver bullet. The following diagram shows the 3 main categories of mitigation strategies and existing implementations in IBM\u2019s AIF360 toolkit:", "To highlight the challenges of biased data and what data scientists can do about it, we have a look at the 1994 US Census Income data set.", "The target is a classification model to predict whether an individual earns more than $50k a year. The problem is fundamentally biased (gender pay gap, discrimination etc.) and the data set includes sensitive data: race and sex. Consequently, we remove that sensitive data from the model input in an attempt to build a group unaware classifier. The following diagram shows the NeuralNetwork architecture we use for our problem:", "The architecture uses an Encoder Neural Network to create a shared data embedding which feeds 3 classification neural networks targeted with predicting an individual\u2019s salary, sex and race.", "In the first round we do not use any adversarial gradients and train the model as a standard multi-head classifier to see how successful our attempted group unawareness is. The following chart shows the model performance after 20 epochs:", "Clearly removing the sensitive data is not making our model group unaware. We can perfectly well predict sex and race from the remaining data. This is not surprising at all as our problem is also historically biased and the sensitive data correlates with all the other features, e.g. education, career choice etc.", "We will use an adversarial neural network to remove any race or sex related information from the shared data embeddings. The custom training loop for TensorFlow 2.0 trains the NN heads for 4 epochs to adjust to the current shared data embedding, followed by an adversarial training of the Encoder using negative gradients from the sex and race classifiers:", "While the objective of the 3 Neural Network heads is to classify individuals to the best possible accuracy, the Encoder has the objective to improve the accuracy of the salary classifier while removing predictability for sex and race.", "To complicate matters further, we also have to address the heavy imbalance of the different groups in our data set in our definition of fairness. Imbalanced data is a common challenge in real world data sets and we address the imbalance in the calculation of the loss and accuracy of the model. That\u2019s why we use custom weights corresponding to the imbalance of our data batches and the tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits() function with a linear activation in the Neural Network output layers to retrieve logits.", "The result of the adversarial training of the model looks as follows:", "We successfully removed the predictability of race and sex from the shared data embeddings produced by the Encoder. But as the world is biased the accuracy of the salary classifier has also suffered significantly, in particular the predictability of high earners. I guess no surprises there.", "Data science has the ability to transform businesses and do great good in reducing the risk and cost in B2B and provide innovative new products in B2C. But data science applications come with great responsibilities. What we have to avoid at all costs is for data science to automate the reinforcement of biases in a non-interpretable and unaccountable way.", "The article hopefully illustrated some important take-aways:", "That\u2019s where the senior business leader comes into the picture again as someone who has to make the call and shoulder the accountability for:", "Jan is a successful thought leader and consultant in the data transformation of companies and has a track record of bringing data science into commercial production usage at scale.
