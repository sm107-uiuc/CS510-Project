This is usually because", "If you\u2019re a Python user, I bet you gonna use Pandas to do most of the jobs. In this article, I will share some useful code snippets that I used to save for myself to use during the EDA phase. By saving these useful code snippets, I saved a lot of time because I will run every new dataset I got through these \u201ctemplates\u201d in order to find some useful insights about the data. So, I don\u2019t need to think about what to do every time.", "One of the most important things we need to know about the dataset is whether there are some missing data. If so, how much they are missed. Please have a look at the function as follows.", "The function takes a general data frame as a parameter, and will return a data frame with two columns:", "The above example is using the famous Titanic dataset which can be from here:", "Sometimes, we may want to get the rows with maximum values for each group of a data frame. Here is the function that can help.", "It has 4 parameters that are the data frame, the column name that needs to be grouped by, the column name for the value and whether has \u201ctie for the first\u201d.", "Let\u2019s look at the data frame as follows:", "It can be seen that we have 3 groups \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d here. For the group \u201cb\u201d, there are two rows having the same value \u201c8\u201d and are both the largest values. In this case, if tie_for_first is False, only the first row with the value \u201c8\u201d will be retained, whereas if it is True, both the rows will be retained because there is a \u201ctie\u201d.", "Here is a sample run on the previous data frame.", "When we have many columns in our data frame, selecting the columns (features) becomes a tricky task. To my experience, this frequently happened to me. For example, once I was doing EDA for an electricity grid dataset with hundreds of generators. What I wanted to do was selecting these generator data and pivot the table. However, there were also many other columns. In this case, the select_dtypes() function helps a lot.", "Let\u2019s use the Titanic dataset that has been used in the first section again. We can use df.info() to get a picture of the dataset. Pay attention to the Dtype column.", "As shown in the screenshot, there are 2 float number columns, 5 integer number columns and 5 string columns. Of course, for a dataset like this, we don\u2019t have to use select_detypes() since there are not too many of them, but it is good to be just used as an example.", "Say, we want to have all the string columns (object type):", "Please be noticed that we\u2019re using include parameter of the select_dtypes() function. In some circumstances, we may want to use exclude parameter to get rid of certain types of columns and retain everything else.", "In the above example, we have selected all the columns that are NOT string type.", "In fact, you may already be noticed that either the include and exclude parameter takes a list argument. Yes, we can include or exclude more than one type of column.", "In the above example, we have selected both the integer and float number types of the columns, which is quite convenient to select only numeric features of a dataset.", "Nevertheless, in fact, there is an even easier way of doing that.", "Yes, both of the types are numeric, so we can just say that we want \u201cnumbers\u201d. If you\u2019re interested in what other types are supported, please check out the official documentation.", "Sometimes, the dataset we have might not be flat. In other words, there may be some columns having list/array types. Usually, it is easy to explode lists or arrays column in a data frame by using explode() function. However, sometimes we don\u2019t want to explode them into multiple rows. Instead, we want to expand them into more columns.", "If we want to expand the two values in each array of the \u201cvalues\u201d column, we can simply do it as follows.", "Of course, most of the time we may want to merge it back to the original data frame. Here is the full function for you.", "The function takes 3 arguments: the data frame, the name of the column to be expanded and a list of column names for the expanded new columns (optional).", "Here is the result if we apply the function on the sample data frame above shown.", "It is quite common to aggregate a Pandas data frame to get the sum or average of something. However, sometimes we may want to aggregate across columns. Let me demonstrate the problem by making a sample data frame as follows.", "In this data frame, we have exam results for students in 2 terms. Suppose we want to average the results for each student per subject. In other words, we want to get the average for the Math subject and English subject separately.", "I know, it is not too difficult to use the first column plus the second one and divide by 2, and then do the same thing for the third and fourth columns. Finally, rename the columns. There is definitely a more concise way to do this. See the code below.", "Do you know that the groupby() method takes a dictionary as well? the dictionary will help the function to group the columns into categories. Then, we can aggregate the values for each category (Math and English).", "In this article, I have shared some tips that I frequently used in EDA activities. I would say you may not have to use them to achieve most of the functionalities or implementations. However, I do recommend understanding them if you never used Pandas like this before. Sometimes, they may save a lot of time during our data analysis jobs.", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
