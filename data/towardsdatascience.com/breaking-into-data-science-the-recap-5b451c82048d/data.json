From this survey, most Data Scientist listed the core skills they have are Python/R/Excel, Data Visualization, Critical Thinking, Communication Skills, Machine Learning, Statistics, Math, SQL, Bussiness Understanding, and Data Preparation. Just look at those varieties of the skills to possess, it could be scary to learn all of them. Moreover, Data Scientist job advertisements posted in the online job boards often require a lot of experience and/or knowledge of the technologies that only accessible if you previously have been in the field for some time.", "As hard it is to break into Data Science, it is not an impossible feat. Many people did in fact, and so do In this article I want to write the recap from all the stories I have read and listen from many sources on how to break in into the Data Science field and what tips these people give.", "What is Breaker? It is just a word that I come up with for convenient purposes. In this article, I would refer the people who want to break in as a \u201cBreaker\u201d. While many people are Breaker, they could actually be categorized. There is one Reddit post that classified the people who want to break into the Data Science field which I quoting but I add my own views here. The classifications are:", "Breaker in this classification coming from academia or used to work intensively in one. Usually hold a Ph.D. (or Master in some countries); often from the quantitative field, have a track record for publications and conferences, and work as a researcher/assistant/professor/lecturer.", "Researcher Breakers are great in the theoretical, but commonly have a hard time transitioning from academia into industry. Most of the time they also lack the business perspective and burned out by how different the responsibility is.", "Career Changers Breaker is a Breaker who already has sufficient experience as a professional in the Industrial, might hold a master's degree or not, and willing to change their career to be in the Data Science.", "Depend on their previous experience, this Breaker could have almost all of the core skills necessary to break into Data Science (Often is Programming, Communication, and/or Bussiness Understanding) to does not have any of the core skills at all. The only thing for certain is their lack of seniority in the Data Science field.", "Just like the name states, this Breaker is a Fresh Graduate from College or currently a student in one. It could be in any bachelor major, but mostly this breaker coming from a quantitative or technical field.", "This is the Breaker who often have the hardest time because they need to find that sliver Entry-Level position which overwhelmed by massive applicants. Moreover, many of this \u201cEntry-Level\u201d position is looks like not an Entry-Level at all, like they required some advanced technology or some similar experience. Although, I would argue the companies do not know much about Data Science if there is an Entry-Level position that seems to have many advanced requirements.", "From the Breaker categories I just explain, depending on where you are standing, the obstacles in front of you would differ. Here I would recap how people breaking into Data Science depending on their Breaker category.", "This is me. I am coming from Academia background and I was a researcher before breaking into the Data Science field.", "Most of this Breaker type have a common ground when they want to break into data science.", "There are some obstacles that this Breaker face. Most of them are:", "Now, how these people actually break into data science then? Academia people still hold an advantage to have an experience and theoretical base. Most of them said that what they need to do is convincing someone you can handle the job. This means that you have the prerequisite knowledge about Data Science and showing the experience and skill you have from doing similar work.", "Knowledge could be acquired by a lot of reading, online courses, or having a mentor. Presenting the experience and skill would need a lot of adjustment; I personally tailor my experience in my research time to fit the business that I want to enter. For example, I am a biologist with experience in biological statistic methods. I just need to show my statistic method that actually appropriates in the industrial business in my CV and interview.", "A lot of stories also pinpoint that they applying for the job via online job boards but not randomly apply. They apply specifically for the job with a research business background that they had (e.g. healthcare). Although, I also have read many stories (like me) who find employment from their own connection. This connection could come from their University, Meetup group, or just your old pal.", "This is the type who already a Professional in Industry before but wants to change their career into Data Science for any kind of reason. This breaker commonly is people who:", "Professional often have better leverage as they already have the correct experience and mindset, but there are still some disadvantages:", "Professionals with a few core skills would still have an advantage compared to the other Breaker, especially if they already have the domain knowledge and/or the programming skill. Many breakers from this categorize often showcase their professional experience during the interview and filling their lack of skill by a lot of reading and following online courses/certification. Building a Portfolio is also a must. Some also enrolling in a higher university degree (Often Master) to improve their chance. Others also recommend doing an Internship.", "Just like Researcher Breaker, many people apply through online job boards but often time the career changer breaker more flexible in terms of the industry so they apply anytime there is an open position. I also read many stories that career changer breaker secure a Data Science job from their own companies. For example, I read their company wants to build a data science team, and because this person possesses the skill they hire them as a Data Scientist.", "A lot of the career changer breakers also get a job as Data scientists because of their presence in online media; especially LinkedIn. They have tried blogging or publishing their work in the online presence and out-of-blue recruiter contacting them.", "Networking although still the most ways that people recommend. With networking, they could bypass many of the usual steps if you just applying like you normally do and networking could also help you to soften your way into the position.", "This breaker is might be the harder type to actually break in the Data Science field. Without an actual industry experience and trying to find a limited spot where the competition is fierce (not just from fellow new grads but also from the experienced). Most of this breaker has these following traits:", "Once more, I stated that this breaker has the hardest time to break into Data Science because:", "It seems that many hurdles to break into data science as fresher, and it is, but it is not impossible.", "These fresher who manage to break in are those who persist in their effort and keep updating their knowledge by reading a lot and doing online courses. Some find employment from their time doing an internship, other by getting into the non-technical industry which has an opening for a data-related position.", "Many also giving tips that if you don\u2019t hold a grad degree it would be better to try finding an internship or try to pursue one. Some also suggest applying for another position but when you already had a sufficient experience you could try to break in once more as a Career Changer Breaker or Researcher Breaker.", "Finding a connection as a fresher or student also not impossible, and in fact, many did. Many find one from their professor in the university, the job board from campus, or even just from their hobbyist group. People also try to connect via online media, such as LinkedIn. One piece of advice regarding networking is that it is still a human interaction with each other and it means to give and take. Don\u2019t suddenly connect with someone in the meetup meeting or LinkedIn by asking if there is an open position or not. Try to have a proper discussion and being friends with them. Networking is not an instant way to secure a job after all. It needs to be slowly taken care of before any result could be produced. I personally build my networking since I was High School, and it only pays off almost a decade later. Networking, after all, is about trust with each other and to some degree, give and take.", "Many people try to break into Data Science and depend on the experience they have, the obstacle would be different as well. A lot of tips by the successful breaker have been given, it includes:", "If you are not subscribed as a Medium Member, please consider subscribing through my referral.", "Your home for data science.
