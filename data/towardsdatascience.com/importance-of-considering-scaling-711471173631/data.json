This concept is usually introduced right before learning concepts such as Data Structures and Algorithms.", "Because, just like in life, there are often many solutions to solving a single problem and knowing the pros and cons of each is crucial to making a good decision.", "While I won\u2019t be covering the different algorithms that Big O pertains to, I will be giving a quick understanding of Big O so as to ease you into the more in depth concepts of performing time and space analysis.", "What exactly is this Big O notation, you may ask?", "Big O notation (with a capital letter O, not a zero), also called Landau\u2019s symbol, is a symbolism used in complexity theory, computer science, and mathematics to describe the asymptotic behavior of functions. Basically, it tells you how fast a function grows or declines", "Simply stated, it is a standardized way of measuring how long it takes for an algorithm to run based on the size of its input.", "In a \u2018normal\u2019 coding session, the focus is on solving a problem, completing a task, or finishing a product. As users and data increase, the solution can break or bottleneck. As input in a system increases, so does the time it takes to perform actions on it.", "Take for example, looking for a video to watch online. If you only had 2 choices, it won\u2019t take long to make a decision. If you had 1,000,000 videos, it takes more time to go through each to find a good one.", "This is when it becomes crucial to focus on time complexity and different techniques that can be used to reduce the time. Big O Notation has become the standard when it comes to communicating these times.", "Think of it as its own unit of measurement. Rather than looking at milliseconds(ms) or nanoseconds(ns), we look at input size (n).", "What really makes Big O Notation stand out against other measurements, are it\u2019s rules of usage. These few rules make it more standardized, readable, transferable, and overall simplified.", "3. Consider worse case / upper bound", "While there are several different Big O Notations out there, alongside other notations such as Big Theta and Big Omega, the following are the most common and the most often seen.", "As stated before, the more important number is the worse case. However, finding both is crucial for understanding range.", "To find best and worst case:", "And, as with many things with computer science and mathematics, it only truly make sense with practice and repetition.", "Interview Cake has a series of questions to practice Big O notations here \u2192 Big O Notation Practice Questions", "If memorization is more your forte, here is a cheat sheet \u2192 Big O Notation Cheatsheet", "Your home for data science.
