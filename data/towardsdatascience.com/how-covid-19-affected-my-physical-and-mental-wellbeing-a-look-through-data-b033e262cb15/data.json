Be it a job-loss, personal financial crisis, more alone-time or even hospitalization, the list goes on and on.", "One aspect that I have underestimated, was personal wellbeing \u2014 both physical and mental. While listening to news updates, reading reports and inspecting disease tracking dashboards, many recommendations for practices to maintain healthy day-to-day life have gone unnoticed.", "So, I decided to dig a bit into my personal data (that\u2019s how I deal with stress! \ud83d\ude2c), to try and uncover significant changes to my wellbeing since the outbreak became official here in Canada.", "I moved to Canada in the summer of 2016, and while the winters here are definitely cold, I am generally trying to maintain an active way of life throughout the year, and allocate time for biking, running or walking when it\u2019s not 30 degrees below 0.", "Since physical distancing measures have begun here (mid-March), I noticed I walk less. But I didn\u2019t realize how much less!", "Using historical activity data (I\u2019m tracking my daily steps using a Withings Steel HR) dating back 4 years, I built a forecast to see how these past 2 months would have looked like if all were normal. As winter ends and spring and summer hit, my step count was expected to cross the recommended 10k/day (by the way \u2014 did you know this recommendation originally came from a marketing campaign? An interesting read about it here!), as the green portion of the figure below shows.", "Since the outbreak began, my activity levels have dropped to even lower than winter levels. Self-enforced stay-at-home orders have had their impact, and so did the extra-long winter, and my activity is barely reaching 40k steps a week.", "Digging deeper, I wanted to see how this time of year compares to previous years, on a daily basis.", "Not to state the obvious, but my step count for each day of the week during COVID times is significantly lower than before the outbreak. Most likely due to a 100%-work-from-home policy, weekdays show less activity than before the pandemic hit. I do seem to regain some movement on Saturdays (probably after realizing the entire week has been very static), but it doesn\u2019t stretch into Sunday, where static behaviour again takes over.", "At work we try to encourage a walk-walk mentality: folks announce on the #wfh Slack channel they\u2019re off for a walk, and go for a stroll around the block or the park. The data clearly shows I need to be more on top of this, and also reclaim my weekends. Montr\u00e9al, where I live, recently committed to adding 327km of bike lanes and pedestrian corridors to allow moving in a safe distance outside, and lots of other cities are adopting a similar approach. Take advantage of this if you can! It will be great for your health, and great for your community if done in a safe distance.", "I\u2019ll be the first to admit that modern life is messing up our should-be ideal sleep schedule: we go to bed way after sundown, wake up after sunrise, and rarely get the much needed sleep time on a regular basis.", "Before the pandemic hit, I would sometimes struggle to sleep well. This would often manifest in waking up multiple times at night, or just taking a long time to fall asleep. At home, I have setup an under-the-mattress sleep tracker (Withings Sleep), and I track my sleep with my watch when I\u2019m away from home, which gives me a pretty decent coverage of my sleep patterns.", "I\u2019ve inspected my sleep data for the past 3\u20134 years, to detect any major differences between pre- and post-pandemic times. Specifically, I\u2019ve looked at how deep the sleep is, and how much time I spend awake each night, trying to fall (or fall back) asleep.", "The figure above captures one of the key findings: each night is far more sleepless now than it was before. In fact, it seems like I almost never fall asleep or wake up during the night for less than 10\u201320 minutes per night, with a large skew towards 60\u201380 minutes per night of laying awake in bed.", "I have been feeling these sleepless nights that, more often than not, result in me tossing and turning in an attempt to fight off endless thoughts, ultimately keeping any peaceful sleep at bay. We must rest our brain and body for both physical and mental recovery as many studies have shown in the past, and it\u2019s a key part of our everyday wellbeing. Read more about it here and here.", "For those experiencing a similar situation, I would recommend trying out meditation (Calm or Headspace have some guided practices, for example), and avoiding any blue-light an hour or two before bed time. While it\u2019s not a magic solution, letting go of worries before bed is the key to helping you deal with any worries or problems when you wake up.", "One more thing that connects directly to sleep quality and physical activity, is mental wellbeing \u2014 or how happy we feel. Being surrounded by ongoing news reports, global crises and insane Twitter activity from reckless world leaders, it\u2019s often hard to think of the light at the end of the tunnel.", "As part of my quantified self efforts, I am also tracking my daily mood. It\u2019s a journaling method I found to be helpful to keep track of how I feel and briefly recap my day, where I tap away my feelings. It\u2019s easier to maintain than a full blown journal (which I actually do, but more on a monthly basis). I would recommend it for anyone who wants to keep in touch with their feelings, and maybe look back once in a while to understand what drives their emotions.", "I score my mood on a 1\u20139 scale, 1 being a very unhappy day, 9 being the most joyous day I can have.", "Below, you can see a comparison of average daily moods from a similar period of time before the outbreak began, compared to the average daily mood since.", "Clearly, nearly every day of the week has shown a significant decrease, where Friday is the only one that maintains a somewhat similar state. The mood is indeed taking a hit by the virus!", "When inspecting how things change over time since the beginning of the outbreak \u2014 the trend is quite clear.", "While I did have some joyful days of 8/9 on my mood scale, there\u2019s a clear downward trend in the data. The longer the situation lasts, the more \u201crisky\u201d it is for my personal happiness, and it\u2019s important to note and acknowledge that, to try and face this if possible.", "I am not a healthcare professional, and this is only a common-sense advice from a fellow human, but if you do feel your happiness is affected, do seek help: talk to a family member, a friend, a partner, or even use one of the many resources out there like Bell\u2019s Let\u2019s Talk.", "The goal of this post was twofold:", "While I prefer not sharing my personal data, I would be happy to answer any questions you might have on methodology or code. Feel free to ask in comments or on Twitter.", "With this in mind, I hope you stay safe, stay physically distant from others and take care of your health, both mental and physical \u2764\ufe0f.", "Your home for data science.
