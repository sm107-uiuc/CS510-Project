Typically, a GAN consist of two networks: generator (G) whose purpose is to map latent code to images and discriminator (D) whose task is to evaluate if an image comes from the original dataset (real image) or if it was generated by the other network (fake image). Playing against the discriminator, the generator tries to fool it, generating new images from the latent vector so the discriminator believes that they are real images.", "Whereas SinGAN is a variant of GAN in which the network has to learn from a single natural image, in contrast to previous versions of GANs as they have multiple real images to learn representations. SinGAN is an unconditional generative model that can learn internal statistics of patches within a single image. SinGAN shows impressive results on various image manipulation tasks as shown in the results section of this article.", "SinGAN architecture consists of a multi-scale pipeline, in which a pair of generator and discriminator are present, learning representations at different scales. They can be trained in a coarse-to-fine fashion, where generator and discriminator at the lowest scale learn coarse features like background and stuff, whereas at high scales, they learn very fine details like edges and corners.", "The source image is downsampled to the respective sizes and fed into the discriminator along with the generator\u2019s output. And the generator is fed with the random noise along with the generated image from the generator below them (except for last, which is fed with random noise only).", "As we are dealing with only one source image, we consider a set of patches from the downsampled source images as our real image dataset. \u201cYou can think of patch as a sliding window which hovers over the image and samples are collected\u201d. Usually, the patch area remained the same for all sizes, but the effective patch size decreases as the image is getting bigger and bigger for higher networks.", "If we take a closer look at the generator, random noise vector along with the generated image (upsampled to noise shape) from below are concatenated together and fed into 5 subsequent convolution layers, and the output of convolution layers is again concatenated with the generated image from below. This will output a new image further sent to discriminator along with real image (downsampled) for evaluation.", "A typical generator in SinGAN with each block:", "Where g_image is generated image from previous generator and Conv is Conv(3x3) -> BatchNorm -> LeakyReLU.", "For Discriminator, generated image and source image (downsampled) are fed for evaluation. Discriminator consists of five convolution layers as in generator but without concatenation.", "The network is trained sequentially, starting from the lowest level and rising to the highest level. Firstly, the generator and discriminator of smallest size are trained to get coarse features, then the next size network is trained as so on. Once each GAN is trained, it is kept fixed, and all the subnetwork GANs are trained in the traditional (adversarial) way.", "Training includes a combination of two-loss functions.", "As you can see in the following image, the first column serves as input to the network and all the subsequent images are the output from the network. All the generated samples have same high lever features like mountains, lakes and sand for the first row and orange background, birds and trees in the second row. Despite using only one image as input, samples shows very fine details and all the samples are quite different from each other.", "Following image shows some image manipulation task results. The first column shows style transfer in which properties of an image can be transferred to another image visually different but contextually same, enlarging or reducing an object within an image without causing jerks within pixels, adding an object in front of the background, reducing pixel distortions (super-resolution) etc.", "Results show that one image is enough to learn properties. All the experiments shows that SinGAN is indeed a powerful generative network able to generalize well even if one image is given as input.", "So, this was a quick and complete look to recently introduced SinGAN. I found this network particularly interesting because of its ability to generalize well using just one source image. This network performed well on various image-related tasks as shown above, you can take a look at the experimentations on Github. This network is implemented in PyTorch and is available on GitHub for experimentation.", "Your home for data science.
