There is something very satisfying about squeezing an extra 1% accuracy with some deep neural network (DNN) and having to spin up a GPU instance in the process. However, these techniques often leave the thinking up to the computer leaving us with a poor understanding of how our models work. So, I\u2019d like to get back to the basics.", "In this article, I hope to teach you a bit about feature engineering and how you can use it to model a non-linear decision boundary. We\u2019ll explore the pros and cons of two techniques: logistic regression (with feature engineering) and a NN classifier. Python code for fitting these models as well as visualising their decision boundaries will be given. You can also find the full project on GitHub[1]. In the end, I hope to give you an understanding of why feature engineering may be a better alternative to other non-linear modelling techniques.", "You are doing feature engineering any time you create features from raw data or add functions of your existing features to your dataset. This is usually done using domain knowledge of a particular field[2]. For example, let say we want to predict the amount of time it takes a person to recover from an operation (Y). From previous operations, we have captured the patient\u2019s recovery time, height and weight. From this data, we can also calculate the BMI = height/weight\u00b2 of each patient. By calculating and including BMI in the dataset, we are doing feature engineering.", "Feature engineering is powerful as it allows us to reformulate non-linear problems as linear problems. To show this, suppose recovery time has the following relationship with height and weight:", "Looking at the 3rd term, we can see that Y does not have a linear relationship with height and weight. This means that we would probably not expect a linear model, such as linear regression, to do a good job at estimating the \u03b2 coefficients. You could try using a non-linear model, such as a DNN, or we can help our model by doing some feature engineering. If we decide to include BMI as a feature, the relationship becomes:", "Y can now be modelled as a linear relationship of our 3 variables. As a result, we would expect linear regression to do a much better job of estimating the coefficients. Later on, we will see that the same idea applies to classification problems.", "If you want to get technical, feature engineering is essentially the kernel trick as we are mapping the features to a higher plane[3]. Although, with the kernel trick, there is generally less thought involved. The kernel function is treated as a hyper-parameter and the best function can be found using brute force \u2014 trying loads of different function variations. With the right kernel function, you can model a non-linear relationship. A DNN, given the right number of hidden layers/nodes, will also automatically construct non-linear functions of your features[2]. So, if these methods can model non-linear relationship why should we bother with feature engineering?", "We explained above how feature engineering allows us to capture non-linear relationships in the data even with a linear model. This means that, depending on the problem, we can achieve similar performance to non-linear models. We\u2019ll go through one example of this in detail later in the article. Besides this, there other benefits to using feature engineering which make this technique worthwhile.", "Firstly, you will have a better understanding of how the model works. This is because you know exactly what information the model is using to make predictions. Also, models like logistic regression can be easily interpreted by looking directly at feature coefficients. The second reason, which follows from the first, is that the model is easier to explain. This is especially important if you are working in industry. It is also more likely that your co-workers will have some exposure to simpler models. A third reason is that it is less likely that your model will be overfitted to the training data. By brute-forcing loads of different hyper-parameters, it is easy to end up modelling noise in the data. In contrast, with well thought out features, your model will be intuitive and likely model real underlying trends.", "Let\u2019s dive into a practical example. To keep things as clear as possible, an artificially generated dataset will be used. To keep the example from being incredibly dull, we\u2019ll create a narrative around it. So, let\u2019s say that your HR department has asked you to create a model that predicts whether an employee will be promoted or not. The model should consider an employee\u2019s age and performance score.", "We create the features for 2000 hypothetical employees in the code below. The employees can have an age between 18 and 60. The performance score can be between -10 and 10 (10 being the highest). Both features are shuffled so that they are not correlated. We then use the following function of age (a) and performance (p) to generate the target variable:", "When \u03b3(a,p)\u2265 0 then an employee is promoted when \u03b3(a,p) < 0 the employee is not promoted. We can see that the term a/p is included in the function above. This means that the decision boundary will not be a linear function of age and performance. Random noise is also included so that the data is not perfectly separable. In other words, it shouldn\u2019t be possible for a model to be 100% accurate.", "Don\u2019t worry if the steps above are a bit confusing. We can make things clearer by visualising the dataset with the code below. Here we create a scatter plot of the data and the result can be seen in Figure 1. With only two features, it is easy to see exactly what is going on. On the y-axis, we have the employee\u2019s performance score and on the x-axis, we have the employee\u2019s age. The points for promoted employees are given a red colour and those not promoted are given a blue colour. In the end, 459 of the 2000 employees (23%) received promotions. This ratio will change slightly for different random samples.", "Although this data is generated, we can still come up with a realistic explanation for the plot. In Figure 1, we can see 3 distinct groups of employees. The first is the group with a performance score below 0. Due to poor performance, most of these employees did not get promoted and we could also expect a few of them to have been fired. We can expect employees with a score above 0 to either get a promotion or take an offer somewhere else. Employees with particularly high scores tend to leave. This is probably because they are in high demand and have received better offers elsewhere. However, as an employer gets older, they need a higher performance score to leave. This could be because older employees are more comfortable in their current positions.", "Whatever the narrative, it is clear that the decision boundary is not linear. In other words, it is not possible to draw a straight line that separates the promoted an not promoted groups well. As a result, we would not expect a linear model to do a very good job. Let\u2019s demonstrate this by trying to fit a logistic regression model using just the two features \u2014 age and performance.", "In the code below, we split our 2000 employees into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). We use the training set to train a logistic regression model. Then, using this model, we make predictions on the test set. The accuracy on the test set was 82%. This may not seem too bad but we should consider that just under 23% of the employees received a promotion. So, if we just guessed that none of the employees would get a promotion we should expect an accuracy of around 77%.", "We can get a better understanding of what the model is doing by visualising its decision boundary using the code below. Here we generate a million points within the sample space. We then use the logistic regression model to make predictions on all those points. Like with the scatter plot in Figure 1, we can plot each of these points. The colour of each point is determined by the model\u2019s prediction \u2014 pink if the model predicts a promotion and light blue otherwise. This gives us a good approximation of the decision boundary which can be seen in Figure 2. We can then plot the actual dataset on top of these points.", "Looking at the decision boundary, we can see the model is doing a terrible job. Roughly half the employees it predicts as having promotions are not promoted. Then for most of the employees that got promotions, it predicts that they did not get promotions. Notice that the decision boundary is a straight line. This emphasises that logistic regression is a linear classifier. In other words, the model can only construct a decision boundary that is a linear function of the features you give it. At this point, we may be tempted to try a different model but let\u2019s see if we can improve the performance using feature engineering.", "Firstly, shown in the code below, we add the additional feature (i.e. the ratio of age to performance). From then, we follow the same process as the previous model. The train test split is the same as we are using the same value for the \u201crandom_state\u201d. In the end, this model achieved an accuracy of 98% which is a significant improvement.", "The model still only needs the employee\u2019s age and performance in order to make predictions. This is because the additional feature is a function of age and performance. This allows us to visualise the decision boundary the same way as before. That is by using the model\u2019s prediction at each age-performance point in the sample space. We can see that, in Figure 3, by adding the additional feature, the logistic regression model is able to model a non-linear decision boundary. To be technically correct, this is a non-linear function of age and performance but it is still a linear function of all 3 features.", "An additional benefit of using logistic regression is that the model is interpretable. This means that the model can be explained in human terms[4]. In other words, we can look directly at the model coefficients to understand how it works. We can see the coefficients for our model features, along with their p-values in Table 1. We won\u2019t go into to much detail, but the coefficients allow you to interpret changes in the feature in terms of changes in the odds of getting a promotion [5]. If a feature has a positive coefficient, then an increase in that features value results in an increase in the odds of getting a promotion.", "Looking at Table 1, we see that as age increases the likelihood of getting a promotion increases. For performance, on the other hand, the relationship is not as clear. An increase in performance would also decrease the age/performance ratio. This means that the effect, on the odds, of an increase in performance depends on the employee\u2019s age. This makes a lot of intuitive sense as it is in line with what we have seen in the scatter plots. In this case, it is probably not necessary to use the coefficients to interpret the model in this way. It was enough to just visualise the decision boundary but, as we increase the number of features, it becomes more difficult to do this. When this is the case, the model coefficients are a great tool in understanding how the model works.", "Similarly, the p-values can aid our understanding of the model. As coefficients are statistical estimates, they have some uncertainty around them. Low p-values allow us to be certain that our coefficients are different from 0. In other words, we can be certain that a coefficient is either positive or negative. This is important as, if we are not certain of a coefficient\u2019s sign, it is difficult to interpret a change in the features in terms of a change in the odds. Looking at Table 1, we see that all the coefficients are statistically significant. This is not surprising as we generated the data using a function of the features.", "Overall, as we generated the data, the analysis above was quite straight forward. Because we know what function was used to generate the data, it was obvious that the additional feature would improve the model\u2019s accuracy. In reality, it would not be so simple. If you didn\u2019t have a good understanding of the data you\u2019d probably have to talk to someone in the HR department. They may be able to inform you of any trends they\u2019ve seen in the past. Otherwise, by exploring that data using various plots and summary statistics you can get an idea of what features may be significant. But, suppose we didn\u2019t want to do all this hard work.", "For comparison, let us use a non-linear model. In the code below, we use Keras to fit a NN. We are using only age and performance as features and so the NN\u2019s input layer has a dimension of 2. There are 2 hidden layers with 20 and 15 nodes respectively. Both hidden layers have relu activation functions and the output layer has a sigmoid activation function. To train the model, we use a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. With a training set size of 1400, this gives us 14000 steps. In the end, the model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test set. This is the same accuracy as the logistic regression model but we didn\u2019t have to do any feature engineering.", "Looking at the NN\u2019s decision boundary in Figure 4, we can see why it is considered a non-linear classification algorithm. Even though we only gave the model age and performance it was still able to construct a non-linear decision boundary. So, to a certain extent, the model has done the hard work for us. You could say the model\u2019s hidden layers have automatically done feature engineering. Then, considering that this model has a high accuracy and requires less effort on our part, why would we even consider logistic regression?", "The downside of the NN is that it is only explainable. This means that, unlike logistic regression, we can not look directly at the model\u2019s parameters to see how it works[4]. We can use other methods but, ultimately, it is more difficult to understand how the NN works. It is even harder to explain this to a non-technical person, such as the head of HR. This makes the logistic regression model much more valuable in an industry environment.", "There are many problems in both industry and academia and most of them will be more complicated than the example given in this article. The approach laid out will obviously not be the best solution to all of these problems. For instance, you\u2019re not going to get anywhere with logistic regression if you\u2019re trying to do image recognition. For simpler problems, logistic regression and a good understanding of your data is often all you will need.", "All images are my own or obtain from www.flaticon.com.
