Especially when they are funded by public money.", "More about Open Data as a public good, as same as information about sources of free open data can be found in my previous article:", "Every year, the amount of data that is being generated, in science and beyond, grows exponentially. This leads to great opportunities in how we use that data in science, in making business decisions or in building evidence-based policies. But there are also big challenges when it comes to capitalizing on the produced data, such as the quality of data and its long term preservation.", "In this logic, we must be able to turn data into knowledge that afterwards results in action.", "So, what does FAIR stand for? (FAIR data principles)", "FAIR data is not equal with open data. For example, as can be noticed from the Accessibility principle, sometimes it can involve authorisation or authentication.", "According to Simon Hudson, Chair of the EC Expert Group on FAIR data, FAIR will not be possible without \u201cconsiderable and wide-reaching enhancement of skills for data science and data stewardship.\u201d And Europe is not really a best practice example when it comes to digital skills, with an average of 42% of its population lacking in this regard.", "Together with Data Stewards, Data Scientists will be required to support researchers throughout the research lifecycle, and will be embedded within research projects at institutional level or in specialized services per domain.", "In many cases, Data science positions are filled by people who already have a research background or who were trained as information professionals. The former is especially important, as much of the work of Data Scientist in this field is discipline specific, and requires a deep understanding of both curation and research.", "After looking at some job descriptions of Data Scientist, offered by research performing organizations, I have noticed that, beside the usual requirements related to machine learning, statistics, Python, data visualization, sometimes high performance computing or cloud computing, some of the future employees are also expected to be knowledgeable in research discipline-related software tools, to write content for scientific journal articles and blogs, or to attend and present during national and international conferences. In terms of education, Data Scientists in this area need to have masters or PhDs in fields such as astronomy, physics, statistics or computers science (varying according to the research discipline).", "One potential drawback for those who come from Computer Science or other related disciplines, and not from one of the specific research fields, is the requirement to be at least a First Stage Researcher (R1). In those cases, it might be preferable to first become a researcher in that field, and then add Data Science skills. However, this is not the case in all circumstances.", "On the flip side, an advantage of working as a Data Scientist in research performing organizations can be the fact that it might involve contributing to social impact. For example, some jobs in this field require applying Data Science to social-tech topics such as pandemics, fake news, citizen participation or renewable energy.", "In the business sector, Data Stewardship is associated with improving data quality, dealing with sensitive and confidential data, data cleaning, defining policies and monitoring systems, defining standards, adding metadata, and the entire process of data management over its lifecycle, from curation, and until it becomes obsolete.", "At Adobe, Data Stewards are responsible especially for interpreting regulations, any contractual restrictions, and policies, and applying them to the data. Therefore, among their responsibilities are: creating data policies and applying them to datasets; reviewing data, datasets, and data samples to apply and manage metadata usage labelling, and other.", "As we can see from the Adobe example and other, in certain settings, Data Stewardship is associated more with data policies and dealing with sensitive and confidential data. And we will see next how, when it comes to the European setting of Open Science, Data Stewardship revolves especially around implementing the FAIR principles.", "In the context of research, Data Stewards can be responsible for activities such as data cleaning, for eliminating inconsistencies, organizing and structuring the data, dealing with metadata, ensuring reusability, access, and long-term preservation of data (even when technology changes), plus other data management operations. Depending on their level of experience and expertise, in some cases, Data Stewards might also be required to deal with defining standards, best practices and interoperability frameworks.", "However, regardless of sector, public or private, Data Stewardship is more than data management, as it also includes data collection or capturing, processing, long-term preservation, and its reuse.", "In a presentation regarding Data Stewardship at the Delft University of Technology, is mentioned that Data Stewards should be able to answer to all data related question in a specific research domain. Some questions might be related to data storage, data recovery and back-up, how to handle confidential and sensitive data, sharing data in the context of patenting, offer help in drawing Data Management Plans and keeping track of data, ensuring long-term preservation of data.", "Moreover, at TU Delft, data steward job specifications include as a core requirement knowledge of the research area in which the Data Steward is expected to work in.", "Some examples of job related responsibilities of Data Stewards (extracted from EURAXESS) are: support researchers and managers throughout the research lifecycle, development of research data management workflows and best practices, Data Management Planning of research projects, research data curation, develop and run trainings and workshops for researchers, data management, ensure data validity, protection and security, ensure compliance with international standards regarding formats, metadata, monitor data management, maintain glossaries, implement FAIR data principles, development of domain-specific vocabularies, ontologies and metadata schemas, participation in research activities and elaborating publications.", "Popular skills (in that order, on Payscale.com):", "No. of job listings on EURAXESS, a European platform dedicated to researchers:", "When it comes to job responsibilities in research performing organizations, the two overlap to a certain degree. Data Scientist roles also include tasks related to data management or dealing with FAIR data principles.", "The authors of the Turning FAIR into Reality report consider that data science and data stewardship can often be combined in the same individual, but that it is preferable to drive greater specialization in the two areas. In some cases, this might depend on the available budget and on how data-oriented is the research organization. For many such organizations it might be difficult to have two separate positions in this regard.", "Below, is an example of how a pilot project related to the European Open Science Cloud described in detail the skills and capability framework when it comes to data stewardship. In this case, Data Science as part of the larger concept of data stewardship. For the entire framework, please see the report.", "Other European initiatives for defining Data Science and Data Stewardship can be consulted on the following pages:", "Given that, for now, there are not many job openings available for Data Stewards, it seems that it might not be the best career to pursue. However, the low number of openings might be also because the role is sometimes integrated within that of Data Scientist, as the latter also involves dealing with research data management, and the FAIR principles for data (at least, in Europe).", "When the two roles are separate, Data Stewards can be extremely important for the reuse of data, even if it is related to the private or public sector. Data has greater value and can yield better results and impact when it can be reused and built upon. In order to do their jobs, Data Scientists need access to good, reliable data, and, in time, Data Stewards can help in that regard.", "Data Stewardship can be a solution to the garbage in, garbage out (GIGO) problem in Data Science. If you don\u2019t have good quality data to start with, it doesn\u2019t matter how good a Data Scientist is. As a friend of mine once said, we need to start by how and what type of data is collected, and then move to processing and drawing insights from it.", "Either way, the demand for data experts in Europe is high and expected to increase even more, as EU institutions wish to catch up to the United States and China in the innovation and tech race. And this cannot be possible without embracing new technologies and stepping up its game when it comes to human resources.", "If you wish to try your hand on open research datasets, check the following repository:", "Your home for data science.
