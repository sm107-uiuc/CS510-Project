This article covers a part of this goal. The IPL data is used for this purpose with a particular focus on the PageRank algorithm. A few ways to build the graph networks are presented, followed by methods to extract some interesting insights. More importantly, a brief tutorial on the PageRank algorithm is also included. CSK and MI, the two most prominent teams in IPL are compared with each other using PageRank.", "Indian Premier League is one of the most popular sporting leagues in the world; its thirteenth edition underway. Its the richest cricket league with the highest viewership. With the pandemic casting a shadow on all sporting activities in the world and India in particular, this is touted to be garnering unprecedented viewership.", "Eight teams participate in this yearly event, each team facing the other twice, once each in their home venues. The ball by ball data of each and every match played in the history of IPL is available for free at cricsheet.org. Their website provides data not only for IPL but all the major men\u2019s and women\u2019s cricket tournaments across all formats.", "This work deals heavily with graphs and uses them for visualization as well as for analysis. Let us wet our beaks first by gaining some basic intuition on building some graphs for cricket analytics. And then we can get into the code.", "One of the interesting ways of exploring the IPL data is through the generation of nodes and edges, where nodes could be players and edges represent specific activities in the game.", "For instance, a batsmen-bowler network shown in Figure A above consists of the batsmen and bowlers as nodes and the directed weighted edges between them represent the runs scored off a bowler by the batsman. The edges with higher weights are coloured in orange and red.", "For example, Rishabh Pant has scored 44 runs off Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, which is represented by an edge from the node of B Kumar to RR Pant and has a weight of 44. This match, in particular, is between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Daredevils in which Rishabh Pant scored a century and yet his team lost the match.", "A much larger but less useful and a slightly overwhelming, batsmen-bowler network covering every ball bowled in the IPL (till IPL-12) is shown in Figure B, below. The plot sure does show the explosiveness of David Warner from down under (check the south-east of the plot).", "Similarly, another type of network which could be built using this data is that of the dismissals or wickets by the bowlers. Another rather frequently studied network is the batsmen partnership networks, which has been shown to be particularly useful in the longer formats.", "Furthermore, note that at a high level, this kind of analysis falls under the area of network science.", "Network science is an academic field which studies complex networks such as telecommunication networks, computer networks, biological networks, cognitive and semantic networks, and social networks, considering distinct elements or actors represented by nodes (or vertices) and the connections between the elements or actors as links (or edges). \u2014 Wikipedia", "Before delving into network science algorithms, particularly PageRank let us first get our hands dirty with some coding. The first task is to prepare the data.", "The first step is to prepare the data, which is available as YAML files. Each YAML file corresponds to a match. And for each match, the data is given in the form of description of a ball. So we need to prepare this data to form the nodes and edges.", "The following method is used to prepare the data needed for generating the graph using networkx.", "The method takes the input as a match and the inning and returns a list of tuples of the form: (bowler, batsman, runs). Data for each ball bowled is aggregated in the lines 31\u201337. And then the tuples are generated in lines 41\u201344.", "The following method converts the tuples to the edges of a graph.", "Lines 16\u201317 aggregate the runs from the tuples for batsman bowler pairs to create the edge weights, while the batsman and the bowler form the nodes. defaultdict is quite suitable here.", "Now, let us see how the network and its plot in Figure A could be generated. The primary library used is networkx along with matplotlib. This is rather straightforward.", "The code to generate the graph in Figure A is given below.", "Line 5 assigns the plot parameters, lines 14\u201322 assign the colours to the edges depending on the number of runs (as described in the comments). Lines 24\u201328 decide the layout of the graphs and the positions of the nodes and edges. Lines 30\u201337 work out the labelling.", "Line 38, finally draws the graph.", "As I was writing this article, the inaugural match between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians is already over, and being a CSK fan I cannot wait to generate the network for the match with the desired outcome.", "Now that we are in a position to generate networks and also visualize them using the data from a match or a set of matches, we can think about algorithms to analyze the graph.", "PageRank is one of the popular algorithms in network science which is the focus of this article. Here is a brief tutorial on PageRank.", "The eponymous PageRank algorithm, which is under the hood of the famed Google search, is surprisingly simple in its bare bones avatar. Most algorithms, when they are made to work in practice, undergo a zillion minor changes to be effective and efficient, these modifications to PageRank are out of the current scope of this article.", "As an aside, last year (i.e. 2019) around this time, all patents associated with PageRank expired.", "Also, note that I have used the reference, Deeper Inside PageRank by Langville et. al. for this tutorial among some others. The course on Linear Algebra from Imperial College London is also referred.", "Now let us get to the PageRank algorithm. The goal of PageRank is to rank the websites and decide the order in which they should be displayed in the search result. The underlying assumption is that the importance of a website is dependent on its links to and from other websites.", "The following is a mini-model of the internet with four webpages pointing linked to each other as shown by the directed arrows.", "Which of these 4 webpages is the most relevant?", "To determine this, each of the pages is represented by a link vector based on the links between them, normalized by the total number of links. For instance, for webpage X, the vector would be as follows:", "X is connected to Y, W and Z and the total number of connections is 3. This leads to the generation of a probability matrix P, by combining the vectors for all the webpages as shown below (note the transpose).", "The probability of a user on the internet to end up on X is dependent on Y. The probability of landing on Y is then dependent on X and W. And so on and so forth. The problem is apparently self-referential.", "Now to calculate the rank of page X, we need the rank of each webpage to which X is connected along with the link probability vector.", "This is represented in the summation below. The rank of webpage X is the product of the link probability of X with every other page with its rank.", "This for the whole internet would take the form:", "The efficient methods to compute r in the above equations is by using iterative methods. one starts with an initial guess of r and multiplies it with P to get an updated r. This is again multiplied with r, and so on till r stops changing.", "The Jacobi method is one formal example of such an iterative method.", "I am reproducing an example from Wikipedia to see Jacobi method in action.", "Suppose we are given the following linear system:", "If we choose (0, 0, 0, 0) as the initial approximation, then the first approximate solution is given by", "Using the approximations obtained, the iterative procedure is repeated until the desired accuracy has been reached. The following are the approximated solutions after five iterations.", "As you could infer, the same method could be applied to solve the rank equation described above. After ten iterations the rank vector obtained in our case is,", "The Jacobi method is essentially the algorithm for diagonalization of a matrix. So how is diagonalization related to this problem? The diagonalization of a matrix provides us with its eigenvectors. Let me try to connect the dots more clearly.", "Matrices linearly transform vectors by one of rotation, scaling, shearing or orthogonal projection (and some more!). Eigenvectors are a set of those vectors, corresponding to a transformation matrix, which does not change their direction under transformation. Though the direction of these vectors remains unchanged, they do get scaled by a factor which is decided by the eigenvalues.", "Writing this definition out in the mathematical form would be as follows.", "Here A is a matrix and v is an eigenvector, and \u03bb is the eigenvalue. I is the identity matrix with the same dimensions as A. The matrix A in the left-hand side transforms the vector v which is equal to the term on the right-hand side, represented by vector v scaled by a factor of \u03bb.", "This equation is similar to the one we wrote for determining the rank above. If eigenvalue were equal to one this would be exactly the same.", "In other words, determining the rank is essentially determining eigenvectors when the eigenvalue is equal to 1.", "Now, the diagonalization of a matrix is nothing but finding its eigenvectors. And this is what the Jacobi method basically does. Therefore, PageRank is fundamentally a method for calculating the eigenvectors of the probability matrix. Note that, there are a number of more efficient methods which could do this. e.g. Power method better suited for the scale of the internet.", "In summary, going in reverse, this tutorial briefly explained the concept of eigenvector and stated that matrix diagonalization could be used to determine them. The application of an iterative method like the Jacobi method, which is essentially a tool for matrix diagonalization is shown. This leads to the fact that the rank determination of webpages is fundamentally the calculation of eigenvectors.", "You hopefully got the whole picture. Now let us apply PageRank to IPL data.", "Let us start with a very simple application of PageRank, determining the player of the match. Calculating the PageRank algorithm is quite straightforward with networkx as you could see from the code below.", "Consider the example of the two matches shown in Figure A and C. For the high scoring match between Delhi and Hyderabad, the output of the PageRank algorithm is as follows:", "Dhawan was indeed the player of the match as also ranked at the top by PageRank. Closely follows Pant. For the recent match between CSK and MI, Rayudu was ranked as the best batsman. But this is actually trivial and not surprising. What could be more useful is comparing batsmen from two teams across the whole IPL.", "Let us analyze the two most prominent teams in the tournament history: CSK and MI.", "Both teams have faced each other 29 times in the IPL and Mumbai has won 17 of those, with the latest encounter belonging to Chennai.", "In Figure D, the network encompasses every match played between the two teams in the history of IPL till now (September 21,2020). It is indeed a dense plot and not very clear.", "What is more interesting though is the output from the PageRank algorithm. Interestingly, the list of top batsmen is dominated by the CSK. And more interestingly, it is topped by Badrinath who was dropped by CSK in 2013 (or around that time).", "To make things more interesting and also to look at a plot which makes some more sense, let us limit the analysis to the years after Chennai came back from the ban \u2014 a depressing time for its ardent fans.", "In Figure E, below, the network for the matches in the last few editions is shown. Let us note some observations.", "The result of applying the PageRank algorithm is as follows. Rayudu with his exceptional IPL form in the recent years is the best batsmen (in the duels between the two teams) while a number of MI players figure at the top.", "Considering the fact that CSK has won only once in the last 5 encounters, this result makes a lot of sense. MS Dhoni just makes to the top 10.", "Overall, there is little doubt that the two teams compete fiercely against each other and being a CSK fan, I hope that Dhoni ends up in the top five by the end of next IPL, presumably his last.", "The focus, for now (to keep the article from becoming huge), was only on the batsmen. There are a number of networks which could be built for analysis. For example, the bowler-batsmen-dismissal network or the batsmen partnership network, as mentioned earlier.", "Moreover, PageRank considered in this article is the bare bones one. It has seen a number of variations over the years which could be applied to this analysis to get interesting insights.", "And then, the whole work could be extended to test matches and ODIs which could provide a lot of metrics for analysis and better understanding than what the current figures from bowling and batting averages, strike rates, etc. do.", "Hope to come up with a follow-up article once more interesting insights are obtained with similar network science algorithms.", "\ud83d\udd35Find me at Linkedin or Twitter \ud83d\udd35", "Also, check out my other articles.", "computer
