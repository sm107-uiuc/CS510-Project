Or maybe I am already paranoid. But I can\u2019t seem to help it. And that\u2019s why I am going to write this down. Beware though. You might just jump onto this bandwagon with me.", "It started a few days ago. I started reading about graphs and now, it's all I see everywhere. No, not the serious-looking charts and bar plots. That\u2019s not the graphs I am talking about. Let me tell you what I am talking about", "There was a plaintive looking definition:", "You got two dots ( or \u201cnodes\u201d as they called it). Give them specific names. Join the two nodes and the line is called a relationship (give it a name too if you want). Scale it up with multiple nodes and relationships. And you\u2019ve got a graph! Simple. Plain. Easy.", "Looked like a spider\u2019s web. It was one. The more I read, the more I was lured in and the more entangled I got.and now here\u2019s how my day looks like. Let me tell you about yesterday.", "I woke up feeling rather adventurous and decided to take the train to work. I rushed to the station and took a quick look at the train map sprawled on the wall, searching for the route I had to take. As I stared at the map, all I could see was a graph. Each location morphed into a node for me and the train lines joining any two locations looked like an edge that was assigned a distance.", "Shaking off those thoughts, I got into the train. Since I had almost an hour to kill, I adopted the most common means of distraction. Checking social media.", "LinkedIn told me that Frank Fakename could be the next potential candidate for a connection request. Apparently the guy worked in the same company as my friend (who was already a connection) and also was in a similar role as mine \u2026 Dang! It was a graph!", "That got me thinking. So it might not be just about LinkedIn but all social media. Because hey! Social media is about people. And people love networking. And well, networks totally look like graphs.", "And that\u2019s what I kept wondering about for the whole train ride.", "I was still preoccupied with these thoughts as I reached work. I mechanically restarted my laptop and opened a web browser session. Following my everyday ritual of reading up on the latest news, I clicked on the link that took me to the news website. My mind wandered and fixated on the \u201cwww\u201d part of the site address. www\u2026World Wide Web\u2026.Web\u2026web\u2026..Oh, no\u2026.graph.", "It then dawned on me that my \u201csocial media is a graph\u201d was just puny part of a much larger scheme. The entire web was a graph! Each web page slowly morphed into a node and the links on the page were relations. And the picture that formed in my head looked something like this", "Enough.! Let\u2019s get to work, I thought. I decided to be a bit more organized and started put together a list of \u201cto do\u201d action items in the \u201c mind map\u201d representation of sorts. Halfway through the process, I backed up and had a look at my handiwork.", "Hold on.. why was it looking like a graph again? Things were getting out of hand now.", "This kept playing on my mind during lunch as I watched the lady in front of me prepare my salad. She put together all the ingredients that I chose and then added the dressing that I wanted. So maybe it was not just my to-do list. But I could actually show any sort of workflow as a graph with each step represented as a node, connected to the next step. And that proved to be food for my brain.", "By mid-afternoon, my eyes were droopy and the only solution to that was a cup of coffee and a good blog to read. Being a machine learning enthusiast, I decided to read about neural networks. Maybe a new topic would do me good, I thought. Boy was I wrong. The first article I opened had a picture at the very top.", "Now you know where I am going with this. And I seriously hope you\u2019re seeing it too. (clue: it looks like a graph). So does that mean the field of deep learning and AI is using algorithms (neural networks) that are just complex graph-like structures? Well, the coffee was not needed anymore.", "Finally, I decided to call it a day. Let\u2019s just go home and \u201cNetflix\u201d. There was this new thriller/crime movie and seemed like a good watch. Everything was fine until this one particular scene appeared. The detective was trying to put together the events that led to the crime and the people involved. He was putting it all up on a pinboard. And\u2026.", "I don\u2019t really have to tell you about it anymore now. The picture is right there staring at you. All I will tell you is that I stopped the movie right there, shut my laptop and simply accepted the fact that graphs are an inescapable part of our lives as I slipped into a content slumber\u2026..", "Wait up! This was just a fictional narrative through which I hoped to elaborate on the fact that the graph data structure is a perfect fit to model many forms of real-world data. Whether it\u2019s representing business workflows or decision making, they\u2019re a perfect fit. Graphs form the basis for social and interaction networks, transport networks, molecular biology and much more. They\u2019re used to provide product recommendations, to estimate travel times, discover new drugs, etc.", "In the following series of blogs, I delve deeper into the topic starting from the basics. I do hope even you have a \u201cgraph epiphany\u201d soon and if you already have; Welcome to the club!", "If you\u2019d like to keep on reading, head over to my next blog here", "Your home for data science.
