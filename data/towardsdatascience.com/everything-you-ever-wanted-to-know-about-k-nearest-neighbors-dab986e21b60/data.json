It can be used for both classification and regression tasks but is more common in classification, so we will start with that use case. The principles, though, can be used in both cases.", "Euclidean distance, or the 2-norm, is a very common distance metric to use for k-nearest neighbors. Any p-norm can be used, however. The p-norm is defined as", "Thus, for any value of p you can define a distance between two points: x and y.", "As mentioned above, there is no real training other than preparing a way to quickly lookup the neighboring points. Imagine your data set contains 2,000 points. A brute-force search for the 3 nearest neighbors to one point does not take very long. But if the data set contains 2,000,000 points, a brute-force search can become quite costly, especially if the dimension of the data is large. Other search algorithms sacrifice an exhaustive search for faster run time. Structures such as KDTrees or Ball trees are used for faster run times. While we won\u2019t dive into the details of these structures, being aware of them and how they can optimize your run time (although, training time does increase) is important.", "A very related algorithm is the radius neighbors classifier. This is the same idea as a nearest neighbors classifier, but instead of finding the k-nearest neighbors, you find all the neighbors within a given radius. Setting the radius requires some domain knowledge; if your points are closely packed together, you\u2019d want to use a smaller radius to avoid having nearly every point vote.", "To change our problem from classification to regression, all we have to do is find the weighted average value of the k-nearest neighbors. Instead of taking the majority class, we calculate a weighted average of these nearest values, using the same weighting methods as above. In this case, a \u201cmajority vote\u201d would just be a simple average of the neighbors and \u201cdistance weighting\u201d would be an average weighted by the distance.", "Let\u2019s take a look at how this all comes together with some Python code:", "Not bad!
