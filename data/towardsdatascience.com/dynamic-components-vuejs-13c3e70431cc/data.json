Decoupling the business logic from the presentation brings enormous advantages in terms of efficiency and quality. The fact that most frameworks build a static set of files is an additional benefit for reducing hosting or deploying complexity. These characteristics are good for an enterprise application, but I found quite limiting when I starting to develop the frontend of RawCMS, my opensource headless cms. In fact, I needed a modular system where contributors could add features to the interface without any limitation or building anything. In this article, I will go over the step I have done presenting my final solution.", "Spoiler: I ended using VueJs with Vuex and plain javascript. The result was a dynamic engine for loading components from any public URL and, if I could come back to the beginning, I will make the same decision again \ud83d\ude06", "Working on a product like headless cms, where you want to allow people to extend the platform developing their own module was a challenge. On the front end part, I was convinced to use a SPA approach and I was used to playing with Angular, but there was a challenge. Loading dynamically components, extending the UI, like adding menu items or routing was not so easy AFTER the build.", "That\u2019s why when I and Leonardo Marcucci started working on it we documented a little bit about the technical opportunities the market offered.", "We found three main solutions, each one with pros and cons.", "This solution consists of deploying multiple SPA and use a central SPA that manages the shell. So it can load menu items based on the number of modules (SPA deployed). I discard this solution because I was scared by the limitation of iframe and interaction between the modules. I fear that a solution like this will be not a lot more than a link list.", "I found some good opinions about web components. For what I was looking for web components were a good solution, but I would use a technical solution easy to use and widely used for preventing the reject from the community and, at the moment I made this selection, solutions like StencilJs was quite young.", "The final solution was to use widely used libraries that make me develop a SPA without building it and with the options of loading dynamically new plugins. That was incredibly easy, just using what VueJs give us natively. Don\u2019t believe it? Just read the next chapter.", "The final decision was to use plain VueJs because it allows us to do great things without a build process. Limiting a little bit of the browser compatibility, we can use ES6 utilizing a lot of powerful features like promises, array automation, etc. In our case, the product is designed for developers, so we supposed that forced them to use a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge wasn\u2019t a big constrain. Besides, if a developer wants to stay on IE6, we may have a bigger problem to solve than installs a browser for using this headless cms.", "So, VueJs was the framework selected, and then we had a set of challenges to make it work. In this chapter, I tried to revisit all the steps that bring us to the final version.", "The first thing we used is the opportunity of loading dynamically a javascript module. Basically the following options are equivalent:", "where the MyDefaultComponent is declared using something like this:", "The import statement can be also called programmatically, making the whole solution dynamic with something like this:", "The code fragment above is the point where RawCMS bootstrap the modules calling an API that returns the list of registered modules. In this specific case, I add all of them in a list, and then I resolve all the promises together to be sure to have all loaded before the init phase. Improvement or optimization can be done on his raw code, but this is the base for all I will tell later.", "As you have seen in the previous paragraph the import is limited to a file called \u201cconfig.js\u201d. This file must be placed on the root of the plugin folder and will contain a json object with the module configuration. For this, I used Vuex, the state management framework for VueJs. This made things very easy to manage. The code for the integration of all the dynamic components on the host app is just a few lines of code:", "In the example above we have all the modules loaded by resolving the promises (the first one is the host application and is treated alone). Other modules are integrated into the app by init them (using a standard method) and getting routes.", "After this step, our modules are part of the main applications and can be used.", "The routing is automatically managed by adding the single routes from modules into the Vue routing engine. We need just one extra step to manage internationalization. This requires to load translation based on the route we are visiting, so we added a chain on the routing pipeline.", "This piece of code loads all the translation from modules and merge it.C Core labels are used as failover.", "Adding menu items basing on the definitions from modules is a very simple matter, just a rendering issue. The js side of the component just put together info from plugins into a single property for simple management on the template side.", "On the template, we just need to render elements using the material design components.", "Communication between modules is permitted by two basic mechanism", "Through events, we can notify all the modules that something happens. Because the event system is central and all event mane is by-name references, there are no physical dependencies. All modules that want to list a given event can do and react based on it, even if they are outside the module. Basing on this principle the component that shows the user badge is notified by the login component when a user does log in, but you can attach your component too. The Vuex library makes the rest. In the next snippet the example of login translated into code words.", "What is the RawCMS.eventBus? Nothing more than a Vue component. Just look at the RawCMS definition.", "The last point is about Vuex usage. I add to the snippet the piece of code that defines the Vuex module and how to read/write data from the Vuex storage.", "Creating a modular SPA application is possible and in some scenarios is required. My use case, an opensource extensible product, wasn\u2019t so usual but you may fall in a similar situation. Just think of an application too big to be developed by a single team or company. Breaking applications in modules, with an event bus and strong convention, made it possible. The solution I proposed is working and easy to implement. My opinion about it after some months it is used.", "In the RawCMS case, a product estimated to developers, where the UI was used just to allow technicians to set up a headless CMS the limitations were nothing compared to the benefits of adopting a smart solution. In enterprise cases or other products with different kinds of users, you may need some additional work (maybe on the DevOps side) to overcome the limitation of the actual solution.", "Your home for data science.
