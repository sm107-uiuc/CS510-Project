That challenge presents itself today still \u2014 with the modern shift towards data-driven corporate frameworks. In spite of the logic-oriented goal, our \u201cright-brained\u201d history has some lessons we can apply today. AEC industries rely on communication to be the most effective and successful. Whether it\u2019s the rendering of a refined interior space or the model nuancing of a complex release valve, we all rely on some form of communication to convey our ideas. And in doing so, we\u2019ve become individually particular and highly skilled at our individual branches of communication.", "Our goal is translating that knowledge and fluency into another realm of communication: data visualization. In today\u2019s practice, data is all around us. Some practices have the luxury of collecting that data and devoting time to extracting information and insights from it, but many others have to be agile and find opportunities in their day-to-day work which will enhance their processes. This article will address both sides of the equation by focusing on data collection as well as visualization, and by presenting easily accessible tools for getting started as well as more complex solutions for the tinkerers among us.", "Data Visualization is a vast field with a profound body of work behind it. Although we can\u2019t embody every lesson there is, we can do well to combine our unique industry expertise with curated parts of it to push our capacity to communicate and collaborate further.", "Now that data has been collected and stored (Part 1), we can start thinking about its presentation and communication. In order to curate that communication, we first have to understand what our goals are, or more simply, what questions we want to answer by asking the data. In this context, data exploration should not be confused with data visualization. We may employ an exploratory step to better understand our data if it is something we\u2019re naturally unfamiliar with, but that process should be separate from the curated communication we hope to achieve through our visualizations.", "Once we formulate a set of questions that we want to answer with our data, we can begin matching tools and technologies to the questions. As with our previous topics, there is a wide range of solutions we can employ to answer our questions, and we will only highlight some of the most popular or widely useful ones here.", "Not too long ago, the commercial solutions were limited in this space. Only 5\u201310 years ago, pivot tables in Excel were considered the standard for visualizing and presenting data. Now, we have tools like Tableau and PowerBI \u2014 tools specifically dedicated to the task of creating and curating data-driven presentations. The innovation in this space has largely been driven by the Financial sector, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t leverage that innovation from within other industries with just as much effectiveness.", "Pros: Save Time, Does Not Require Domain-Specific Knowledge, Higher Quality Product", "Tableau is a Business Intelligence (BI) platform/app which allows users to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations using a familiar graphic user interface. In comparison to other BI tools, Tableau has a much steeper learning curve, but also offers more opportunities for customization and curation of the data visualizations. That trade-off carries true through the other data visualization platforms we will review later in this guide \u2014 both commercial and custom solutions.", "In addition to a steeper learning curve, Tableau also has a very significant cost associated with it. Therefore, it only makes fiscal sense for teams and organizations that have fully committed to this type of workflow. There is a free version offered as well, but it requires the user to publish their dataset on the internet which is neither advisable nor possible when working with most clients and partners.", "PowerBI is another BI platform which offers very similar functionality to Tableau, discussed above. The main differences between these two platforms are their accessibility and cost. PowerBI is designed to be useful to anyone and everyone \u2014 it does not rely knowledge of data-science or data visualization to allow the user to create great visuals. Instead, it simplifies much of the interaction with the data, and lets the user create and explore through simple operations. A regular user with no prior experience can be up and running with PowerBI in a matter of hours, or at most, days. The same user faced with Tableau would likely require at least a week, if not more, to be truly effective. (This information is purely anecdotal/experiential, and is not a measured statistic).", "PowerBI also offers a free and paid version, but unlike Tableau, the free version is usable. PowerBI\u2019s free tier limits some of the features of the app such as multi-author collaboration, and custom data source definition, but overall it is largely the same product and can be used by teams of almost any size effectively. The paid version can be bundled with an Office365 subscription, so if that\u2019s something your organization already provides, it may be a smaller cost than a solo purchase.", "The downside of PowerBI is the customization limitations. Because the tool is so user-friendly and accessible, deep customization and more \u201cpowerful\u201d features are absent. For the average dataset and user, this may not be an issue, but for teams trying to hone in on an aesthetic or trying to wrangle a truly massive dataset, this tool would present issues.", "Google Data Studio is a newer player in this space, and is part of the broader G-Suite. This is the lowest-cost offering among the commercial solutions, and therefore might be best suited to smaller teams and organizations. It is also very accessible, and has a very robust free-plan offering which makes it an optimal choice for prototyping or getting one\u2019s feet wet with data science and data visualization.", "The landscape of custom solutions in data visualization is exiting and rapidly expanding! Code libraries and open-source contributions are constantly making this field more accessible and useful for coders and software developers to inject these kinds of workflows into their projects. The main libraries we\u2019ll discuss here are rooted in the Python and JavaScript language \u2014 the two most popular programming languages in 2019.", "Although coding may be intimidating to newcomers, it should be noted that many of these libraries exist to simplify the interaction with the work. Just because someone might want to explore a custom solution, doesn\u2019t mean that every part of it needs to be custom \u2014 they can instead go with a \u201chigher-level\u201d library which abstracts a way a large chunk of the data they don\u2019t need to control or define.", "Pros: Customization, No Purchase Cost, Extendibility, Interoperability", "Cons: Maintenance, Requires Knowledge to Create, Time", "JavaScript is a great, natural choice for data visualizations. Since it runs natively in the browser, it provides the opportunity to reach audiences on a number of different platforms \u2014 mobile, web, and even desktop. For the same reason, it allows a high degree of customization and interactivity when creating and curating visualizations. If we can control individual elements on the screen/web page, we can easily bind data points to them and create relationships between those points which in turn create meaningful visual information for us to consume and translate into insights. Another benefit of JavaScript in this use case is its popularity. As it continues to maintain the title of \u201cMost Popular Programming Language in the World\u201d, it also means that precedents and examples are readily available to learn from. It might not seem like a huge benefit, but as many of these libraries are \u201clow-level\u201d in nature, examples and precedents are critical for speedy development, especially if the developer doesn\u2019t have a data science or frontend background.", "Where JavaScript fails to impress is in the data processing and manipulation process. Being inherently single-threaded, it often falls short in the performance department when being compared to something like Python, Go or even something compiled like C#/C++. In addition to performance, there\u2019s also not a huge scientific community working in JavaScript to contribute utilities, libraries, and packages like there is in Python for example. There are still plenty of utilities out there to get the job done, but sometimes it can feel like its an uphill battle just to get the data processed for visualization.", "Python\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in this respect are almost the polar opposite of JavaScript\u2019s. Whereas JavaScript was not optimized for scientific computing and data processing, Python not only is, but is also backed by a huge community creating and supporting open-source tools for Pythonic data science. Libraries like SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas make data preparation much quicker, simpler, and less frustrating. An added benefit of using the Python stack is how much machine learning development is being done with the same stack. Knowing the language and tools for visualization workflows could easily set one up for ML/AI workflows down the line.", "In terms of weaknesses, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint concrete aspects of Python for data visualization \u2014 it\u2019s fairly well rounded for this use case. One challenge is the delivering and sharing of the created visualizations. Since JavaScript is the language of the web, it is straightforward to embed the visualization in a web or mobile experience, but with Python, distribution has to be more carefully planned. A popular medium for the scientific computing community has been Jupyter, and it could be leveraged for this use case as well.", "There are a ton of different avenues for pursuing data visualization. The positive of that is that there is a breadth of choices \u2014 ranging from very user-friendly to completely low-level and customizable. The negative of that is that making a choice can be difficult. Making a choice should be an individual decision \u2014 it should align with your goals, the goals of the organization, and the realities of time and training that it would take to implement one of these solutions at scale. But above all, it should be about communicating. We can collectively \u201cnerd\u201d out on data, and we can similarly appreciate a gorgeous data-driven graphic, but we also have to maintain the focus that we are creating and communicating information to enact change. And achieving that takes a lot more than just being tech-savvy.", "Your home for data science.
