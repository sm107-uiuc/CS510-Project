The\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["\u201cBased on your activity, we think that you might like this.\u201d That phrase is one of the most common phrases seen on almost every social media platform, and there is a good reason for it. The conversion rate on these platforms is what drives business. This conversion rate is essentially the number of persons who took some action on a post out of the total number of persons who saw the post. The action taken from the post could be simply engaging with a piece of content, visiting a website that was linked to the post, or even purchasing an item that was mentioned in the post.", "With any of those scenarios, it can be seen why having a greater conversion rate is better. People are more likely to act on something that they are interested in or on something that sparks a need to react. Additionally, after a user has interacted with something that they were interested in, it is then the goal of the platform to show more content that is similar because the level of engagement will be similar. This is the essence of a recommender system; it determines a list of what a user might be interested in, evaluates what items from the list perform the best, and then repeatedly shows users those top-performing items.", "If you are a person who is interested in becoming a data scientist and you are also not interested in anime, you are more likely to click on a post saying \u201cTop 5 Algorithms for Data Science\u201d rather than one saying \u201cTop 5 Anime of 2020\u201d. After that, it would be ideal for you to continue seeing posts about data science. Therefore, every piece of content that a platform\u2019s user can see needs to be optimized to achieve its maximum potential. The best way of maximizing this potential is to only show users content that they are interested in. But now the big question comes, how do platforms know what a user would be interested in?", "There are two main, general ways that a platform can determine a user\u2019s interest. These are content filtering and collaborative filtering, and both methods have their own advantages. Content filtering uses information that is already known about both users and posts to connect things together. It involves having each user and post labelled from a set of predefined categories, and then scoring these connections. Once the scores are determined, it is assumed that a user will prefer the content with a higher score.", "Let us work through an example to understand this process better. For simplicity, suppose content on Instagram only had two categories: romance and comedy. Julia is an Instagram user who loves comedy but dislikes romance, so she would be given a weight of 4 for comedy and 0 for romance. Now there are two different posts which could be recommended to Julia. Post A is only about romance, while post B has a mix of both romance and comedy. Based on the total score, Julia should be more interested in post B and that\u2019s the one which will be recommended to her.", "Now there are more things which can be used to determine whether a user would be interested in a post or not, and these can include age, location, and even race or ethnicity; but the concept remains relatively consistent. To collect this information, platforms usually require users to create a preference list of some kind. This can literally be by filling out a form which asks, \u201cdo you prefer comedy or romance?\u201d, or by developing a social graph.", "A social graph is a record which maps a user to all the content they indicated that they would be interested in. On Instagram, this would be the acts of following another Instagram user, liking posts from other users, and sharing posts on the platform. Through doing this, a user develops a network which they believe they are most interested in. It gives a user the sense that they are in control of what they see in their feed. The challenges to this method are that it can seem like work to the user to fill out what they prefer or to actually connect with a group of users, and persons are not as good at listing their preferences as they might think.", "This brings us to the second method that platforms can use to determine user-interest; collaborative filtering. It works on the idea that a user will probably be interested in content that other users with similar viewing habits were interested in. This can somewhat be thought of as reversing the content filtering method. Instead of having predefined categories, mappings and scores, the collaborative filtering method will investigate what are users engaging with and then work \u2018backwards\u2019 from there. With a set of engagement data, the goal is to determine what are the features which link similar posts to each other. These features are unknown and usually won\u2019t have a label, such as comedy, attached to it. Instead, they are referred to as latent features because they arise out of the underlying patterns within the data.", "TikTok is a platform which uses collaborative filtering, so let\u2019s walk through the TikTok algorithm to get a better understanding of how this method works. When a new user starts using TikTok, they do not have to provide a list of preferences nor do they have to explicitly follow anyone. Rather, they are brought to a welcome page where videos start playing, and the most important metric is how long they looked at a video. The algorithm then analyzes this watch-time data, as well as how many videos were rewatched or exited, to understand what a user is interested in. It is assumed that if a user watched a video for a longer period, if they rewatched a video multiple times, and if they exited a video less frequently, then they are interested in that piece of content.", "When that user then returns, they are served personalized content based on the previous analysis of video watch-time. This method bypasses the social graph and instead creates an interest graph. As the name suggests, it is a mapping of users to what they might be interested in based on various performance metrics. Now, TikTok is not the first platform to utilize this method. The YouTube algorithm works in a similar manner. However, TikTok videos are usually much shorter than YouTube videos, and users feel comfortable posting more content. Therefore, there is a lot of data to learn from on TikTok.", "This is the power of the collaborative filtering method. There are tons of data to learn from and extract latent features which can then be used to understand consumers better, and then develop eerily accurate recommendations. Another advantage of this method is that users do not have to go through the work of building their connections or filling out forms to indicate what they are interested in. However, this can also lead to a user engaging with a rabbit-hole of \u2018similar content\u2019 that they would not have explicitly searched for.", "It is sometimes said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Often, users believe that when a platform recommends them something that they\u2019re truly interested in, it must be magic. It is not magic. Instead, it is sufficiently advanced technology. Both content filtering and collaborative filtering employ some data from a user\u2019s past behaviour to predict something about them. Content filtering requires a user to build a social graph and it lumps users into human-defined categories based on preferences. Collaborative filtering, on the other hand, causes users to create an interest graph, and it lumps content features together based things learned from user activity.", "So how do platforms know what a user would be interested in? Well, the user would have told them through one of these methods.", "Data Scientist? Yes. Researcher? Somewhat. Content creator? Sure, why not."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
