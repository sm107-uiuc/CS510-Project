It is primarily developed by Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence research group.", "Facebook recently released the much anticipated 1.3 version at PyTorch DevCon 2019, adding support for Google TPU, PyTorch Mobile and more. Also, The Gradient release a report on the current state of machine learning frameworks, stating that more and more researchers favor PyTorch to TensorFlow as their main framework. Another good reason if you are leaning/using the fast.ai library, it is based on PyTorch because it:", "\u201cuse all of the flexibility and capability of regular python code to build and train neural networks\u201d, and \u201cwe were able to tackle a much wider range of problems\u201d", "To me, it feels more natural working with PyTorch, being Pythonic and all. A better analogy is that developing machine learning models using TensorFlow is like wearing heavy armor: It\u2019s powerful but very clunky. PyTorch gives you all the freedom and a smooth flow of actions.", "But the flexibility of PyTorch comes with a price. Getting into PyTorch isn\u2019t easy. More freedom means you have more factors that need considering and more nuances to balance.", "That\u2019s why a great tutorial will help you greatly smooth out the learning curve. There are many resources out there. Jeremy Howard\u2019s wonderful tutorial on the PyTorch website is a good starting point. Yet if you want to delve down even deeper, I recommend you check out deeplizard\u2019s PyTorch Tutorial Series on YouTube.", "It\u2019s to-the-point (respect viewer\u2019s time by being concise), relevant (based on PyTorch 1.1) and most importantly, fun to watch. It uses a lot of neat animations/graphic editing techniques to make the video engaging and pleasant to watch. The production quality is very impressive.", "Chris is really great at explaining a complicated concept in a very concise and clear way with the help of great animations and versatile form of short video clips. Their videos will keep you occupied from start to finish. Couple of things they really stand out:", "Some YouTube videos offer exceptional content, but the aesthetic is not there, especially for the screencast videos. Viewers usually have to stare at one or two windows most of the time, which is visually boring and easy to get tired. Not for deeplizard though. The team is very good at creating subtle yet aesthetically pleasing animations. Even for backdrop images, which are usually static, they created some zoom in/zoom out effect to make it less boring. The motion is subtle enough so there is no concern of motion sickness. Plenty of eye-candy \ud83c\udf6c I\u2019d say.", "Embedding short video clips of relevant yet different styled content is another way to make the learning engaging. Our brain gets tired quickly if only one part gets stimulated. Looking at the same scene or listening to the same person talking, people won\u2019t keep their focus long enough. At least can\u2019t do it without some mental efforts. Embedding a variety of styled video clips solved the problem. Different parts of your brain get excited and you can keep the learning flow effortlessly.", "Other than the two lovely YouTubers of the channel Chris and Mandy, there is a virtual \u2018AI creature\u2019 they created as a third voice-over. It sounds like C-3PO in Star War movies, but female. It guides the viewer through the debugging process or asks some thought-provoking cryptic questions, etc. If you are into the Sci-Fi vibe, you\u2019ll totally love it. Again, less boring, more engaging.", "Besides the videos itself, they also have a membership website where you can find extra learning materials: Blogs, Quiz, Code snippets, and other extra resources. It\u2019s behind a paywall but I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good supplement of the video.", "The main takeaway? I felt that they\u2019ve made PyTorch seems quite straightforward and easy to understand. I felt like I can totally do my ML project on PyTorch going forward. Though I\u2019ve only finished their PyTorch tutorials, I\u2019d guess their other contents are also good too. Feel free to explore a bit more and let me know your experience below. If you are learning fast.ai course, since it\u2019s built on top of PyTorch, sooner or later you\u2019ll have to beef up your PyTorch knowledge and deeplizard\u2019s tutorial is a good place to start.
