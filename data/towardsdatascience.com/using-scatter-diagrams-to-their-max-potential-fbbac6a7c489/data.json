My thought was to maximize my reports and presentations by presenting every data point at every angle, including as many details to a single graph as possible. I cringe at the thought now. I learned over time that there\u2019s a correct situation for every graph and that less is more when it comes to efficiently conveying a story with your data. This is the information I want to share with you today.", "Whether you are an expert or a novice, I believe this article will be a great resource to anyone wanting to sharpen or refresh their knowledge on graphing. In this article I want to go over the following:", "Going through these sections my goal is to help you identify the unnecessary fluff and noise, present a simple, straightforward story for your audience, all while trying to avoid getting too technical.", "A scatter diagram is primarily used when you want to determine if a pair of numerical data points have a cause-and-effect relationship with each other. A scatter diagram is effective at showing a relationship because it does a good job of showing the range of data points at any section. If we were to use a bar or line chart, the best we could derive would be the trend of the data. We would miss out on a lot of other potential insights. Let\u2019s look at an example:", "Let\u2019s assume we have a set of data of archers and their heights and shooting accuracy. If we use the data to draw a line chart, we can see that there\u2019s a positive trend between height and accuracy: the taller the archer the more accurate their shots. But the line\u2019s direction gives us no additional meaning, and makes the graph a lot more confusing. A line between two points generally represents a change over an interval (usually time), not other numerical values. If we plot the data into a scatter diagram format, we can see the trend between the height and accuracy pairs, and properly see the range of values. If the data points did not have a trend, then the line chart would not give us any information at all. We\u2019d just see a spaghetti-like mess, and the only time that\u2019s acceptable is when you\u2019re a toddler throwing a tantrum.", "Here are some questions you can ask yourself to determine if you should use a scatter diagram or not:", "If you answered no to all three questions, then using a scatter diagram should be just fine.", "So when comparing two variables (where one is not time) it is best to represent the data in a scatter diagram for ease of readability and analysis.", "Now that we know when to use a scatter diagram, let\u2019s spend some time to determine how to best represent our diagram. Depending on the results of the scatter diagram, we can focus on telling a specific story or finding. Below are ways we can highlight our findings.", "A trend line is a great way to show what kind of relationship our data pairs have. Does the data show a positive or negative correlation? How strong is the correlation between the data pairs?", "Looking at the diagram to the left we can see that the trend line slopes upwards, showing a positive correlation between the archer\u2019s height and accuracy, but the points are pretty far from the trend line, representing a weak correlation. In contrast, the diagram to the right shows the data points sloping downward and close to the trend line, indicating a strong negative correlation.", "The slope also tells us if the trend line is completely horizontal or vertical. A horizontal trend line indicates that the variable on the x-axis does not affect the variable on the y-axis, whereas a vertical trend line tells us that the x-axis variable is unrelated to the y-axis variable. The two results are interchangeable as we can set the x- and y-axis as either variable.", "Using trend lines, we can more easily explain the nature of the data that we plot. I\u2019ve added more succinct definitions of what the trend line can tell us below:", "Trend line slope: The steepness of the trend line tells us that the rate of change in the y-axis is caused by the x-axis. An upward or downward slope from the origin represents a positive or negative trend, respectively. A completely horizontal trend line represents no change in the y-axis that is dependent on the variable in the x-axis. A vertical trend line would show that the changes in the y-axis are caused by some other variable than what is used in the x-axis.", "Density of data to the trend line: Density to the trend line tells us how dependent the variables are to each other. If the data points are close to the trend lines, they are very dependent. A lower density (data points further from the trend line) would represent that other factors are probably associated with the y- or x-axis.", "Curvature of the trend line: A straight trend line represents a constant ratio change: for every value in x a defined value in y will change. If we see a curved trend line (parabolic curve), then the rate of change could be accelerating or decelerating along the x-axis.", "If you need more details, below is a great resource with more information about trend lines and how to understand their slopes and it\u2019s general use in coordinate geometry:", "Coupling the trend line with sections of the diagram can help us tell an even more specific story about our data.", "Depending on the story we\u2019re trying to tell our audience, we can focus on certain parts of our scatter diagram. It\u2019s usually a good idea to start out with a general explanation of your data and then to do a deeper dive. This helps your audience follow along and engage with the story.", "From the graph above we can distinguish two characteristics of our data on the archers:", "Sectioning off areas of the scatter diagram is a great way to focus on the mean, above/below averages rates, and even anomalies to the data set. Using this technique will really help us guide our audience through the story we\u2019re trying to tell.", "When we plot our scatter diagram we won\u2019t necessarily generate a graph with an obvious trend line, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t derive insights from our data. As we\u2019ve discussed in the trend line section, we can have a scatter diagram where the trend line could be vertical or horizontal. See below:", "Here we have a different data set (finally, I was getting sick of the archers\u2019 data as well). On the x-axis we have the average length of words used by writers, and on the y-axis the years of experience they have. Let\u2019s see what we can tell from this data set by circling the clusters of data points.", "Looking at the circled data in the above chart, it seems like writers with a few years of writing experience, as well as writers with more years of writing experience, tend to use shorter words. On the other hand, writers within the median writing experience range use longer words. The story we could tell from this is:", "New writers have a smaller/simpler vocabulary, therefore word length is shorter. As writers become more experienced, vocabulary expands and longer words are used. The most experienced writers will go back to using shorter words, as experience has taught them that ease of readability makes for better writing and for reaching a broader audience.", "We don\u2019t need to look for a trend to determine a pattern. We can focus on clusters or anomalies to see if we can make sense of the data, or where to focus our investigations next.", "We spent a good amount of time discussing different ways to interpret and present our data, but it\u2019s just as important to know how to truly understand and explain what your data is presenting. It\u2019s easy to make biased assumptions from a scatter plot, so let\u2019s go through a few potential pitfalls and see how we can avoid making them.", "Our scatter plot will rarely, if ever, contain the entire population that we are trying to consider. Different factors including our own biases can affect how we\u2019ve sampled data. Google News is a good example of this in action. Depending on your past search history, Google will surface \u201crelevant\u201d news topics and ads to you, but these topics and ads are not indicative of the entire population, it\u2019s only the spectrum in which you are interested.", "If you\u2019d like to learn more about how to have Google News surface unbiased articles, you can check out my earlier Medium post here:", "Let\u2019s take a look at the diagram below to take a deeper dive at this phenomenon.", "Let\u2019s assume that we live in a world where there is no correlation between wealth and whether someone is more of a dog lover or cat lover. In this world, the fact is that there are just as many wealthy dog lovers as there are not-so-wealthy dog lovers, and the same goes for cats \u2014 an evenly-distributed population. Now let\u2019s assume you primarily hang out with wealthy cat owners. If you created a scatter diagram based on a survey of people you spend time with, you\u2019d incorrectly see a correlation between people who love cats and higher wealth. You\u2019d be missing out on surveying the hardcore dog lovers, and people of a lower wealth standing.", "Here\u2019s another example: you sent an email blast to all 1,000 of your subscribers about a new product for sale. 100 of your subscribers bought the product. 60 of them live in Ohio, and the remaining 40 in other states. You could use the 100, and determine: \u201cWow, Ohioans in particular really enjoy my product!\u201d Now let\u2019s say 800 of your 1,000 subscribers are from Ohio. This changes the story now, doesn\u2019t it? You just marketed to more Ohioans than people from any other state. Ohioans don\u2019t necessarily like your product, only 7.5% of them bought your product. On the other hand 20% of non-Ohioans also bought your product. (but the Ohioans like you enough to subscribe to you, though).", "To ensure that you have a good sample set, make sure that the data you are using is truly representative of the insight you are trying to portray. A good exercise is to:", "If all Bobs are builders, and all builders can fix-it, can all Bobs fix-it? Yes they can. Because being able to \u201cfix-it\u201d is a transitive correlation of Bobs. But in this instance, the keyword is all. We made a very generalized statement. If we said if all Bobs are builders, and some builders can fix-it, then not all Bobs can fix-it.", "So when we are making multiple scatter diagrams, we have to be careful not to not assume that different correlations and their variables are related to each other. They are not always transitive.", "Here\u2019s a more non-SAT style scenario. Let\u2019s assume we plot two diagrams:", "If both diagrams show a positive correlation of each of the variables, then it seems logical to say that \u201cAn individual who sleeps more can write more articles in a given day.\u201d This could be true, but we cannot deduce this conclusion. We don\u2019t know if the correlations are transitive. It could be that a person writes more articles because they had a carb-heavy breakfast which fueled their brain. We don\u2019t really know. So it\u2019s best to avoid these kind of comparisons, unless we can prove the correlation are transitive. If you can take the time to prove the transitivity exists, it may be worthwhile to add those details.", "Let\u2019s use the above graph to illustrate the example. This includes some multi-dimensional graphing which we won\u2019t get into here (resources on understanding this at the bottom of the article). Suffice it to say that \u2018x\u2019 is a vector that represents all hours of sleep taken by our sample, and \u2018y\u2019 is a vector that represents all productive hours by our same sample, and that \u2018z\u2019 is a vector that represents all articles written by, again, the same sample. Vectors with less than a 90-degree difference between them are said to be correlated as they are in general moving in the same direction. So those are vectors \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019, and \u2018y\u2019 and \u2018z\u2019. If we look at vectors \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018z\u2019 they have a greater than 90-degree difference, showing that the two vectors are not correlated.", "So why go through the hassle of explaining this? Because, as the storyteller, it is your job to guide your audience, and help them avoid misunderstandings about your findings. I\u2019ve personally found using the vector example on a whiteboard extremely helpful in explaining this concept. A lot of businesses will make decisions based on these findings, so it\u2019s important to ensure that we help them make the best and most accurate ones possible.", "We\u2019ve learned a lot about what kind of inferences we can make from the scatter diagrams we\u2019ve made, but we need to still determine which came first, the chicken or the egg?", "We\u2019ve seen a positive correlation between an archer\u2019s height and their accuracy, but are archers who are taller more accurate or do archers who shoot with accuracy become taller? It may sound like a ridiculous question to pose, but it\u2019s a point you have to prove one way or another.", "Here\u2019s a more ambiguous example. Let\u2019s assume there is a correlation between children who throw tantrums more than the average child, and poor grades at school. Which is the cause, and which is the effect? Do poor grades make children throw more tantrums, or do kids who throw tantrums tend to produce poorer grades? Chicken or egg?", "A good way to isolate correlated results, or as I like to say, \u201cthe quick and dirty method\u201d, is to create more diagrams that are possible factors. Can we check for how nutrition affects grades? Can we also check if single- or two-parent homes make a difference? There\u2019s a lot of back-and-forth that can occur, but it\u2019s up to us as the storytellers to determine the truth before we represent it to our audiences.", "As you can see there\u2019s a lot we can do, and even more to consider when creating scatter diagrams. To help boil them down, keep the following questions in mind the next time you\u2019re creating a scatter diagram:", "Going through these steps will help you identify the most important and relevant aspects of your data, and present them appropriately. Since we also went through some mental exercises on how to think about your findings, you\u2019ll be able to confidently speak to your audience in a presentation setting.", "If you enjoyed learning about scatter diagrams and the thought that can go into it, I would highly recommend reading Jordan Ellenberg\u2019s book \u201cHow Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking\u201d.", "It has been my favorite read of 2019, and there are a lot of great concepts you can learn from it and apply to your day-to-day work. Part 4 of the book, Regressions, has a lot of great detail on how to look at data conceptually and what meaning you can actually derive from it. Great use of scatter diagrams in that section of the book. It also contains a lot of other easy to understand and powerful to use mathematical concepts.
