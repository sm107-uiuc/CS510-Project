This happens, for instance, whenever not representative or already biased data is thrown into machine-learning algorithms, without particularly examining it toward prejudiced structures. The outcome will be just a reflection of this bias and reinforcing our biased society.", "An application trained with biased data was, for example, the Amazon internal recruiting tool, which was dismissing female candidates because it was trained on historical hiring decisions.", "An example of not representative data would be when I train a face recognition application with machine learning and feed it mainly pictures of white people. The result would be that white people will be identified more likely than others. Unfortunately, most of the face recognition tools on the market were biased, as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has revealed 2019. As the NIST study has shown, most of the tools tend to have significantly higher false-positive rates (falsely identified) among people with color and women, ranging from 10 to 100 times higher, than among Caucasian men. This becomes especially problematic when this tool is sold to institutions like the police department and contributes to more disparity.", "These examples are no exceptions, but rather a common accompaniment of digitalization and automation. Now imagine our future where we already are automating real estate agents, lending, hiring, news, risk assessment and so forth, using biased algorithms mentioned before.", "Nevertheless, just staying away from this new technology doesn\u2019t solve the problem, since this would only yield more misconceptions and therefore create worse technology and on top, it would expose us to manipulation from external technology.", "Therefore this topic needs further attention and has to be taken into account and understood by anyone, especially people involved in technological development.", "When a minority group exists in a society with predominant fewer assets they enter a vicious cycle of racism. Taking the history of PoC (people of color) in the United States as an example, where it all started with an extensive history of oppression and tyranny and led to a deeply ingrained systemic racism still existing today.", "\u201cIndividual intent is not necessary for systemic evil.\u201d \u2014 Jamie Arpin-Ricci", "The reason for this, put in a simple way, is that after the oppression has ended, people of color had few assets like capital or housing and were excluded from positions of power. Politics ignored completely unfair incidents like redlining, real estate steering, or privileged treatment for the GI Bill, which supported only white people in building up wealth and allowed passing it to the next generation. Consequently, a huge wealth gap has emerged over the decades and the most disastrous problem is that people tend to reverse cause and effect. So, people of color are unconsciously seen as more criminal when arrested, less fitting when applying for a job, and less reliable for loans, which all have been revealed by numerous studies.", "Rehavi and Starr issued 2014 the further comprising racial disparity in criminal justice, where blacks receive sentences that are almost 10 percent longer than those of comparable whites arrested for the same crimes [1].Bertrand & Mullainathan have shown in 2004 that white-sounding names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews than African-American ones [2]. Finally, Rugh et al. (2015) exposed that black borrowers in their sample paid an additional 5\u201311% more in monthly payments [3].", "Solutions for repairing a racist system are tremendously complicated, consequently, institutions should be thoroughly examined on any discriminatory foundation.", "Not having learned from history how important it is to build up an institution without bigotry and discrimination, we are already making the same mistakes all over again, with very few addressing this issue.", "\u201cWhen digital transformation is done right, it\u2019s like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, but when done wrong, all you have is a really fast caterpillar.\u201d \u2014 George Westerman, MIT Sloan Initiative on the Digital Economy", "Technologies in\ufb02uence our life with the decisions we take, with the products we buy, with travels we plan and it even has an impact on our mindset and political opinion.", "Studies of Epstein [4] have revealed, that search engines are in\ufb02uencing indecisive voters up to 20% before an election and even higher within certain demographic groups. In conclusion, these tools allow abuse to determining the outcome of an election, which puts great power into search engines and their algorithms and hence should not be overlooked from an ethical point of view.", "Furthermore, our generation consumes loads of information from platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, or Netflix where algorithms define and recommend content. Although it is not agreed yet, if recommender-systems are creating or in contrast breaking \u2018filter bubbles\u2019, it is clear that they possess notable impact. Filter Bubbles describe the issue that users see only content that agrees with their preexisting beliefs [5]. Yet, this phenomenon already exists without these systems, since it is part of human nature to look for confirmation rather than disproof and thus recommender systems pick up precisely that desire. Having said that it depends nowadays completely on the developers on how to deal with that dilemma, whereas it is an ethical and sociological matter.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you are developing biased technology because of unawareness. Ignorance cannot anymore be an excuse! This topic is too important for our future to ignore it and means we all have to work on it.", "\u201cRacist legacy laws and modern racist practices are all part of the same system, and it needs to be changed now.\u201d \u2015 DaShanne Stokes", "If you are involved in the development of technology, you always have to critically check your system and be conscious of the general weakness regarding moral standards it is imposed on. You are responsible for what you contribute and it is fatal to be not aware of the impact it causes.", "However, there is no jurisdiction for immoral implementations, which is why engineers and scientists do not take responsibility, especially since it often conflicts with productivity and competitiveness. This trade-off is rather complicated to balance, hence we need engineers, scientists, and sociologists working collectively with politicians to actively develop appropriate infrastructure. Recently the European Commission has proposed a white paper with guidelines for dealing with Artificial Intelligence in the future, which is worth reading. Nevertheless, it falls short getting attention and lacks finding solutions to maintain productivity and technological progress. Ultimately, this might turn out to be the tipping point of success and failure: Striking a balance between progress and meaningfulness.", "One thing everyone can and should contribute to this matter is raising awareness and providing knowledge instead of ignorance or passiveness.", "Finally, if we take care of our inventions, the outcome can even be part of the solution redefining our society from nonracist to anti-racist.", "[5] Pariser, E.
