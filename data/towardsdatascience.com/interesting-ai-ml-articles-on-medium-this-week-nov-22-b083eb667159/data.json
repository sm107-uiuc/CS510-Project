We all have a role to play to create an opportunity for equal representation.", "Arunn has written an article that shares a wealth of knowledge and learnings from his two years of experience working as a Machine Learning Engineer within an AI Startup.", "This article is one that I would highly recommend to entry-level Data Scientists or ML practitioners. Arunn includes some crucial tips and advice that can aid overwhelmed entry-level ML practitioners, ease into an AI-focused work environment.", "The advice Arunn mentions in this article is associated with topics such as growth mindset, teamwork, responsibility management and many more advice that will set a strong foundation for any ML practitioner looking to have a long and stable career within the AI field.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
