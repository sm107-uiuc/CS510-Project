Even though the field was mostly populated by people with academic backgrounds at the beginning, this is definitely not the only valid entry point. The long-standing debate about whether or not should you have a PhD to be a data scientist has been settled: you don\u2019t. However, a PhD can definitely provide some very unique benefits, which can enhance your work and life. In this post, my aim is to objectively provide the most important advantages and disadvantages of this path.", "Before we go on, the right thing for me to do would be to introduce myself to show you that I speak from personal experience. So, I am a pure mathematician by training. I have completed all my degrees (Bachelors, Masters and PhD) in mathematics, because I loved it so much. After I finished my PhD, I joined a computational biology research group as a postdoctoral researcher, which was my gateway to machine learning. I spent the next three years applying deep learning on various cell biology problems, mainly connected to high throughput microscopy. Currently, I am working to build my startup. I know from personal experience that a PhD can be beautiful and simultaneously grueling journey. If you are before this choice, I hope that I\u2019ll be able to provide useful information for you to base your decision.", "There is one fundamental requirement which should be met if you want to obtain a PhD. During my seven years in academia, I have met with countless students who gave up before the finish line.", "There is one factor which determines who succeeds and who fails: deep intrinsic motivation to push the boundaries of knowledge.", "Those I knew who began the journey exclusively for possible career gains failed to finish the degree without a single exception. PhD was a miserable experience for them. If you don\u2019t really want a PhD, then, well, don\u2019t do it. If this is the case, there are more optimal paths for you to grow.", "However, if you do have that certain inner drive, you\u2019ll find that this path has several unique values.", "Every job and PhD position is different. From each aspect, they are distributed along a wide spectrum, where extremities are possible. This means that the benefits I mention here is not exclusive to academia, and in some occasions, they might not be present at all. For instance, the first thing I\u2019ll talk about is academic freedom. There are some companies which might allow you to take control in the direction of the development, as there are some research groups where you will be unable to influence your research direction as a PhD student.", "With this being said, the tendencies are clear. On average, industry jobs tend to fall on one side of the spectrum, while a PhD position falls on the other.", "When you have a PhD position, it is unlike any job. If you are hired for a company, unless you got a very senior position or you are one of the first hires of a startup, your room to impact the direction of the enterprise will be limited or even nonexistent. However, when you are doing research, this is usually not the case. As a PhD student, you are expected to take control of the planning and execution of your project, possibly exploring novel ideas on your own. As opposed to industry, interest often beats practicality here. This freedom is both a blessing and a curse: you can pursue a wide array of subjects, but it is very hard to decide which ones are worth it.", "In your research, you are essentially required to became a top expert in your narrow field. If you can find a way to utilize this knowledge in a future job, this will put you way ahead of everyone. This is a chance you\u2019ll unlikely to get in industry, since things go much faster there and most often you won\u2019t have time to go really deep.", "Your environment plays an important part in your growth. Surrounding yourself with very smart people is a good way to improve yourself. Your advisor, the faculty, and your fellow students are all excellent sources of ideas and stimulating discussions. By its nature, academy is where the state of the art is pushed further beyond.", "Innovation requires failure, which is often undesirable in industry settings. However, this is not the case in research, so as a PhD student, you are given the chance to fail often. (Which, trust me, is very important.) You don\u2019t have users to serve and a product to maintain, which allows you to focus on constantly moving forward. In a typical industry environment, there is often little incentive to do that.", "An essential part of being a PhD student is presenting your talks at conferences. Often there is a specific budget allocated for this in scientific grants, or the conference may offer grants themselves. Aside from online media such as Twitter, a conference is the best way to put your work out there, get feedback and network.", "In addition to the good stuff, the academic path has several difficulties. It is essential for you to be aware of this if you are considering this direction. Some of the potential troubles can be lightened if you are aware of them.", "From a career standpoint, the time spent doing a PhD is time not spent building your career outside of academia. If you wish to eventually move to the industry, you miss out on those years. Most likely you\u2019ll still be hired to junior position after obtaining your degree, which effectively puts you behind. A PhD is an investment in knowledge, which takes years to return.", "It depends on the higher education system of your country, but generally, the scholarship you receive is far beyond an industrial salary, even for juniors. You might even have to pay a very expensive tuition, which might put you in debt. If you are not sure this investment will pay off, putting yourself in debt is not a good idea.", "If you start a new job and soon you realize that it is not a good fit, most often you can leave without negatively impacting your career. However, this is not true for PhD. The postgraduate track is structured such that the biggest reward \u2014 your PhD \u2014 is essentially behind a time gate. Leaving the program early is like quitting a startup job before your vesting period starts. Unfortunately, there are plenty of reasons to leave, as we see.", "In research, being first to solve a problem or make a discovery is what matters the most . If your competitor crossed the finish line just before you, essentially all your work is wasted. You won\u2019t be able to publish and won\u2019t be acknowledged at all for the result. Because of this, things are often hacked together just to make them work quickly, making it difficult for others to build upon the result. In addition, you advance your career by putting out publications, which also incentivizes to move fast.", "Fortunately though, these tendencies are slowly changing, at least in computer science and data science.", "In research, glory matters a lot. Every PhD student is out there working on their big project, which is counterproductive to collaboration. However, there are differences among research fields. In computer science, people tend to be more collaborative, but in life sciences, you are almost certainly isolated and your fellow students might be your competitors. This situation can be made worse by abusive supervisors. I have seen advisors putting several students on the same problem, pitting them against each other to incite competition. The first one to solve the problem would be able to graduate, the rest won\u2019t.", "Working alone also impacts the amount of the work itself. There is no DevOps team to help you, no one will write the articles instead of you, no one will draw the illustrations, put together a proper user interface, promote your work, etc. Most likely, you have to do this all alone.", "Due to all the things we have talked about, pressure is often enormous on a student. The sources are both intrinsic and extrinsic, often feeding each other in a vicious cycle. For a researcher, the bar is set to pushing the barriers of existing knowledge, which is a difficult thing to do. This leads to potential mental issues, making it harder to accomplish goals, further amplifying the internal struggle.", "It is not by accident that mental health problems surface much frequently in PhD students. There are several studies about this, for instance the one below highlights the proportion of people affected with each issue among several groups.", "I know all of what we have just discussed from personal experience. I had trouble with money, had a bad relationship with my advisor, was struggling with the publication pressure, was suicidal and had to seek help, and had many more other issues. But every step of the way, I fought so hard to overcome these, and I have eventually succeeded.", "The most important thing I have obtained from my PhD was grit.", "The single most valuable gain was not in the career benefits or the in the deep knowledge. It was coming out on the other side, knowing that all obstacles can be overcome with hard work and effort.", "If you love taking machine learning concepts apart and understanding what makes them tick, we have a lot in common. Check out my blog, where I frequently publish technical posts like this!", "Your home for data science.
