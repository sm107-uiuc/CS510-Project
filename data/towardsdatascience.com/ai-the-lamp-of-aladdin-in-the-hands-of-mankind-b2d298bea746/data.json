Ignoring completely these two key players in most of the solutions to the topics actually covered.", "We need to start concerning ourselves with the question of vision and goal for mankind, in particular in relation to our new and evolving magic wands AI and 4IR. Maybe it is unrealistic to aim at a single vision for the entire mankind. Still, we need the brainstorm, exchange of ideas, and debate about the future direction to stay in control and ensure that in ten, twenty or thirty years the reality will be favourable for a majority of the global population.", "UN has defined the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)which is a very good way to address the problems we face today. Still, none of the goals is directly related to guiding the AI/4IR in a specific direction with the best of our society in mind.", "For decades the climate has been changing, scientists have been warning about it while others have been denying it. In the meantime, the climate changes got more severe by the minute.", "With AI/4IR it is a similar situation, there are lots of disagreement of how fundamental and all-embracing the changes will be and how fast they will come. In the meantime, the development is accelerating and producing new result every day.", "Today, the biggest AI race is the competition to develop the first Artificial General Intelligence(AGI). AGI is a human-like intelligence developed to solve general tasks, not just a single specific task. The first country or company to succeed will gain a tremendous advantage and as soon as it is working, it will spend 24 hours, 7 days a week to improve itself. The fact that there are literally being invested millions in AGI projects every day, proves how serious investors are taking this, and is a strong indication of how far the AI engineers already are.", "Three topics that are regularly mentioned when attempting to predict a future AI/4IR world", "\u00b7 Jobs \u2014 How many will lose their jobs to robots and AI?", "\u00b7 Sharing of resources \u2014 Who will own the robots and the AI?", "I honestly find it odd to discuss if AI and 4IR will result in loss of jobs. I assume that it is part of the entire concept. To produce solutions that can help people in their work or even do it for them. The presumption that AI/4IR does not reduce the size of the workforce, is not logical. Why develop a solution that renders one job redundant and then creates a new one another place? it is futile.", "This is where I bring Aladdin and his lamp in.

This would give you time and freedom to explore endless possibilities in the last two bullets, both alone and together with others. The vision is not laying on the couch all day developing a depression. It is about having enough resources to pursue the passions, that you never had time to really explore before.

Being interviewed by Lex Fridman from MIT, he made a very clear statement on the challenges capitalismand society is facing.", "I think hyper-capitalism is going to have to be coupled to hyper-socialism", "Remember that capitalism was a result of the first industrial revolution beginning at the end of the 18thcentury. 4IR calls for major changes, maybe even a whole new system. This raises two questions; What should this new system be?
