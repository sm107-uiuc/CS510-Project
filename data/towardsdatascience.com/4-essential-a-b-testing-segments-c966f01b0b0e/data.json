In the end, this is coming back to our original advice about how to avoid disaster when rolling out any kind of machine learning system.", "In short, it\u2019s good to think about your user base and specific segments that could influence your ML system (pre or post-deployment, but in this context, we\u2019re more focused on post-deployment). Fast.ai does a great job of explaining how various user segments could influence your overall ML system. If we think about it \u2014 if we\u2019re using an A/B test to evaluate our ML system, then this idea also applies to A/B testing. So, it\u2019s important that we think about ways our A/B test could go awry.", "A couple of years ago I saw a great presentation on A/B testing. The presentation introduced 4 segments to watch when doing A/B testing. My boss (at the time) and I used this terminology at work and found it very insightful.", "Fast forward to today, and I can\u2019t find the original lecture anywhere lol. So I thought I would write an article on the subject (for myself and for others). Again, I would reference the original lecture (might have been by Uber), if I could find it :-/.", "So what are these magical segments we should consider?", "Here they are, in all their glory. I tried my best to remember the original segment names, but failed, so I created new names. The principles should still hold. Okay, so below I\u2019ve given more details on how to interpret the graphic.", "Say you own Diapers.com, an online retailer of the world's best diapers. Your customers need to register for an account before they can go off and buy all the diapers they wish. Since your site has no guest checkout, you know who your customers are, what they buy, and what they don\u2019t buy. You want to test out a new look for your checkout page. You\u2019d like to see if a new background color could boost sales. You have your usual checkout page that has a light red background color, which we\u2019ll call our \u2018red\u2019 view. You\u2019d like to introduce a new light blue background view that we\u2019ll call our new \u2018blue\u2019 view. Our hope is that the new \u2018blue\u2019 checkout view will help increase sales.", "The customers that bought less when you had the \u2018red\u2019 page, but buy more with the new \u2018blue\u2019 page \u2014 these are your \u2018Influenced!\u2019 customers. These customers love your new checkout background color!", "Those that bought a lot with the \u2018red\u2019 page, and still buy a lot with the new \u2018blue\u2019 page \u2014 these are your \u2018Adopters\u2019. These customers buy diapers regardless of any website changes you make.", "Those that didn\u2019t buy much before, and still don\u2019t buy a lot with your new \u2018blue\u2019 page \u2014 these are your \u2018Haters\u2019. These customers hardly buy diapers regardless of any website changes you make.", "And finally, those that used to buy a lot, but now they buy less with your new \u2018blue\u2019 page \u2014 these are your \u2018Disrupted!\u2019 customers. These customers used to buy a lot of diapers, but your new background color has caused them to buy fewer diapers! Whoops!", "So what\u2019s the big deal? Well, you could do your A/B test, aggregate your results over all your customers, and report your findings. In fact, this is something you should do. But, what if you find that your A/B test hardly made a difference in your population? You could end up throwing out a perfectly good feature that some users really love. Aggregating your A/B test results over all your customers (in your test population) is something you should do, but it shouldn\u2019t be the only thing you do.", "Since the \u2018haters\u2019 and \u2018adopters\u2019 were unaffected by your experiment, maybe you should remove them from your A/B test results (or at least have a version of your results with these groups excluded). Why? Well, including these customers in your results is adding a lot of noise to your results, and thus drowning out your true impact on the business.", "Are you able to identify the \u2018disrupted\u2019 segment? If so, you could possibly turn that feature off for those customers. Why take away a feature from your \u2018influenced!\u2019 customers love when you don\u2019t have to? Maybe you can customize each customer's experience? Why throw something out that could make you money?", "In addition, you could review these segments at a macro and/or a micro-level. For example, you could segment your customers over many experiments. Or, you could segment your customers for just one experiment. Either way, there is new information to be gained. What makes this segmentation work so great is that it gives you a better understanding of both your experiment performance and your customer base. Which customers are dragging their feet? Which customers love everything you do? There is a lot to be gained by breaking down your A/B test results.", "That's it!
