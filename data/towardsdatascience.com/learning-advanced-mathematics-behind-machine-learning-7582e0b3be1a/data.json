Therefore, it is imperative to have a good grasp of mathematics to understand machine learning. While most of the data scientists are aware of basic mathematical concepts such as Linear Algebra, Statistics, etc. but many of them are not aware of some deep mathematical concepts that can help them have a clearer understanding of how an algorithm works or allow them to understand the latest research in machine learning.", "In this article, I have shared resources for advanced mathematics courses, which help machine learning. The topics discussed in this article are Convex and Non-Convex Optimization, Information Theory, Probabilistic Graphical Models, etc.", "The list of resources is given so that it assumes the reader\u2019s familiarity with basic concepts such as Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Multivariable Calculus, and Multivariate Statistics. It is vital to understand these essential topics to understand the material presented in the advanced courses present in this article.", "I have also written another article on these topics which can act as a predecessor for this article. Feel free to check it out!", "The resources in this article can be used to start a Ph.D. degree, where a thorough understanding of mathematical concepts relating to the research topic is expected from a student.", "The plan is mainly divided into the following parts:-", "The list is never-ending, but the following four topics I have discussed here are essential in machine learning and highly transferrable to other engineering fields.", "Most of the methods in Machine Learning are based on finding the optimal parameters that minimize some objective function such as Binary Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error, etc. Due to this fact, most of the machine learning problems can be treated as optimization problems. Using Convex Optimization, some machine learning algorithms makes analysis simple and ensure the uniqueness of the solution. Convex optimization is used in many engineering fields and is one of the fundamental topics of any engineering degree.", "The most classic book to learn the topic is the Convex Optimization Book by Dr. Stephen Boyd and Dr. Lieven Vanderberghe. There are also very great lectures offered at different universities around the world. Some of them are listed as follows:", "Probabilistic Graphical Models provides a mathematical way to encode the probabilistic relationship between random variables in graphs. Generally, the nodes in the graph are the variables, and edges encode the probabilistic independence or dependence between them. In most of modern machine learning research, many machine learning models are defined with graphical models. This method is used to describe the structure of the probabilistic inference underlying the model. It is also used in other fields such as Biology, Finance, etc.", "Probabilistic Graphical Models by Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman is the standard book for learning PGMs. In addition to the book, there are some beautiful courses on PGMs listed as follows:", "Non-convex is a relatively new field compared to convex optimization and is of utmost importance in algorithms such as Neural Networks. Using convex optimization techniques for solving non-convex problems results in local optima rather than global optima, which is one of the biggest problems in deep learning models. Non-convex problems have many feasible and very flat regions, widely varying curvature, several saddle points in each region.", "There are few adequate resources available for non-convex optimization since it is not an established field and still an active research area. The best reading resource is \u201cNon-convex optimization for machine learning\u201d by Dr. Prateek Jain and Dr. Purushottam Kar. There isn\u2019t any course that covers non-convex optimization in great detail. The best video resources are the talks given at the NIPS 2015 workshop on Non-convex optimization.", "Information theory has a solid relationship with machine learning. Cross-entropy loss used in many machine learning algorithms is a direct application of information theory. Decision Trees also uses concepts of Information Theory such as Entropy, Mutual Information, etc. to split nodes in the tree data structure. Information Theory is also used in Data Compression, Signal Processing, Information Retrieval, Data Mining, etc.", "The classic book for learning Information Theory is \u201cInformation Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms\u201d by David MacKay. In addition to the book, the author has a course named \u201cInformation Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks\u201d at the University of Cambridge, and lectures are available on YouTube.", "After completing the courses mentioned above, you can try to learn more courses in mathematics related to machine learning. For example, Measure Theory, Tensor Algebra, Mathematical Modelling, etc. are such other topics.", "Other than the courses, you can now pick any theoretical machine learning paper presented at a top conference such as NIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc. and read and try to reproduce the results of the paper. The learning from this plan can also be used to start your research at any company or start a Ph.D. degree.", "Your home for data science.
