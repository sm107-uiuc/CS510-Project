All aspects of life begin to be combined with this term. Starting from the financial sector to the automotive field, it certainly will not be separated from AI.", "One method that is developing rapidly as AI develops is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). From the beginning of the development of AI to the development of deep learning today, ANN has a part in them. So it is not surprising that this method is one of the most influential methods for the development of AI.", "But why is this method so influential in the development of AI? Why is this term so popular? And what is the Artificial Neural Network? In this article, we will answer that question.", "Artificial Neural Network is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that adopts the workings of the human brain in processing a combination of stimuli into an output.", "An important part of ANN is Neurons. Like the human brain consisting of many brain cells, ANN also consists of a collection of neurons that are interconnected. Inside the neuron, there is the stimulus receiver, stimulus processor, and the output part. The output produces information that can later be transmitted to other neurons.", "ANN is very popular because it can solve complex problems that are difficult to be solved by other methods. This method also became the forerunner to the development of Deep Learning, which is one of the sub-fields of Machine Learning that focuses on Artificial Neural Networks that have multiple and deep layer structures. If you haven\u2019t read my article about deep learning, you can check the link below.", "As explained in the previous section, ANN has one part called neurons. In general, ANN has three neurons, namely input neuron, neuron hidden, and output neuron.", "In hidden neuron and output neurons, there is a function used to generate output from the previous neuron. This function is called the activation function. The output of neurons can be passed on which will later become an input for further neurons.", "The output of ANN is a value that represents the prediction of a variable being sought. The next important part of ANN is the weight. Weights are used as input multipliers that will enter a neuron. Each neuron that is connected to each other will have their own weights. Each neuron can be added biased, which is a constant number added to the neuron input.", "In addition, there is also a layer. A layer consists of one or more neurons. There are three layers in ANN, namely the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. If the structure only has input and output layers, it is called the single-layer perceptron.", "Meanwhile, if it has at least 1 layer (hidden layer) between the input and output layers, then it is called Multilayer Perceptron.", "If the Multilayer Perceptron has many hidden layers, it is called a Deep Neural Network. In this article we only focused on Multilayer Perceptron (1 hidden layer).", "As explained earlier, ANN can make predictions and classifications by studying the data patterns that have been provided. The more data provided, the more patterns can be learned by this method. In general, there are two main processes in the Neural Network that are commonly used, namely feedforward and backpropagation.", "Feedforward is an algorithm for calculating output values \u200b\u200bbased on input values, while backpropagation is an algorithm for training neural networks (changing weights) based on errors obtained from output values.", "The learning process in a neural network begins with initiating the value of the weight, learning rate, and epoch. We also have to determine the number of input neurons, hidden neurons, and output neurons. Epoch is an iteration in ANN. We can determine the number of iterations in the learning process, if it reaches a certain iteration, the learning process will stop. We can also determine the minimum error value to stop the learning process.", "Learning rate is a value to determine the speed of learning, the greater the value of learning rate, the faster the machine is learning, but it will be difficult to get optimum results, conversely, the smaller the learning rate the slower the machine is learning, but the greater the possibility of getting optimum results.", "The feedforward process is focused on finding the output of the system that has been built with predetermined parameters. The results of these outputs will be compared with predetermined targets. Let\u2019s look at the following illustration.", "The illustration above is an example of using a single layer perceptron. x1 and x2 are the input data we use, while w1 and w2 are weighting. Usually, the weight value is determined randomly [-1\u20261]. The process for calculating the output is as follows.", "For example, we have the values \u200b\u200bof x1 and x2 respectively 1 and 0, and the values \u200b\u200bof w1 and w2 are 0.25 and 0.75, respectively. Then the calculation is like this x1 * w1 + x2 * w2 = 1 * 0.25 + 0 * 0.75 = 0.25. Then, the value is entered into the activation function. The activation function that we will use here is the sigmoid function. By using the sigmoid function the result is 0.56.", "So what if the structure consists of 3 layers, namely the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer? Basically the same. The value of the activation function above will be the value for the hidden layer which will be forwarded to the output layer. For more details, let\u2019s look at the following illustration.", "After we get the value for the output layer, the next process is to get the error value from the output layer. This error value will later become a parameter to change the weight value. To calculate errors there are also many methods such as MSE (Mean Squared Error), SSE (Sum of Squared Error), etc.", "Backpropagation focuses on updating and evaluating the parameters (weights) used in feedforward. The weight value will be changed according to the error value obtained. Error value obtained from Target value \u2014 output value.", "Weight renewal usually uses an optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm used in ANN varies, such as Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation), RMSProp, Gradient Descent, etc.", "For more details on backpropagation calculations, you can see videos from 3Blue1Brown.", "After we update the previous weight, we have completed one iteration. The next step is to enter the second iteration by repeating the feedforward process. This process will continue to repeat until the stop conditions that we specify before.", "After the training process is deemed sufficient, the ANN model can be used for the classification process. The way to do classification is similar to the feedforward process where the data entered will be processed on neurons in ANN by means of weight multiplication. the difference in weight multiplication here with feedforward is, the weight used is the best weight obtained in the training process. When the process is in the output layer, the output obtained is a decimal number for each neuron which will be transformed into a predictive class label from the system.", "After seeing the structure and learning process on ANN, many questions might arise. What is the most appropriate structure for ANN to get good performance? what other parameters can be used to improve system performance? what is the optimum number of neurons used? etc. All of these questions will be answered if we have carried out trial and error experiments on the structure and parameters for the cases and datasets that we have. Each dataset will have different optimum parameters and structures.", "This article is the result of collaboration with Naufal Dzaky Anwari, if you speak Indonesian and want to read the Indonesian language version, please visit this link.", "Your home for data science.
