Below, we will look at a split in three in analogy to three types of interactions people have with music.", "The great wave of machine learning open-source software, online courses, and cloud-based tools allow the newcomers not to worry about the specifics of ML pipelines.", "The availability of off-the-shelf tools is a blessing and a curse in the world of ML. That is because while there are easiness and accessibility with which inexperienced users can benefit from machine learning, it is safe to assume some of them don\u2019t really know much of what they are doing nor understand. Jumping into the wrong conclusions about their data/model is, thus, very common.", "These are called listeners because just like in the case of music, the users are able to choose different types of algorithms, discern between the surface differences between them and benefit from their usage.", "Compared to the listeners, the artists are courageous enough to plug and play different methods and analyses into the pipeline. Very important for this category is how well they master the math behind the tools used. They don\u2019t really go very deep into the bits and pieces of the methods used but have a good understanding of what is the mechanism behind and what needs to be tweaked to improve the performance of their model.", "These are called artists because just like a violin singer where highly skilled practitioners can bring their instrument to life and excite an audience, they can spice things up a little in their ML practice.", "You can listen and have fun. You can play the violin and be great at that. But it may be that creating your own pieces of music is not something very accessible. Same for ML practitioners.", "are what fall under the category of composers. Not only that they enjoy \u201clistening to music\u201d, \u201cplaying\u201d it perfectly, but they also \u201ccomposed\u201d masterpieces.", "Chances are, you may not be a composer now, but with discipline and passion you can do it.", "This is a pamphlet and should be treated as such. It does not really matter what type of ML practitioner you are if you love what you\u2019re doing and your work provides values.", "If you like my work, consider reading other posts of mine:", "Your home for data science.
