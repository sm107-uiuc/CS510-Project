With the use of sector ETFs, I aim to mimic hedge funds\u2019 risk/return profiles in sector allocation, but enjoy the benefits of using highly liquid assets with low costs. A sector rotation strategy allows investors to capture returns from different stages of the market cycle while diversifying their holdings by putting more (less) weight into sectors that are rising (falling). Sector ETFs provide a cheap vehicle to invest in hundreds of stocks across different sectors.", "The strategy is to train a model to predict future returns of 11 ETFs representing each sector by using the past sector allocation of the biggest hedge funds based on their latest 13F stock filings. The expected returns over a test period will then be used in a mean-variance optimisation to obtain optimal weights to put in each sector. The weights will then be allocated into investing in the 11 sector ETFs.", "Form 13F is a quarterly report filed to the U.S. SEC by institutional investment managers with over $100M AUM, listing all equity assets under management. The form is required to be filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter, and it provides a lagging snapshot of hedge fund holdings which will be used in a model to predict future sector ETF returns. While there are data vendors that specialise in providing quality filing data, I went with the free but dirty way of scraping all the holdings of the top hedge funds from the SEC records.", "Mapping CUSIP to ticker allows us to query the sector for each stock. I do not have access to any paid services so I used SEC\u2019s Fail-to-Deliver data which contains the CUSIP and ticker SYMBOL columns. I created a mapping table with the historic fails data and supplemented it by querying the CUSIP (e.g. 00206R102) and scraping the SYMBOL (e.g. T) from Investing.com.", "Now that we have the ticker for each stock, we can add a SECTOR column to the mapping table by querying the ticker and scraping the sector from Yahoo Finance. I supplemented it with searches on marketbeat.com.", "I aggregated the value of holdings for each sector based on my mapping table and it is important to note that I have excluded stocks which I cannot find the sectors for in Yahoo Finance & marketbeat.com. Therefore, the quality of the result is only as good as the input data and the mapping used. I took 13 of the top HFs by AUM but we could definitely research more into finding the significant U.S equity movers.", "The filings go back to as early as 1998 but we are limited by the range of sector ETF prices.", "I used the yfinance API to pull prices of the largest ETF for each sector that has lasted since 2000. At a risk-free rate of 0.02, I calculated the annualised holding period excess return for each ETF where the period is determined by:", "The idea is to train a predictive model for each HF, where the inputs are the HF\u2019s sector allocation for the last quarter, and the outputs are the sector ETFs\u2019 holding period excess returns.", "The base-model is a multi-variate multi-input Random Forest Regressor that is able to incorporate the relationship between the dependent variables (sector alphas). The meta-model is a bagging of the predicted outputs from each of the 13 HF\u2019s model to predict the final output. Since some funds started after year 2000, each of the 13 HF\u2019s model has a different training start date which ranges from 2000Q2 to 2006Q4, and end date on 2015Q4. Therefore, the training period ranges from 37 to 60 quarters. The test period is consistent for all 13 HF\u2019s model from 2016Q1 to 2019Q4 (16 quarters). The overall bagging model predicts the alphas for the out-of-sample test period.", "I wanted to use state-space / mixed models to account for the nested structure of sector holdings within each HF but the sample size is too small for such a high parameter space. The bagging approach assumes an equal impact of each HF\u2019s sector rotations on the market instead. While we are unable to front-run or invest together with the HFs, we could attempt to predict the delayed impact of the market in response to their allocation. The big assumption is that the market is slow to react to the HFs\u2019 sector rotations and their movements are large enough to influence the market.", "The overall alphas for Test Quarters x Sector ETFs are then fed into a mean-variance optimisation to get the optimal weights for each sector.", "Weights allocated to each sector ETF:", "The allocated weights are then tested in a hold-out set for the latest quarter reported (2020Q1) vs an equal allocation of weights across all sectors.", "Although it performed slightly better than an equal weighting by reducing risk and improving return, it is clear that the strategy was still heavily exposed to the risk of an overall US equity market downturn. The sector ETFs\u2019 historical returns seem to be highly correlated with each other in the plots above as well.", "Provided the model is precise enough, the question of whether hedge fund returns can be replicated successfully can be attributed to market risk factors (beta) vs the fund\u2019s edge (alpha). Nonetheless, returns are notoriously hard to predict especially when our alpha may be lost in time and is of rather poor quality due to the data and robustness of the models.", "Your home for data science.
