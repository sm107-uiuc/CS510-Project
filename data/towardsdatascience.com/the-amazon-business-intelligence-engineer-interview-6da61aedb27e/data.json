Data on every customer interaction is gathered and analyzed\u2013 from the discovery of a product, to its purchase, and even to its eventual delivery. To refine site performance and improve customer experiences, Amazon feeds this data into its recommendation system, which displays the most relevant products for each customer.", "The process of creating a personalized screen of recommendations extends to all of Amazon\u2019s products and services, including Alexa, Prime Video, and Twitch. Business intelligence engineers translate the large data warehouse at Amazon into meaningful insights and improvements. At Amazon, data drives every decision.", "At Amazon, the Business Intelligence Engineers work in tandem with clients, analysts, and database developers to translate collected data into business decisions. The solutions created by these engineers assist in the analysis, automation, and reporting of both internal and external client data.", "Frequently, Amazon engineers are embedded within teams and work cross-functionally with other teams, aiming to improve overall customer experience. The roles of this position range from implementing solutions through data modeling to providing guidance to business leaders.", "Amazon is large enough to boast of over 40 departments with more than 100 internal teams within these departments. Therefore, it is crucial for Amazon to efficiently process and analyze the huge amounts of corporate data it receives. Business Intelligence Engineers design software and corporate platforms to do exactly this, thereby making it easier to draw meaningful conclusions from Amazon\u2019s collected data. They work within teams and alongside Amazon\u2019s internal clients to provide accurate and accessible data that supports critical business processes.", "Based on the teams assigned to, Business Intelligence Engineers may perform functions such as:", "The Amazon business intelligence interview is similar to most other technical interviews at Amazon, consisting of two initial phone interviews followed by an onsite interview.", "The initial screen is mostly a discovery interview to find out if you are a good fit for the culture and the company. The interviewer will ask you questions about your background and experience. You must be ready to discuss your past relevant projects with the interviewer. Tell them about any challenges, unique situations or problems you faced and how you overcame them.", "The technical will be conducted via a live coding platform. The interview tests for SQL and Python skills. Expect around five SQL problems that will steadily increase in difficulty.", "Example SQL Question: Write a query to identify the manager with the biggest team size.", "Here\u2019s a hint: This question is relatively straightforward. We\u2019re given two tables and asked to find the manager team with the largest number of employees.", "There are actually a couple of ways we could do this. Method one involves using the MAX function and method two (which is the path we chose to follow) involves creating a sorted list grouped by the manager name.", "We chose method two because it takes advantage of the most basic aspects of SQL to produce an elegant solution to the problem at hand.", "This is the last interview stage and comprises of 5 one-on-one interview rounds with business intelligence engineers, data scientists, and a hiring manager. Each interview round lasts approximately 45 minutes with a lunch break in-between.", "Questions in this interview span across the breadth of data science concepts and are scenario-based (with real Amazon problems). Each interview round has one form of behavioral question and you can expect a lot of \u201cTell me about a time\u2026\u201d questions.", "Overall, the onsite interview is broken down into:", "The Amazon BI interview process is designed to learn candidates ability to leverage data warehouse information and advanced analytics tools to turn data into meaningful information that can be used to make sound business decisions. This interview is a combination of various data science theories and it tests the depth of your domain knowledge as it applies to real-life situations.", "Brush up on your knowledge of statistics and probability, SQL and ETL processes, and Business Intelligence solution platforms, such as Tableau, MicroDesktop, SQL SSIS and AWS.", "Also, note that Amazon asks situation-based questions and it will help to form your responses around the \u201cSTAR\u201d format. It will also help to be familiar with Amazon\u2019s 14 leadership principles and have a story based around these leadership principles.", "Here\u2019s an example, recently featured in The Guardian, of what it sounds like when applying the STAR Method in the interview:", "Situation: \u201cA customer rang up complaining that they\u2019d waited more than two weeks for a reply from our sales team regarding a product query.\u201d", "Task: \u201cI needed to address the client\u2019s immediate query and find out what went wrong in the normal process.\u201d", "Activity: \u201cI apologized, got the details and passed them to our head salesperson, who contacted the client within the hour. I investigated why the query hadn\u2019t been answered. I discovered that it was a combination of a wrong mobile number and a generic email address that wasn\u2019t being checked. I let the client know and we offered a goodwill discount on her next order.\u201d", "Result: \u201cThe client not only continued to order from us but posted a positive customer service tweet.\u201d", "Your home for data science.
