The eyes of the world are watching as we move towards the final decision of who will face off against President Donald Trump. It\u2019s been a crowded field but over the last week, it has gotten decidedly less so. Emotions are running high; it has been a contentious primary season so far with many candidates garnering passionate supporters who may be feeling angry or let down by the rest of the party. At the start of last week, there were around 8 candidates running (to be honest it\u2019s been hard to keep track) and now on the other side of Super Tuesday, it\u2019s looking like we may be down to a final two. With emotions in the party charged I decided to take a look at the language being used by the candidates and those who interact with them through the lens of Twitter over this last week.", "The data used for this analysis was streamed from Twitter starting on February 24th and leading up to March 3rd (Super Tuesday). Tweets were gathered which fulfilled the following requirements:", "The tweets were stored in a network database (Neo4J), processed/cleaned with RegEx and NLTK (Python\u2019s Natural Language Toolkit) and then visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The sentiment of each tweet was calculated with VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary sEntiment Reasoner). In total 753 tweets from the candidates and ~94,000 tweets about the candidates were looked at. The breakdown of those counts are shown below.", "Sentiment can be thought of as a measure of the emotional content of text: the more positive the number the more positive the emotion, and the more negative the number the more negative the emotion. Sentiment is measured by VADER on a scale from -1 to 1. In my experience working with text from Twitter, a sentiment of 0 occurs often not only to denote a neutral value (potentially meaning as many positive words as negative words) but also to denote objective text (pure delivery of information without an associated emotion).", "The visualization above plots the sentiment of each tweet grouped by the candidate\u2019s username on Twitter. The boxplot calculates summary statistics on their overall sentiment with the outermost prongs denoting their extreme values (lowest and highest) and the inner highlighted box capturing the middle 50% of values for their sentiment. The bar that cuts through the highlighted box marks the middle value (in our case the median).", "Notably, from the image we can get a sense of how often the candidates are using Twitter to broadcast their message or garner support. It\u2019s likely not a coincidence that the 4 candidates that remained in the race as contenders for Super Tuesday top the list based on the number of tweets they\u2019ve sent out. Additionally I\u2019ve noted the two tweets with the most extreme values from the sentiment (Bernie had the most negative tweet and Biden the most positive). From these tweets we see that the sentiment analysis is picking up on emotionally charged words like: bankrupt, crime, debt, honored, friend, and happy.", "It\u2019s important to recognize here that negative and positive does not necessarily translate to just sad/depressing and happy/motivating. Negative can mean righteous anger, and positive can mean congratulatory. It\u2019s an important caveat to remember as we continue to approximate and aggregate the emotional content of language.", "Looking at the tweets of the 4 major candidates from Super Tuesday in aggregate gives us a sense of when they are most active (the time zone used is EST and each quadrant represents 6 hours of the day). Additionally the cluster of neutral tweets in the afternoon suggests a common time to make announcements or post updates.", "As noted earlier there were many more tweets about the candidates than there were from the candidates themselves, and above we are taking a look at a sample of tweets from regular users. The relative volumes have been maintained and appear to match up with a few exceptions. Interestingly the progressive candidates appear to garner significantly more engagement on Twitter than the moderates, which could speak to an inherent bias in looking at people that are active on Twitter (i.e a skewed demographic that could skew more liberal or younger than the general population). In particular the amount that Bernie is mentioned in tweets far exceed any of the other candidates (note: he has the same number of tweets about him as the next three candidates combined).", "We have a sense now for some of the emotions contained in these tweets, but what are people actually saying? In an election our voices are heard in the vote that we cast for one candidate over any of the others. Our votes are then aggregated and diffused over the actions of delegates that act on our behalf (generally, don\u2019t @ me). There is a fair amount of procedure that occurs in the translation of our voice into the action of choosing a candidate. But today we can look directly at the chorus of voices digitally engaging in the process of electioneering. This word cloud visualizes the frequency of words across all of the tweets by these people. The larger the word the more prevalent it is in the vocabulary of all users. It is an aggregate snapshot of the conversation happening around the primary.", "Above we take a look at the most frequent words broken down by the 4 major candidates on Super Tuesday as well as in aggregate (top-middle). I left the candidate names in the analysis instead of filtering them out as a stop word to get a sense for how often a tweet may have referenced one with regard to another. Again we see how Bernie seems to dominate the center of focus on Twitter. In looking at some of the words that appear I feel compelled to point out that \u201cman\u201d does not appear on the most frequent words for any of the male candidate\u2019s but \u201cwoman\u201d does for the only major female candidate left in the race. This does not prove an underlying misogyny or bias but I hope it is cause for reflection on how we and the media have treated and covered each of the candidates throughout this process.", "I hope this preliminary analysis has provided some insight into the days leading up to Super Tuesday. In terms of the data gathered we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of the national conversation or how communities on Twitter are engaging with the candidates. Next steps could include:", "Suggestions and discussion welcome!
