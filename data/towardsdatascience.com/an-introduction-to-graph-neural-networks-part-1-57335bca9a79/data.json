This is due to their ability to learn from graph data efficiently. There is an intricate and cohesive network connection behind most systems that defines the interaction between the network components. This interaction can be represented as a graph. To model these systems, it is essential to understand the network behind them. Graph Neural Networks help us take advantage of the network's relational structure to model it better and predict the outcome.", "A graph is a structured non-linear datatype with nodes(also called vertices) and edges. It is mathematically represented as G(V, E). For example, a molecule of NO\u2082 can be considered a graph where the nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms are considered the node, and the bonds between the atoms are considered to be edges. Another example of a graph can be your family, where each person is a node, and the relationship between two people is the edge.", "A graph can have labels on both its nodes and edges. It can either be numerical or textual. Each node will have some features that define the node. In a graph of NO\u2082, elements like the atomic number, atomic weight, and the number of valency electrons of each node can be its respective features. The edges might or might not have features depending on the type of graph. In NO\u2082, the edges' features can be the bond strength, bond type(single bond or double bond), etc.", "Graphs are classified on many different bases. The most common one is based on the edges of the graph. These are directed and undirected graphs. In a directed graph, the edges from one node to another are directional, while in an undirected graph, the nodes are connected through edges, and no direction is present.", "A practical example of a directed graph is Instagram. When you follow someone, they don't necessarily follow you back. In a sense, this is unidirectional. On the other hand, Facebook friend requests are an example of an undirected graph. Once the friend request is accepted, both of you can see each other\u2019s content.", "Why can convolutions not be applied to graphs?", "Images have a fixed size and grid-based structure data with a defined spatial locality. On the other hand, graphs have arbitrary sizes, complex topology, and a non-euclidean structure. It also does not have a fixed node order. As we all know, neural networks are defined for specific sizes, grids, and structures. Thus convolutions cannot be directly applied to graphs.", "I\u2019ll write about transforming the graphs into matrices like the Adjacency matrix, Incidence matrix, Degree matrix, and Laplacian matrix in the upcoming blogs. Further, I\u2019ll discuss different approaches to using convolutions on graphs and their advantages and disadvantages, creating a node embedding of the graph, and forward propagation in GNN.", "Your home for data science.
