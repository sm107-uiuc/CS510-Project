One of the main pain points I found dealing with graphs was visualizing the network, the node properties and edges in a neat, visually appealing way. The default plotting options are built on Matplotlib, which is well, let\u2019s just say sub-optimal for this type of visualization.", "Instead of playing around with the Matplotlib axes API, manually customizing the graph or creating a one off function, I wanted something a little bit more robust, easier to use out of the box, visually appealing and neat while maximizing the possible amount of information that can be displayed on the graph.", "In comes my favorite visualization library Plotly. Plotly already had some documentation on how to visualize graphs, but it was still a fairly lengthy process and only documented for non directed graphs. The goal was to find (or create) a uniform API that follows the .plot standard, with some customization for graphs. Hence, why I made this package called Interactive Graph Visualizations (igviz).", "Note: Currently, only Networkx is supported but the next step is expanding it to Apache\u2019s Graphx.", "To view the interactivity of any of the plots, you can view them here.", "To install run pip install igviz", "Create a random graph for demonstration purposes and assign every node a property called prop and make the value 12.", "By default, the nodes are sized and coloured by the degree of itself. The degree of a node is just the number of edge\u2019s (lines connecting 2 nodes) it has. You can see the degree of the node by hovering over it!", "Note: This also works with Directed and Multigraphs. Directed Graphs will show the arrows from node to node.", "Tip: When it comes to customizability, you can change the how the nodes are sized (size_method) to either be static, based off a node\u2019s property or your own custom sizing method.", "Tip: The color\u2019s can be changed (color_method) to be a static color (hex, plain text, etc.), based off a node\u2019s property or your own custom color method.", "There are more options, and more to come, but those are the ones that greatly impact the visualization and information of your graph.", "Here all the nodes are set to the same size and the colour is set to a light red while displaying the prop property on hover.", "Tip: To display Node\u2019s properties when you hover it, specify a list for the node_text parameter of node properties you want to have displayed. By default only degree is shown.", "Tip: If you want to display edge properties when you hover over an edge, add show_edgetext=True when calling ig.plot!", "Here, the sizing and color method is based on the prop property of every node as well as we're displaying the prop property on hover.", "To add your own sizing and color methods, pass in a list of a color or size pertaining to each node in the graph to the size_method and color_method parameters.", "Tip: To change the colorscale, change the colorscale parameter!", "You can change the way your graph is organized and laid out by specifying a type of layout. Networkx comes with predefined layouts to use and we can apply them through layout.", "By default, igviz looks for the pos node property and if it doesn't exist it will default to a random layout.", "To add your own pos property you can set it via the nx.set_node_attributes function.", "I encourage all feedback about this post or Igviz. You can e-mail me at sidhuashton@gmail.com or leave a comment on the post.", "If you like the project please give it a star as well as follow me on Twitter for more updates!", "Any bug or feature requests, please create an issue on the Github repo.
