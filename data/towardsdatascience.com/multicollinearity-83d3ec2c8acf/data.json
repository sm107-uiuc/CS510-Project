In this short article, I would like to address what multicollinearity is, why it is a problem, how to measure it and how to treat it once discovered.", "Multicollinearity exists when one or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This, of course, is a violation of one of the assumptions that must be met in multiple linear regression (MLR) problems. One of the factors affecting the standard error of the regression coefficient is the interdependence between independent variable in the MLR problem.", "Suppose we have a dataset to predict the price of round cut diamonds. The target variable is the price. The predictors are carat, cut, color, clarity, x, y and z. The variables x, y and z represent internal measurements across the diameter of the diamond.", "The ordinal categorical variables cut, color and clarity are label encoded so they can be used in the linear regression model. A correlation matrix allows us to see the Pearson correlation coefficient between each variable in the dataset. Interestingly, we are able to see that there is a strong linear relationship between carat and x, y and z. This dataset is highly suspicious of having multicollinearity amongst these variables.", "This poses a problem when the correlation between variables becomes higher. As the degree of collinearity increases, so does the size and volatility of the regression coefficient. This leads to higher sample to sample variability. This renders the variable in question unreliable as a predictor in a regression equation. The confidence interval of the coefficient in question becomes very large and this makes rejection of any null hypothesis near impossible. As the research question is in the alternate hypothesis, our chance of getting to it is hindered by lack of statistical significance of the regression coefficient.", "If multicollinearity is suspected, it can be checked for using variance inflation factor (VIF). For a moment, the dependent variable is removed from the picture. Each independent variable is regressed against all other independent variables. The resultant R\u00b2 value is used to represent VIF mathematically as shown in the following equation:", "What this means it that as variables are truly independent of each other, R\u00b2 will be very small and the equation tends towards 1. A VIF of 1 would indicate complete independence from any other variable. This is one of the assumptions in a multiple regression model. A VIF between 5 and 10 indicate a very high levels of collinearity. This corresponds with R\u00b2 values of 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. General practice states that anything with a score > 10, must be excluded. The closer to 1, the more ideal the scenario for predictive modeling.", "In python, we are but a couple of modules away from easily assessing this. Considering the diamond dataset, we have a multiple linear regression problem with 7 independent variables and 1 dependent variable. We regress each independent variable against each other and determine a VIF score. We use the dmatrices function to create design matrices.", "For ease of visualization, I put VIF in a dataframe object.", "Such high VIF scores confirm the suspicion! The variables x, y and z are highly correlated with carat. In this case, these variables are dropped from the MLR model. However, there are various ways that we can deal with multicollinearity.", "Ultimately, some form of dimensionality reduction will have to take place to address the problem of multicollinearity.", "As you can see, multicollinearity does not have to be a problem. Once identified, you are equipped to manage it and keep it at bay.", "The data in this article are based on a github repostiory.", "Please connect with me on Linked In!", "Your home for data science.
