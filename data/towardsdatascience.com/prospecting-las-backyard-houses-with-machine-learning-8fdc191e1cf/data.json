However, some are rented out as passive income especially for young families or aging elderly. I want to find out where these houses will make a good amount of money.", "The homeowner would simply enter their address:", "And be output their potential backyard house\u2019s expected nightly income, unit type and capacity:", "To make this prediction, I first built a model that predicted the income of a property. I then built a database of properties that could feasibly accommodate a backyard house of any size. I then used transfer learning to plug my backyard house database into my price prediction model to obtain each property\u2019s predicted nightly income of their potential backyard house.", "The following goes in to detail about the data pipeline.", "Part 1: Build Model to Predict Nightly Income", "I used AirBnB LA data as a proxy for income. This dataset had about 100 features, and I selected the most important amenities as well as the location and size details. I also limited my dataset to super-host status to ensure the quality of my target feature: nightly prices.", "To assess location quality, I compared the property\u2019s proximity to various geographic feature datasets \u2014 including cultural attractions, transit consisting of entrances to metro stations and highways, parks, and most importantly, the nearest median home sale prices.", "On average, houses are $142/night and my model was off by $51.", "Part 2: Generate Potential Backyard House Database", "To identify potential backyard houses, I used lot data from the LA County Assessor\u2019s office which provided the address, coordinates, lot area and the area of the main house on the property.", "In order to find which properties could accommodate a backyard house and how big that house could be, I processed the lot data with respect to LA municipal backyard house building code. The code defines 5\u2019 setbacks from property lines, and 10\u2019 setbacks from the existing house, limits the entire build-able area of a plot to 50%, and sets as the backyard house maximum square footage to be the lessor of 1200 square feet or half of the area of the main house.", "I identified 1.6 million lots that could legally build backyard houses of one to three bedrooms depending on their maximum size.", "Those lots created my backyard house database, which consisted of the look-up address, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the location in terms of latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. I plugged this backyard house database into my model to predict their incomes.", "I used the model to identify which backyard houses would make more income. I found that houses that were more dense, had more bathrooms, and were rare, had more value. I had engineered the density and rarity features.", "The density feature favored properties that claimed they could accommodate a lot of people, and actually provided a lot of space for those people evidenced by the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The number of bathrooms is raw data that is inherently indicative of capacity, but also the year built as older houses tend to have less bathrooms. The rarity feature preferenced properties in a high value location \u2014 determined by the nearest median home sales price, and if they were unique for that location \u2014 determined by the number of properties with the same number of bedrooms available for rent in that neighborhood.", "For an individual in a high value neighborhood with space to accommodate a large unit, the gains for renting out your backyard will be higher. For an individual in a less desire-able neighborhood with less space, your gains will be lower. However, there will still be quantifiable gains.", "Using our backyard house database and visualizing it over LA with Tableau, we can identify three distinct segments of the potential backyard house market \u2014 high, medium, and low value.", "Many different start-ups have entered the backyard house building space and could find use in this dataset. Typically, the backyard house project lifecycle has several phases from initial financing to ultimately renting it out. While an individual architect would offer a very specific design covering only a portion of the life-cycle at a highly variable price, startups entering the space are streamlining the building process and offering prices upfront. For example, Cover is geared towards producing a high-end backyard house with minimal effort by the homeowner, offering 3 custom designs of their factory built houses within 3 days, inclusive of all expertise for feasibility, design, and building. Whereas La M\u00e1s caters to homeowners without capital, and offers end-to-end funding, in addition to the design and building of a backyard house in exchange for a minimum 5 year commitment to rent to a homeless person or a Section 8 housing voucher holder.", "For a start-up like COVER, this area dense with higher value properties would be a good market to focus on. For a non-profit start-up like La M\u00e1s, this area dense with lower value properties will be a good market to focus on. 1. Lastly, the medium value properties fall somewhere in between and are a toss-up. These may be a good market for individual architects who make custom solutions to specific needs.", "This machine-learning powered database is a useful tool for both the ADU start-up as well as the home-owner. I also see potentials from a planning perspective. The city is capable of tuning its incentives for different populations in different areas of the city.", "Your home for data science.
