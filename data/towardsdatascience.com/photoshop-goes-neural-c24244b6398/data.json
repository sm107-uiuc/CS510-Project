As you see, every filter is evaluated \u2014 Adobe is collecting feedback about all of them, it\u2019s listening to users. Collaborative development is a good thing (I hope they can implement the users\u2019 ideas).", "Here is an example with a female face:", "There are often controversies around such physiognomical Neural experiments. The system is often biased and doesn\u2019t work well on images of people of color. The problem is the missing diversity in the datasets these ML models are trained on. It\u2019s one of the most crucial problems, especially now, as we are building training fundaments for future AI systems.", "Adobe is aware of such issues. Alexandru Costin, Adobe\u2019s vice president of engineering for Creative Cloud told in an interview to The Verge:", "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges we have is preserving the skin tone, [\u2026] This is a very sensitive area.

Fortunately, it was available within the provided style collection \u2014 and here we have the first deficit: others than in the aforementioned Colab Notebook, Adobe Photoshop doesn\u2019t allow you to upload your image for Style Transfer Reference (at least in the current version). Adobe outcomes were rather sobering.", "Among the features of this Filter, you will find the adjustments of Style Strength and Brush Size. You can blur the background and even preserve the colors of the target image during Style Transfer. The Style Transfer Filter is promising and provides useful functions, but its results are far away from what you understand under \u201cStyle Transfer\u201d. Interestingly, Lucid from some years ago performed better.", "PROs* Easy concepted filter* Various Style Reference images (currently: 52)* Adjustable features like Style strength, Preserving Color, etc.CONs* Not really convincing results* No possibility to use your image as a style reference", "These were Featured Filters so far, but Photoshop Neural Filter collection provides more \u2014 other filters are in development status \u201cbeta\u201d, but deliver some interesting and surprising effects.", "Alternative: Style Transfer Colab Notebook (based on Lucid by TensorFlow). Free and good results, even if without adjustment functions.", "This is at the moment probably one of the most interesting Neural Filters within Photoshop.", "Here we have a GAN based processing of various elements within a facial image. By controlling defined layers you can transform many features of the portrait. For people familiar with GAN-based applications like ArtBreeder such layer adjustments are well known. Artbreeder in the newest version runs mostly on StyleGAN and even provides a bigger diversity of features.", "For my further experiments, I will use a GAN-generated image (KafkaGirl) and the photography of an existing person.", "The reason was mentioned in a tweet by Alexandru Costin:", "As we will see in the following, indeed Smart Portrait works better on original photo portraits (the actual field of interests of the main Photoshop users).", "In Photoshop you can correct the gaze of a portrait, which works astonishingly well. (Exactly this function is still missing in Artbreeder).", "Changing the Expression features seems to be still capable of development. For example, \u201cHappiness\u201d.", "While Artbreeder (StyleGAN2) changes slightly other features of the face and generates a harmonic and authentic expression, Neural Filter of Adobe almost places the smile on a face, with realistic teeth, but still, the rest of the face remains without changes.", "In the case of the original photo, it works way better:", "The reason was already mentioned above: \u201cface preserving\u201d is the main focus of Smart Portrait, since using Photoshop the creatives should change some features of a face, but not the face", "Due to the cross-layer attention tend images of ArtBreeder to alternate from original the more the bigger volume you input. You can nevertheless counteract the unintended changes by re-adjusting other layers. \u201cAngriness\u201d seems to be more complicated to revisualize (probably due to lack of \u201cangry\u201d images in FFHQ, Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset, StyleGAN2 was trained on).", "Nevertheless, Artbreeder does its job better with emotional power regarding StyleGAN-generated images.", "Here is Artbreeder still the winner, at least regarding synthetic GAN-created faces. If you move the regulator \u201cFacial Age\u201d in Photoshop till the limit on the right, you\u2019ll get a slightly older version of a girl with an almost invisible double chin and old neck skin. Artbreeder on the limit does wonders.", "Facial Age manipulation within Photoshop Smart Portrait works indeed better with original human photo:", "This feature, still missing in Artbreeder, could be one of the hits of Photoshop, but it\u2019s also still improvable. In this case, I combined head direction with a gaze:", "Something is wrong with the changed image, proportions or composition is not quite right.", "Better results you can achieve with human photos:", "This feature is essential, especially in the case of collages or placing one person in another photography. Alas, this feature is buggy at the moment: random pixels are jumping out of the composition.", "Still, this function is very crucial for Photoshop (and probably highly demanded) and I am sure, this will be still improved.", "Such bugs are not observed with human photos:", "Smart Portrait has still some other features, which are useful in specific cases:", "Hair thickness lets hair grow in a very natural way.", "Placement moves the head before the background \u2014 and the missing background is filled content-sensitively (probably inpainting).", "All in all, Smart Portrait is a great beginning for use of Neural Networks, just it still has to be improved in various cases.", "PROs* Gaze, Head direction, Placement, Hear thickness work pretty well \u2014 * Photoshop can benefit from AI-driven face adjustments, and the tendency is promisingCONs* Still very improvable* To0 small variety on features", "Alternative: ArtBreeder, definitely. Even if it\u2019s StyleGAN-powered, but you can upload an existing image and change it with all StyleGAN-generated faces. The only thing is: sometimes uploaded images look different compared to the original, I suppose due to alignment with Latent Space. StyleGAn seems to \u201ccorrect\u201d images.", "This function is useful if you want to apply the same makeup setting to various faces (or vice versa).", "In this experiment the colors don\u2019t really correspond to the MakeUp source image, probably it depends on the source and target images as well.", "This filter detects occlusion of the image and works astonishingly well. Especially photos with perspectives play around vanishing point such effect gains its expressiveness.", "In the next image of a theater stage model you even can see the contrast of the structures in the foreground:", "In this image you can better distinguish between background and foreground and the front object is emphasized:", "I\u2019d appreciate depth-aware blurriness instead of haze for better expressiveness of the photo though, a feature already used in many smartphone cameras. With Photoshop can you do this as well, but with several workarounds (e.g. \u201cfield blur tool\u201d, but this approach above could be a very effective support for such function.", "I wonder, when AI-driven 3D Ken Burns Effect or 3D Photography Inpainting will be implemented by Photoshop \u2014 or also by After Effects?", "If you are looking for the famous DeOldify version by Jason Antic implemented into Photoshop, you will be probably disappointed.", "Indeed, Adobe didn\u2019t use DeOldify. Back to my experiments with DeOldify, I was stunned by the imaginative power of colors.", "To compare, here is a Black&White Photo, #DeOldified, and #Colorized.", "Even if in the case of Adobe Colorize you can adjust the color balances and even define between Focus Color and Scene Color, the quality is still kind of bleak. Just compare the richness of flower colors DeOldify brought to life \u2014 in the case of Photoshop it\u2019s still a plain sepia alike color quality.", "Alternative: DeOldify (GitHub / Colab Notebook) or its implementation in MyHeritage.", "\u201cEnhance!\u201d \u2014 I suppose Deckard used SuperZoom by Photoshop. Because of this quality convinces.", "Along with the Zoom function, you can enhance image details and remove JPEG artifacts (in case you zoom in a small JPG low-quality image). You also can reduce noise and sharpen the image.", "If you compare the original \u201czoomed-in\u201d image with all its pixel artifacts and enhanced SuperZoomed image you probably agree with me.", "Of course, there are still new artifacts, but sharpness and shapes are very well taken.", "In case you are about to restore digital images, especially JPGs with artifacts caused by heavy compression. Photoshop is acting here \u2014 as one should assume \u2014 as a professional tool.", "For example, I took this photo and compressed it to 50%:", "Here is the compressed zoom view on the artifacts:", "As you see, the glitches are gone, we have appropriate contrasts and patterns. Here works ML for Adobe.", "The rest of the Neural Filters is still under construction \u2014 and there are several very promising functions like", "Photoshop as an image processing tool for professionals and creatives begins to use directly the power of ML models and AI in general.
