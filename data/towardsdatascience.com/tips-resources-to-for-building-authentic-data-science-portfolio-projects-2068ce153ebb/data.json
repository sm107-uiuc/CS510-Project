Not only do they showcase your work, abilities and strengths to recruiters, but they are also a great way to apply your learning.", "Unfortunately, many people don\u2019t really craft their portfolio projects to the best it can be. Instead, they write some code, put it up on Github, and possibly write an article about it, or, they do a Kaggle competition and drop the code on Github.", "This unfortunately is not a great way of creating portfolio projects. Why? because the model you have created is just living in a notebook, thus you don\u2019t learn about model deployment. Second, most of these competitions have clean datasets for you to use, which is quite a contrast to real world data, so you are not really doing the hard part of obtaining the data.", "I this article, I will share with you the following:", "So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the article!", "This is arguably the hardest part of a portfolio project, because sometimes you may have all the skills to do a project, but you don\u2019t know where and how to apply it!", "One approach is to take inspiration from other projects that people have made. Here are some great examples:", "Brainstorming is a really powerful tool in generating ideas for projects. It is scientifically proven that writing things down can make you more productive, and often times I myself get surprised at the ideas I can come up with when writing them down on some sticky notes!. This tutorial is a perfect guide on how one make the most out their brainstorming sessions.", "Another approach is to find out what problems you may face in your day-to-day life, and see if you can solve them using Data Science. Questions you can ask could be the following:", "And so on. The points is that there are lots of things that may bother you, but instead of complaining about them, find out if you can utilise ML & Data Science to come up with innovative ideas!", "The most important part of any project is data. Without data, everything else is useless. However, finding the right data for you projects can be a tough task to do. That\u2019s why I have compiled a list of free, open and good quality datasets for you to use for your next portfolio project.", "Without further ado, here is the list of free open datasets:", "This is a list I have compiled from my own personal experience of using these resources. I encourage you to check some out them out and see what is hot and what is not. So now you definitely can\u2019t use the excuse of \u201cI can\u2019t find good data!\u201d", "Once you have a dataset downloaded and ready to analyse, pause for a second, and ask some key questions:", "When I was starting out with building portfolio projects, I would usually skip all the EDA and preprocessing and just run an XGBoost model(yes, how stupid indeed.) However, I knew that I needed to follow a clear structure to my projects. And then I met CRISPDM.", "Cross-industry standard process for data mining(CRISPDM) is a process model that describe the 6 steps describe the Data Science Life Cycle. It essentially helps you plan, organise, structure and implement your projects.", "Great. But what do the steps really involve? Good question. So, let\u2019s discuss exactly that!", "Here, you define the actual objective of the project, and what you are aiming to achieve by creating this project. This can be split into 3 stages:", "Ok, so now that you have understood what you are trying to achieve, you begin to do your analysis. The steps can be broken down to the following tasks:", "Data collection: you begin by collecting your data. You may avail of REST API\u2019s, Data Warehousing services, or other methods to collect and cement your data together into a usable dataset", "Data Description: You begin by doing some EDA, looking at the basic structure of the data, getting a feel for the data and understanding the type of data you are working with", "Data Exploring: Here, you take a deeper dive into your data. You begin to perform more complex queries, look for hidden patterns in the data, and try to find aspects of the data that give key insights onto the problem at hand", "Data Assessment: You begin to assess the quality of the data. You ask questions such as:", "This is the step where you prepare the final data to be used for the model. The stages here are the following:", "Probably the most enjoyable and anticipated part of the project. This stages is split into 4 areas:", "This stage of the cycle focuses on which model best fits the objective and the project and planning the next steps. This stage can be split up into the following:", "Sorry to burst your bubble, but a model is not very useful to people inside your Jupyter Notebook! You need to have a plan on deploying the model .The steps involved in this are the following:", "These principles will greatly help you in clearly structuring your portfolio projects, so that you are not jumping from one stage to another. If at any stage you are unsure about something, always traverse back through the cycle and see if you can improve on anything.", "The reason I put these two methods as a section of their own is simply because I have not seen enough portfolio projects availing to them. These 2 methods are very underrated and can help immensely in the following areas:", "Undoubtedly the most underused strategy that I never see being used is logging. It is so easy, yet hardly used. Essentially, logging keeps track of your code and logs down key messages that you can later go through if you begin to face an issue in your project.", "I use this all the time, and I have caught numerous nasty bugs that would have otherwise gotten into production and would have forced me to spend endless hours of fixing them. If you want to learn how to use logging, here is a great article by Real Python on logging, and honestly, it is the only tutorial you will ever need to read as it is truly comprehensive.", "This is also a very underrated and underused strategy. I cannot put enough emphasis on the importance of a Test Driven Development and the countless benefits that it possesses. Establishing a solid CI/CD pipeline can help achieve the following objectives:", "Personally, I like to use Travis CI and Git when setting up my CI/CD pipeline. However, feel free to use any CI or CD tool that you may desire.", "While nobody is perfect, I believe that one should always strive for it. Here, I have given tips and resources to make your projects stand out and unique from the rest, and how to make the most out of your project. I have described the end-to-end cycle that should be performed, and how you can use 2 underrated methods to really reach maximum efficiency in your next project.", "I hope this article has helped you one way or another, and I hope that you are now ready to build the most authentic portfolio project ever witnessed! Make sure to stay updated for more content, and always be the best you can be!", "Your home for data science.
