After removing names and common stop words, around 6000 words were left for analysis.", "The word correlation network graph illustrates how words are used either in the same sentence or next to each other in the debate. I grouped some of the words into networks that may be relevant to the topics covered in the debate:", "We can also tag each participants\u2019 words with a part-of-speech category (noun, proper noun, adjective, adverb, etc.). This section will look specifically at the most occurring proper nouns, nouns, and adjectives used by Trump and Biden.", "One of the basic tasks of sentiment analysis is understanding the polarity of a given text, whether the opinions expressed in the text are positive, negative, or neutral.", "The first plot below shows the polarity of speech text by each spokesperson across the debate event.

Next, we will look at the spokesperson's exact words, colored with polarity/positivity.", "Words with negative sentiment are colored in blue and positive sentiment as red in the word clouds. The size of the words depends on their respective frequencies.", "The most used positive word by Trump is \u2018won\u2019 and \u2018affordable\u2019 by Biden.
