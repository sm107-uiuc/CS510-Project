Today we\u2019ll answer how binning bias can mislead you in the analysis and how to prevent this issue with the power of ECDF plots.", "The article answers the following questions:", "Without much ado, let\u2019s get started!", "As Justin Bois from DataCamp said \u2014 binning bias \u2014 and I can\u2019t agree more. What this means is that using different bin sizes on a histogram makes data distribution look different. Don\u2019t take my word for it \u2014 the example below speaks for itself.", "To start, we\u2019ll import a couple of libraries for data analysis and visualization, and load the Titanic dataset straight from the web:", "If you are unfamiliar with the dataset, here\u2019s how the first couple of rows look like:", "Next, let\u2019s declare a function for visualizing histograms. It takes a bunch of parameters, but the most important ones in our case are:", "We will use the mentioned function two times, the first time to make a histogram with 10 bins, and the second time to make a histogram with 30 bins. Here are the results:", "he data is identical, but different bin sizes can lead to binning bias \u2014 perceiving the same data differently, due to a slight change in the visual representations.", "What can we do to address this issue? ECDF plots are here to save the day.", "ECDF stands for the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s way less fancy than it sounds, and is also relatively easy to interpret.", "Like histograms, ECDFs show a single variable distribution, but in a more efficient way. We\u2019ve seen previously how histograms can be misleading due to different bin sizing options. That\u2019s not the case with ECDFs. ECDFs show every data point, and the plot can be interpreted only in one way.", "Think of ECDFs as scatter plots because they also have points along X and Y axes. To be more precise, here\u2019s what ECDFs show on both axes:", "To make this sort of visualization, we need to do a bit of calculation first. Two arrays are required:", "The following Python snippet can be used to calculate X and Y values for a single column in a Pandas DataFrame:", "It was quite a simple one. We\u2019ll need one more function, though. This one is used to make an actual chart:", "Let\u2019s use this function to make an ECDF plot of the Age attribute:", "But wait, how do I interpret this? It\u2019s quite easy. Here are a couple of examples:", "Wasn\u2019t that easy? But wait, the party doesn\u2019t stop here. Let\u2019s explore how to plot and interpret multiple ECDFs next.", "In the Titanic dataset, we have the Pclass attribute, which indicates the passenger class. This sort of class organization is typical in travel even today, as the first class is reserved for wealthier individuals, and the other classes are where the rest of the folk is located.", "With the power of ECDFs, we can explore how the passenger age was distributed among classes. We\u2019ll need to call the ecdf() function 3 times, as there were three classes on the ship. The rest of the code boils down to data visualization, which is self-explanatory:", "The resulting visualization is shown below:", "As we can see, the third class (red) had a lot of children on board, which isn\u2019t the case all that much with the first class (green). The population in the first class is quite older, too:", "These are just rough numbers, so don\u2019t quote me if I made a mistake by a year or two. Now you know how to work with and interpret ECDFs. Let\u2019s wrap things up in the next section.", "Don\u2019t leave anything to the personal interpretation in data science. Just because you like to see 15 bins in a histogram doesn\u2019t mean your coworker likes it too. These differences might lead to different data interpretations if interpreted visually.", "That\u2019s not the case with ECDFs.
