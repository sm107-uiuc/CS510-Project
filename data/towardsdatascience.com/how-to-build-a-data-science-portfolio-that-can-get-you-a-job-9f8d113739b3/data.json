This has been one of the most common questions by job applicants looking for a career in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.", "How to get hired for a Data Science job?", "What should my portfolio demonstrate infront of the recruiter?", "And the answer is pretty simple: \u201cYour portfolio should display what you do!\u201d Yes, it is that simple as it sounds. There are many things that your portfolio can display and you should actually work on displaying such things that are only relevant to your domain. If we are considering Data Science in mind or whether it be Machine Learning or Deep Learning, the one thing that is common is the chemistry between Technical Capability and the Non-Technical Capability about you.", "Remember, a portfolio can be anything, it can be through your resume or LinkedIn profile, or it can be your Kaggle profile or your GitHub Profile or it can be different types of competitions in which you are participating. Just anything which throws light on you!", "Being in the domain everybody knows about their technical capabilities like for being a Data Scientist, you need to know what is machine learning, what is deep learning, you need to know statistics, various algorithms, how they work, and the mathematics behind them. You need to know the data cleaning process and everything which is related to the work you have to do in the industry. You need to know how to program by using any of the programming languages whether it be Python, R, Julia, Java, etc. it depends on which one you chose and learn. You need to have a basic understanding of various cloud architecture like AWS, GCP, IBM Cloud, etc. and how to deploy a fully functional data science project on the servers.", "In general, you need to know the complete Data Science Lifecycle and its implementation on the real-life data and developing an end-to-end system for a Data Science application.", "Data Science is more about understanding the data and communicating what you understood from your research and analysis. It is about contributing your understandings in front of the world. In general, we can say that a good data scientist should be good at communicating the results and ability to work in collaboration with a different type of team members and the ability to understand and reason more from the data. So, you need to display the art of storytelling which is one of the core foundations of a Data Science profile.", "The ability to understand and reason more from the data, analyzing the data, and bringing up insights that arise more questions from that data and solving those real-life problems is the curiosity that drives the data science industry is the real world.", "For students studying in some college or the freshers who are actively looking for a job, the most important thing is:", "An internship is one of the most important things that one should look for once they have completed studying the concepts about the core domain. An internship in Data Science will add up much more value to your portfolio by showing the recruiter that you have some working experience in the industry and have good exposure to real-world problems.", "Now you have worked for an internship, so you can add the projects which you have built and the problems that you have solved, all those things you can mention proudly in your resume. So this was the first and most important thing that you should be doing.", "Suppose you are a college student who is trying hard to get an internship but by some means, you land up with nothing in hand. What to do then?", "Suppose you are a working professional and you have been working in a different domain for some company and now you want to switch to a data science career but you are not getting an internship or any project in your existing company regarding Data Science. So what to do in such a case?", "Yes, that is true. Take up any problem you see in the world where you know that you could have brought a change if you have ever got the chance to work on it. It is the right time! Take up a project and build a complete end-to-end solution for it. Trust me, a personal project done completely by you will add up great value to your portfolio which can sometimes be equivalent to doing an internship.", "You can collect datasets of your interest from websites like Kaggle which has tons of datasets available for free. Then you can start working on your project. Build an end-to-end system which solves your problem and deploy your project on any cloud services like AWS, GCP, etc. Remember, you need to make sure you are working on a full end-to-end project and not only a part of it which has to be from data collection to communicating the results and finally deploying the ready-to-use system on the cloud.", "There are various websites that are hosting Data Science competitions on a regular basis like Kaggle has every month some of the competitions live on the website. HackerRank is another such good website that regularly conducts hiring competition and long challenges where you can solve the problem by applying your skills and working on improving the accuracy of your model or things like that.", "So such websites are limited to improve the accuracy of the machine learning model, but you don't stop there. Take the dataset from there and build a complete end-to-end system by yourself. In doing so you will learn a lot of new things which would be very useful in the overall growth of your knowledge in a particular domain and can benefit you a lot during your interview. Now, You need to think of how you can utilize the resources from a particular website (like Kaggle) and can use it in making a fully ready working system that you can add in your portfolio.", "Note: Even though you do NOT have any working experience in real-world industry, a project can work wonders!", "You need to work on your public profiles like GitHub, LinkedIn, Kaggle, etc. to make a good impression on the recruiter who would definitely be impressed if the profiles are well built.", "These things would definitely help you in building a much better and stronger portfolio. Keep yourself updated with the new technology and over time you would definitely make it through!", "and many more at Paras Varshney.", "I hope you would surely make something out of this read!", "If you like it and share it with your friends and help the community grow better and stronger. Connect with me on Linkedin.", "Your home for data science.
