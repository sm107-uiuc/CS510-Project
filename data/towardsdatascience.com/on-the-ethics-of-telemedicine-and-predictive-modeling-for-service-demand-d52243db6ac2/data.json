Services range from real-time consultations, remote monitoring, to electronic medical record data transfers.", "Telemedicine has the potential to transform healthcare, but ensuring it is ethically acceptable requires anticipating and addressing potential pitfalls.", "These include effects of attempting to utilize one-size-fits-all implementations, patient privacy issues, erosion of patient-doctor relationships, and the temptation to assume that new telehealth service technologies must be effective.", "Emergency teleneurology care has grown in magnitude, impact, and validation. Stroke is a leading cause of death in the US and the timely treatment of stroke results in better outcomes for patients. Teleneurology provides evidence-based care to patients even when a board-certified neurologist is not physically on site.", "Determining staffing demand for telemedicine consultation for a specific period of time is an integral part of the decision-making activities of providers of acute care telemedicine services.", "Here, we describe the building of a forecasting model to predict consultation demand to optimize telemedicine provider staffing [0].", "Ethics have a strong position within medicine, reflecting deontological principles of seeing an action as right or wrong in itself depending on its conformity with a moral rule and not on its consequences. This is then overlaid with a utilitarian ethic of maximizing good and bringing about the greatest happiness to the greatest number.", "The medical tradition is based on patients\u2019 rights, doctors\u2019 duties, and attempts to balance different interests. To a degree, it also reflects an Aristotelian account of virtues and the values of a profession; widely known statements of the medical commitment to serve humanity include the Hippocratic Oath and the World Medical Association\u2019s International Code of Medical Ethics [6]. However, despite being based on such seemingly stable systems, ethics in medicine is influenced by wider trends in science, society, and politics.", "The development and availability of diverse, cheap, and reliable technologies, financial pressures on the healthcare sector, and a growing demand from the public for universal access to high-quality medical care has led to a rapid growth of telemedicine services. Telemedicine is a hundred-year-old concept that describes the process of using information technologies and telecommunications platforms to deliver healthcare services, which range from consultations, education, exchanging patient records data, research, and more [1]. Recently, telemedicine market growth was projected to be $41.8 billion with greater than 19% growth from 2018\u20132022, yet currently only addresses 0.1% of global demand [5,6].", "The decentralization of healthcare delivery and health budgets has also encouraged a number of independent telehealth projects. These projects are often small-scale, bottom-up, and driven by small teams of health professionals from diverse disciplines, e.g. using a video link between a local doctor\u2019s surgery and a hospital consultant. It has been observed that the medical tradition is dominant in most of such projects, and the popularity of the term \u2018telemedicine\u2019 (as opposed to \u2018telehealth\u2019) reflects the preoccupation with medical aspects of healthcare delivery.", "In constructing a computational model to predict the demand for telemedicine services over time, with the goal of helping both hospitals and telemedicine service providers better understand staffing needs in terms of the distribution of on-site and via-telemedicine doctors, we argue that this is too narrow a focus.", "We hypothesize that demand prediction as executed below is not as optimal as it could be, as compared to if we had somehow encoded into the model viewpoints on particular issues relating to the growth of telehealth activity. However, we take care to identify and understand which objective, quantifiable features contribute most to forecasting telemedicine service demand, and discuss the inclusion of particular ethical dilemmas for involved parties into the prediction logic afterwards.", "In this analysis, we refer to telemedicine as the use of technology to deliver care remotely between patients and providers. We specifically analyze teleneurology, an application of telemedicine to treat patients who require a neurology specialist, such as for acute ischemic stroke, migraines, or epilepsy.", "In this context, consultation demand is the quantity and frequency of consult requests from hospitals. Hospitals across the nation are interested in predicting the number of future visits within a specific time (i.e. within one week or one month). This information is valuable because it impacts hospital cost assessment in terms of overcrowding, hospital understaffing, and insufficient bed availability [2].", "Telestroke and teleneurology are telecommunication-based services specific to treating patients who have stroke and neurological disorders in need of care from a neurologist. In a randomized, blind, and prospective trial, telestroke was more patient-specific, sensitive, and higher predictive values than traditional telephone-based consultations [19]. These are typically deployed in underserved facilities that lack 24/7 stroke expertise [2,13,15].", "Previous studies have shown that telestroke services performed as reliably as bedside neurologists by comparing their assigned NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke) scores, from both in-person neurologists and those treating via telemedicine [4]. The study concludes that doctors practicing through telemedicine can be used to help emergency physicians administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a drug that dissolves blood clots used to treat ischemic stroke [2,4,6].", "Telestroke has also been shown to be cost-effective, with and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $108,363/QALY (quality-adjusted life year) in the 90-day horizon and $2,449/QALY in the lifetime horizon [14]. The QALY is a generic measure of disease burden, incorporating impact on both the quantity and quality of life, used in economic evaluations; one QALY equates to one year in perfect health. Similar studies found that the cost-effectiveness of hub-and-spoke telestroke can increase the number of patient discharges [16].", "Demand prediction could improve these services even further, to predict how many clinicians should be physically present at the hospital versus how many should be available remotely via telemedicine initiatives.", "Many hospital departments are interested in forecasting demand for care for a variety of reasons. For example, emergency departments (ED) in the U.S. experienced widespread overcrowding issues, which negatively impacts patient quality of care and hospital costs [7]. Predictive studies using Poisson models on EDs have shown with up to 90% confidence that the highest number visits during the week is Monday and increases from 7:00AM until it peaks at noon [2,18]. Another study forecasted hospital bed demand by analyzing prediction techniques: hourly historical average, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and sinusoidal with an autoregression (AR)-structured error term. ARIMA performed the best and was able to estimate demand for bed count 4 to 12 hours in advance [7].", "However, to current knowledge, there is no study that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of teleneurology implementation by forecasting demand for consultations across different clients. This is true because telemedicine services vary nationwide based on the demands of individual hospitals, which can be on available bed count, hospital type, value-based care or fee-for-service care, hospital staffing, etc. The study we present here can help shed light on what factors affect return on investment for telemedicine services for both hospitals and providers.", "The dataset has 411 hospitals and 97,593 consultations since July 2015. The number of consultations were predominantly focused on stroke, followed by Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), encephalopathy, seizures, and stroke that requires tPA administration (tissue plasminogen activator, tPA stroke).", "Although less frequent, tPA Stroke is the highest clinical priority. The hospital clients\u2019 bed count sizes ranged from 10 to 1432. Geographically, the data shows a heavier representation of hospitals in the Southeast, which occupy around 35% of the total number of clients. They are in Figure 1, which shows the fields used to run the models. Within teleneurology, around 53,000 females received consultations compared to 43,000 males, which is summarized by the pool of females dominating at 55% overall. As the number of consultations was dependent on Provider Diagnosis, an overwhelming majority of consultations were based on stroke, followed by TIA, then tPA stroke, which is more serious and life-threatening.", "The relationship between tPA administration and a variety of factors, including gender and age, is highly correlational. Although there was no correlational relationship between gender, there is a normal-like distribution that models the relationship between age and tPA (Figure 2).", "The data shows that tPA Administration accumulates mostly in New Jersey at 278 cases, followed by Pennsylvania at 165 cases (Figure 4). Interestingly, New York, which had less than half the number of tPA administrations than North Caroline or New Jersey despite experiencing similar demand for teleneurology.", "Using polynomial regression fitting, tPA administration and the months of the year follow a cubic relationship with correlation coefficient (r\u00b2 value) of 0.76.", "OLS linear regression and polynomial regression models are used to find strong correlations between features and demand. Ridge regression and the lasso were also tested on the dataset to find the best fit model.", "Ridge regression is used for fine-tuning the complexity of the model with a regularization term, while lasso regression suits sparse data by forcing the sum of the absolute value of the regression coefficients to be less than a fixed value, causing some certain coefficients to be set to zero and reducing the problem to a simpler model that does not include those coefficients [12].", "Given below are plots depicting the weekly and monthly telemedicine service demand aggregated across all partnering hospitals, over a period of approximately a year. The weekly demand (Figure 7) appears to be centered around 850\u2013950 patients utilizing telemedicine services. These counts oscillate around this center on an approximately 1.5-week basis, and demand is noted to spike slightly around the holidays and new year periods.", "The monthly demand plot (Figure 8) below confirms the above observation, where dips and peaks are observed either once or twice a month (the sudden downward-sloping lines at the immediate left and right of the plots are due to the provided data beginning and ending in the middle of a month).", "An OLS linear regression and polynomial regression were conducted on the dataset (Figure 9), where the generated trends are depicted with a dotted green line and solid red line respectively, overlaid on a scatterplot of demand aggregated weekly.", "The following results were outputted for the OLS regression, with the slope of the line being 0.21, the y-intercept as 845.71, and the r\u00b2 value as 0.04. The low correlation coefficient outputted prompted running a model with additional input variables. After experimenting with various orders of fitted polynomials, training, testing, and cross-validation were executed to generate accuracy scores, which were no longer highly variable from run to run due to an augmented independent variables set in the system.", "The following features were used to train the new regression models: \u2018time zone\u2019, \u2018visit initiated\u2019, \u2018state\u2019, \u2018sex\u2019, \u2018age\u2019, \u2018service line\u2019, \u2018reason for consult\u2019, \u2018provider diagnosis\u2019, \u2018hospital type\u2019, \u2018bed count\u2019, \u2018stroke center\u2019, advanced comprehensive stroke center, and total ER visits (Figure 10).", "Running linear regression on these features, most of the data points matched the predicted value where r\u00b2 = 0.78 (Table 1). Applying lasso regression on the same features, the r\u00b2 = 0.77, which was less optimal than OLS linear regression. Ridge regression on all inputs yielded slightly better results, with r\u00b2 = 0.78 (Table 2), and performed the best overall.", "Running the weekly prediction linear regression model with just \u2018provider diagnosis\u2019, the model yielded r\u00b2 = 0.74. Using the same model with Service Line in place of \u2018provider diagnosis\u2019, the accuracy increased to r\u00b2 = 0.77. Weekly prediction with only \u2018reason for consult\u2019 performed the best even compared to training all the features together with r\u00b2 = 0.79 (Table 1). Interestingly, weekly forecasting with \u2018reason for consult\u2019 and \u2018provider diagnosis\u2019 bumped the accuracy to r\u00b2 = 0.81. It was expected that \u2018reason for consult\u2019 and \u2018provider diagnosis\u2019 would yield strong results but surprising that \u2018service line\u2019 was also an equally good predicting factor.", "The sparse nature of this dataset enabled a slight change in the target variable to cause huge variances in the calculated weights. The plots below, one for each of ridge regression (Figure 11) and the lasso (Figure 12), set a certain regularization (\u03b1) to reduce this variation.", "When \u03b1 is very large, the regularization effect dominates the squared loss function, causing the coefficients tend to zero. At the end of the path, as \u03b1 tends toward zero and the solution toward the ordinary least squares, coefficients exhibit large oscillations. In outputting accuracy statistics for the models built for this study, we set an \u03b1 enabling a maximal score.", "This analysis aims to reasonably predict future consult demand to optimize hospital staffing and analyze return on investment for both parties, and demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between week or month of a telemedicine consultation request and the predicted number of consultations. We have found that certain combinations of input features, including hospital characteristics and certain consult characteristics (namely \u2018provider diagnosis\u2019, \u2018service line\u2019, and \u2018reason for consult\u2019), yield forecasted telemedicine consult demand with around 78% accuracy overall.", "Ongoing work includes improving the accuracy of the current predictive model by adding a classification by service line and the reason for consult and provider diagnosis component to it, in order to further break down the provided forecasted demand outputs. We will continue to work around dataset limitations, which include the dataset consisting entirely of data from one telemedicine provider and its clients, for a single practice, only over a one-year time period.", "Ideally, we would like more information on the degrees to which telemedicine was utilized in consults over various hospitals, patient demographics data (to analyze which hospitals get greater telemedicine service demand and if this is correlated with patient demographics), and notes of which partnering hospitals specialize in which service lines.", "Noting that the spikes and dips in demand over the year are not dramatic, we look to build in an anomaly detection component into the model, to search specifically for which points and microtrends most affect telemedicine service demand at certain points over time. We also seek to augment the dataset, to broaden the size of the training and test sets, to further address optimizations to the predictive model.", "As the field of telemedicine further develops, we also acknowledge that the treatment of ethical issues in telehealth needs to be seen as going beyond individual projects or clinical situations, and be considered in relation to society as a whole and the varied interest groups within it.", "We note that telemedicine applications pose a number of practical ethical dilemmas for those involved. Examples include telemedicine services\u2019 effects on the doctor-patient relationship, balance of benefits between doctor and patient, questions of accessibility, data security and patients\u2019 confidentiality, the use of innovative but unproved technologies, allocation of scarce resources and opportunity costs, and medical practice, employment, and job satisfaction.", "Perhaps these problems arise because telemedicine applications involve ethical and evaluation traditions from multiple disciplines coming together, leading to conflicting values and unworkable or partial evaluation frameworks. This is precisely why telemedicine services should increasingly be evaluated in terms of empowering patients and communities, contributing to social cohesion, and democratizing service delivery, instead of intensifying social exclusion (information-rich and information-poor) and depersonalization of health services (providing treatment, not care) [4,6].", "We see telemedicine as needing to be understood not only as a medical technology or treatment, but also as service to genuinely improve health. Many proponents of telehealth maintain that it offers a way to follow a duty to do the best for an individual person and the utilitarian aim of allocating limited resources in the best way possible to the benefit of the whole population, and such trends could be computationally modeled relatively easily. However, for future work on forecasting telemedicine service demand, we argue for the incorporation of a more Aristotelian approach when evaluating the changing landscape that is telehealth, with an emphasis on the achievement of healthy people leading fulfilled lives.", "Notably, telehealth developments have revealed several problems: privacy issues involving patient data, the presence of inaccurate and obsolete data within databases, security breaches, information overload, lack of user-friendliness, and weak standards for linking patient\u2019s medical and personal information to achieve interoperability for individual records [6]. How new applications fit with changes in healthcare delivery and health information infrastructure, as well as the quality and accuracy of online information, are also of deep concern.", "Telemedicine developments seek to \u201cimprove health care locally, regionally, and worldwide by using information and communication technology\u201d [8]. However, in many instances of telehealth use, patients have not been the ones to decide whether conventional medicine or telemedicine fits their needs better, or understand how their concerns are incorporated into the technologies. Consequently, ethical problems may arise related to the intentions of those who develop these systems (e.g. SOC Telemed, the health consulting company for which we analyzed service demand data in this report) and the goals they seek.", "That the design of telemedicine services may benefit service providers and clinicians more than the ill or elderly calls for more attention to setting ethical design and evaluation principles. We consider several additional avenues for research: understanding how provider-centric versus patient-centric telemedicine services are, whether the shift to remote services promotes rationality and efficiency at the expense of values traditionally at the heart of caregiving, how the replacement of human contact with new technologies could best be handled, and to what extent telemedicine services are aimed not toward the improvement of health or well-being but to create market needs.", "Additionally, situations often arise in which telemedicine care inadvertently leads to poorer quality care. For example, in cases where doctors participated in initiatives to provide accessibility to remote communities and solutions to overcrowded or understaffed hospitals, being distant from patients and overwhelmed by a flood of reports and medical images from several sources led to misdiagnoses [15].", "Furthermore, remote clinicians often lack information when they interpret information in the absence of direct knowledge of the patient, possibly leading to imperfect prescriptions. Informed consent also becomes an ethical challenge in such scenarios. While being informed (in the medical sense, being aware of benefits and burdens) is commonly understood in situations like drug trials, new telehealth technologies involve new kinds of risks, often times impossible to anticipate.", "Indeed, designing telemedicine services is difficult, since different individuals attribute different meanings to the same technology. (For example, a patient may consider a phone-based diet and exercise counseling program as a way for the service company to reduce costs and contact with practitioners while other users may view the app as an empowering alternative to depending on a human counselor.) Thus, standards for evaluating telehealth services are necessary; evaluation should include not only technological and economic, but also ethical and social aspects of the new technologies addressing the long-term effects on personal well-being.", "All in all, technology should complement clinical and care decisions based on values fundamental to the practice of healthcare \u2014 compassion, care, humaneness \u2014 and not be pursued as an end in itself.", "[6] American Hospital Association.
