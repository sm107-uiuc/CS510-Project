spread by the media, perhaps none is more detrimental than Us vs Them: the idea that the world is divided into two groups \u2014 one good, one evil \u2014 and all events can be viewed as a struggle between the two. This two-sided view of the world takes advantage of our natural tendency to form tribes and is applied in many situations, from political parties to economic systems, and, to countries in the form of \u201cdeveloped vs. developing world.\u201d In the last case, this takes the form: developed = rich with low birth rates (assumed to be us) vs. developing = poor with high birth rates (them).", "A binary outlook may make for compelling news (conflicts and tribalism are sure ways to get our attention) but it\u2019s false. All of human life, from the personal \u2014 income, height, sexuality \u2014 to the international \u2014 systems of government, economic systems, national wealth \u2014 exists not in two states, but along a continuum. Moreover, we dehumanize people by splitting them into two groups letting our instincts and cognitive biases do the thinking for us instead of using our rationality. In this article, the fourth episode of the Reality Project \u2014 an effort dedicated to becoming less wrong about the world with data \u2014 we\u2019ll see why a separation between developing and developed countries no longer applies and look at factful ways to view nations instead.", "The previous episode of The Reality Project, on global nuclear weapons is here. You can find all The Reality Project by searching on Medium for the tag.", "For this article, we\u2019ll rely primarily on Hans Rosling\u2019s book: Factfulness: Ten Reasons We\u2019re Wrong About the World. Other sources are the World Bank Poverty Page, the YouTube video \u201cDebunking Third World Myths with the Best Stats You\u2019ve Never Seen\u201d, and the article \u201cShould We Continue to Use the Term \u2018Developing World\u2019?\u201d. I made the graphs with the Gapminder Data Exploration tool which you can download for free (it includes data).", "To start, it\u2019s worth looking at where this binary idea applied to countries originated. The term \u201cdeveloping country\u201d probably evolved out of \u201cThird World\u201d, which originally referred to countries aligned with neither the Communist Soviet bloc or Capitalist NATO in the 1950s. These countries tended to be former colonies struggling to provide citizens with a decent standard of living, and \u201cThird World\u201d soon came to mean poor countries with high birth rates, what are now referred to as developing nations.", "Admittedly, at one point, during the 1960s, this distinction actually did make sense \u2014 or at least was in line with the existing data. In the below chart, we see the fertility rate (births per woman) on the y-axis versus income (GDP per capita) on the x-axis in 1960 for all countries where we have data.", "(The color represents the world region: yellow = Europe, blue = Africa, green = Americas, and Red = Asia + Australia). There is a relatively clear grouping as countries in Europe plus a few in the Americas and Asia tended to be both richer and have fewer babies per woman (lower right). On the other hand, African countries almost exclusively had high birth rates and low income. Development aid took off in the post-WWII years, and so, at the time, this classification allowed NGOs and governments to focus their efforts.", "However, since 1960, the picture of the world has changed dramatically. Let\u2019s look at the same graph in 1990, just after the fall of the Soviet Union.", "Now we see not a grouping but a linear transition. There are still differences between countries, but the noticeable gap that existed has given way to a smooth line. The global fertility rate, at an extremely high 5 babies per woman in 1960, had fallen to 3 in 1990. The extreme poverty rate \u2014 less than $2 /day \u2014 likewise fell, from over 60% in 1960 to less than 40% in 1990.", "These trends \u2014 decreasing fertility and decreasing poverty \u2014 have only accelerated since 1990. Below is the most up-to-date picture of the world:", "What we see here has been named \u201cThe Great Convergence.\u201d While there are still differences, there is no one gap that divides countries; instead, they are arrayed along a continuous line of income. Drawing a single separating line of this graph is impossible because there is only a smooth transition. Countries all over the world have gotten richer and, as a result, have longer lives, reduced childhood mortality, and fewer children per women.", "Notably, China and India (visible as the large red bubbles) have experienced extreme reductions in poverty, resulting in a new world low of under 9% extreme poverty in 2018. The new global birth rate is at 2.5 babies per woman, drawing near to the replacement rate of 2.1.", "When we look at a similar graph of childhood survival versus fertility rate, we can see the same trend. The developing/developed gap here is even clearer in 1960 (left) but again, the world has since converged (right).", "The old boxes clearly no longer fit. We\u2019ll get into a more accurate characteristic in the next section.", "We\u2019ll end this part with one final visual: the changing worldwide income distribution since 1800. It\u2019s one thing to get your picture of the world from the news, but completely different to watch the transformations take place in front of your eyes with real data. As incomes around the world increase, the global extreme poverty rate (vertical line) decreases from 86% to under 15%(and, in 2018, the World Bank reported it was under 10%).", "If you watch closely, you can see the emergence of a gap right around 1960 \u2014 this is precisely the time at which the terms \u201cdeveloping\u201d and \u201cdeveloped\u201d first came into use. However, as the animation continues, the gap slowly disappears until incomes exist along a continuous distribution. The separation of incomes \u2014 called the Great Divergence \u2014 was a real phenomenon, but the new picture is a Great Convergence as incomes increase nearly everywhere.", "This disappearing of the \u201cgap\u201d between two distinct sets of countries means the terms \u201cdeveloping\u201d and \u201cdeveloped\u201d no longer accurately represent countries. If we use this distinction, it means placing Mexico, GDP per capita $17,000, and Mozambique, GDP per capita $1,200, in the same category. In other words, a binary distinction is too broad. Nonetheless, as in the 1960s, some form of breaking up countries is useful as it allows us to find countries with similar needs. If the two-part model is broken, what fixes it?", "In Factfulness, Hans Rosling lays out a four-tiered approach for grouping countries based on similar needs derived from income. These are outlined as follows (from Bill Gates\u2019 excellent post on the subject).", "If you must think of it this way, Level One is \u201clower-class\u201d, Levels Two and Three are the global \u201cmiddle-class\u201d, and Level Four is the \u201cupper-class\u201d. In this system, the vast majority of the world\u2019s population are correctly classified as middle class or above reflecting the recent substantial gains in income.", "Below is a breakdown of the world population into each level over time:", "In 1800, close to the entire world population (85%) existed on Level One. In 2018, only 15% of the world\u2019s population is still there and the middle classes are growing far faster than the extremes.", "The actual levels and dollar amounts, with each person representing approximately 1 billion people, are below:", "The four-tier system is an improvement over a binary split. Rosling\u2019s approach is useful because it captures needs of different countries more accurately than binary categories, it allows us to clearly see progress over time, and it prevents us from falling into the Us vs. Them type of thinking. (Not to mention the numbers work out very well). While this argument may seem like semantics, it actually does matter because how we measure determines how we act.", "(There are other systems to approach the same problem. The International Monetary Fund still uses a binary advanced vs emerging economies, the United Nations Development Program uses a continuous Human Development Index, and the World Bank has recently stopped using the terms \u201cdeveloping\u201d and \u201cdeveloped\u201d. There is also a compelling argument for expanding the four categories to five with the fifth representing abundance.)", "Why does any measurement matter? The answer: it helps us to figure out what approaches work to solve a problem by observing causes and effects. Consider a typical continuous human measurement, weight. If you are trying to lose weight, one of the best places to start is simply weigh yourself every day so you can see if you are going in the right direction. How else are you supposed to know if your (non)-interventions are having any impact? A process of act \u2014 measure results \u2014 adjust actions is how we personally improve in any pursuit. The exact same is true of global development: measuring along a continuous or four-tier scale allows us to clearly see progress over time and relate back specific improvements to causes.", "The weight metaphor also holds up when we start to think about using binary versus multiple categories. If there are only two states \u2014 fat and thin \u2014 we are inaccurate categorizing a lot of people and it\u2019s going to be hard to stay motivated if your status never changes even from year-to-year. We are much better off thinking in terms of categories \u2014 obese, overweight, healthy, underweight \u2014 so we can make salient recommendations to individuals (or ourselves) to guide their actions for losing weight.", "When it comes to global poverty, it can seem like there are reasons to despair. There are 750 million people \u2014 mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 currently in extreme poverty. However, we shouldn\u2019t stop there, and, once we start digging into the data, the picture becomes much better: over 1.2 billion people lifted out of extreme poverty in the past 30 years and the real possibility of eliminating extreme poverty within the next several decades. With a binary worldview, we risk missing all of that by lumping together everyone not at our income level as developing. In the four-tier framework, we can see that actually about 85% (6/7 billion) people live on the second level or higher and the largest segment of the population lives in the global middle class (levels 2 and 3). If we look again at the graph of the distribution of levels over time, we see lots of reason for hope:", "The middle classes are growing and the first level (the \u201clower class\u201d) is shrinking rapidly. This is good not only for people in those countries but also for everyone around the world. As countries get wealthier, citizens report increased life satisfaction (a better measure than day-to-day happiness):", "Furthermore, as incomes increase, fertility rates decrease as better health care leads to fewer children dying and subsequently, women have fewer babies:", "(There are many other reasons for the decline in fertility which you can read about on the Our World in Data fertility page.) There are people worried about overpopulation (I don\u2019t happen to be one of them based on the data and best estimates) and, if you are one of them, the best way to limit population growth is to bring people in all countries out of poverty. As families have fewer children, they can spend more resources on each child, giving them a better chance to succeed, which they can then pass on to their children and the virtuous cycle of decreasing poverty and decreasing fertility continues.", "You might argue that at the end of the day, this is only semantics. However, the \u201cdeveloped vs developing\u201d dichotomy is more than a choice of words, it\u2019s a mindset. At its core, a binary worldview is intellectually lazy because it means not looking at the data and it\u2019s inhumane because it leads us to see individuals as the dreaded other rather than as people fighting for the same things that we are \u2014 health, prosperity, and a better life for those in the next generation.", "The Reality Project isn\u2019t about knowing facts so you can feel superior, it\u2019s about using facts to encourage people to contribute to the long ascent of humankind. The \u201cDeveloped vs Developing\u201d myth is a great place to start because it offers an opportunity to show optimistic stats, talk about how our view of the world is wrong, and make gentle corrections. Once we understand why and how the world is getting better, we can make sure it continues that way. As a first step, start by viewing matters \u2014 in your personal life and on an international level \u2014 not as black and white but on a scale, that, even when divided, shows progress and its causes.", "As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.
