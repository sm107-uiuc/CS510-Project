What are the Adversarial Examples? Simply put, Adversarial Examples are inputs to a neural network that are optimized to fool the algorithm i.e. result in misclassification of the target variable. We can misclassify the target variable by adding \u2018proper\u2019 noise to it. The concept has been demonstrated in the following image.", "Today, the focus of this tutorial is to demonstrate how you can create the Adversarial Examples. We are going to generate using the fast gradient sign method.", "In this method, if x is an input image, we modify x into", "where the adversarial input is obtained by taking the sign of the gradient of cross-entropy loss w.r.t input image x and adding it to the original image. \u03b5 is the hyperparameter here.", "For this tutorial, we are going to use the popular MNIST dataset. If you don\u2019t know what MNIST dataset is, I suggest going to the following link.", "To train our model and generate Adversarial Examples, we are going to use the JAX module. JAX is Automatic Differentiation (AD) toolbox which comes handy when it comes to training massive datasets such as MNIST. Someone has aptly described JAX as Numpy on steroids! As this is not \u2018Introduction to JAX\u2019 tutorial I won\u2019t be diving deeper into it.", "You can refer to the following documentation to know further about JAX.", "For beginners, I suggest referring the following tutorial on JAX and its usage.", "Now let\u2019s dive into coding. The code that I\u2019m providing has been built upon the following GitHub repository. I have made the necessary changes and have added some new functions to make it suitable for the application at hand. You can visit the following link for reference.", "Firstly, we will import all the important libraries.", "Next, we will download and load MNIST data.", "Now we will define the function which will compute the output of a fully-connected neural network by iterating over all of its layers, taking the activations of the input/previous layer and applying the tanh activation.", "Remember that for the output we use, z=w\u22c5x+b", "In this tutorial, we are going to use a cross-entropy loss.

Let\u2019s perturb the same image with fast gradient sign method.", "For this purpose, we have defined the function. Here we are using 0.3 as the value of hyper-parameter epsilon.", "After running code above we get the following output.", "We see that the perturbed image has a lot of noise. This noise amount can be controlled by the value of hyperparameter epsilon.", "Finally, let\u2019s see if the noise has any effect on the model classification, i.e. if our model misclassifies the perturbed image.", "The code above gives us the following results.", "Voila! our model has misclassified the input image to class \u20183\u2019.", "Thus we saw how to generate Adversarial Examples. You can repeat the same procedure for the entire test set.", "If you are curious about JAX, I suggest visiting the following page and see what more you can do with JAX.", "Please give this article a clap if you find it useful, it would be of great help!!", "Your home for data science.
