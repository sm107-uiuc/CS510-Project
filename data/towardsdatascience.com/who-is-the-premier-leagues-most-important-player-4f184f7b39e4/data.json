Liverpool have the thing pretty much sewn up (see my earlier blog about how they\u2019ve achieved such superiority), and the usual suspects are involved in the annual scrap to avoid relegation.", "In my \u2018On Target\u2019 blog series, I have been documenting my quest to \u2018Moneyball\u2019 Fantasy Premier League (FPL). So far, we\u2019ve looked at getting data from the Premier League website using interactive web scrapers, and how to use object oriented programming to organise that data in a user-friendly way.", "The ultimate aim of all this will be to create a model to predict which players are likeliest to score in upcoming games. Before getting to the nuts and bolts of neural networks, however, it is worth taking a step back and thinking about the rich dataset we\u2019ve created. We have line-by-line data for every single shot taken in the Premier League so far \u2014 there\u2019s a whole world of EDA we could dive into!", "In FPL, there is an concept known as the \u2018Talisman Theory\u2019. Popularised by the FPL community \u2018Who Got The Assist\u2019 (WGTA), it broadly states that every team will have one individual \u2018Talisman\u2019 player who, for whatever reason, elevates the team\u2019s performance. The Talisman player scores the team\u2019s goals (or at least sets them up for other players), and their team\u2019s play generally suffers in their absence.", "How can we best identify such players? WGTA approaches this problem by examining the Fantasy points that players score. My approach is slightly different, in as much that I\u2019ll think about raw match data, in particular shot and goal involvement.", "Let\u2019s start with something simple \u2014 which players have been involved in the most shots, and the most goals. By \u2018involved\u2019, we mean players who either took the shot, or those that \u2018assisted\u2019 the shot, i.e. made the final pass to the shooting player.", "This suggests that Kevin De Bruyne of Manchester City has been the most instrumental player in terms of shot and goal involvement. We see from his relatively small bubble size that this is primarily due to \u2018assists\u2019 \u2014 De Bruyne tends not to score goals, but provide them for other players.", "We can see this impact when we look at the best attacking partnerships. This considers the number of shots that players have assisted for each other over the course of the season so far \u2014 we see that De Bruyne features in three of the league\u2019s top ten partnerships.", "So we can probably conclude that De Bruyne is a \u2018Talismanic\u2019 player for Manchester City. Of course, this finding was made easy by the fact that Manchester City as a team score lots of goals (they had scored more than any other team in the league at time of writing). How could we think about the Talismans of teams who are less prolific?", "A simple method could be to look at the percentage of a team\u2019s shots and goals that a player was involved in.", "De Bruyne is still towards the top right of the plot (which is where we\u2019d expect an \u2018important\u2019 player to be). This time, however, we see that players of smaller teams are more prominent; Teemu Pukki of Norwich has scored over 60% of his team\u2019s goals, and no player has been involved in a higher share of his team\u2019s shots than Raul Jiminez of Wolves.", "Share of shots and goals is a nice start, though we can get even more scientific. Let\u2019s think of each team as its own \u2018social network\u2019. Then we can think of each player as a node within the network for their respective teams. The weight of the \u2018edges\u2019 between each pair of nodes can then be defined by the number of times that those two players have assisted each other\u2019s shots.", "Note \u2014 we can implement this using NetworkX, a nice little package for network analysis in Python. I\u2019ll not go into too much detail on my exact code for this, since it involved a decent chunk of data preparation that\u2019s awkward to explain out of context. However, the part that actually uses NetworkX is relatively straightforward. I recommend looking through their tutorial, which discusses graph creation, editing, and visualisation.", "Let\u2019s use Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s Manchester City team as an example.", "As expected, we see that De Bruyne is well connected in the network. We note the very \u2018heavy\u2019 edges, connecting him to players like Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling, and Riyad Mahrez. Recall that these three players had very productive partnerships with De Bruyne.", "What about the two other players we highlighted in the \u2018share of shots\u2019 analysis?", "Norwich City\u2019s network is much less strongly connected compared to Manchester City\u2019s (we would expect this \u2014 Manchester City have had 70% more shots than Norwich so far this season). We also see that Norwich are much more reliant on a core of players (namely Pukki, Buendia, and Cantwell).", "The same is true for Wolves, to a degree, though Wolves have had slightly more shots than Norwich, and their wider team appears better connected, with at least five or six players that seem to assist each other\u2019s shots relatively frequently.", "Of course, just eyeballing a visualisation isn\u2019t especially rigorous. Happily, network theory comes with several metrics that attempt to enumerate how \u2018central\u2019 a node is within a network.", "We should ensure that any centrality metric we use considers the edge weights \u2014 a player who is assisting a teammate many times is more important to the team than a player who only assists them once. One measure that does this is \u2018weighted betweenness\u2019.", "In a given network, betweenness quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. In other words, to calculate Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s \u2018betweenness\u2019, we calculate the shortest possible \u2018journeys\u2019 between every pair of players in the Manchester City network. We then calculate the share of those \u2018journeys\u2019 that pass through the De Bruyne node.", "As mentioned, the betweenness metric can account for edge weights. In particular, we can say that the edge between two players who assist each other a lot is \u2018shorter\u2019 than other edges*. The shortest path between a given pair of nodes is, of course, likelier to use these short edges, therefore players with high goal involvement will feature on more of these shortest paths, and have higher levels of betweenness.", "*For the purposes of these calculations, we can say that the length of the edge between two players is the inverse of (i.e. 1 divided by) the number of times that they assisted each other. The \u2018shortest path\u2019 between each node pair is then calculated using Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm.", "So if we calculate the weighted betweenness of every player across the league, what do we find?", "We see that the most important player for their team, by far, is Jack Grealish of Aston Villa. Indeed, if we visualise the Aston Villa network, we see Grealish slap bang in the middle, with very few strong edges between any other pair of players.", "As expected, we see that there is a positive correlation between the share of a team\u2019s shots a player has been involved in, and their \u2018centrality\u2019 within a team.", "So who are the \u2018Talisman\u2019 players for each team?", "Let\u2019s look at the networks for the teams whose \u2018Talisman\u2019 have relatively low betweenness. As expected, these teams have quite an even spread of shot involvement, with no one player (or even any tight group of players) dominating.", "This is the latest post in my blog series \u2018On Target\u2019, in which I\u2019ll be attempting to build out a model for \u2018Moneyballing\u2019 Fantasy Premier League.
