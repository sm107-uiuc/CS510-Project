It is also rare in practice because it does not have a readily available real-world analogy that helps intuition. To make matters worse, online tutorials tend to intimidate readers with complex formula (beta & gamma functions) and weird sounding names (conjugate prior). So in this post, I\u2019ll waive those technical details and supplement some badly needed intuition through visual animations and simulated experiments.", "Beta distribution is a probability distribution of probabilities. What does it mean? Everyone started learning probability by flipping a coin. So let\u2019s start with a coin. First, define p as the probability of landing a head. If the coin is fair, then it is most likely that the coin will land head half of the time. In this case, p = 50% is the most likely value for p. But wait, it is also possible to have an unfair coin that behaves accidentally like a fair coin. So we cannot rule out the possibility that the coin is unfair, even if we observe heads half of the time.", "Notice how I am using probability to describe probability p. This is the essence of Beta distribution: it describes how likely p can take on each value between 0 and 1. Beta distribution is parametrized by Beta(\ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd). Together \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd describe the probability that p takes on a certain value. Here is the only formula you\u2019ll need to get through this post.", "Prior is what we believe before conducting an experiment. If you look at both sides of a coin and see that one side is head and the other side is tail, you may believe that the coin is a fair one. A fair coin has \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd, and the magnitude describes how confident you are about your belief. If you\u2019re confident, then you may assign high values to \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = 10. A less confident guy would probably assign \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = 3. The difference is summarized below.", "Sure, both curve are centered at p = 50%, but how to quantify \u201cconfidence\u201d? Think of \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd as imaginary coin flips before you actually flip the coin: \ud835\udefc - 1 is the number of heads you get, and \ud835\udefd - 1 is the number of tails. If you imagine that you have flipped 18 times, and got 9 heads and 9 tails (\ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = 10), you are more confident that the coin is fair, than someone who imagines only 4 trials that resulted in 2 heads and 2 tails (\ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = 3). The reason we need to subtract 1 is that, by setting \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = 1, we reduce numerator to a constant 1. This gives us the uninformative prior \u2014 we assume zero imaginary coin flips.", "Before flipping or even looking at the coin, what do we know about the coin? We know nothing, and when we don\u2019t know anything, we say anything can happen. It is equally likely to be a fair coin, to be a two-headed coin, to be a two-tailed coin, or any mixture of alloy that has one side heavier than the other. When we don\u2019t know anything, the probability of landing head is uniformly distributed. This is a special case of Beta, and is parametrized as Beta(\u237a=1, \u03b2=1).", "Depending on the use case, we may or may not want an uninformative prior. Sometimes during experiments, we don\u2019t want what we already know bias the way we interpret data. In other cases, we want to leverage the results from earlier experiments, so we don\u2019t have to learn everything from scratch. In both cases, however, we learn from new evidence using Bayesian updating.", "We have previously thought of \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd as imaginary coin flips. Although this is a conceptual convenience, the good news is that Beta distribution does not distinguish the imaginary and the real. If we flip the coin and observe a head, we simply update \ud835\udefc \u2190 \ud835\udefc + 1 (vice versa for \ud835\udefd ). This process is called Bayesian updating (see here for a proof).", "Let\u2019s start with an uninformative prior, and suppose the coin is indeed fair. What do you expect to happen? As we flip the coin, we will observe a roughly equal number of heads and tails, and the more we flip, the more confident we become that the coin is fair. So the probability density function grows sharper and sharper at p = 50%.", "Now consider the case where the coin is biased 20% towards head, and we start with an uninformative prior. It instantly emerges up at and centers around p = 20%. This is not surprising because we are not biased in our prior belief. Note that I also simulated the complement event (p = 80%). This is an important property of Beta distribution: each trial can only end up with two possible outcomes.", "If we start with a prior belief that the coin is fair, we\u2019ll see that the peak (mode) of Beta distribution converges more slowly to the true values.", "The stronger our prior belief, the more slowly we\u2019ll accept the truth if they differ. In the case below, the prior is strong enough (\ud835\udefc = \ud835\udefd = 100) that we are unable to converge to the true values in 1000 iterations.", "If the prior is not symmetric, we\u2019ll see that the Beta closer to the prior converges faster (and its peak higher) than the one further from prior. This is intuitive: if the reality is consistent with what we believe, we gladly accept it and become more confident with what we believe. In contrast, we are slower to accept the truth if it contradicts what we believe.", "For a concrete example of real-world application, let\u2019s consider the baseball batting average (adapted from this post). The national batting average is 0.27. If some new player joins the game with no records on prior performance, we may compare him to the national average to see if he is any good. The prior is formulated as Beta(\u237a=81, \u03b2=219) to give the 0.27 expectation. As he swings his bat, we update \u237a and \u03b2 along the way. After 1000 bats, we observe 300 hits and 700 misses. The posterior becomes Beta(\u237a=81 + 300, \u03b2=219 + 700), with expectation 381 / (381 + 919) = 0.293.", "This post introduces Beta distribution and demystifies its basic properties using simulation and visualization. You should have built up some intuition on what it means to describe probability with a probability distribution, how prior interacts with evidence, and how it relates to real-world scenarios.", "Bayesian updating is a very powerful concept and has a wide range of applications in business intelligence, signal filtering, and stochastic process modeling. I will study some of those applications in the near future. The next post is a close inspection on Google Analytics\u2019 multi-armed bandit experiment (the first animation in this post actually comes from an 8-armed bandit experiment).", "The following blogs covers topics relevant to AB testing, and more in-depth review of key concepts mentioned in this article.", "Your home for data science.
