At the heart of the growing Esports scene is the need and dependency for data science and data scientists. While it may not look like it, Esports has become an employment hot spot for data scientists and data engineers. If you are a data scientist or are exploring new job opportunities, Esports may be the best place to look.", "In an article posted earlier this year by Business Insider, the Esports industry is estimated to bring in over $1 billion dollars in revenue for the first time in history in 2019. This came from a report from Newzoo, an analytics company, which projected that the Esports industry would bring in roughly $1.1 billion dollars in revenue, which is a 26.7% increase from the year prior. A large factor in this increase originates from the growth of investments, advertisements, and media coverage that the Esports scene has built over the last decade. This figure accumulates the revenue brought it from various gaming communities, some of which you may recognize like League of Legends, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Newzoo estimates by 2022, the Esports market will be approaching roughly $1.8 billion dollars. With more accelerated growth, this number could increase to over $3 billion dollars by 2022.", "Based on these figures alone, it not only confirms that there is money in this market but also depicts the growing need for data scientists in these markets.", "Along with funding, one of the factors that contribute to the growth of Esports is the consistent growth in viewership for Esports competitions. One of the most popular sporting events every year is the NFL Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is often seen as the Holy Grail in U.S. sporting events along with their memorable TV ads. Each year, this one event dials in roughly 100 million unique viewers. Based on Sports Media Watch, this past Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots had just shy of this figure at 98.19 million TV viewers alone, along with 2.6 million from streams. Compared to previous years, the Super Bowl had roughly 103 million viewers in 2018 and a whopping 111 million in 2017.", "When comparing these figures to Esports championships, they aren\u2019t too far off. One of the biggest global Esports is League of Legends, a multiplayer online battle arena game created by Riot Games. In 2018, the League of Legend World Championship, or \u2018Worlds\u2019, clocking in over 99.6 million viewers over the course of the Final series (3 games). The high viewership numbers can be attributed to League of Legend\u2019s success overseas as it has become one of the most popular games in both EU and Asia.", "Although it may seem strange for data science and Esports to be related, the connections are very vital to the gaming ecosystem. Similar to game analysts and sports, data is essential to understanding how to optimize gameplay. Like in sports, winning games relies on understanding what strategies work and which strategies do not. By using large samples of data, data analysts are able to discover different strategies, techniques, and gameplays that optimize results to ensure victory. Luckily with games like League of Legends, matches can be re-watched and put into databases to be examined further in the further. After every game, data is gathered and sorted, which can then be analyzed and broken down step-by-step.", "Games like League of Legends are dependent on game data. Players are able to see how impactful they were after every game using the dashboard. It not only shows the past matches, but provides detailed graphics of damage dealt, gold earned, and even the top plays or killing streaks of the game. Along with data provided by game developers, one of the most popular League of Legends websites for data analytics is a website called Mobalytics.", "Mobalytics is one of the largest databases dedicated to League of Legends and other games developed by Riot Games such as Team Fight Tactics. This database contains different beginner guides to getting started, top team compositions, characters with the highest win rates, and more. Other popular gaming websites like OP.GG, Overbuff.com, and even more also provide player statistics for gamers all over the world. These websites have become an integral part of optimizing gameplay. While they are important, tools like Mobalytics are just a fraction of what is required in data science jobs in Esports.", "With a simple google search, you can find endless positions for Esport companies, organizations, and clubs. These positions can range in titles calling for Data Engineers to Data Scientists and even Game Analytics, Esports is becoming a hot spot for data science.", "In a description of the Senior Analyst positions offered by Riot Games, they stated,", "As a Senior Analyst on the Esports team, you\u2019ll join the Insights team \u2014 the group of researchers, analysts, data scientists, and strategists who perform analyses that empower Rioters to make difficult decisions. You\u2019ll be part of an interdisciplinary team and work with Rioters from other disciplines (designers, artists, producers, etc.) to conduct studies and analyses that\u2019ll inform the features, systems, and experiences of our products. Your background in data analysis and strategic decision-making will ensure that you\u2019re an advocate for players and can provide strategic guidance about their wants, needs, and behaviors.", "Gaming companies like Riot Games and other Esports organizations need and are out searching for talented data scientists to help optimize their game. If you are a data scientist, Esports may be the next place you might want to look into!", "If you are interested in data science or want to get into data analytics, check out probotplayground.com.
