After reading some technical posts on Differential Privacy, finally, I\u2019ve understood what is it. In this post, I will only explain the intuitive view of DP by skipping all other definitions in DP such as sensitivity.", "Let me first introduce what is Differential Privacy (DP). Given a query function f that is to retrieve if a user is, let\u2019s say, the number of smokers from given a database D.", "Now, let\u2019s assume that an attacker wants to retrieve some private information from a database D1. The attacker knows who has removed his account (e.g. the attacker knew Bob removed his account from some services), but the attacker wishes to know if Bob is a smoker or not (he might want to do something bad on Bob)", "Yesterday, the attacker queried the system to get a result, which is f(D1) = 3. Today, Bob removed his account, D1 becomes D2 and the attacker runs the query again (just assume no other new information), which is f(D2) = 2.", "Now, the attacker knew that Bob is a smoker because he can get the information by doing so", "That\u2019s \u201cDifferential\u201d Privacy, we can get the private information by the difference between an old query result and a new query result.", "I took examples from here [1] to explain the mathematical definition of DP.", "Firstly, we might need to know what is KL divergence [6] doing in order to understand DP. KL divergence is to measure the distance between two probability distributions. Higher KL divergence indicates two probability distributions are further (less overlapping), lower indicates nearer (more overlapping).", "Now, let\u2019s look back to the general mathematical definition of DP as below:", "At the first glance of this formula, I can\u2019t interpret it. After reading several posts and explanations, especially from [1], now I understand the interpretation. We need to look at the KL divergence as well (from the book [3] section 3.5.1).", "This form seems familiar, isn\u2019t it? It is similar to the formula of KL divergence, having one probability distribution P divided by another probability distribution Q. In our case, P(x) = Pr[M(D1)] and Q(x) = Pr[M(D2)] (M is explained later). KL divergence is asymmetric, which means P(x)/Q(x) is different from Q(x)/P(x), but we don\u2019t care about asymmetric here in DP.", "DP wants to change the deterministic output to a probability distribution.", "Therefore, a new randomized query function, M can be found, by adding noise (common noise types are Gaussian and Laplacian) bounded by the epsilon value to the query result.", "std(epsilon) is a function to calculate standard deviation based on the epsilon, now I just assume that this function can calculate theoretically correct standard deviation.", "Then, query results no longer a pure 2 or 3.", "Now we are just getting the \u201capproximate\u201d number of smokers, with a probability (e.g. 70%) that is correct.", "Therefore, when we try to get private information through the difference between the old and new queries, we can only know that Bob might be a smoker, or he might be not.", "If two probability distribution overlaps (P(M1)/P(M2) = 1, ln(1) <= epsilon 0), then, the attacker will not know if Bob is a smoker or not. Because P(M1) is generating the same output as P(M2), the attacker can\u2019t differentiate the results. Although this can prevent information leaking through differences, it will also affect the quality of the query function. More noise (smaller epsilon, smallest is 0) leads to good privacy and bad quality, less noise (higher epsilon) leads to bad privacy and good quality. Hence, epsilon is the \u201cprivacy budget\u201d of a randomized query function, controlling how much quality you can give up to protect your database privacy.", "DP means that we can get some private information by the difference between an old query and a new query. DP can be understood through KL divergence and changing the query function to a randomized function, we can avoid private information leaked immediately.", "However, more number of queries can still leak the private information (after they get the mean of the query), it involves a lot of new concepts again, such as privacy spent (e.g. the privacy accountant in TensorFlow DP optimizer or PyTorch Opacus PrivacyEngine) to stop the user from querying the system.", "I will be writing more intuitive explanations once I understood more DP concepts such as privacy spent, or epsilon-differentially private. Hopefully, this post will help you to understand intuitively what is DP.", "Here are my resources to understand DP.", "Your home for data science.
