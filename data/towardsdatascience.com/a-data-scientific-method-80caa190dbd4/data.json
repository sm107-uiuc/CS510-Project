This value could be of different forms in different contexts \u2014 but, usually, it comes in the form of better decisions.", "As we venture ever further into the 21st century, the role that data plays in the decisions we make is becoming ever larger. This is because of the sheer volumetric increase in available data, as well as the improvements in the tools we can use to store, process and analyze it.", "However, in the grander scheme of things, the field of data science is still in its infancy. It is a field that has emerged at the intersection of several other disciplines \u2014 statistics, business intelligence, and computer science to name a few. As these fields are subject to rampant evolution, so more so is data science.", "Therefore, it is important to formulate clearly an approach to making better decisions from data, so that it may be applied to new problems methodically; sure, the process may start out as \u2018firing shots into the dark\u2019 \u2014 but you at least want your shots to become more accurate over time; you want your process to improve with each project.", "At Gaussian Engineering we have done a number of projects with the express aim of extracting value from data; this post will attempt to document some of our learnings and formulate a process for doing data science; an inspiration for our approach is the time-and-tested scientific method\u2026", "The scientific method is a procedure that has characterized the field of natural science since the 1700s; it consists of a series of systematic steps \u2014 which ultimately aim to either validate or reject a statement (hypothesis).", "The steps go something like this:", "1. Observe \u2192 Make an observation", "2. Question \u2192 Ask questions about the observation, gather information", "3. Hypothesize \u2192 Form a hypothesis \u2014 a statement that attempts to explain the observation, make some predictions based on this hypothesis", "4. Test \u2192 Test the hypothesis (and predictions) using a reproducible experiment", "5. Conclude \u2192 Analyse the results and draw conclusions, thereby accepting or rejecting the hypothesis", "6. Redo \u2192 The experiment should be reproduced enough times to ensure no inconsistency between observations/results and theory.", "As an example, imagine that you have just gotten home from school or work; you turn on your bedroom light, and nothing happens! How could we use the Scientific Method to determine the problem?", "Science is a methodology for increasing understanding; and the scientific method can be seen as an iterative method to standardize the process of conducting experiments, so that all experiments may produce more valuable, reliable results \u2014 and therefore, better understanding.", "In a similar manner, we would like a standardized methodology for data science; that is, a method which prioritizes the obtaining of information that is relevant to the goal of the analysis.", "\u201cIf it disagrees with experiment, it\u2019s wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science.\u201d \u2014 Richard P. Feynman", "At our organization, Gaussian Engineering, we have come to a method which we feel works well for our projects. Like the scientific method, it is made up of 6 stages:", "These stages will be explained in more detail, and I will list some of the tools/methodologies we use during each stage (our team programs in Python, and uses various open-source tooling, so excuse my bias in this area).", "The \u201cidentify\u201d stage is concerned with the formulation of the goal of the data science project; it could also be called the \u201cplanning\u201d stage.", "We find it immeasurably helpful to get a very clear sense of what we are trying to achieve through analyzing the dataset in question. To borrow a term from the PAS 55 Physical Asset Management Standard, we try to ensure that our team has a \u2018clear line of sight\u2019 to the overall objectives of the project.", "During this stage, we ask questions like:", "Some useful tools/methodologies for the \u2018identify\u2019 stage:", "This \u201cunderstand\u201d stage is all about getting a general feel for the data itself.", "Before you start losing ourselves in the details; diving into the various data sources; filtering on various fields, and walking the fine line between \u2018value-added work\u2019 and \u2018analysis paralysis\u2019, it is useful to ensure that your team has a bigger picture understanding of what is there. We do this after having spent a good amount of time establishing a line of sight to our project goals \u2014 so as to keep them fresh in our minds during this next phase.", "During this stage, we ask questions like:", "Understanding the aspects of your data, such as its overall size, can aid you in deciding how to go about your analyses; for smaller data you may wish to do all of your analyses in memory \u2014 using tools like Python, Jupyter, and Pandas, or R; for larger data you may be better off moving it into an indexed, SQL database (for larger data still, Hadoop and/or Apache Spark become options).", "What is also particularly fun about this stage is that \u2014 if you have a clear line of sight to your goal \u2014 then, as you gain a better understanding of the data you can determine which aspects of it are most important for the analyses; these are areas in which most of your effort can be directed first. This is especially helpful in projects where there are strict time constraints.", "Some useful tools/methodologies for the \u2018understand\u2019 stage:", "(The above heatmap was generated with random data)", "This \u2018process\u2019 stage is all about getting your data into a state that is ready for analyses.", "The words \u2018cleaning\u2019, \u2018wrangling\u2019 and \u2018munging\u2019 come to mind.", "A useful phenomenon to put to you here is the Pareto Principle \u2014 or \u201880/20 Rule\u2019:", "\u201cfor many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes\u201d \u2014 Vilfredo Pareto", "The \u2018process\u2019 stage can often take up the most time; in light of the Pareto Principle, it is important to prioritize what aspects of the data you devote most time to; you want to focus on what you think is the most important first, and come back to secondary fields only if necessary and if there is time to do so.", "During this stage, we may do any or all of the following:", "The purpose of this stage is really to make your life easier during the analyses stage; processing data usually takes a long time and can be relatively tedious work, but the results are well worth the effort.", "Some useful tools/methodologies for the \u2018process\u2019 stage:", "This stage is concerned with the actual analyses of the data; it is the process of inspecting, exploring and modelling data \u2014 to find patterns and relationships that were previously unknown.", "In the data value chain, this stage (along with the previous stage) is where the most significant value is added to the data itself. It is the transformative stage that changes the data into (potentially) usable information.", "In this stage you may want to visualize your data quickly, attempting to identify specific relationships between different fields. You may want to explore the disparity of fields by location, or over time.", "Ideally, in the identify stage, you would have come up with several questions relating to what you would like to get out of this data, and perhaps have even stated several hypotheses \u2014 this is then the stage where you implement models to confirm or reject these hypotheses.", "During this stage, we may do any to all of the following:", "The analyses stage is really the stage where the rubber meets the road; it also illustrates the more sexy side of data science.", "Some useful tools/methodologies for the \u2018analyses\u2019 stage:", "(Note that we are leaving the visualization tools for the last section)", "This stage is concerned with drawing solid, valuable conclusions from the results of the analyses phase. This is the phase in which you can formulate clear answers to your questions; it is the phase in which you can either prove or disprove your hypotheses. It is also the stage in which you can use your conclusions, to generate actionable items to aid in the pursuit of the goal (if appropriate).", "We usually aim to create a list of conclusions or \u2018findings\u2019 that have come out of the analyses and a subsequent list of recommended actions based on these findings. The actions should be listed with your target audience in mind: they want to know succinctly what was found and what they can do with/about it.", "In this phase we may do any to all of the following:", "Some useful tools/methodologies for the \u2018conclude\u2019 stage:", "Arguably the most important step in the Data Scientific Method is the \u2018communicate\u2019 phase; this is the phase in which you ensure that your client/audience/stakeholders understand the conclusions that you have drawn from their data.", "They should also be presented with these in such a way that they can act on them \u2014 so if you do not recommend actions, the conclusions should then be presented so as to stimulate ideas for action, within them.", "This is the phase in which you package your findings and conclusions in beautiful, easy-to-understand visualizations, presentations, reports and/or applications.", "In this phase we may do any to all of the following:", "Some useful tools/methodologies for the \u2018communicate\u2019 stage:", "Now it is all very well to go through the process as stated thus far; after all, it should result in some sound information. Really though, to realize any benefits of this data, something should be done with the information obtained from it!", "Like the Scientific Method, ours is an iterative process, which should incorporate action\u2026", "So, to modify our diagram slightly:", "Oftentimes we may also go through the six stages, and there won\u2019t be time for action before we iterate once more. We may communicate findings that immediately incite further questions \u2014 and we may then dive right into another cycle. Over the long term, though, action is essential for making the entire exercise a valuable one.", "In our organization, each new data science project consists of several of these cycles. Communication of results often sparks new discussions and opens up new questions and avenues for exploration; if our conclusions result in actions which yield favorable results? We know we are doing something right.", "\u201cWithout data, you\u2019re just another person with an opinion.\u201d \u2014 W. Edwards Deming", "For the original version of this article, click here.
