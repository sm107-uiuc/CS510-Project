You have to think about a vast amount of technical details and at the same time build something easy and enjoyable to use. Let\u2019s say you have those areas covered. The question remains \u2014 which technology should you use? R or Python?", "Today we\u2019ll compare two technologies for building web applications \u2014 Python\u2019s Dash and R\u2019s Shiny. After reading this article, you\u2019ll know how these two compare and when it\u2019s better to use one over the other. You\u2019ll also see if it\u2019s worth it to make a long-term switch to either.", "Both technologies are compared in the following areas:", "Let\u2019s start with Python\u2019s Dash. It is a Python framework used for building web applications. It\u2019s written in Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, so it\u2019s an ideal candidate for creating dashboards. If you\u2019re a heavy Python user, Dash will allow you to express your analysis quickly and visually.", "Here\u2019s an example dashboard you can create with Dash:", "Want to see more dashboard examples? Check out Plotly\u2019s official app gallery.", "On the other hand, R Shiny is an open-source package for building web applications with R. It provides a robust web framework for developing any sort of apps, not only dashboards.", "Shiny is easy and intuitive to use, as you\u2019ll see in the examples below. It also doesn\u2019t require any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge \u2014 but this is helpful if you want extra customizability.", "Here\u2019s an example dashboard you can create with Shiny:", "What else can you do with Shiny? You can find an excellent collection of demo Shiny dashboards here.", "Winner: Tie. You can develop identical solutions with both Dash and Shiny.", "Every web framework comes with a chunk of code needed for the application to run. You can\u2019t avoid writing this code, or at least copying it from a previous project.", "This section will show you just how much code is needed to start a Dash and a Shiny application. You will create two identical applications by the end, each showing only a single H3. Let\u2019s begin with Dash.", "So eleven lines in total, and you haven\u2019t imported any data visualization library. Three lines are empty \u2014 used for formatting purposes. In general \u2014 not bad. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s the deal with Shiny:", "Only nine lines here, of which three are empty. Here\u2019s the corresponding application:", "Winner: R Shiny. Does it really matter much, though? It\u2019s only boilerplate code, after all. At this initial stage \u2014 no, it seems like it doesn\u2019t matter. However, for more advanced applications, Dash requires a lot more boilerplate code than Shiny does.", "For instance, there are no reactive intermediate variables with Dash, which is a big drawback. We\u2019ll return to this theme of Shiny ease-of-use throughout the article.", "Let\u2019s continue our comparison by taking a look at UI elements. The goal is to create the same form-based application in both Dash and Shiny.", "The application should be used to filter job candidates by level, skills, and experience. It also allows you to specify additional points of interest.", "Let\u2019s start with Python\u2019s Dash. All of the core UI components are available in the dash_core_componenetslibrary. The convention is to import it abbreviated as dcc. Other imports and boilerplate remain the same.", "Here\u2019s the code for a simple form-based application:", "Yeah, not the prettiest. Dash doesn\u2019t include too many styles by default, so you\u2019ll have to do it independently.", "Let\u2019s replicate the same application with R and Shiny:", "As you can see, Shiny includes a ton more styling straight out of the box. Shiny applications look better than Dash applications by default. However, who wants their apps to look \u201cdefault\u201d anyway? We\u2019ll cover custom styling in the next section.", "Winner: R Shiny. You can create a better-looking application with less code.", "Nobody likes a generic-looking application. The aesthetics of your app are tied directly with how users feel about it. With advancements in design, we\u2019re used to commercial apps looking spectacular. That doesn\u2019t mean developing great-looking apps is easy, especially for developers.", "Still, adding a touch of syle through CSS is more or less a must for your app. This section compares how easy it is to add styles to both Dash and Shiny if the same stylesheets look identical across the two.", "Who knows, maybe default stylings on Shiny will come as a drawback. Later, we\u2019ll compare how easy it is to add custom CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to your app.", "A CSS file for the Dash application goes to the assets folder and in the www folder for Shiny apps. Create these folders in a root directory, where your application file is.", "Here\u2019s the complete CSS for both Dash and Shiny \u2014 called main.css:", "Let\u2019s now use it to create a simple styled application \u2014 first with Dash:", "As you can see, the stylings work just as for any regular web application. That\u2019s because Dash didn\u2019t add its default styles like Shiny did.", "Here\u2019s the code for a styled R Shiny app:", "Well, that obviously doesn\u2019t look right. The more elaborate default Shiny styling is conflicting with our custom styling. Shiny needs a bit more work with stylings than Dash, but that\u2019s something you can quickly get used to.", "Still, the included styling with default Shiny apps means that there is a bit more work required to add custom styling to a Shiny app than a Dash app at a basic level.", "Winner: Dash. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make Shiny apps look fantastic, though.", "Let\u2019s discuss CSS frameworks. Bootstrap\u2019s been one of the most popular frameworks for years, so naturally, you might want to include it in your apps. It\u2019s a great way to introduce new design elements and give your apps a fresher look.", "Your apps will still look kind of \u201cdefault\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s mostly because Bootstrap has been out for so long and we\u2019ve come to associate it with a \u201cstandard\u201d appearance.", "Anyone who has been in web design/development for more than a short period knows this to be true.", "Including Bootstrap in Dash is easy. You just have to install the dash_bootstrap_components library and you\u2019re good to go. The code below shows you how to create a navigation bar and a jumbotron in Dash:", "R Shiny is different. It comes with Bootstrap out of the box, but not with the most recent version. Bootstrap version 4.5 is the latest at this point, but Shiny is still stuck on 3.3.5. One solution for addressing this issue is by using the bslib library. Here\u2019s how to make the same application with Shiny:", "As you can see, it is a code-heavy solution. It requires you to specify every CSS class and other properties as if you were writing in pure HTML. Declaring a winner in this department is a no-brainer.", "Winner: Dash. Using Bootstrap is much cleaner in Dash than in Shiny.", "Dashboards shouldn\u2019t look and behave like plain reports. They have to be interactive. Users won\u2019t like your dashboards if they can\u2019t easily change what\u2019s displayed and even interact with individual data points.", "That\u2019s where reactivity (or callbacks) comes in.", "Options are endless here. You can update every component as a single input changes, update only selected components, delay updates until the button is pressed, etc. We\u2019ll stick to the basics and perform the update when any of the inputs change.", "For our example, you\u2019ll have a single text input and two dropdown menus. Their values determine how the visualization looks. The text input is used to change the title, and the two dropdowns are used for attributes shown on the X and Y axes.", "Let\u2019s start with Python and Dash. Here\u2019s the code:", "It\u2019s a simple dashboard but requires a fair amount of code. Nevertheless, the code is simple to read and understand. Dash uses app.callback decorator pattern to handle reactivity. You can update as many components in a single callback and get values from as many components as needed.", "R Shiny is a bit simpler. It requires significantly less code to produce the same output. Still, the syntax might look strange if you\u2019re not used to R (e.g., double exclamation point in front of column names).", "Here\u2019s the code for producing the identical dashboard:", "Winner: R Shiny. Shiny requires less code than Dash for better-looking output.", "It looks like R shiny is ahead by a single point. Does this mean that R Shiny better for everyone and every scenario? Absolutely not. You can develop identical production-ready applications in both technologies. What you choose depends on your specific needs and preferences.", "R Shiny is a bit faster for developers. It requires less code than Dash for identical solutions. That\u2019s if you decide to not use Bootstrap in your dashboards.", "Further, creating custom components in Dash requires extensive React.js knowledge, which is a large hurdle. Dash also falls short with intermediate reactive variables. Using them requires you to create a hidden div to store and reuse calculations.", "An alternative solution exists, but it\u2019s still a big drawback when compared to R Shiny.", "Which one do you like better \u2014 Dash or Shiny?
