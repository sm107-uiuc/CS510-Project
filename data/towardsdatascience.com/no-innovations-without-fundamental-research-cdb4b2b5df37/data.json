Many people do not know what a professional mathematician really does and whether there is anything left to discover in mathematics. I will try to tackle the first problem below. The answer to the second question is: no, mathematics is infinite and there will always be something to discover (you can prove that mathematically).", "The source of mathematics lies historically in two fields: geometry and number theory. Each of us knows the geometry from school: calculating area of triangles, squares, circles and so on. The problem is that this kind of geometry was done by people several hundred years ago. At present, geometry has adopted forms so complicated that an attempt to explain it in a short article would miss the goal (briefly, modern geometry studies complicated geometrical objects by looking at their shape and dynamics. Etale cohomology, stacks, sheaves, schemes \u2014 those are all mathematical terms). On the other hand we have number theory, which focuses on studying natural numbers: 1,2,3,4, \u2026 Each natural number can be represented as the product of prime numbers: 2,3,5,7,11, \u2026, that is numbers which are divisible only by themselves and by 1.", "Prime numbers and the study of them \u2014 after three thousand years of development \u2014 still play one of the main roles in modern mathematics. They are also used in industry \u2014 thanks to research on prime numbers, we can safely make purchases online without worrying about our data. Knowledge of very large primes helps in data encryption. Numbers are the mother tongue of computers.", "In mathematics one makes sure that a given statement is true by giving a proof. To put it simply, a proof is a sequence of logical sentences that begins with certainties (axioms) and leads to the derivation of the desired hypothesis. For example, we could ask if there are infinitely many prime numbers. This is true; the proof is short. However a little bit more complicated question \u2014 is there an infinite number of pairs of prime numbers with a difference of two (we call such prime numbers \u201ctwin\u201d), such as 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19 \u2014 remains until today without a proof. Mathematicians expect this to be true, but nobody has yet been able to find an argument that would justify this statement.", "It was only in 2013 that Yitang Zhang made a breakthrough, which, although it is a big step forward in understanding of twin prime numbers, still does not allow to fully answer the question. Mathematics is alive. There are many problems that mathematicians cannot solve now. There are new answers, but also new questions, because every proven claim opens new possibilities.", "Research in pure, abstract mathematics consists mainly in reading and thinking. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m interested in an open problem \u2014 like the one I described above about pairs of prime numbers. How would I try to prove it? The first step would be to learn everything that was known about the problem so far. I would read and try to understand the latest mathematical articles that address this problem. As I said, mathematicians cannot solve it now, so I would not find a proof anywhere, but only results that could approximate the result. For example, Zhang proved that there is a certain number N, such that there are infinitely many pairs of primes with a difference at most N. We would solve the problem if we were able to prove that we can take N to be equal 2.", "In the first step I would consider whether I could improve Zhang\u2019s result, for example by proving the result for pairs of prime numbers with the difference n, where n is smaller than N. This would bring us closer to solving the initial problem.", "The further phase of research is thinking and more reading. In addition, there is a collaboration with other mathematicians. Reflecting on the problem long enough, I would be able to formulate simpler questions that could be better understood by other mathematicians. Mathematics is a social activity \u2014 it is not enough to find a proof, but also to be able to explain it to others. Verification is necessary. This is why conferences and seminars play such a big role for mathematicians, as they are a platform to discuss ongoing research and exchange ideas.", "Unfortunately, most often the original problem cannot be solved anyway. Nevertheless the situation is not bad, because generally it is possible to achieve a small improvement in the results achieved so far or to notice something that others have overlooked in their research. This is the basis for writing an article, which will be the basis for further research. Mathematics is the cumulative effort of generations of mathematicians.", "Innovation. A word that has often been repeated in the last years. We want our economy to be innovative. We want highly qualified specialists and professions that will be at the forefront of global development. How to achieve it? Knowledge is the key.", "At the core of the fields describing the world like biology, chemistry and physics is mathematics. Physicists model our world using mathematical methods. It is similar in biology, chemistry and also in IT. Without good mathematical foundations, it is not possible to improve modern technologies. The most abstract mathematics plays the role of an axiom \u2014 we base our progress on it. Thanks to it, we have computers, internet, smartphones, planes or space travel.", "Someone might rightly ask why not directly finance engineers who produce useful goods? The problem is that engineers base their calculations on the theoretical basis that comes from physics. First, we must know that something is theoretically possible before we undertake it. But can we only finance physicists? However it is necessary, their work would not be possible without the mathematical foundations of abstract mathematics that was cultivated with no applications in mind.", "The participation of mathematicians doing abstract mathematics in interdisciplinary projects raises the quality of research. Mathematicians have a more formal view of the nature of research and a wider perspective, because they are not looking for immediate applications. They are interested in a complete understanding of the subject. That is why they often devise meta-languages \u200b\u200bthat serve to describe phenomena. An example of this is the formal development of logic that allowed the creation and programming of computers. The first IT specialists come from logic and the logic itself is still necessary to deal with programming. Potentially in the future, the same will happen in economics, sociology or biology, where a precise language is needed to obtain valuable results. Here, I will mention only the theory of games, which has already found application in economics and sociology, as well as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which is based on cryptography (and again the theory of numbers!).", "Mathematicians themselves deal with mathematics because they find beauty in it. The issue of applications is in fact secondary to them. Anyway, it is not possible to say a priori which field of mathematics will be useful and which will not be. The British mathematician, G. Hardy, boasted that he deals with so abstract mathematics that it will never be applied. Fate wanted that his research is currently used by biologists and IT specialists to solve specific problems (see Hardy-Weinberg principle).", "From an economic perspective, most mathematical studies have no economic justification \u2014 they will not pay back in five or ten years. However, they are the best investment in decades because they allow to maintain highly qualified scientists, build the basis for any further discoveries and provide support to teams from other fields and businesses. This also applies to other fundamental research, i.e. research that is conducted to understand something, not to build anything. Examples of fundamental research include: understanding brain\u2019s functioning, a structure of an atom or the relationship between prime numbers.", "I argue that mathematics is a field in which any country can have world-class successes in a relatively short time. Research is cheap compared to expensive laboratories needed by chemists, biologists or experimental physicists. By employing the right people and building conditions in which mathematicians could reflect, one has the chance to compete with the most developed countries in the world.", "Mathematicians do not need much. All they need is time without teaching students, which they will be able to devote entirely to research. The effects will be visible quickly. The higher the level of mathematics in the country, the higher the potential technological level, because it is impossible to understand modern science or engineering without mathematics.", "Innovations are only possible through development of mathematics \u2014 deep analytical thinking and care for details allow to push boundaries of science and engineering, and build something truly unique.", "Your home for data science.
