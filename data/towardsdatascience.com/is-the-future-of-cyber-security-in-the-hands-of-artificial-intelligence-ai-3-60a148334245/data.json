The first level includes traditional static cyber defense mechanisms such as identity and authentication, cryptographic protection, access control, and network filtering, etc. The second level includes proactive cyber defense mechanisms such as information gathering, security assessment, network status monitoring, and attack. The third level corresponds to cyber defense management, which performs a holistic assessment of network status, the choice of appropriate or optimal defense mechanisms, and their adaptation [33].", "Early warning, intrusion detection, and prevention systems, including artificial intelligence technologies, play an important role in ensuring these cybersecurity levels.", "Early Warning Systems (EWS) are used to protect against cyber-attacks and respond as soon as possible. However, due to the new level of cyber threat evolving with new technologies, unlike traditional and pure packet inspection, the new EWS architecture needs to collect, analyze, correlate data, and at the same time detect, analyze and respond to threat models in near real-time. It is heard. This need includes the development of virtual sensors, sophisticated correlation of data, new logic models for network behavior analysis, learning algorithms, and the development of concepts and new approaches that can provide scalability, reliability, and flexibility, especially in IPv6 networks [34].", "The aim of using Artificial Intelligence in early warning and intrusion detection is to develop an advanced, intelligent help system for detecting attacks from the internet as early as possible in both local area networks and wide area networks. Within this framework, widely used internet protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and HTTP should also be considered, as well as newer protocols such as SOAP.", "The main problem that needs to be addressed with the use of Artificial Intelligence in the field of cyber defense is that the available technologies are not at the desired level and what Artificial Intelligence methodologies should be developed and adapted in order to minimize the human factor, which is considered as the weakest link in cyber defense.", "The Use of Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Offense", "Misuse of AI can threaten security in several ways;", "Automation of Social Engineering Attacks: NLP (natural language processing) tools are able to mimic the victim\u2019s writing style, so Artificial Intelligence systems collect online information to create personalized malicious websites/emails/links that are likely to be clicked automatically.", "Automation of Vulnerability Discovery: Past models of code vulnerabilities help speed up the discovery of new vulnerabilities.", "Advanced Hacking: Artificial Intelligence can be used in many ways in hacking. For example, Artificial Intelligence provides automated tools to improve target selection and prioritization, avoid detection, and respond creatively to changes in the target\u2019s behavior. It can also mimic human-like behavior that directs the target system to a less secure state.", "Automation of Ransomware Tasks: Artificial intelligence techniques can automate various tasks such as dialogue and payment processes with victims of ransomware attackers.", "Utilization of Artificial Intelligence in Applications: Artificial intelligence is used to create data poisoning attacks, or backdoor (backdoor).", "Flock Attacks: Distributed autonomous robotic system networks allow monitoring of large areas and execution of fast, coordinated attacks.", "Attacks on Autonomous Drones and Vehicles: The control of artificial intelligence-based autonomous drones and vehicles as a result of cyber-attacks poses significant threats.", "Fake News: When the latest developments in image processing are combined with natural language creation techniques, the public tries to be misled by producing highly realistic videos of state leaders who seem to be making speeches and comments that they have never actually done.", "Personalized Disinformation and Impact Campaigns: AI-powered social network analysis can identify key factors to be approached with (malicious) offers or targeted by disinformation.", "[32] X.
