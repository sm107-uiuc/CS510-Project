These graphs will also show us how characters\u2019 positions shift within the network as the story unfolds.", "Before digging in, a little about the guts of the graphs to help interpret them.", "Nodes. Nodes represent individual characters, of which there are 557 over the seven seasons. To give a sense of each character\u2019s significance, nodes are larger for characters who appear in more scenes, and green for main\u200a\u2014147 regular and recurring\u200a\u2014\u200acharacters. Nodes for minor characters are pink and, of course, small.", "Characters enter the network when they first appear in a scene and exit when they are killed or otherwise die (the fate of 100 main characters). Minor characters also exit if they do not appear for five consecutive episodes and do not later reappear. Those who do later reappear\u00a0remain and absent connections drift toward the center of the graph until they reappear\u00a0and\u00a0reconnect.", "Edges. Edges connect characters who co-appear in particular scenes. Among the 557 characters there are 3,849 edges (~7/character). Edges are added when characters first appear\u00a0together\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0scene. Edges between main characters are considered permanent\u200a\u2014\u200aonce two main characters have co-appeared an edge connects them unless one or both is killed or dies. Edges involving minor characters are removed if the characters do not co-appear for five consecutive episodes, or one or both exit the network. This difference reflects the likely persistence of ties between main characters despite not having recently co-appeared\u2014for example, ties among Stark or Lannister family members despite the separate (and disconnected) paths they travel.", "The edges also signal the nature of ties. Thicker edges indicate more frequent co-appearances, and so \u201cstronger\u201d ties. The tenor of ties is reflected in their color, with redder (bluer) edges indicating more (less) frequent co-appearance in armed scenes, and so more combative (cordial) relationships. Purplish edges mix of friendly and hostile co-appearances, and so may reflect either friends fighting foes together, or friends later becoming foes (or vice-versa).", "Layouts. Graphs are generated using a \u201cForce-Directed\u201d algorithm in which unconnected nodes are pushed apart and connected nodes are pulled together. This gives meaning to the location of characters in the graph. Characters colocated in the graph co-appear in scenes together more frequently. And, when a set of characters tend to co-appear frequently with each other, these characters will cluster together. Characters who co-appear with characters who tend not to co-appear occupy positions between these characters who are themselves located in different regions of the graph.", "Now you know all you need to \u201cread\u201d the graph, and give meaning to the characters\u2019 positions and movement within the graph over time. Watch the graph animation a few times to see if you can track the unfolding story line in the graph, and make sense of the evolving network.", "Several features of the graph will be of interest to us in future episodes. I\u2019ll introduce a couple of them here so we can dig more deeply (and precisely) into them (and others) in later episodes.", "Cliques. One notable feature is that the network is characterized for much of the series by a \u201ccliquey\u201d structure in which relatively distinct clusters of characters play out story lines\u200a\u2014\u200asome much more violent than others, as edge colors reveal\u200a\u2014\u200acentered on the main characters anchoring them.", "These \u201ccliques\u201d, and their central characters, are more easily seen in the next graph, in which clusters of characters who frequently co-appear with one another are colored similarly. Because their members co-appear primarily with each other, these cliques (and their members) are relatively isolated from each other within the network\u200a\u2014\u200athe clique centered on Daenerys Targaryen being the most isolated.", "A transition in the graph\u2019s topology occurs during Season 7 as the graph converges into a single clique comprised of all the main characters. This transition reflects the merging of the previously separate story lines and their central characters into a single alliance in the face of the growing White Walker threat.", "Small Worlds. A second is that, prior to the convergence in Season 7, several main characters, rather than belonging to a clique, straddle them, linking their story lines and connecting their main characters into a single network graph. Tyrion Lannister, for example, bridges multiple cliques across the network, as does Theon Greyjoy. Others, Jon Snow, for instance, both center a clique, and bridge between them.", "This topology\u2014densely interconnected cliques linked by a small number of bridges\u200a\u2014\u200ais signature \u201csmall world\u201d networks, which are ubiquitous in social (as well as biological and technical) systems. And so it is intriguing to see this topology also arise in these fictitious Lands, with or without the intention of the series\u2019 creators/writers.", "In a small world network, despite most nodes connected primarily to a relatively small number of other nodes within a clique, the paths between them are short\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0result\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0small number of nodes\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cbridge\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0cliques. Small World network structures exhibit important features, including rapid spread of information through the network in only a few steps, and robustness to the loss of nodes, most of which have little effect on the length of paths or cliquey-ness of the network.", "This robustness is apparent both when Eddard (Ned) Stark loses his head and his wife and son, Catelyn and Robb, meet the ends at the \u201cRed Wedding\u201d. As evident in the animations, the graph\u2019s topology is altered little by their exits. Because the characters they co-appeared with also tended to co-appear with each other (their edges are relatively uniform in color\u200a\u2014\u200aNed, purple; Catelyn and Robb, green), their edges are \u201credundant\u201d and the network topology robust to their demise.", "In contrast, the edges of a \u201cbridging\u201d character like Tyrion Lannister who co-appears with characters who tend not to co-appear with each other (and so his edges are multicolored) are not redundant, and their loss can alter the topology dramatically.", "(World without Tyrion. To illustrate this, I\u2019ve posted a graph in which Tyrion is given the \u201cGeorge-Bailey-It\u2019s-A-Wonderful-Life\u201d treatment. With his node and all its edges removed, the center of the graph is largely vacant and cliques nearly disconnected (but for Theon Greyjoy, especially after the Red Wedding), and remains so until the Season 7 convergence\u2026 much of which depended on Tyrion\u2019s connections, and so unlikely in his absence. You can view it here.)", "Transient Ties. Another way to highlight these network features is to graph the co-appearance network within narrower time-windows of the story by dropping all edges\u2014for main and minor characters\u200a\u2014\u200aif the characters do not co-appear in five consecutive episodes, or either or both characters exit.", "Because this graph is drawn based on recent co-appearances \u2014 active ties \u2014 the sparseness of connections between cliques is more apparent, as are the bridge characters who jump from clique to clique as they spin their webs of connections with characters across the network. Watch, for example, Tyrion Lannister move the though the network over time. The result is his central position in the earlier graphs which assume these connections are persistent rather than short-lived.", "In the next episode (link below), I\u2019ll look in more detail at the \u201cstatistical mechanics\u201d of the global network\u2019s structural characteristics, quantifying its various features \u2014 density, clustering, path length, and small worldliness\u2014 and perhaps begin digging into the network positions and ties of some of the main characters.", "New to GoT Season 7.5?
