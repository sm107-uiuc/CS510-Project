Working at tech education company Decoded, I have found it fascinating to see the immense value data skills can bring to every sector \u2014 from banks and retailers, to charities and government. When embarking on such an initiative, there are plenty of strategic decisions for our clients into make. One of the most common questions we get is:", "\u201cWhich programming language should we teach our staff?\u201d", "The data science community has regularly debated this issue, and a quick Google search will reveal plenty of blogs and videos discussing the technical merits and elegance of each language. But from a business perspective, the decision typically rests on a different set of factors.", "Here\u2019s a quick Q&A that might help you make a decision.", "These are the two most popular and versatile languages at the moment. They are both free and open source. Each have hundreds of libraries that simplify the process of transforming, exploring, analysing and visualising data.", "Online data science community Kaggle\u2019s annual survey \u201cThe State of Data Science& Machine Learning\u201d asks the question \u201cWhat tools are used at work?\u201d", "R and Python appear right at the top of the list in the latest published survey results. Python is used by 76.3% of respondents and R by 59.2%. (It\u2019s worth noting that the items that come next in terms of popularity are not equivalent tools. For example, SQL is a language that allows you to query a database, and won\u2019t help much when it comes to data analysis).", "The next programming languages on the list are far less commonly used: C/C++ at 19.2%, MATLAB at 18.4% and Java at 18.3%. All of these languages have their own merits, but when it comes to learning data science they simply aren\u2019t as accessible, flexible and well-supported.", "Typically the biggest deciding factor is whether your existing data science teams already have a preference for Python or R. There\u2019s a huge benefit to working within a consistent environment because:", "So if your existing data scientists mainly use Python, go with Python. If they spend most of their time in R, go for R.", "Yes! Kaggle\u2019s survey revealed that while Python was more popular overall, R was more popular among statisticians. R can be a good choice because it has been purpose-built for statistical analysis.", "This means that many common statistical tools are built into R (whereas Python relies more on external packages). Traditionally, R has also had a bigger range of statistical and specialist visualisation packages. However, as Python has become more popular, it has started to catch up. These days, pretty much anything you can do in R can be easily replicated in Python.", "Q. OK, I think I\u2019ve made my decision. What if it turns out I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake?", "Don\u2019t panic. As you might have noticed, the Kaggle survey revealed that Python was used by 76.3% respondents and R by 59.2% \u2014 so there\u2019s a huge overlap among the community. Most data scientists are comfortable using both tools, even if they have an opinionated preference for one.", "Learning either language will make picking up the other far simpler. Don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s a lot more to learn beyond the programming itself\u2014 from maths and statistical concepts, to data pipelines and visualisation. Either language makes an excellent base to explore those topics, and begin your journey as a data scientist.", "Your home for data science.
