Often, the result of this can be poorly documented and difficult-to-use code, especially after the original graduate student (who wrote it) has graduated and left. For this reason, when I developed some data analysis scripts during my grad school research, I decided I wanted to try and document/demonstrate it as well as I could so that any future users could use it intuitively. The result of my efforts is this landing page.", "I was able to generate this website with GitHub Pages, which is a service that allows you to easily host a static website for your repository. Doing this is extremely simple, and your website will be at the URL:", "For simplicity, we don\u2019t want a user that clones our master branch to also see all the of the HTML/CSS/JS files that will be associated with our project website. To get around this issue, we can use something called an orphan branch \u2014 essentially a branch that sits at the root of the tree with no previous commits. Then, by having all of our website files live in the orphan branch, when the repository is cloned, only the files on master will be shown by default (though anyone can still go to the website branch if they wish).", "We create our orphan branch, which we will call gh-pages with the following command:", "This is the part that I found the scariest when I first did this. You are going to remove everything from your folder in order to clear the gh-pages branch. Don\u2019t worry, your master branch files are not gone! Use the following command:", "You will notice that all the files will vanish from your local working directory, which is what freaked me out the first time I did this. Again, do not worry, everything will be fine!", "Now, add your index.html file, along with any CSS stylesheets, Javascript, and other resources your website would need to run into your local working directory. Now stage and commit your changes:", "Finally, we want to make sure we are pushing our changes to the appropriate branch (gh-pages).", "Navigate online to your GitHub repository and go to the settings. As you scroll down, you will notice a section titled \u201cGitHub Pages\u201d. Under the area titled \u201cSource\u201d, you will see a drop-down menu, which you can use to select the branch from which to build your website. We will go ahead and select gh-pages.", "Wait a couple minutes, and BAM! Your site should be live! Navigate your browser to https://<username>.github.io/<repo_name> to see your wonderful creation.", "As you continue to edit your website and source code, you will quickly notice that you will have to keep switching between your two branches:", "Although simple, this may become cumbersome after a while \u2014 fortunately, we can use feature called worktree to create separate directories for each of these branches.", "First, let\u2019s either create a separate, new directory with the same name as our repository, or clear out our local working directory. If we clear out the current directory, we want to remove all the git tracking info, which we can do with the following:", "Now, let\u2019s re-clone our repository into a subdirectory. We\u2019ll call this directory source and it will be where we keep all our source code.", "You will notice that you now have a folder called source with all the files from the master branch. Now let\u2019s create a new directory called gh-pages that will house all our website files:", "Now, we use worktree and make our gh-pages directory correspond to the remote gh-pages branch.", "And you\u2019re done! Now, you will notice that when you go to the gh-pages directory, you will only see the files on the gh-pages branch, and if you run a git branch command, you will see that you are on the master when in the source directory, and gh-pages when in the gh-pages directory.", "You can now freely edit both your repository website and source code at the same time, and you have an awesome landing page for your project on GitHub!", "Thank you for reading! You can see some of my work at my personal GitHub page.
