In this article, I will walk you through the Algorithm and Implementation of Decision Tree Regression with a real-world example.", "Decision Tree is one of the most commonly used, practical approaches for supervised learning. It can be used to solve both Regression and Classification tasks with the latter being put more into practical application.", "It is a tree-structured classifier with three types of nodes. The Root Node is the initial node which represents the entire sample and may get split further into further nodes. The Interior Nodes represent the features of a data set and the branches represent the decision rules. Finally, the Leaf Nodes represent the outcome. This algorithm is very useful for solving decision-related problems.", "With a particular data point, it is run completely through the entirely tree by answering True/False questions till it reaches the leaf node. The final prediction is the average of the value of the dependent variable in that particular leaf node. Through multiple iterations, the Tree is able to predict a proper value for the data point.", "The above diagram is a representation for the implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm. Decision trees have an advantage that it is easy to understand, lesser data cleaning is required, non-linearity does not affect the model\u2019s performance and the number of hyper-parameters to be tuned is almost null. However, it may have an over-fitting problem, which can be resolved using the Random Forest algorithm which will be explained in the next article.", "In this example, we will go through the implementation of Decision Tree Regression, in which we will predict the revenue of an ice cream shop based on the temperature in an area for 500 days.", "In this data, we have one independent variable Temperature and one independent variable Revenue which we have to predict. In this problem, we have to build a Decision Tree Regression Model which will study the correlation between the Temperature and Revenue of the Ice Cream Shop and predict the revenue for the ice cream shop based on the temperature on a particular day.", "The first step will always consist of importing the libraries that are needed to develop the ML model. The NumPy, matplotlib and the Pandas libraries are imported.", "In this step, we shall use pandas to store the data obtained from my github repository and store it as a Pandas DataFrame using the function \u2018pd.read_csv\u2019. In this, we assign the independent variable (X) to the \u2018Temperature\u2019 column and the dependent variable (y) to the \u2018Revenue\u2019 column.", "In the next step, we have to split the dataset as usual into the training set and the test set. For this we use test_size=0.05 which means that 5% of 500 data rows (25 rows) will only be used as test set and the remaining 475 rows will be used as training set for building the model.", "We import the DecisionTreeRegressor class from sklearn.tree and assign it to the variable \u2018regressor\u2019. Then we fit the X_train and the y_train to the model by using theregressor.fit function. We use the reshape(-1,1) to reshape our variables to a single column vector.", "In this step, we predict the results of the test set with the model trained on the training set values using the regressor.predict function and assign it to \u2018y_pred\u2019.", "In this step, we shall compare and display the values of y_test as \u2018Real Values\u2019 and y_pred as \u2018Predicted Values\u2019 in a Pandas dataframe.", "From the above values, we infer that the model is able to predict the values of the y_test with a good accuracy.", "In this graph, the Real values are plotted with \u201cRed\u201d color and the Predicted values are plotted with \u201cGreen\u201d color. The plot of the Decision Tree Regression model is also drawn in \u201cBlack\u201d color.", "I am attaching a link of my github repository where you can find the Google Colab notebook and the data files for your reference.", "I do hope that I have been able to explain the ML code for building a Decision Tree Regression model with an example.", "You can also find the explanation of the program for other Regression models below:", "We will come across the more complex models of Regression, Classification and Clustering in the upcoming articles.
