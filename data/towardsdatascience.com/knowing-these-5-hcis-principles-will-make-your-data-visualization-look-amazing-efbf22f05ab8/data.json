There, I came to know about various human psyche principles presented in the domain. I was so excited to explore multiple such principles from the view of the Data Visualization. Data visualization is a high bandwidth connection between data on a computer system and the human brain, facilitated by visual communication so by understanding how different psyche principles influence human behavior; we can design our products (Viz, Graphic, UI/UX, and so on.) to elicit specific responses and actions from our users. We can create a significant impact by being more empathetic and user-centric.", "Here I will share how five different HCI\u2019s principles can help us create impactful visualization.", "If you want to understand something, you first have to imagine that what you are hearing or reading is true and take it from there. \u2014 George Miller", "Miller\u2019s law, proposed by George Miller, tells us that we can only keep around seven items in our working memory. Anything beyond that is tough to recall. Having more than seven elements generates confusion and loss of focus of the user, who can no longer remember the information he/she now is looking for.", "Creating a dashboard with more than seven different objective-wise elements is not good. Instead, if we have ten charts to incorporate in a dashboard, we can chunk them and make two dashboards. In simple terms, we can say that Miller\u2019s Law is trying to say that we should reduce information overload (cognitive load) and the visualization\u2019s complexity.", "Which one do you find easy to read and remember, A or B?", "I am sure Portugal 763,199 is easy to remember than Portugal 763199, so in B, we used Miller\u2019s law. A straightforward approach to implement Miller\u2019s law is to chunk as chunking form seems easier to scan and less daunting to complete.", "Design for patterns for which users are accustomed. \u2014 Jakob Nielsen", "Jakob Nielsen, one of the world\u2019s most influential designers, proposed Jakob\u2019s law. It states that users favor familiar experiences. They tend to prefer visualization/charts similar to those they have already explored. They already know what/how such charts represented as they will require less effort to understand. So we can say familiarity is security, and users love the well known.", "Please, remember this graph and what it is trying to say.", "Does this mean we should copy a popular visualization? Not exactly. Instead, we should study such great design in the community we\u2019re designing for by conducting depth analysis and focusing on how the expert, designs for similar needs.", "Our goal here is to identify famous styles within the industry we\u2019re designing. Inclining with known manner will help us establish the right user expectations and create familiar experiences.", "I hope you still remember the graph I requested you. Now, Do you find any difference in the charts and its objective?", "I bet, you do. Yes, As we already saw the bar graphs for Number of Students, our mind already capture it and whenever we see the title Number of students we immediatly incline bar chart with it but here I put the bar chart to student performance thus it creates little time to think for user to adjust with new information.Using this law, we can pursue users not to think much while enjoying the visualization.", "If you want people to remember something, make it stand out. \u2014 Hedwig von Restorff", "Eight-seven years ago, Hedwig von Restorff, a German psychiatrist, conducted a memory experiment. She gave people a list of similar but distinct items. One item on the list was a unique color from the opposite things. When Hedwig asked her research participants to remember the list, she found that the uniquely colored item\u2019s recall rate was drastically higher than the other stuff. Thus the Von Restorff Effect or isolation effect or specific encoding states that when we see a group of similar objects, we\u2019ll often remember the one that mostly differs from the others.", "Here we highlighted the concerned (essential aspects) country, Netherlands, only thus attracting user attention. This principle makes all the difference when we\u2019re trying to help users remember. Mostly size, color, and shapes are used to apply this principle.", "In the attention economy, anyone trying to connect with an audience must treat the user\u2019s time as the ultimate resource. \u2014 Jakob Nielsen", "Jakob Nielsen (Remembered this name!?), one of the world\u2019s most influential designers, discovered F-Pattern, the most cited and the most useful eye tracking resources in the design community. The F-pattern represents where a viewer typically focuses on the sites/visualization, following the letter F (\u2018F\u2019 means fast). This report suggests that:", "Our visualization should design for scanning, not reading, so the best content should be anchored across the top with left corner precedence. This spot is guaranteed to get noticed as using this will make the reading experience engaging. However, we should also think in a way that if someone is scanning our viz finds it attractive, they will read so we can place information in places outside the F too.", "Here we see on A that centering the content creates a little gap in the design; thus, it consumes user time of exploration; however, on B, we align the text on the left so the user immediately starts absorbing the content (Some of us might disagree with this, but I used this for understanding purposes only.)Thus there is a pattern of F.", "Making sure to stick with the F-pattern will ensure our visualization make a meaningful impression on our audience.If you want to explore more about such patterns, Here are some worth checking: Gutenberg Diagram, Layer-cake pattern, Spotted pattern, and Commitment pattern, etc.,", "Reduce the number of stimuli and get a faster decision-making process. \u2014 William Edmund Hick", "Hick\u2019s law or the Hick-Hyman law or rate of gain of information, proposed by British and an American psychologist team of William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, tells that the time it takes for a person to decide as a result of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of options will increase the decision time logarithmically.", "In layman term: The more there is to pick from, the longer we\u2019ll take to select. Do you feel this resembles with K.I.S.S (Keep It Short and Simple) design approach?", "Yes, K.I.S.S., Echos the Hick\u2019s Law. The K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Silly or Keep It Short and Simple) originated from Hick\u2019s law, causing simplicity in its design and development. Hick\u2019s law\u2019s objective is to try and simplify the decision-making process, not eliminate that process. And we can say it is all about how we arrange our information architecture.", "So in visualization, providing vast information will give rise to more choices (info), and the user will take a longer time to pick one. (Remember, we do not use Hick\u2019s law in a segregated manner. We always combine it with other HCI\u2019s principles.)", "Information overload in our visualization directly affects the principle of Hick\u2019s law as we \u201cmight\u201d start by trying to decide what to grab next. Still, pretty soon we\u2019re going to, err\u2026", "Here on A, we have many options to pick from, and our user will take a couple of moments to decide which to choose. On B, we have three options, so there is not so much need for decision time. Thus, in B, we used Hick\u2019s law. Shortening the long lists and reducing the number of options possible is a straightforward approach for implementing Hick\u2019s law. In cases where long lists are inevitable, we should limit the number of options the user can view at a single time to make scanning more comfortable and faster.", "Thus, if you made this far, We can see that proper use of the above principles in an efficient manner will bring our visualization to the next level. Using these principles, we will present data in the best possible way to satisfy our audience\u2019s needs. Next time when you jump into making the design, think where and how you can apply these principles.", "There are three responses to a piece of design \u2014 yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for.", "If you have any queries regarding the article or want to work together on your next data visualization project, ping me on LinkedIn.", "This article was voluntarily contributed to the blog at vizartpandey.com.", "Your home for data science.
