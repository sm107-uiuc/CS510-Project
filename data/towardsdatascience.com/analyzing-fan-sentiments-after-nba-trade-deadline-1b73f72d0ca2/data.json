With some clear winners and other doubted for their choices, it has clearly been an orchestra of mixed sentiment. However, before I explain my reason for writing this post, I\u2019d like to give Non-NBA fans some background on what was happening a week ago.", "As the trade deadline for the NBA Season \u201819\u201320 was approaching on February 6th 2020, fans were eagerly waiting for \u201cWoj bombs\u201d to drop, while rumors were spreading far and wide on different platforms through various personnel. There is so much to be said about these rumors, because at least some of them, came to be true in some form or another.", "This really caused an eruption on twitter and I enjoyed it watching the tweets roll over, trying to grasp the sentiment of each fan.", "The players and media reactions are easy to deduce, but when you have so many fans for 30 different teams, how exactly do you tell who\u2019s upset and who\u2019s not? Well, some teams are visibly upset for losing a good player and not getting much in return, while others may be expressing their unhappiness in smaller numbers.", "So, I did a little digging and recovered tweets from the last 10 days for the teams that were the most affected by this trade deadline. My goal is to understand the overall fan sentiment of these teams and see how they stack up against each other. The 7 teams I will be analyzing are:", "So without any further ado, let\u2019s get into it.", "I did the entire analysis on Python (Jupyter) and I\u2019ll add snippets of my code for you to follow along if you want to replicate the process.", "The following libraries are required: NLTK, Textblob, Pandas (just pip install).", "You want to start by importing the following:", "I had all my tweets for each team saved as separate CSV files, so I just uploaded them with the following:", "Then I\u2019ll combine them all into one dataset with the following:", "and since we only want to analyze tweets in English:", "Now the dataset is ready to work with NLTK.", "First, we want to tokenize the the text into separate words, so that we can remove stop-words, non-English words, and nonsensical hashtags. We tokenize with the following line:", "Now we clean the Text with Beautiful Soup:", "Next, I will define a function to untokenize the text along with some extra cleaning that may help us along the process. I also remove the non-english words using the corpus of english words from NLTK.", "Now, I have a dataset with processed text and it is ready for TextBlob\u2019s sentiment analysis.", "First, let\u2019s insert a column for the score:", "Next, I\u2019ll define a function that will give us the sentiment output for each row of text in our dataframe. I will apply this function to our rows and get the sentiment score for each tweet.", "We got our scores in the forms of subjectivity and polarity. You can graph them with seaborn using the following:", "Now, let\u2019s calculate the overall score of each team by summing the items. This will give us our final score, which will be an indicator of the fans\u2019 sentiments.", "First I create a new data frame, with each team as the rows.", "Get the teams as a list:", "Finally, I wrote a function to calculate the sum of scores based on the team name:", "The final dataframe has the scores of each team summed up. The higher the score, the more positive fan sentiments are for this team according to their tweets.", "Just to graph our final result:", "We can see the Cavaliers don\u2019t have the best of sentiments after acquiring Andre Drummond (considering his contract expires in 3 months), so they only have him for a short while. Miami Heat, on the other hand, seems to be getting the best kind of reaction from fans after trading for Andre Igoudala.", "Thanks for the read!
