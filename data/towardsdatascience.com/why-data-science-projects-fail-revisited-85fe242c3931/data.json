In fact, according to a recent Gartner study, 85 percent of them fall short of expectations. Why? General industry literature is replete with some common-sense type reasons (Asay, 2017; Taylor, 2017; Veeramachaneni, 2016).", "In critical self-reflection, the ex-CEO of a large insurance company in Switzerland, and a contemporary witness of failing and succeeding data science projects, explained to us why data science projects have a tendency to fail. According to him, they fall short of expectations at the end of the day because project owners often start in search for the problem to a stipulated solution or method and not with the business problem that they intend to solve. The result, he concludes, is disappointment for most project stakeholders. Likewise, it is key to not walk into Maslow\u2019s trap: if all you (choose to) have is a hyped data science hammer, every data related problem seems to be a nail. At the same time, managers and business leaders should make sure that the problem they pick is overly relevant for the business.", "Yet, as applied machine learning enthusiasts, it begs the question, whether this poor fit between problem and solution/method as well as the selection bias are the only root causes of failed data science projects or just their symptoms. More to the point, we argue that the devil is in the detail and that anecdotal evidence from business leaders or one-size-fits-all explanations do not do justice to the peculiarities of different cases and situations. This becomes obvious by discussing the special case of why many machine learning hedge funds fail where there is no obscurity about the business problem to start with, namely it\u2019s the optimization of risk and return.", "A glance at machine learning hedge funds", "The hedge funds industry has been keen on adopting analytics and machine learning early on, applying quantitative strategies to create what people in the financial industry call alpha \u2014 a positive return, often the side effect of a successful data science project. Since generating profits based on a quantitative strategy is for hedge funds the most viable way to make money (no other product/service exists, which can eventually finance current and future costs or investments), the performance of those quantitative funds is supposably of interest to those involved in deciding on big data investments. Most of them fail. Their average life span is about five years. Following the FT, out of an estimated 7200 hedge funds in existence at the end of 2010, 1777 were closed within three years, implying around a quarter of all funds disappeared.", "Machine learning funds fail because of the same reasons, any other newly formed venture fails. Overestimated revenues, underestimated costs, compliance, poor hiring and training practices, technology choices and operational (in-)efficiency. Additionally, this special kind of investment firm has other reasons for frequent failure. They fail because of absurd things such as the wrong funds name (Joenv\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4 & Tiu (2018)), but also because of more fundamental aspects such as the misaligned fee and incentive structure, which has been publicly criticized by investors such as Warren Buffett (John Melloy (2017)). Most commonly however, the lack of stable and high returns, one can call it an insufficient product-market fit, brings down most funds. The popularity of machine learning funds lies in its promise to be better than average. And just like in any other industry, the majority of people underperform, but the difference with machine learning funds is that there\u2019s no tolerance for underperforming. The culture here is contrarian to the culture found in most tech-hubs, where failure is almost glorified. When quantitative funds go out of investor\u2019s confidence, they are dissolved quickly and investors almost always have lost part of their money.", "85 versus 25 percent failure rate: learning from hedge funds to succeed in data science projects", "We share the disappointment of many capital providers for this asset class if a strategy does not work out. Yet, there is also something to be gained from the radical transparency of financial markets, sometimes demystifying the same tools and algorithms used in data-science. In financial markets, no one can hide. Quick feedback is inevitable and delivered fast. In the real economy however, project managers of course want their projects to be successful too, but they only gain certainty in the last weeks of the project. Many projects are not iterated quickly enough and are then suddenly shut down or quietly declared as completed \u2014 to end them on a somewhat positive note. Overcoming a modus operandi of delayed feedback, just as finding the right order and fit for methodology and project outcome, are among the many complex and interacting building blocks, that make successful data science projects. Therefore, the overgeneralization and the sorting of common-sense type reasons for data science project failure by importance, seems in our view a misleading explanatory exercise. That approach suggests the independence of failure reasons and that they can be eliminated or mitigated reason by reason. The data science failure complexity remains to be tamed and we like to commemorate Albert Einstein\u2019s words \u2014 everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. The simplification of complex phenomena such as data science projects including the root causes of why so many of them fail will not bring the sought after insight and project cure; but the willingness to proceed holistically with the discourse, encouraging cross-industry exchange of experiences, good and bad, will eventually.", "Dr. Daniel M\u00fcller works as Data Scientist for ITM Predictive, helping organizations apply algorithmic pricing, warehouse inventory optimization, and transitioning organizations to the machine learning age.
