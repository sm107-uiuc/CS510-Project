We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "Some of the measures that have been suggested to curb the spread of Covid-19 might seem trivial, excessive, and outrightly preposterous, but there is a rationale behind them and they are essential in fighting this pandemic. Let\u2019s face it, we all want things to go back to normal but how does washing hands with soap and water help us achieve this?", "To answer this question we will come up with a simple model that will allow us to explore how viruses spread and then, by adjusting a few parameters, we will see if some of these measures have a significant role in controlling the spread of the virus.", "Imagine this perfect country called Wakunda (see what I did there) where everything is sunshiny and good because they have leveraged the full power of Artificial Intelligence. However, a mysterious and highly infectious disease emerges in the country, and initially, only one person is infected, we will call him Tchulu (Don\u2019t worry he is not a prince). Despite having odd signs and symptoms, Tchulu fails to go to the hospital and decides to tough it out. In the evening he interacts with four of his friends and unfortunately infects two of them. Coincidentally each of these infected friends also interacts with four other people and they infect two each. The cycle continues such that in just a few weeks, so many people are infected and there is trouble in the country.", "To get a clearer insight, let us describe this situation in slightly more abstract terms:", "So we can now use the notations above to come up with some interesting equations.", "To get the total number of cases at the end of a day, all that we need to do is to add to the number of current cases, the number of new cases, i.e.:", "By factoring out N\u209c this can be simplified to:", "And if we express this in terms of N\u2080 we get:", "This gives us an equation that we can use to predict the number of infected people on a given day of the pandemic. For example, in 10 days the number of expected cases in Wakunda will be:", "And the number of expected cases in 20 days will be:", "Well that\u2019s just a preposterous estimation and this is because we have overly estimated the infection rate and as such we will use a much more sensible rate of 0.15", "So enough of the math, boring isn\u2019t it, and let\u2019s get back to the subject matter. Using the equation above we can model the disease progression within the first 30 days. To do this I will call on the assistance of python (If you do not know how to program then feel free to skip the code snippets)", "First, we will define a function for this purpose", "Next, we will apply this modelling function with the following parameters:", "We, can now peek into the data and see how the number of cases varies within the first 30 days", "We get a glimpse of the dramatic rise in the cases within a short time. To get a grip on this, let us visualize the data with a graph", "We have an exponential curve. Initially, the number of infected people is quite low and it is easy to dismiss the virus as a hoax, and all the while, ignore the advice of experts but suddenly, from day 20 in our case, the numbers increase so rapidly to the point that it becomes overwhelming and this mirrors what we have seen in the current Covid-19 pandemic.", "So this brings us to our original question, how do some of these measures help curb a pandemic? To answer this we will go back to our mythical country and explore the effects of stringent measures before considering those of some of the rather trivial measures.", "Now imagine that on day 10 the government of Wakunda recognizes this pandemic and they enforce measures to curb its spread. So first they isolate, quarantine and treat the infected. They also call for a lockdown but this is not necessary because the intelligent citizens quickly practice safe social distancing. These measures end up reducing the average number of people who are exposed to the disease (from an average of 4 people to 3 people). Now let us see how this affects the number of cases within the next 20 days.", "(Here we only need to reduce the E parameter in our initial model from 4 to 3)", "We can now peek into the data to see if these measures result in any change in the number of cases.", "With the measures in place, the total number of infected people decreases from the initial projection of 830,767 to 128,052 which is a equates to about 702,715 people spared from getting an infection. We can appreciate this visually in the graph below:", "This might be an overly optimistic estimate because in real life it is difficult to identify and isolate every infected person but despite this, from the model, we get an intuition of how minor changes in the average exposures lead to huge decreases in the overall number of infections. Therefore the clarion call to stay at home, avoid crowded spaces, and present yourself to a health facility in case you are experiencing some signs and symptoms are not frivolous but quite important in stopping this pandemic. So please heed the call.", "On to a much more pragmatic scenario. Let us say that not everyone in Wakunda adheres to social distancing and that the government is not able to identify every infected person. However, a few smart fellows still follow the simple instructions and they practice some of the seemingly trivial measures: they avoid crowded areas, wash their hands, put on masks and other personal protective equipment while in public places et cetera. Their little efforts reduce their chances of getting the disease, despite being exposed, and this translates to a tiny reduction in the infection rate from 0.15 to 0.145", "Using our model let us check if their efforts amount to anything.", "As usual, we check the new data to see if there is a change in the number of cases", "These efforts, although seemingly trivial, spare 176,316 people from being infected at the end of 30 days. These numbers might not be as dramatic as the ones above but they still show that every effort goes a long way in reducing the impact of a pandemic. We also get an intuition of the nature of exponential functions: that minor tweaks to the parameters lead to dramatic changes in the output.", "We can appreciate the impact of these efforts visually in the graph below:", "It doesn't seem as much but every effort, no matter how little, saves a life.", "The model above is highly simplistic and it suggests that once an infection begins it cannot be stopped and that everyone, sooner or later, would get infected. This is because it assumes that the infection rate remains constant and that no one recovers and ceases to be contagious. However, none of these assumptions is true but still, this model gives a perfect picture of the early stages of a pandemic.", "The main lesson here is that both individual and collective efforts especially early on -when the cases are little and it doesn\u2019t seem to matter- are really essential. In the face of a pandemic, those seemingly trivial instructions such as washing hands and social distancing, are potent weapons that can annihilate any contagion. The exciting thing is that these weapons are in your hands and all that you have to do is to use them; be a superhero and save lives.", "Just to confirm the accuracy of this model and its lessons let us look at some real-world data", "You can see that the curves are exponential and from the preceding discussion, you now know that every little effort goes a long way in reducing the spread of the virus.", "In actuality, epidemic curves are logistic rather than exponential. Consider the figure below:", "There is an initial lag phase where the number of infections grows slowly; an exponential phase where the number of infections grows rapidly and a diminishing phase where the number of infections decreases gradually after which the curve flattens (asymptotes) out and no new infections are reported.", "This flattening of the curve is what everyone working towards and this process can be hastened through our individual and collective efforts. We all have a part to play.", "Be responsible, be a hero, save lives, and may the force be with you.", "Your home for data science.
