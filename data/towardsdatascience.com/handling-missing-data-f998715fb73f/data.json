Missing data is extremely common in practice and can have a large effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data, hence why a huge portion of Data Scientist time is attributed towards data cleaning.\u201d", "Although we explored ways to detect missing data, we did not give a clear solution as to how we should go about combating the problem. In this post I hope to run through some strategies that I\u2019ve found useful and because this is PyTrix, of-course I am going to share some useful Python code that we could use to perform these task.", "Note: The full notebook can be accessed in the link below. Furthermore, this post was created straight from Jupyter notebooks \u2014 to find out how I done that click here.", "We are going to be using the infamous Titanic dataset from Kaggle which can be accessed by clicking here.", "We can see some NaN values in the Age and Cabin columns of Figure 1, but it will be difficult to see how much missing data we have by looking at our data in this way. A better solution would be to use df.info() which will give us the non-null count and data type of each column - See the Documentation", "Before handling these missing values it\u2019s important that I mention, in an ideal world, we\u2019d of done some intensive analysis on the data we currently have because we want to attempt to understand why the data has gone missing in the first place. Additionally, speaking to a domain expert (if you aren\u2019t one) is also an important step when dealing with missing values so that we can ensure whatever technique we use is sensible (statistically) and we can still derive accurate predictions from our model.", "The reason for this is simple, if missing data reduces the representativeness of the sample and can therefore distort inferences about the population for us to deal with this problem, it\u2019s vital to to ensure we are providing our models with an accurate representation of the population.", "Since our purpose is to explore various techniques to handle missing data, we can assume the prior requirements have been carried out.", "The easiest way to deal with missing data is to delete them. Also referred to as listwise deletion, in this method we remove an entire row from the analysis if it has a single value missing.", "Removing the rows from our data can cause more harm than it does justice. In this instance, we dropped 708 rows (20.5% of observations) which is a significant amount of data considering our sample size. This is problematic since reducing the amount of data reduces statistical power of our analysis since this in part relies on a high sample size.", "Additionally, if the reason for the missing data is not random we would be creating a bias in the findings if we decide to perform listwise deletion. An example of non-random missing data is when intrusive questions (i.e. How much do you earn?) are asked in questionnaires. Many people may not feel comfortable to share that information but would have no problem answering other questions. The bias may occur because the people that do decide to answer every question including the intrusive questions may have very different characteristics than the participants who do not feel comfortable to answer the intrusive ones.", "Note: If the variable is missing a large portion of data, we can create a binary flag variable to indicate missing (1) or not missing (0) and delete the initial column with the missing values.", "The next few techniques focus more on imputation which is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values. Listwise deletion, although the most common way to deal with missing data due to its simplicity, comes with its pitfalls. Imputation can be viewed as a way to avoid these pitfalls.", "This is where a missing value is imputed from a randomly selected similar record. A form of hot-deck imputation is Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF imputation). What LOCF does is it finds the first missing value then imputes the missing value using the cell value that is immediately prior. This method aligns with the belief that the best guess is that the data has not changed from the last measurement. We will implement it in Python.", "Now we will perform LOCF on this dataframe and this should impute all the missing values using the cell above the missing value", "Using this method to impute data is known to increase the risk of increasing bias and potentially leading to false conclusions on our data, therefore it is not often recommended \u2014 I am not very sure if people use this in practice.", "This may not technically be the correct term to use to describe these techniques, however I wanted an umbrella term that would capture all the different ways we could use statistics to impute our data. Common statistics are mean, median and mode.", "Mean imputation attenuates any correlation that involve features that are imputed \u2014 there is guaranteed to be no relationship between the imputed variable and any other measured variable meaning that this may be a very good method for univariate data, but not very much so for multivariate \u2014 We can use the mode value for categorical data.", "Again, this may be bad terminology that I am using to title this phenomena. A popular way to approach missing data imputation is to use a model to predict missing values. There are many models to select from though the kNN has proven to be quite effective (often referred to as nearest neighbors imputation).", "The documentation for KNNImputer states \"Each samples missing values are imputed using the mean value from n_neighbors nearest neighbors found in the training set. Two samples are close if the features that neither is missing are close.\". Hence, I removed all the object data types because this will raise an error in the for this algorithm.", "Note: There are also other algorithms that have methods for handling missing values in-built like XGBoost", "If you\u2019d like to get in contact with me please leave a response or connect with me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
