People perform various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases.", "As a simplification, there are no specific product to track. Only the amounts of each transaction or offer are recorded.", "There are three types of offers that can be sent:", "In a BOGO offer, a user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount.", "On receiving a discount, a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent.", "In an informational offer, there is no reward, but neither is there a required amount that the user is expected to spend. Offers can be delivered via multiple channels.", "The primary task is to use the data to identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present these offers.", "The cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) methodology is an open standard process that describes conventional approaches used by data mining experts.", "CRISP-DM is a cyclic process that breaks down into six phases.", "Focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, and then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition and a preliminary plan.", "For the current scenario, we are going to:", "There are two ways in which Data Understanding phase is practiced:", "The transformation from Business to Data understanding phase is not linear; instead, it is cyclic.", "In this project, we are going to utilize only the data provided by Starbucks as it is challenging to work with inherent limitations in data.
