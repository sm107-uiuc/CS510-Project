This dataset contains many house sales and for every house, it lists the house\u2019s characteristics and the final sales price. The goal of the exercise is to build a machine learning model that can predict the sales price of any house based on the house\u2019s characteristics.", "In order to get to such a model, I will use the concept of functions, so let me first explain what functions are and how they work. This will be an important building block for a good understanding of Machine Learning.", "A function is a definition of how to convert an input into an output.", "As a simple starting point, let\u2019s say that a function is a definition of how to convert an input into an output. The function is like a black box operation that works the same way every time. It\u2019s like a cooking recipe where input numbers represent ingredients, the function represents the manual work and the oven instructions and the output represents the resulting dish.", "As a simple starting point, let\u2019s say that a function is a definition of how to convert an input into an output. For example, let\u2019s define a function that does +1 on any input number:", "To make it slightly more interesting, let\u2019s make a function with two inputs x1 and x2. We call the function f2 (for function 2)", "Now let\u2019s go back to the housing price example to understand why we need a function. The goal of the housing price exercise is to predict the housing prices based on input numbers. And since we will have multiple input numbers and 1 output number, this would fit perfectly with the concept of a function as we just saw.", "We can make a function that converts multiple characteristics of the house into a prediction of the house price!", "When applying this idea to the practical case, we can say that the goal is to build a function that computes the correct value of the housing price, with as input multiple characteristics of the house!", "The functions that I discussed above had a perfectly precise mapping. 3 + 1 gives 4 and that is perfect. It may seem easy now, but in real life, we have to deal with the following two realities:", "To find the correct function, we have to work the other way around:", "In real life, we do not know the prediction function yet!", "In real life, we never have the function that predicts what we want to predict. Our task is not to apply a function to some input data, but our task is to find this exact function that most precisely maps a known input to an unknown output. The approach is as follows:", "A second problem: life is not exact", "A perfect function probably does not exist for the data that we have. The best function will maybe be close to the correct answer but not as simple as this. In many cases though, a close to perfect prediction is already very useful! As long as we are able to measure the error of our function, we will be happy if it is almost perfect!", "Now we come to the core goal of supervised machine learning: finding the (hidden and unknown) function that would allow us to convert the correct input variables into the correct output variable as precisely as possible.", "When we input for example the garden surface, the number of rooms and the build year of our house, we want our function to output the house price as closely as possible.", "This function is not easy to find! A lot of Machine Learning tools exist for this and I am going into this right now.", "What we are going to do in practice is an elaborate form of \u201ctrying out\u201d many different types of \u201cfunctions\u201d. But not just randomly, we need a solid approach for those trials.", "The first building blocks that we need are machine learning models. There are many models openly available, for example \u2018Decision Trees\u2019, \u2018Random Forests\u2019 \u2018Gradient Boosting Machines\u2019 and much much more.", "Those models are a sort of optimization machines that try to find the best function to convert inputs to outputs: this will be our prediction functions. There are many models available because each has its own specific way to try and optimize the precision of the forecasting function.", "Each of those models will define the function with different types of operators, but also with different types of mappings (for example decision trees use if/else statements whereas a linear model uses matrix computation).", "In the previous step, let\u2019s say that each model that we can think of has built a slightly different prediction function (a slightly different mapping of input data into the target variable).", "The next step in the model creation is measuring the errors of each model. Each model is slightly different, and since we have to accept a slight error (life is random). But we still want the least error possible!", "We will test all our different prediction functions on a separate part of the data that was not included in the model development and the model that has predicted closest to the data that we observed in reality, will be the model that we retain as the final model.", "We have now built a model: a prediction function that converts inputs into outputs as closely as possible!", "Now that you have an intuitive understanding of supervised machine learning, it is important to get started learning some of the models (the function making tools).", "Here is a list of the most common models. This will give you an entry point for further study:", "There are many machine learning models that each have their own unique way of mathematically finding a prediction function based on input and output data.", "In practice, you apply different models and measure the error on a part of external data. Then you select the model that works the best, meaning that has the smallest error. Then you can use this model as a prediction function that converts input variables into a target variable. This is your Machine Learning model!", "The machine has learned the prediction function", "Once this process is done, we could say that the machine has learned this prediction function, hence the name Machine Learning.", "A few extensions to what I have explained:", "Rather than using housing prices, we can use images as input (then it\u2019s called computer vision) or even human-written texts (then it\u2019s called NLP). In those types of machine learning, people are more likely to call it Artificial Intelligence. Other types of models are needed, often neural networks and deep learning rather than the ones described. But the process is still the same.", "We can also make the learning more powerful by updating the learned functions as soon as we receive new data, which makes the prediction function improve over time! This makes the learning process resemble even closer to the human learning process!", "The goal of this article was to give an intuitive explanation of supervised machine learning. Thanks for reading it until here, I hope it has been useful to you! Stay tuned for more!", "Your home for data science.
