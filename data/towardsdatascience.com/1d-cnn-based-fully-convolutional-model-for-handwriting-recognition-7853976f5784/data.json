Handwriting Recognition on the other hand is a more challenging task due to a large number of variations among the handwritings of people.", "Recent progress in deep learning has led to the development of efficient OCR/HTR solutions. Although these models perform remarkably well in practice, these aren\u2019t easy to train, understand and deploy due to the following limitations:-", "In this article, we will talk about a novel deep learning architecture (EASTER) that solves the above-listed challenges to some extent. This architecture in a fast, scalable, simple, and also efficient than many complex choices for the task of OCR and HTR.", "EASTER model utilizes only one-dimensional convolutional layers for the task of HTR and OCR.", "EASTER: Efficient and Scalable Text Recognizer", "Here is a list of items that this article is going to cover regarding the EASTER model-", "EASTER (Efficient and Scalable Text Recognizer), is a fully convolutional architecture that utilizes only 1-D Convolutional layers in the encoder and adds a CTC-decoder(Connectionist Temporal Classification) at the end.", "EASTER sets a new way of visualizing and efficiently solving OCR/HTR tasks with only 1-D Convolutional layers.", "Here are a few important points about EASTER architecture:-", "In addition to the EASTER architecture, this paper also presents a synthetic data generation pipeline with an augmentation setup. That means you can train your own OCR/HTR system with zero training data requirements.", "Now the question comes-How do you apply the one Dimensional Convolutions on a two-dimensional image. This is a very valid question, and the next paragraph explains it-", "Consider an input image of size 600 X 50 (W X H) as shown in the figure below.", "Here, if you draw any vertical line in this image, you will only cut a single character (if not drawn in white-space), and if you draw a horizontal line you will probably end up cutting all the characters.", "In other words, what I am trying to say here is- along the height of the image you will only find the properties of a single character while along the width you will find all different characters as you move from left-to-right.", "So basically, the width can be assumed as a time dimension where if you move along the time, you find the different subsequent characters, while height represents the properties of a character at a given time-stamp.", "A one-dimensional filter of kernel size-3 actually means a filter of dimension 3 in the time dimension(along the width, 3 pixels at a time) that covers the overall height of 50 pixels(H). So, basically a filter of kernel size-3 means a filter of 3x50 (or 3xH) dimensions (just like 1-D CNN works for NLP word embeddings).", "As shown in the figure above, this red rectangular box is a 1-D convolutional filter that scans the full height of the image as it moves on the time dimension(the width) from left to right. Each scan stores the information of the observed character(or part of the character).", "This information is finally passed to a softmax layer that gives a probability distribution over all the characters possible for each time-step along the width. This probability distribution is then passed to the CTC decoding layer to generate the final output sequence.", "Easter model architecture is quite simple that utilizes only 1-D Convolutional layers for the task of OCR and HTR.", "Easter encoder part consists of multiple stacked 1-D Convolutional layers where kernel-size increases with the depth of the model. The effectiveness of stacked 1-D Convolution based networks to handle the sequence-to-sequence tasks has already been proved in the area of ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition).", "The basic structure of an EASTER block is shown in the figure below. Each block has multiple repeating sub-blocks. Each sub-block is made up of 4 ordered components-", "The overall encoder is a stack of multiple repeating EASTER blocks (discussed in the last paragraph). Apart from repeating blocks, there are four extra 1-D Convolutional blocks present in the overall architecture as shown in the figure below.", "This the first block of the model that contains two 1-D convolutional layers with a stride of 2. This block is used to downsample the original width of the image to width/4. Apart from the stride, all other components of the sub0-blocks are similar to the one discussed above.", "There are three post-processing blocks at the end of the encoder part, where the first one is a dilated 1-D Convolutional block with dilation of 2, the second one is a normal 1-D Convolutional block while the third post-processing block is a 1-D Convolutional block with \u2018number-of-filters\u2019 equal to the number of possible outcomes (model vocabulary length) and with a softmax activation layer. The output of this layer is passed to the CTC decoder.", "EASTER encoder passes the output probability distribution of the encoded sequence to a CTC decoder for decoding.", "To map the predicted output characters into the resulting output sequence, the EASTER model utilizes a weighted CTC decoder. This weighted CTC decoder results in the fast convergence of the model and gives better results than vanilla-CTC when training data is limited.", "The configurations of this weighted-CTC decoder is described in detail in the original paper.", "EASTER 3X3: A 14-layered variant can be constructed using the table shown below. This is a very shallow/simple architecture with just 1M parameters yet very effective for the task of OCR/HTR.", "This model can be easily scaled to increase performance/capacity. In the experiments shown in the paper, a 5x3 variant achieves the state of the art performance for the tasks of HTR and OCR.", "In addition to a novel architecture, the EASTER paper also describes the ways to synthetically generate training data for both machine-printed as well as handwriting recognition tasks.", "Using these methods(well described in the paper), you can train an optical character recognition system (OCR) or a handwriting recognition system (HTR) of your own without any labeled data. As the configurable data generator shown in the paper will prepare the synthetic labeled training dataset for you.", "The following figure shows some synthetically generated samples from the paper, they look very realistic-", "The paper shows some amazing results on the IAM-offline line recognition tasks. The experiments on the handwriting recognition task prove that the EASTER model works really well even when the training data is limited.", "Handwriting recognition results of EASTER are compared with one google\u2019s paper on \u2018A Scalable Handwritten Text Recognition System\u2019 (aka GRCL) where the author shows good handwritten line recognition results with a limited training dataset. EASTER model outperforms GRCL even with lesser training samples as shown in the table below.", "EASTER further shows SOTA results on the scenic text recognition (Machine Printed) tasks, without any augmentations, and with a greedy-search-decoding mechanism(without language model decoding).", "Here is a screen print of model results on handwritten as well as machine-printed tasks from the paper itself-", "In this article, we discussed a novel fully convolutional(with only 1-D Convolutions), end-to-end, OCR/HTR pipeline that is simple, fast, efficient, and scalable.", "In addition to the architecture, we learned about how a 1- Dimensional Convolutional filter works on an image to be recognized.", "Finally, we discussed the synthetic data generation pipeline along with the recognition results as shown in the original paper.", "For more details, you can read the original paper here as it has a detailed explanation of all the aspects we have touched in this article.", "Thanks for reading!
