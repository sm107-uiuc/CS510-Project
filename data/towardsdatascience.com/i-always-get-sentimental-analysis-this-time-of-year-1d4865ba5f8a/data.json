Dicken\u2019s portrayal of that old man\u2019s midnight hallucinations about the spacetime continuum echo our own annual misty-eyed holiday reflections. Or\u2026 whatever. Maybe it\u2019s the memories of holidays past \u2014 remembering family gatherings, childhood presents, and simpler times. Maybe it\u2019s the current atmosphere \u2014 the nip in the air (or here in Atlanta, the massive swings in temperature), the hustle, and the bustle (or here in Atlanta, the traffic). Or maybe, just mayyyybe, it\u2019s the fact that I long for a day when qualitative analysis, specifically natural language processing (NLP), is actually a useful tool in creating meaningful insights.", "What is NLP? Well, according to the wiki gods, it\u2019s is \u201ca subfield concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.\u201d Neat. Why do I care\u2026?", "Qualitative data is the next revolution", "Quantitative data is soooo 2010, bro. As analysts and programmers, we\u2019ve essentially mastered numbers. There are countless scientists, statisticians, and business gurus who are 1) way smarter than me and 2) working tirelessly to invent the next \u2018tool\u2019 to make number-crunching and bean-counting easier, better, and sexier. I think about how Tableau blew my mind the first time I opened it. I think about how far Excel has come. I think about the bajillions of libraries being created in Python and R. Every day, it\u2019s out with the old and in with the new. Clearly, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re done with quantitative. I\u2019m just saying we\u2019re now working more and more with unstructured databases, images, sounds, and, of course, text.", "Our words matter. A lot. I\u2019ve spent countless hours analyzing qualitative data for Hospitals all over the United States. This was primarily under the umbrella of sentiment analysis. Within most of this data lives untapped potential for improvement. It\u2019s gold, Jerry. Why is it gold? Text specifically in the form of survey comments often support, validate, and in many ways supersede the quantitative data we drown in. Furthermore, it exists as feedback from all levels of the organization: leadership, mid-level managers, front-line staff, and the customer \u2014 aka \u2014 patient. This information serves not as a compass but rather as a GPS that guides leaders in their action planning efforts. There. That\u2019s why I care.", "Are there qualitative tools that can do this for us? Short answer: yes. Automating the analysis of this information is possible, but is it effective? We take a \u2018bag of words\u2019 and essentially smash round qualitative data into square quantitative data with a Mario-esque mallet. It takes tons of effort to do this manually, but what happens when we utilize data science tools to speed up the process? Will it achieve the same result quicker? Is it better?", "Let\u2019s compare a computer to a human", "Let\u2019s figure out what we need. In my case, I\u2019m talking about sentiment analysis for hospital surveys where we want to know positive and negative opinions about safety factors voiced by people around the hospital.", "Let\u2019s use VaderSentimentAnalysis. This library is a promising library for quick and dirty \u2018opinion mining\u2019. Also, the author is a Georgia Tech grad, so there\u2019s that (Go, Jackets. Sting \u2019em. bzzz \ud83d\udc1d) Anyway, there are a few foundational notes before diving in:", "2. It\u2019s built on a static library of words, characters, and emojis (yes, emojis) that is updated as the library is updated. So earlier when I wrote, \u201c\ud83d\ude2f\u2603\ufe0f\ud83d\ude24\ud83c\udf84\ud83d\ude12\ud83c\udf85\ud83d\ude4a\u2603\ufe0f,\u201d not only do you know exactly what I mean, but apparently Vader also knows what I mean. Well, or it makes it up anyway \ud83d\ude0f \u2190 this guy.", "3. The output of the method contains four scores: positive, neutral, negative, and compound. More on this below.", "For the purposes of this analysis, why don\u2019t we just assume survey comments are structured similarly to \u2018tweets\u2019. I know they\u2019re different. This isn\u2019t a research paper. Calm down. Point is that folks typically write the way that they feel, so survey comments contain a lot of slang, misspelling, and emotionally charged words\u2026 just like\u2026 a tweet.", "Let\u2019s understand Vader. With that assumption behind us, let\u2019s look at a few examples of text and their corresponding scores. These are straight from the Vader GitHub page. Notice the following: punctuation matters, caps matter, and slang matters. Things matter.", "Perhaps \u2018pos\u2019, \u2018neu\u2019, and \u2018neg\u2019 are self-explanatory (perhaps not as we\u2019ll see), but \u2018compound\u2019 needs some background:", "\u201cThe compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a \u2018normalized, weighted composite score\u2019 is accurate.\u201d \u2014 VaderSentiment GitHub", "So, if I\u2019m understanding correctly, their compound score is a bit of mathemagic. This is the metric that matters most when classifying a blob of text. For example, here is an example of scraped tweets from various news handles and their resulting compound scores from back in July.", "Let\u2019s do this thing. Ok, enough. Install the library on your local environment and upgrade if prompted.", "Assuming you have other basic Python analysis libraries already in place, this is all we need. Now, let\u2019s do some testing on this comment:", "This is an excellent sample. It contains a lot of similar sentiments seen across hospitals across the nation. That being said, if I looked at this comment and had to classify it as positive, neutral, or negative, what do you think this would be? Yeah. Duh. It\u2019s negative. It\u2019s also negative about a few specific categories, but more on that later. Now, let\u2019s see what Vader has to say:", "This is interesting. I\u2019m not sure what to make of the \u2018pos\u2019, \u2018neu\u2019, and \u2018neg\u2019 scores, because the \u2018neu\u2019 score is dominating at 0.71\u2026??? However, notice, \u2018compound\u2019 score is -0.965. This translates to, \u201cyour text blob is very, very negative.\u201d That matches our mental classification, so you nailed it, Vader.", "First, aggregate all of the text (in this case approximately 400 comments) and run the code again on that new blob. Next, if you want to see scores for each individual string, create some sort of loop and push the values into lists for the purposes of slicing and dicing. This is all I\u2019m going to say on the analysis front. Here\u2019s one way:", "Let\u2019s look at our aggregate results. When I manually analyzed approximately 400 comments, this was the distribution of sentiments. It takes roughly an hour for a seasoned analyst with Healthcare experience and an understanding of the full data set to perform our manual \u201ccomment analysis.\u201d", "\u2026and the result of the Python and VaderSentiment code running on these approximately 26,000 words?", "Uhh\u2026 this looks VERY different. However, there is a silver lining. The compound score is -0.6951. If we loosely compared that to our manual analysis, the negative ratio is 0.85, we might be getting somewhere. However, I\u2019m not sure where, yet.", "We have a long way to go. Moving forward, there is a call to action and a few key takeaways when working with qualitative data.", "I leave you with two things. First,", "Pls bring me a useful NLP tool.", "SRSLY.
