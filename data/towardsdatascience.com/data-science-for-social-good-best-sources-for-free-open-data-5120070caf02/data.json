For data to be considered fully open, it must follow certain principles that maximizes its utility:", "Open data is part of a larger set of movements, that includes also open-source software, open educational resources, open access, open science, open government and other.", "More and more, certain types of data have started being considered a \u2018public good\u2019 which, when made available for use, reuse and free distribution can lead to better policy-making, better informed decisions, value creation and citizen-centric services. And this is how, Open Government Data philosophy and set of policies have also appeared.", "Open government is a doctrine according to which citizens should have access to governmental documents and data for effective public oversight. By making governmental data open, public institutions show transparency and accountability in front of the citizens they are serving.", "One amazing example I have encountered comes from Seoul, South Korea, where open data has become the norm and it is used for tackling real challenges the city and its citizens are facing. In Seoul, not only public institutions are using the data they are collecting, but also any business, non-profit organization or regular citizen can access them if they wish to build upon them or just check them for accountability reasons.", "One of the goals of the City Hall is to provide open data to its citizens so that they can use them and build upon them.

Free data is data that is available without cost. Usually, open data is also free of charge. But when it comes to online data, not all of it can be used for free or without restrictions. In many cases it is copyrighted, being the propriety of its creators, and it requires permission or paying a fee.", "Even when the data is not copyrighted, things are not perfectly clear. And we can think here of web scrapping data from LinkedIn. In 2019, the US Court of Appeals denied LinkedIn\u2019s request to prevent the analytics company HiQ from scraping its data. Even so, LinkedIn does not appreciate anyone trying to scrape data from its platform, and warns against it in some articles.", "Now, let's get to the meat of this article: where can one find open data; be it governmental or of other types.

Examples of source organizations are: Food and Agriculture Organization, World Health Organization, The World Bank, the OECD, International Monetary Fund etc.", "The search engine allows users to look for information either based on the larger datasets, sources of data, or topics. Each such element has a drop-down menu which, in my opinion, allows for an easy user navigation.", "Moreover, UN Data provides access to three specialized UNSD Databases, such as UNComtrade, Monthly Bulletin of Statistics Online and the well-known Sustainable Development Goals indicators, through separate individual portals. The UN Comtrade is a repository of official international trade statistics, relevant analytical tables and publications. MBS Online provide access to economic and social statistics regarding more than 200 countries and territories in the world.

And, again, data can be also filtered by country.", "When it comes to data, WHO has a high coverage, as it works with 194 Member States from six regions. And through the Global Health Observatory, WHO provides access to more than 1000 indicators that it monitors that can be navigated either according to themes under SDG health and health-related targets, by category, or by country. Some examples of the types of data it provides are: road traffic injuries, noncommunicable diseases and mental health, mortality from environmental pollution, tobacco control, clean cities, Health Equity Monitor etc.", "The US Government\u2019s open data portal helps users navigate over 225 079 datasets from different Governmental Agencies, which can be used together with the tools and other resources provided to conduct research, develop web and mobile applications, design data visualizations and other.", "One advantage when using it is that it allows filtering data according to location (on map), topics, format, types of data (geospatial or non-geospatial), organizations, organizations types, Bureaus and Publishers.", "One drawback of the portal is that, even though most datasets have valid metadata, there are still some that do not have working URLs that permit download.", "The United States Census Bureau is in charge with producing data about the American people and economy, as it\u2019s primary mission is to conduct the US Census every ten years.

And only a small number of datasets have special conditions of reuse, as a result of the necessity to protect third-party intellectual property rights.", "As a bonus, the portal also provides access to a visualization catalogue that includes a collection of visual tools, training materials [data visualization workshops and webinars which involve working with tools such as D3.js, Qlik Sense, Webtools Maps, PowerBI) and re-usable visualizations.", "This Portal is managed by the Publications Office of the European Union and it harvests the metadata of the Public Sector Information available on public data portals across European countries.

However, their website is designed only for native speakers.", "Numbers for Development is the Inter-America Development Bank\u2019s Open Data portal, and it showcases socio-economic indicators for the Latin American and the Caribbean Region. And it is built upon seven data sources: Agrimonitor (tracks agricultural policies), INTrade (trade in the region), Latin Macro Watch (macroeconomics, social issues, trade, capital flows, markets and governance), Public Management, Social Pulse (living conditions), SIMS (labor markets), Sociometro (socio-economic conditions). The search process can be filtered either by country, or by indicator.", "Below, I have added an interesting article regarding how big and open data were previously used for social good in Latin American countries:", "Open Data portals from Latin American countries", "The Google Public Data Explorer is in part a search engine that facilitates access to datasets provided by international organization (as those covered previously in this article), national statistical offices, NGOs and research institutions. In addition, the team behind it wanted to give more to its users and that is why their aim is to make the large datasets of public interest easier to explore, visualize and communicate even by non-technical audiences.", "Beside the Google Public Data Explorer, there is also the Google Dataset Search engine which enables its users to find datasets stored across the Web through simple keyword searches. When using it, one can apply filters related to the download format, usage rights, topics, or according to the last update. One criteria the source uses for ranking its datasets in search return results is the number of scholarly articles that has citied a dataset.", "FiveThirtyEight is a very comprehensive source for high-quality data coming from the field of Journalism.
