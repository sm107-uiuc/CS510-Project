You can think of it as a dataset. It was a good way to playfully introduce my child to complex concepts. In this article we will highlight through this flowery garden:", "All the flowers in my garden are the exact same. But I had to lie a little. I said some of the flowers were helping our rabbit to grow faster and be smarter. Other flowers don\u2019t do anything.", "For two weeks we picked all the flowers in the garden and put blue sticks for the magic flowers and purple sticks for the normal flowers. With each flower, I invented whether or not it was magic, but it didn\u2019t matter. We had a dataset of flowers and we knew their X, Y position with the stick, and whether they were magic or ordinary with the stick\u2019s color.", "For practical reasons, the flowers will be replaced by dots in my illustrations.", "My child and I made our little dataset with our sticks planted in our garden. We will call it a training set. I now wanted my child to be able to predict from the data available whether the next growing flowers in the garden will be magical or ordinary depending on their position. I waited another week for another piece of the dataset. We did not pick these flowers or even put sticks in their position. We will call this set of flowers the validation set.", "These are the rules of the game my kid had. He had a choice to make when trying to delimit the areas of the garden where the magic flowers grow for our rabbit. He had a choice to make:", "The next rule was simple: arrange the cable(s) in the best possible way to delineate the magical flower areas from the ordinary flower areas. Every time my child tried to position the ropes, I will report to him according to the validation set the mistakes he has made.", "You got it. So it is 3 different models with more or fewer parameters. It could be any predictive model but for example, I will illustrate these ropes using neural network illustrations.", "It is easier to understand overfitting by understanding before what underfitting is. Underfitting appears when the model is too simple. Or when the model is not good enough for the given data.", "This is a case rarely encountered. Besides, my child did not choose the rigid rope. It seems absurd to use something that sounds too inflexible to be useful.", "If my child had used the rigid rope:", "But the choice of this rigid rope is not flexible enough to fit our data. In machine learning or deep learning, whatever the algorithm used (SVM, ANN, Random Forest), we must make sure that our model has enough features for our data. Hence the importance of knowing your dataset.", "If you have understood what underfitting is: overfitting is the exact opposite. The following metaphor is often used:", "My child chose to delimit the magical flower zones with the last choice I had proposed to him: the multiple flexible ropes. It\u2019s always tempting to use too many features rather than the bare essentials. Instinctively, we are all children!", "This is the mistake we make too easily. Why not use everything instead of nothing? Most of us are biased about this. As my child, we too would have made the choice to take all the ropes.", "Thanks to the bunch of ropes my child finally managed to surround all the areas where the magic flowers grew.", "Then we evaluated with the magic flowers of the week which is our validation set and oops\u2026 The accuracy is very bad. Even worse than with the rigid rope causing underfitting.", "I admit I don\u2019t really have a child, I never made up this flower story outside of this article. But my child is the model I programmed. I invite you to consider your models as such. Because if we give them the choice to use a lot of features then we can be sure that our models will use all of the features. Then it will overfit.", "We just have seen is we have to find the right balance between specificity and generalization.", "When training a model, you should be careful to find the right balance:", "So counterintuitively, the model that would have had the best result in predicting the growth areas of magic flowers would have been the simple flexible rope. Not the several flexible ropes ones.", "Well, we have to be careful about overfitting. It is good to know, yet how do we detect it? There are two schools of thought:", "I prefer metric monitoring. I\u2019m not interested in knowing the error distance of the lines with the areas that delineate ordinary and magic flowers. What I am interested in is the accuracy of those lines. For me, the error is used to adjust the position of the ropes. The metric is used to evaluate their position.", "Once identified, the easiest and most intuitive way to prevent overfitting is to apply Early Stopping. If the accuracy starts to decline on the validation set it\u2019s time to stop our training to avoid losing the generalization and having overfitting.", "The other obvious way to prevent overfitting is to check if our model contains too many features for the given dataset. In other words, if our model has a trend to overfitting then we can gradually remove features and/or their flexibility. This allows us to obtain a model that is more suitable for our dataset.", "When we modify the architecture of our model, the learning rate, or the parameter initialization method: these are the hyperparameters we are modifying.", "Let\u2019s come back to the basics. We need a validation test to determine we are not performing any specificity that could lead to overfitting. But we evaluate this performance with the validation set. After tuning the hyperparameters, the validation data itself becomes biased. We use them to \u201ctrain\u201d our hyperparameters in a way.", "This is why it is essential to split your dataset into 3 distinct sets. One to train the model. Another one to validate our training and tuning our model. Finally, a test set to validate our model. This set should only be used at the very end. You should never re-tune your model using this set.", "Another way to prevent overfitting is what is called K-fold cross-validation. Let me explain. When we split the dataset we leave the testing set out for the end. Then we partition our training set into subsets.", "In our flower dataset, we can proceed conveniently. We partition our dataset with the flowers of each week. In the first iteration, we train our model with the first two weeks and evaluate it with the last one. In the second iteration, we switch and repeat the process for each iteration.", "This will limit the specificity to one week of magic flowers that would have grown on rarer areas. This leads to generalization. At the very end, we will be able to evaluate our model on the flowers of the following week, our test set.", "There are other methods to prevent overfitting:", "Yet they will have their own article soon \ud83d\ude1c", "Knowledge is all about sharing.Support me and get access of all my articles in one click here.", "Other images are homemade and free to use", "Your home for data science.
