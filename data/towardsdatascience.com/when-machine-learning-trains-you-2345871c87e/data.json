From personal experiences to lessons\u2026 | by Arun Jagota | Towards Data Science", "h1": "When Machine Learning Trains You", "description": "In the early 1990s, several of us were given a tour by a professor of his house. He specialized in \u201cneural networks\u201d. (Yes, even then.) He had wired up his house to be controlled by a \u201cneural net\u201d\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["In the early 1990s, several of us were given a tour by a professor of his house. He specialized in \u201cneural networks\u201d. (Yes, even then.) He had wired up his house to be controlled by a \u201cneural net\u201d. (Yes, even then.) The main (and only) topic of conversation during the tour \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 was the \u201cneural net\u201d. (The house was merely the backdrop.)", "What I remember most from this visit is the story of how the neural net had trained him. It goes like this. One task the neural network was trained to learn was to set the thermostat automatically. Specifically, to keep the professor in comfort but also the heating bill low. More formally, to adaptively optimize a loss function that captured two competing terms: 1. (minimize) heating (or cooling) cost and 2. (maximize) the professor\u2019s comfort.", "The neural net figured out an interesting way to do this. (Or so the story went.) Consider wintertime. Heating bills can run high if you are not careful about the thermostat setting. Initially, the neural network learned to favor \u201ccomfort\u201d. Presumably, the professor\u2019s feedback nudged it in this direction. (Not sure how you complain to a neural net that it is too cold, but those are details. Hmm, maybe these days you complain to Alexa.) The neural network gradually lowered the temperature. The heating bill went down consistently. The professor adjusted (habituated).", "It seems the neural net had (in effect) figured out that humans can be habituated to gradually lowering levels of discomfort (i.e. after a while they stop complaining) whereas the cost keeps decreasing during this process.", "Reflecting on this later, I did ponder whether the neural net feature added to the resale value of the house. But then again, would you really pay a premium for the added benefit of having a smart neural net habituate you towards gradually increasing levels of discomfort to save a few bucks?", "In the mid-1990s I decided to give voice recognition software a try. I purchased a copy of a well-known commercial software at the time and installed it on my Windows computer. (Yes, Windows existed even then.) My intent was to use this to take and transcribe voice notes, which I would later edit for the occasional errors. Made sense. In principle.", "Didn\u2019t quite work out in practice. I like to think my English speaking is decent, having done so all my life. No doubt there is room for improvement. It didn\u2019t take long for the software to opine where! I\u2019ll elaborate in the next paragraph.", "During my early sessions with the software, it asked me to train it on my speaking. Fair enough. It made several errors during these training sessions. It suggested that I work to retrain it on the words it had gotten wrong. Again, fair enough. However, this dragged on for a month. Several hours a week. And though the software\u2019s accuracy on recognizing my voice did improve, not as much as I had hoped, commensurate with the training effort I had put in.", "Over the course of this month, it started dawning on me that it wasn\u2019t I who was training the software, it was the software that was training me! To improve my English speaking skills \u2026 (Well, actually we were both learning.)", "Still, it definitely felt that the software was implying that my role was critical in this. You just speak better, it seemed to say \u2014 leave the rest to me.", "What? Well, ok, fair enough to some extent. It is when the software repeatedly made the same errors and kept implying that \u201cif only I could speak better\u201d, I felt enough was enough. How long can you go on just the wishful thought \u201cit\u2019s around the corner\u201d?", "That\u2019s when I gave up. I hadn\u2019t signed up for this. It did make me wonder whether the software should be marketed as helping people learn to speak English better, in addition to or in lieu of its current target market.", "Were these merely amusing episodes? Or are there lessons of wider import to be learned? Framing this in data science terms I would characterize what was happening in both cases as active co-learning. That is, both the human and the ML learned. (In the neural thermostat case, the professor learned about his own habituation to discomfort.)", "That said, the learning was definitely steered by the ML. It was in control of what it wanted the human to focus on. (This is most apparent in the speech recognition case, which we discuss in the next paragraph.) Well, I suppose that is what the term active learning means.", "Let\u2019s delve further into the speech recognition case. The initial training uncovered words that the ML got wrong. It\u2019s reasonable for it to suppose that I wasn\u2019t speaking them \u201cwell enough\u201d. Fair enough. So in effect, it asked me to speak these words better. Again, fair enough. Some level of active learning is ok. Its when it goes too far, i.e. when you have expended a lot of effort and don\u2019t get the returns you expect, that it starts becoming a problem.", "Okay, now that we have legitimized this process by giving it an esoteric name, active learning, let\u2019s muse a bit on which other use cases this might help in. Briefly, my hunch is that they are probably all over the place, i.e. in all the diverse areas in which supervised machine learning is applicable.", "Well, let\u2019s pick a few specifics and examine them. (We\u2019ve already seen two. Two more below.)", "Self-driving cars. Wouldn\u2019t be cool if your self-driving car could say to you something like \u201cI have difficulty driving on mountain roads so could you take me for a (practice) spin there? (The \u2018co\u2019 part comes in as follows: maybe you also get to improve your driving skills in this setting as a consequence.)", "Medical imaging. The ML is having difficulty discerning pathology in a particular medical image. It asks a radiologist to take a look. This might help not only the ML but also the radiologist improve their medical image analysis skills.", "Your home for data science.
