A basic theoretical overview of the\u2026 | by Susmith Reddy | Towards Data Science", "h1": "What is an OCR ??", "description": "A basic theoretical overview of the working of an Optical Character Recognition system. Different phases of an OCR system have been explained briefly from a beginner perspective."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["The necessity of digitisation is rapidly increasing in the modern era. Due to the growth of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the wide availability of handheld devices, people often prefer digitized content over the printed materials including books and newspaper. Also, it is easier to organize digitized data and analyze them for various purposes with many advanced techniques like artificial intelligence etc. So to keep up with the present technological scenario, it is necessary to convert all the information present till now which is in the printed format to digitised format.", "Here comes OCR \u2026.Our saviour\ud83d\udcaa \ud83d\udcaa which helps us in performing the tedious work of digitising the information. OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, whose primary job is to recognise the printed text in an image. Once we recognise the printed text with the help of OCR, we can use that information in various types.", "This is a 3-part series of articles that explains various concepts and phases of an OCR system. Let\u2019s have a look at what you are going to learn in each part", "Below image shows the different phases in the workflow of an OCR system.", "Let\u2019s briefly discuss each phase shown in the above image:-", "This involves scanning a document and storing it as an image on which recognition has to be performed.", "We cannot input an image directly for the OCR system. Some pre-processing has to be done on the image so that it becomes moderately easy for OCR to recognise the information in the image. It is like getting dressed up according to the occasion.", "2. Binarization: It means converting a Coloured image to Binary image (containing only black & white colours). Usually, in practice, this conversion of Coloured image to Binary image is done by an intermediate GrayScale image.", "Coloured image \u2192Gray Scale image \u2192Binary image", "This can be done using different methods like \u2192 Adaptive Thresholding \u2192 Otsu\u2019s Binarization \u2192 Local Maxima and Minima Method", "I prefer Adaptive Thresholding, as it binarizes the image with a certain threshold which is calculated dynamically depending upon its locality in the image.", "3. Noise Removal: Noise (small dots or foreground components) may be introduced easily into an image while scanning it during Image Acquisition because of various reasons like low clarity camera, a shadow on image etc.This noise should be removed so that the image will be clean and uniform.", "4. Thinning and Skeletonization: Different images have text with different width of strokes. This variability is very high in the case of handwritten words. Skeletonization is a technique, using which we can make all strokes to have a uniform width (Maybe 1 pixel wide or few pixels wide)", "Once a Clean image is obtained, after the Preprocessing stage, the next stage is the Segmentation. It is a technique of breaking the whole image into subparts to further process them.Three types of Segmentation can be done in OCR:- \u2192 Line level Segmentation \u2192 Word level Segmentation \u2192 Character level Segmentation", "In this phase, we extract some Unique Features of the segmented subcomponents obtained from the previous stage. There are many techniques through which we can extract features like its shape, strokes etc.But nowadays, for feature extraction, we mostly rely on Machine learning models which uses a stack of CNN, RNN(Recurrent Neural Networks), LSTM(Long Short term memory) layers.", "This is the decision-making stage of an OCR system . Classification uses the features extracted in the feature extraction stage to identify the text segment. Algorithms like SVM can be used for classification.", "Apart from these phases, To improve the performance of OCR we can also perform an optional Post Processing step after the Classification stage.", "The most probable errors that would occur in the OCR system is due to the wrong prediction in the Classification stage (this might be due to the poor feature extraction, a lot of noise in the picture etc). In the majority of the cases, these prediction errors will result in small spelling mistakes because of the wrong prediction of one or two letters in a word (like the word \u2018ball\u2019 is predicted as \u2018boll\u2019). So these type of spelling mistakes can be corrected using language models, Word2Vec models (like CBOW and skip-gram) etc.", "Wohooo\u2026\u2026now you know the basic workflow of an OCR system.", "Any doubts, Suggestions, Corrections are Welcome. \ud83d\ude03", "[4] Boulid, Youssef & Souhar, Abdelghani & Elkettani, Youssfi.
