I have done something similar in the past: the Fresh from the arXiv series that appeared on the Scaleway blog last fall. It was great as a means of forcing myself to keep up with what is new in the field of deep learning, but, with the field being such a lively one, got too time-consuming in the end. Despite my favourite sci-fi author once saying", "not everyone can live up to Robert A. Heinlein\u2019s high standards. Reading the arXiv is certainly where specialization comes in handy. Coincidentally, for the past few months I have chosen to focus on Active Learning as it is an area of great practical importance at a time when compute keeps on getting cheaper but data labelling remains costly. To learn about the most cutting-edge research in the active learning field, read on!", "First on our list is A Survey of Active Learning for Text Classification using Deep Neural Networks:", "It starts with an overview of the basic ideas behind Active Learning, the different ways of doing it (e.g. pool-based vs. stream-based, etc), the common terminology used, and goes on to list a few different classes of query strategies (i.e. the choices of logic that the model uses to decide which training samples it would like to have labeled next). With plenty of references, the preprint provides a nice starting point for those interested in applying AL to NLP.", "COVID-19 is everywhere these days, the arXiv being no exception. Correcting Data Imbalance for Semi-Supervised Covid-19 Detection Using X-ray Chest Images looks at (no surprise here) semi-supervised learning done on an imbalanced set of (some) COVID-19 images vs. (a whole lot of) no-COVID ones. Imbalanced datasets and prohibitively expensive annotations are two hallmarks of medical data, so it makes sense to look at these two together.", "The model itself is a variant of Google\u2019s MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning, dating back to 2019 \u2014 much like the virus in question.", "On a related medical note, we\u2019ve got Gradually Applying Weakly Supervised and Active Learning for Mass Detection in Breast Ultrasound Images:", "Here we have what the authors refer to as (a) strongly annotated data, where the annotations are two-fold: bounding box around the mass + benign vs. malignant classification label, and (b) weakly annotated data, that only comes with an image level label. The model trained on the strongly annotated data is then used to iteratively query the user the bounding boxes for batches of weekly annotated images, in the familiar active learning fashion.", "A fairly vanilla application of active learning via query-by-committee and another query strategy involving Monte Carlo Batch Normalisation. The problem is an interesting one though: change detection in aerial or satellite imagery. I never really gave much thought to how maps are being kept up-to-date, but the idea is that generally, maps are renewed with incremental updates rather than constantly recreated from scratch. The task then is detecting changes. The issue is, finding these (typically, rare and sparsely distributed) changes manually involves inspecting the entire mapped area \ud83d\uddfa. Good luck labelling that training set! Luckily, active learning is there to help:", "In Learning to Learn in a Semi-Supervised Fashion, the authors tackle the problem of image-based item verification (e.g. face recognition \u2014 or any task where you aim to learn the sort of feature embeddings that would group instances of the same type close together while keeping the others far away). Now here is a twist: the sets of object classes in their labeled and unlabelled datasets are disjoint. Meaning, the model is asked to figure out stuff (for lack of a better term) about data of unseen categories \u2014 in a way, that preserves those categories\u2019 structure. Pretty cool, no?", "The next preprint that caught my eye focuses on incremental learning: a machine learning approach where the model is being continuously updated with new data, while also tasked with preserving the knowledge of the previously learned information. This certainly is a realistic scenario in a wide range of applications. To make it yet more realistic, let\u2019s say only a portion of the newly streamed data is annotated (hence the need for active learning) and let us not make any assumptions about the class distribution either. So we\u2019ve got incremental active imbalanced\u2026 what should we call it?", "Finally, in non-arXiv, but still very much active learning, news: last week I gave a 20 minute presentation on \u201cwhy some data are more equal than others\u201d as part of the Open Data Science Conference warm-up. The talk is now available on their website as a free on-demand webinar:", "My part starts around 23:00. Check it out, and I will see you in a week or two :)", "P. S. If you are new to Active Learning, here are a couple of my older articles to get you started:", "Your home for data science.
