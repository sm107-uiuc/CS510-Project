C programming offers low-level memory access and gives full control over the underlying hardware.", "Over the years, C became one of the most used programming languages. Besides, C is arguably the most disruptive and influential programming language in history and has influenced almost all other languages on this list.", "Although C is often criticized for its accidental complexity, unsafe programming, and lack of features.
