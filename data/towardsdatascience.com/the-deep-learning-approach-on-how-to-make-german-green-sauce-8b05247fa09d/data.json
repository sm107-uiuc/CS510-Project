Here\u2019s an idea: Use deep learning to prepare a traditional dish. Let me say this in advance: I don\u2019t think tradition reaches its best potential when it is transformed into fear of an unknown future, nor when it is transformed into a blurred memory of a long (probably not so glorious) past. Tradition best unfolds its potential when it helps to enjoy everyday life \u2014for example when it turns into delicious food! In my opinion, tradition often is not a necessity \u2014 it\u2019s a luxury. But that\u2019s another topic worth writing about.", "However, since deep learning techniques are very powerful and there are many potential use cases, I tried to include some of the bits I learned from Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas\u2019 fast.ai course. I asked myself: How can machine learning help me to better understand the everyday things around me? Can I uncover traditions by making them visible \u2014 at least to me? In my opinion, the keys to tradition lies in the many things that surround us every day. In this example, I wanted to use image classification algorithms to share the knowledge of past times.", "I moved to Frankfurt almost ten years ago. At first I was very unfamiliar with the food and drinks offered in Frankfurt\u2019s Hessestub. In these old restaurants there is plenty of apple wine in original Hessian jugs, the so-called \u201cbembel\u201d. People often sit together at large tables on wooden benches, the restaurants are crowded, usually it is loud and noisy. So you stick to the apple wine and order very original and heavy dishes, which are probably served by a very quick, but not so nice host (sometimes I think they hate to be nice \u2014 this makes the whole experience even more interesting for visitors). If you ask for an \u201coriginal Hessian regional meal\u201d, the host just shakes his or her head, because everything they serve is regional and he or she has no idea what you mean by your request.", "In case you happen to visit Frankfurt or Hesse in general, I would like to give you some advice: Try the green sauce (\u201cgr\u00fcne So\u00dfe\u201d). Hessian people occasionally serve it with meat (e.g. schnitzel), but often only potatoes come along with it. Everyone loves it. This is how green sauce looks like if you\u2019re taking it to a picnic:", "The Frankfurter Green Sauce contains of seven herbs: parsley , chives , chervil , borage , sorrel , garden cress and salad burnet", "Unless you have super powers and can convince chefs (and German grandmothers) to change traditional recipes: forget adding or changing one of these herbs. It\u2019s a tradition. The herbs are the heart of the matter: so to make green sauce, we need to be able to identify and collect these seven herbs! All the herbs we need for our green sauce can be found near Frankfurt, they grow in the fields and forests near the city. I have already told you about the German grandparents: To this day, some of the older citizens know exactly where to find the herbs for green sauce. If you want to know where they grow, you can take part in regional courses, especially in summer. An expert will show you the secret spots that can only be found by those who have been there before. But I don\u2019t want to wait: My goal is to build a little helper for me and my friends to identify the herbs needed to make our own green sauce. Let\u2019s do it!", "Our problem is a classification problem. So we want to know if the herbs we find are relevant for making the green sauce. We intend to classify them as parsley, chives, chervil, borage, sorrel, garden cress and salad burnet. As input for our little algorithmic helper we select pictures. Once we are in the fields, we can take a photo of the plant or leaves we want to identify and \u201cshow\u201d it to our program. In short, we want to build a model (a mathematical abstraction) that, by classifying an input image, tells us which of the classes the image corresponds to.", "The environment we\u2019ll work in is a jupyter notebook. Fastai is a library (library = collection of tools/code parts) sitting on top of Pytorch \u2014 a very powerful machine learning library, working with Python code. If you\u2019ve never heard of one of these things: Python is the language we\u2019re writing our code in, Pytorch and fastai are the tools we are using and the jupyter notebook helps us organize our code. For further information about the setup visit the fastai website.", "We start our jupyter notebook and type in:", "This way we have all the image recognition functions of the fastai library. Next we want to be sure that we can train our network. By providing data to the neural network, we want to build a mathematical representation (model) with which we can then categorize new photos of discovered plants/leaves.", "Our model does not know what parsley is, it has never seen the green sauce or anything similar. To train a model, we show it a series of photos with correct labeling. That\u2019s why we first have to create seven folders with seven different labels: Parsley, chives, chervil, borage, sorrel, garden cress and salad burnet.", "We, therefore, open our chrome browser, go to google image search and type in: e.g. \u2018parsley\u2019. We then get a large number of pictures of parsley and scroll down. Then we hit Shift+Control+j to open up the Javascript Consol of our browser. We type in:", "When we hit enter, we download a file with all the urls of the parsley google-Images. We save it under \u2018parsley.txt\u2019 and continue with the other six herbs. Great! Out dataset links are prepared. We put all the text files in a folder called \u2018seven_herbs\u2019 and make sure that it lays in the data folder in our home directory (fastai won\u2019t find it otherwise).", "Step 2: Downloading the image files", "Next, we download the data directly to the server, we\u2019re working on. Fastai needs to know the path, where our dataset lies. This step might be a little different in some environments \u2014 for example if you\u2019re working in kaggle\u2019s kernels. If you struggle, you can visit my starter kernel on kaggle.", "Afterwards we set the names of our herbs as classes.", "This next steps seems a little bit tricky, in fact it\u2019s very simple. It just takes the text files and makes two things: it creates and names a folder for each class (aka herb) and then fills this folder with the pictures defined in the equally named text file. (In the kaggle starterset you don\u2019t need to do these steps, because I already attached the dataset to the kernel.)", "We then review our files to make sure they are not damaged or the links are not buggy. The following code will erase those that fail to open or download correctly.", "Now it\u2019s getting serious. We start processing our data by creating an ImageDataBunch object. This way we can manipulate the data and train our model later. The np.random.seed(13) defines which images are randomly selected from our training data. (We only need this line of code if we want to train the model again in the same way.) Our ImageDataBunch is created by passing the path of the folder with our photo data in it. We define a validation set that represents 20% of the data and define a size for our images.", "Next we also need to assign our classes to to ImageDataBunch.", "If we type in the following code, the ImageDataBunch shows up and we can have a look at our data.", "Let the training begin! First, we load in the vision.learner, a module that holds the cnn_learner: imagine this to be as a pretrained neural net, that is trained on a large image dataset. Next, we\u2019re using \u2018transfer learning\u2019 as a technique \u2014 we\u2019re showing our dataset to the cnn_learner, so that it learns the specifics of the seven herbs.", "Finally: Let\u2019s create our model \u2014 our mathematical representation of the correlations between labeling and pictures.", "So we downloaded the pretrained model from the Fastai library. Next, we want to adjust the model to the data. To make sure that we can keep our results for later, we save the model directly after our four training cycles.", "After this process we end up with a result, that shows an error rate of 0.33, that means that in 33% of the cases, the model will still mess up. We want to have a closer look on what that means:", "This plot shows us the learning rate and the loss of our trained model. For further explanation, please have a look e.g. here. In short, the loss function shows us how well we are doing with our model. For each prediction, the graph shows us the absolute difference between the prediction that our model makes and the actual label that the photo holds. (Remember: all our training data is labeled). As a rule of thumb, we always want to look for a downhill path in the plot. If we look at the part from 1e-5 to 1e-3, it seems as if the model there is still getting better. Shortly after 1e-3 the gradient is rising again very quickly, which means that the error rate is also increasing again. We can improve our model by training it further.", "After all this training, we want to find out how well we\u2019re doing. We interpret our results.", "The confusion matrix shows us the relationship between the predictions made on the basis of the model and the actual labels of the images. As we can see, in most cases the model makes the right decisions: In particular, the chives images were correctly recognized in 33 cases. The losers are the chervil and the sorrel: The chervil, an herb that is less easy for the human eye to identify than the long and smooth chives, is less surprising, whereas the sorrel, at least to my surprise, has been mistaken by the neuronal network for garden cress on several occasions. The most confused lists also points this out:", "We can see from this that things went wrong during training. Overall, our model doesn\u2019t come off so badly, although we could of course still do a lot to improve our results, e.g:", "Right now, we\u2019ll leave it at that and announce: We are ready! We have built our neural network. You might think: \u2018Ok, great, but how do I photograph a herb and show it to my trained network?\u2019", "Remember, the goal is to have a website where we can upload a picture. Now there is a need for an interface design. (We won\u2019t spent time on the design itself in this tutorial, but maybe in the upcoming ones.) For simplicity\u2019s sake, we want to create a graphical user interface that can only receive one image. We want our service to be accessible via the Internet at all times, so we make a simple homepage with only one interaction option, namely to have a photo analyzed. To make our small application available, we use render. This is a cloud provider that you can use to deliver apps and websites.", "First, we need to export our model. That\u2019s what this looks like on kaggle kernels:", "This adds the file \u2018export.pkl\u2019 in our data structure. We download the file to our hard drive. Next we push it to a google drive and make sure that it is free to read for anyone (otherwise the following command will not work). We use this direct link generator, so downloading our file automatically starts with a click on the link.", "In order to use Render, we need to upload the project we want to \u2018render\u2019 to github. In case you don\u2019t know github: its basically a place where people share code. The great thing about github is, that you\u2019ll find a lot of nice projects which you can use as a starting point for your own projects. In this case, we use the repository of anurag as a basis and make own out of it. If you click on \u2018fork\u2019 at anurags repository, you\u2019ll find his repository in your github account. You can then modify it (rename, type in your code) and \u2018commit\u2019 the changes (don\u2019t worry- this will only change your \u2018branch\u2019 \u2014 in other words: your version of the repository). If you want to know how github works in detail, I strongly recommend to read the github guide.", "So after forking anurags repository, you might rename it to \u2018green-sauce\u2019 and we need to do two important things to make this code work:", "If we want to change colors, fonts or other visual elements, we can modify the css-file. As soon as we\u2019re finished, we move on to render.", "At the dashboard of render we click on the \u2018new web service\u2019-icon. There we type in our repositories github-address. You can find my github repository for this medium article at https://github.com/piaoyapia/Seven-Herbs. If you want to render your own app, leave the environment dropdown at \u2018Docker\u2019. Thats it. Render will take care of the rest!", "Finally we are finished and we can test our website! If you followed along, you probably have your own version by now. Otherwise just test mine.", "So I uploaded a photo of me holding a parsley. Then I clicked on \u201canalyze\u201d. The result is not so spectacular optically, but at least it is correct: The network recognizes the herbs as parsley. Yeah!\ud83c\udf89", "Mission accomplished \u2014 we have our model to find herbs. Theoretically, we could go to the fields of Frankfurt and distinguish between the seven different herbs that grow there. As you may have noticed, we don\u2019t have a class called when none of these herbs are seen in front of our lens. This means that even if we photograph a cute kitten, our neural network sees one of the seven herbs in the picture. In conclusion, I do not recommend \u2014 and I am not liable for any damages \u2014 using this website in real life. Rather, this project is intended as an incentive to look for ways to use machine learning concepts that can tell us something about the world we live in and that we don\u2019t have in mind in everyday life. Finding herbs for green sauce is not a world problem \u2014 certainly \u2014 but there is culture behind it. If you read this article up to this point, you may not only have learned something about machine learning, but also about an old German recipe. Let\u2019s combine old knowledge and machine learning in future projects \u2014 in even more important areas than only food culture!", "I\u2019m researching in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
