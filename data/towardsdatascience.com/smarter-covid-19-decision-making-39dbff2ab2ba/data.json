You already know you\u2019ll just confirm whatever you wanted to believe. If this is what you\u2019re doing, this guide is here to help!", "A better way to approach things is:", "Disclaimer: My expertise is in data and decision-making \u2014 not epidemiology \u2014 so this is a step-by-step decision-making guide to help you structure your thinking while you seek COVID-19 advice from scientists who know a thing or two about diseases.", "If your main objective is to feel better, perhaps you\u2019ll find it soothing to read about two nasty psychological effects which might be ruining your ability to cope effectively with the information you\u2019re getting:", "If you\u2019re interested in learning about how they\u2019re messing with your head during the pandemic, check out my articles on those topics in the links above. Maybe it\u2019ll be a sort of therapeutic moment courtesy of behavioral economics. (Said no one ever?)", "Start off by thinking carefully about your ethics and values. At this stage, try to think in more general terms than the recent pandemic. Ask yourself hard questions about what you consider to be your responsibility to your world, community, friends, family, and self.", "If you\u2019re not in the habit of investigating your own morality, now is as good a time as ever to have a grown-up moment and face unpalatable general questions like, \u201cUnder what circumstances, if ever, am I willing to put a stranger\u2019s life at risk? How much risk?\u201d (If you\u2019ve ever driven a car around others or gone outside when you have the sniffles, I\u2019m sorry to inform you that you\u2019ve already risked strangers\u2019 lives.)", "Once you understand your priorities and what you consider to be right and wrong, you\u2019ll start to form a view of your various objectives and how much they matter to you. For example, is the ability to eat at restaurants important to you? Is it more important to you than your family\u2019s health?", "This analysis assumes that your typical behavior is in service of existing objectives (e.g. visiting your favorite restaurant might bring you utility) and makes sense for you as long as it isn\u2019t put into conflict with a different objective that you value more (e.g. staying healthy might bring you more utility). In the next few steps, we\u2019ll structure your decision-making around signals that your old behavior is no longer consistent with your stated priorities.", "Notice that at this stage in the decision process, you should avoid contemplating whether it\u2019s safe to eat out or not. You\u2019ll tackle that in Step 5. For now, stick with weighing the importance of things to you outside of the context of today\u2019s specific virus.", "Disclaimer: I should point out that since I\u2019ve performed this exercise for myself, I clearly have opinions on what\u2019s ethical, but I\u2019m not here to impose any of my views on you. This post isn\u2019t about telling you how much of a nice person to be (what am I? your government?), only how to make decisions wisely within your own moral framework\u2026 though I hope you\u2019ll choose to be kind.", "Once you know where you stand, brainstorm a bunch of potential actions you might consider taking in the near future which deviate from what you\u2019d do if there were no COVID-19. Everything from washing your hands a bit more to working from home to full self-quarantine to, I dunno, reading manuals on how to hunt bears with your bare hands.", "Technically, the list of potential actions is infinite, so whenever one pops into your mind, you\u2019ll save time by asking yourself:", "Answering \u201cno\u201d to either one means you can conserve effort by eliminating it outright so the decision process doesn\u2019t take forever.", "Example 1 \u2014 Not important: The decision to wash my hands a little more is not important to me because it doesn\u2019t cost me much. Even if it turns out that it was a waste of time, I won\u2019t be upset. I\u2019m okay with just doing it. I\u2019ll do it. No more thinking or research required. Cool, that was easy.", "Example 2 \u2014 Not a real decision: There\u2019s nothing (short of an utterly nutso sci-fi scenario) that could make me hunt a bear with my bare hands. Excellent. There\u2019s no decision to make. I don\u2019t have to think about this one anymore.", "Once you\u2019re done brainstorming, try to tackle your list in order of importance so that you get to the big ones before you get tired and go watch TV. Or, even better, set a timer for the amount of time you\u2019re willing to invest into Steps 2\u20134. Each of the steps below should be done separately (in parallel unless they\u2019re dependencies) for each action.", "For each potential action, think VERY carefully about which information you will accept as triggers for this action. Appropriate triggers (or \u201cdecision criteria\u201d if you prefer additional syllables) are sufficiently strong signals that following your old course of action is inconsistent with your stated goals and priorities (thus triggering you to switch to the new action under consideration).", "Let\u2019s try an example. Perhaps you\u2019ve got theatre tickets for tomorrow night and you\u2019re considering the action of skipping the performance.", "Default action: Go to the theatre as planned.Alternative action: Change your behavior and don\u2019t go.", "By default, you\u2019ll go to the show and you\u2019re committing to not going if one of your triggers happens. (Choose them wisely \u2014 if you allow yourself to backpedal later, you\u2019ve voided the whole point of structuring your decision-making. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to really visualize that you\u2019ve actually received this information and check that you\u2019re content to respond with your new action.)", "Throughout this section, you\u2019ll need to be thinking in terms of your priorities \u2014 if you care only about your own short-term health, then your triggers will be mostly related to information about the personal risk of catching the virus and its severity in your demographic group. If you care about the wellbeing of others and/or about having access to medical resources in the next few months, you\u2019d also need to consider triggers related to \u201cflattening the curve\u201d and information about the risk of spreading the disease (since it would be a disservice to your stated priorities to clog your nearest hospital with people who got sick because of you). It\u2019s a relief that you took the time to weigh these priorities in Step 1, else how will you come up with appropriate triggers?", "You may choose multiple triggers for each action. These triggers should all be phrased as information that you receive. This information might be about:", "[Listen up, data nerds \u2014 if you\u2019re used to thinking in terms of statistical hypothesis testing, things might get weird for you here since I skipped some steps to keep things simple for casual readers. I recommend checking out the appendix below where I explain what\u2019s happening via the framework you\u2019re probably used to \u2014 the one with default actions and null hypotheses.]", "Choose the minimum quality of information sources that can serve as valid triggers. If a source of lower quality gives you the information, you will attempt to verify it with your chosen source and not act unless the quality is sufficient. Continuing our example, your minimum quality sources for each of the triggers might be:", "Remember, these examples (vaguely based on my tastes) are not suggestions. I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell you how to live your life, except perhaps to encourage you towards self-awareness. Each of us must make our own peace with how we structure our decision-making.", "Now that you\u2019ve come up with the minimum signals the universe needs to send you to trigger various actions, you\u2019ll gather information (and keep gathering it) from your high-quality sources. If the decision is important, do your homework thoroughly.", "Notice that I\u2019m asking you to think before you look at information. That\u2019s why the data gathering bit is saved until Step 5. If you consider typical habits of the human animal, you\u2019ll notice that most folks don\u2019t do it this way. So why am I asking you to do it?", "Thinking and setting criteria BEFORE looking for information helps immunize you against confirmation bias. To learn more about that, check out my article on data-driven decision-making. Of course, it\u2019s possible that things you forgot to consider come up, so you\u2019ll need to make existence-based decisions (learn more here). Even in those cases, having thought a bit about the minimum strength and quality of information that you\u2019ll accept as a trigger for action is very valuable.", "If no relevant information comes in, keep doing what you were planning to do. When a different action is triggered, do it. (Perhaps you\u2019ll notice that some actions should already have been triggered and this exercise helped you catch up.)", "Take some time to do a bit of thinking now so that you\u2019re wiser and calmer when information comes along.", "If you read all the way to this point and you know someone who might find this useful, please share it with them. In the meantime, I\u2019m going to resist making a joke about what it takes for advice to go viral.
