For the case study, I will use CPI data in Indonesia from 2002-2020"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.bi.go.id/id/moneter/inflasi/data/Default.aspx", "anchor_text": "Bank Indonesia", "paragraph_index": 2}], "all_paragraphs": ["Time Series data is data that is observed at a fixed interval time and it could be measured daily, monthly, annually, etc. Time series has a lot of applications, especially on finance and also weather forecasting. In this article, I will introduce to you how to analyze and also forecast time series data using R. For the data itself, I will give you an example from Bank Indonesia consumer price index (CPI) data from December 2002 until April 2020.", "Before we begin the analysis, I will give you what steps that we have to do. The steps are like this,", "As I said before, we will do time series analysis on Indonesia\u2019s CPI data starts from December 2002 until April 2020. We can get the data from Bank Indonesia. Unfortunately, we have to copy the data first from the website onto the spreadsheet, then make a .csv data from it. The data looks like this after we import it,", "Before we can make an analysis, we have to pre-process it first. Especially on the \u201cInflationRate\u201d column where we have to remove the \u2018%\u2019 symbol and convert it to numeric type like this,", "Then, the data that we have will look like this,", "With that, we can make a time-series object from the \u201cInflationRate\u201d column using ts function", "With cpi variable, we can conduct the time series analysis.", "First, let\u2019s introduce the consumer price index (CPI). CPI is an index that measures the price change of consumer goods at a certain time from its base year. The formula looks like this,", "Each CPI values is measured every month. Here is the code and also the plot as the results from this code,", "Based on the graph, We cannot see any trend or seasonal pattern. Despite it looks seasonal, the peak of each year is not in the same month, so it\u2019s not seasonal. Then, this graph also don\u2019t have an increasing or decreasing trend on it. Therefore, this graph is stationary because the statistical properties of the data, such as mean and variance, don\u2019t have any effect because of the time.", "Beside of the graph, we can measure statistical summary from the data. We can see that the maximum inflation occurs in November 2005 with the rate of CPI is 18.38. Then, the minimum inflation occurs in November 2009 with the rate of CPI is 2.41. With that information, we can conclude that the data doesn\u2019t have a seasonal pattern on it.", "After we analyze the data, then we can do modelling based on the data. There are 2 models that we will consider for this case, there are Auto Regression (AR) model and also the Moving Average (MA) model. Before we use the model, we have to identify which model that perfectly fits on the data based on its autocorrelation and which lag suits the model. To identify this, we will make the Auto Correlation Function (ACF) plot and also Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) plot like this one below and here is the code,", "Based on the plot above, how we can choose the perfect model for this data. To choose between AR and MA model, we can see this summary below,", "The summary says that AR(p) will fit the model if the ACF plot tails off and PACF plot cuts off to nearly 0 after lag p. Then, the MA(q) model will fit if the ACF plot cuts off to nearly 0 after lag Q and the PACF plot tails off. If both plots are tailing off, then we can use the ARMA(p, q) model to it. For those who still confused about tail off and cut off, tail off means that the value is decreasing gradually and not drop to nearly 0. Then cut off means that the autocorrelation decrease to nearly 0 after the previous lag.", "Based on that information, we can see that the ACF plot decreases gradually (tail off) and the PACF plot decreases to nearly 0 after lag-1. Therefore, for this model, we will use the AR(1) model for the next step.", "To make sure that the model can be used for forecasting and the other measurement, we have to test the model using Ljung Box Test. Here is the code to do that,", "Based on these plots, we can see that the Q-test plot have p-values above 0.05, then the ACF plot shows no significance between another lag, and finally, we can see that the QQ-Plot is almost fit into the line, so we can assume that is already normal. Therefore, we can use the model to do the forecast.", "After we make the model and taking the test, now we can do the forecasting by using this code below,", "Forecasting is the last work that I can show you. I hope, with this study case on time series analysis, you can make a time series analysis based on your problem. This article is just showing the fundamentals on how to do the analysis and not tackling a problem that is using the ARIMA model and the data that I used still stationary data. I hope that I can share with you talking on how to analyze non-stationary time series data later on.", "Your home for data science.
