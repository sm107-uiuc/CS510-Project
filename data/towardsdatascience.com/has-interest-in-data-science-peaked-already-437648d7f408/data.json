With just one hour of work I published a prediction which matched the observed outcomes better than what took Gallup and others orders of magnitude more resources to produce.", "I am now summoning the power of Google Trends one more time to get the lay of the land of data science by using search interest trends over the past ten years as a proxy. The data is used to examine the following questions:", "If these sound like questions you\u2019d like to know more about, read on. The subfields / sub-topics in the analysis are as follows: data science, big data, artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, artificial neural network, business analytics, anomaly detection, A/B testing (see technical note 1 for details).", "First the basic lay of the land. As Google Trends only allows 5 terms to be compared simultaneously, I have split 9 of the 10 topics into two, grouping them so the trends are visible.", "Several insights are readily identifiable. Back in 2010\u20132011 interest in the \u2018artificial neural network\u2019 topic (not shown) was higher than all five shown on the graph, but it was dethroned as early as 2012 and now has the same level of interest as \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019. Interest in \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 was also gradually surpassed by all the rest except the newest kid on the block in the face of \u2018deep learning\u2019. \u2018big data\u2019 first became a thing in 2011. It peaked four years later in 2015 but is now in decline and has been surpassed by both \u2018machine learning\u2019 (since 2017) and \u2018data science\u2019 (since 2019). Notably, interest in both \u2018data science\u2019 and \u2018deep learning\u2019 was practically non-existent just 7 years ago as they started getting traction only in 2013\u20132014.", "Things are nowhere near as crazy in the tier with less relative interest which is shown in figure 2. \u2018business analytics\u2019, \u2018a/b testing\u2019, and \u2018anomaly detection\u2019 all exhibit more or less stable growth. \u2018reinforcement learning\u2019 is a mild outlier in this group as it seems to follow the growth trend of \u2018machine learning\u2019.", "Across the whole 10-year period \u2018machine learning\u2019 and \u2018big data\u2019 were most popular by a large margin, but by 2020 \u2018data science\u2019 has taken the second place from \u2018big data\u2019.", "Figure 3 below combines all ten topics to examine the rates of growth over time (click for full size). Unlike the first two figures, trends in this one are not scaled relatively to each other to allow for a comparison of growth rates.", "The general trend is clear \u2014 there is a significant growth in interest across the board with some subfields growing faster than others. Notably, even very related subtopics take off at different points and show very different rates of growth across the time series.", "Two subfields stand out from the rest upon further analysis. A comparison between the growth rates relative to Jun 2010 of all ten terms (figure below) shows that by far the most growth is seen for the terms \u2018data science\u2019 and \u2018deep learning\u2019.", "The increase is even more startling if we compare the peak versus the starting point:", "This is of course partially due to their very low starting point \u2014 these two terms were non-existent in 2010 not only relative to their peaks, but also relative to all other terms in the analysis. These are also the terms with the most rapid growth when we take into account how late they appear on the map (also see figure 8). Whether due to more readily available big data, or to the proliferation of software which democratizes access to highly technical instruments, or due to pressure from above to automate, interest in deep learning and data science is growing rapidly over the past ten years, and by a wide margin compared even to other high growth topics.", "An examination of the growth of the search interest trends will help answer this question. A rough classification into extreme growth fields (more than four-fold increase) and high growth fields results in the following two graphs:", "Figure 6 shows how interest in \u2018big data\u2019 is in decline after its spectacular growth in 2011\u20132013. Other terms have not grown for several years now and only \u2018business analytics\u2019 and \u2018data science\u2019 seem like they might have more growth ahead. However, both experience a peak in Feb 2020 and a subsequent significant decline. It is reasonable to ask if this is the peak of interest in data science and if so, if we are going to see interest remain on these levels for a while, or if it will enter a slow decline much like \u2018big data\u2019.", "Another visualization of the stark explosive growth of \u2018data science\u2019 and \u2018deep learning\u2019 even relative to other very high growth terms is shown on figure 8.", "This figure shows the lack of growth of interest in \u2018deep learning\u2019 in recent years. Also visible is a break in the rapid growth trend in \u2018data science\u2019. My conclusion based on these data is \u201cyes, we have likely reached the peak\u201d.", "As I was examining the trend lines it occurred to me they show much less correlated movement than I expected given how tightly related many of these search terms intuitively are. Some fields took off faster than others, and also at different times.", "I decided to run a correlation analysis to more formally examine these relationships or lack thereof. The raw search interest data was detrended using first order differencing, resulting in a stationary series. Initially I used Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient and noticed a number of coefficients in the 0.6\u20130.7 range. Upon further examination these turned out to be mostly due to outliers. As the relationship might also be non-linear, I decided to use Kendall\u2019s tau rank coefficient instead of Pearson\u2019s. These are more robust to outliers and would capture any type of monotone relationships, not just linear ones (see technical note 2). Kendall\u2019s tau is somewhat less powerful though.", "The correlations were computed using this correlation coefficient calculator I\u2019ve coded which also provides accompanying statistics. The p-values for many of the correlations were very small and the 95% confidence intervals quite narrow suggesting genuine relationships.", "The resulting correlation matrix shows that search interest for the different topics is not nearly as related as one might expect. The largest correlation is 0.56 and it is between \u2018deep learning\u2019 and \u2018machine learning\u2019. A few others are in the 0.4\u20130.5 range, but most are lower.", "It seems \u2018machine learning\u2019 correlates the most with all other search topics, whereas \u2018business analytics\u2019 correlates the least. \u2018data science\u2019 shows positive correlations across the board, but these are slightly weaker compared to those of \u2018machine learning\u2019. Search interest in \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 exhibits low correlation with the rest, and so does the interest in \u2018reinforcement learning\u2019. The remainder show coefficients mostly in the 0.2\u20130.4 range.", "Data science topics exhibit impressive growth in interest over the past decade. \u2018data science\u2019 and \u2018deep learning\u2019 in particular exhibit astonishing levels of growth between 2010 and 2020. In just a few short years they make the journey from near non-existence to leading topics in terms of search interest.", "That said, it seems interest in most data science topics have already peaked. For some the peak was as early as 2015, while for others it was much sooner. Though we might see a recovery in the rest of 2020, the trend of rapid growth for \u2018data science\u2019 which was established in 2013 is surely broken.", "A correlation analysis found interest in most sub fields to be loosely to moderately related with the highest correlation coefficients being around 0.5. This shows that the data science field is quite diverse, and each sub field has more or less a life of its own, with its own periods of glory and decline.", "Your home for data science.
