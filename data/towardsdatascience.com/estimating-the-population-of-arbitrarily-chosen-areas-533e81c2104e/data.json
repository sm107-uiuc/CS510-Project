Old empires and states would go to great lengths to roughly estimate the numbers of inhabitants in their realms, so as to ascertain the military forces which could be recruited or the numbers of persons from whom taxes could be collected for example.", "In more recent times, methods for estimating the population have improved greatly and became more refined, with most governments nowadays performing periodic census enumerations, which are then supplemented by records of births, deaths and migrations, as well as schools attendance, taxation lists, voting registers, etc. Despite this, many countries and places still lack accurate information about their populations, and even in places where that information is known, there is a lack of publicly available information at a fine-grained level, where usually only data at a relatively large administrative level (eg. village, council, etc) is known or accessible.", "With that in mind, in this post we will examine a versatile method for estimating the population of any given area in the world, using only features from one of the largest and most accessible public datasets in the world: OpenStreetMap (OSM).", "OSM is a massive collaborative map of the world built and maintained mostly by volunteers, and it has a wealth of information about all sorts of things, such as roads (motorway, primary, residential, etc), buildings (accommodation, commercial, religious, etc), amenities (restaurants, bars, entertainment, transportation, etc), shops, leisure areas, sports places, and a wealth of other features which can be extracted either by using an API (such as the overpass API), or, as was the case in this project, by extracting them directly from an OSM file using a tool such as PyOsmium.", "The population training data we\u2019ve used in this project came (indirectly) from Facebook\u2019s High Resolution Settlement Layer, which estimates the population of a given area using satellite imagery. Although perhaps said model can achieve higher accuracy, performing predictions for new user-defined areas would probably mean having access to the image processing algorithm used in the first place, which is very likely not publicly available, let alone the probably high computing resources required for that task.", "Therefore, there are obvious advantages on having a model that can make the same kind of predictions with a relatively small set of features, and based solely on publicly available data (OSM). This project\u2019s main goal was to provide such a model as an end result.", "This project consisted of three distinct but closely related major steps: data collection, data analysis and model training.", "Note: as you\u2019ll see, there were two somewhat separate workflows performed, one with a more basic set of OSM features (which was part of the original sourced dataset), and another one with an extended set of OSM features (which were added to the original data). The latter will be the main focus throughout this present analysis, but we\u2019ll talk about the former as well.", "We started with an existing dataset [1], which consisted of multiple hexagons with a 400m edge spanning the entire earth (minus some shadow areas). These contained aggregated data from Facebook\u2019s High Resolution Settlement Layer regarding population data, combined with some OSM features, such as the number of OSM objects, number of buildings, number of OSM users who mapped the area, total length of roads, among others.", "From that huge dataset, a smaller subset area encompassing Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) was selected and filtered for this model, resulting in a dataset consisting of ~300k hexagons. This area was chosen due to its relatively large spread between high density urban areas and lower density rural areas, as well as being relatively well mapped. A snapshot of the resulting dataset can be visualised below.", "As the OSM features present in this data proved insufficient for explaining enough variance (as we\u2019ll see in the results section), a considerable effort was put into building an application that, given a base OSM file and a GeoJSON polygon(s) defining the area(s) of study, can automatically retrieve several features and map those to the provided polygon(s).", "The OSM data model is such that there are nodes, ways and areas. Nodes are the basic building blocs of all other more complex structures, and when they have associated tags, they are included as a count. Ways represent a collection of nodes representing lines, and are used to map roads for example. As such, they are mapped as a length. Finally, areas are a collection of nodes starting and ending in the same location, and are used to map buildings or any other structure, and hence, are mapped as an area.", "Thus, in the end this equated to roughly 120 extracted features, which basically correspond to most of the information that can be extracted from an OSM map. As an example, in the figure below all purple tags would correspond to shops, which would then be divided by category (such as food, clothing, beauty, etc), whereas the dark yellow ones would equate to amenities, which again would be split by category (sustenance, entertainment, transportation, etc).", "For an in-depth explanation of the rationale behind the feature collection, visit the corresponding project and the OSM wiki.", "After collecting the data, some data cleaning was performed, which included removing columns with only one value and removing outliers. As there were no categorical variables, there was no need for one-hot encoding. Following this, the data was ready to be analysed and for a model to be built from.", "After the data collection and preparation step, an exploratory analysis was performed, in order to get a sense of the data and the relation between the target variable population and the other independent variables. Since we were building a regression model, one of the most important characteristics of the data is the correlation between the dependent (target) and the independent (features) variables. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was found that the variables highway_residential_length, landuse_residential_area and highway_bus_stop_count had the highest correlations, as these variables are associated with residential areas, and thus, populated places. On the opposite end, the variables with highest negative correlation were natural_area and landuse_agricultural_area, which was again expected, as these type of features are associated with low population density. The figure below shows the full correlation results.", "Taking a closer look at the relation between some of these variables, a strong correlation between highway_residential_length and population is observed, but weaker between building_accommodation_count and population. For the variables with negative correlation, we can observe that the relation is not linear but parabolic, which gives us already an indication that perhaps polynomial terms of the variables will provide a better fit to the data.", "Visualising the data spatially also brings an interesting perspective, confirming the correlations we see in the scatter plots. As expected, urban centres have higher concentration of residential roads, railways and buildings, whereas the areas with higher agricultural land use or areas marked as natural have higher concentrations away from urban centres.", "After analysing the data, a machine learning pipeline was put together in order to perform some preprocessing and transformations on the data and then fit the training data into the model, with a 20\u201380% test \u2013 training split.", "One of the transformations in the pipeline was to normalise all the features and target variable by the area corresponding to each training example, as that proved a better solution for making the results more generalisable to larger areas. Below the steps of the pipeline are briefly described:", "As mentioned before, two different models were built: a first approach with the sourced dataset containing few OSM features, and a second one using the dataset augmented with more features using a custom-built application. For testing the performance of the models two different metrics were chosen: the r\u00b2 score, which gives us a measure of the ratio of the variance in the data explained by the model, and the mean absolute error, which gives us an indication of how well the model is doing in a measurable quantity \u2014 in our case inhabitants / km\u00b2.", "For the first approach at building the model, a combination of linear (Lasso and Ridge) and ensemble (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) regressors were tried. After performing hyperparameter tuning, it was seen that the best results were achieved using a combination of up to 3rd degree polynomial terms and a Gradient Boosting regressor, with a corresponding r\u00b2 score of ~0.67 and a mean absolute error of ~158 inhabitants / km\u00b2. In order to get a glimpse of how we were faring in terms of bias-variance, the learning curves were analysed, and as suspected we could observe that, even using polynomial terms to build more complex relations between the variables the model was suffering from high bias, where both the training and cross validation errors were converging at a relatively high value. Therefore, in order to build a better performing model, we would not need to add more training data, but to include a larger set of features, one that could explain more of the variance in the target variable.", "Thus, motivated by these learnings, more data was acquired (as detailed in Data Collection), making us ready to apply the machine learning pipeline to this enriched dataset. As was the case in the previous approach, again a combination of linear (Lasso and Ridge) and ensemble (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) regressors were tried. Following a hyperparameter optimisation, a combination of up to 2nd degree polynomial terms and a Gradient Boosting regressor achieved once more the best results, with a r\u00b2 score of ~0.9 and a mean absolute error of ~91.8 inhabitants / km\u00b2. This was a great increase from the first approach! This proved the effort of acquiring more features worth it. Having a look again at the learning curves, we see that the training and cross validation errors are still converging (indicating a certain bias in the model), but to a sizeably lower value.", "In this case though, a comparison of actual and estimated population values was performed for some places / cities*. When that was done, it was seen that the best results (lower average error between actual and predicted) were achieved using a Lasso regressor with a regularisation value of 1, indicating that we are perhaps overfitting on the data somehow when using the Gradient Boosting regressor.", "*In order to calculate the population for custom defined places, one first needs to use osm-feature-extractor and map the osm features of the provided area. Then, this intermediate step can be fed into the model, which will output the population density (inhabitants / km\u00b2). Finally, by multiplying the result by the area one gets the total population.", "Examining further the models, the feature importance of that model shows that indeed the most important feature by far is highway_residential_length, as opposed to the more distributed coefficient values of the Lasso regressor. This points to the fact that the Lasso regressor model is likely better at generalising to unseen cases as it takes into account more features, and hence less prone to overfitting.", "In this project we set out to build a model that could accurately predict the population of a given area, based solely on features extracted from OSM data. For this we started first with a dataset taken from [1], which was characterised by having few features, and thus, resulting in a high bias model. Based on this, we extended the base data with extracted features taken from OSM files using a custom-built application.", "We saw that the addition of more features, although risking adding some noise to the model, provided a much improved predictive capacity, and allowed us to greatly reduce the mean absolute error. Also, with this approach we have a way of deterministically extracting all the required model input features from OSM files, as opposed to just using the initial data, which we did not have out of the box a way of determining the features for new areas without having to perform some sort of reverse engineering.", "We saw that, even though the Gradient Boosting regressor model performed better on the test data, the Lasso regressor performed better on actual population estimates for several places / cities, achieving a maximum difference of 26%.", "In this model, we used data points that spread across the UK, which spans areas of very high density (such as London), as well as areas of less density and of farmland. This should enable the model to extend well to most cases, although probably not so well if we were to use it in areas of very high population density. Also, the model is dependent on how well mapped the area in the study is. In most of the western world, the OSM extracts are quite well mapped, but it\u2019s less so the case in less developed places \u2014 although the main centres of population, in general, tend to be well mapped.", "Despite these facts, we saw that the model estimated the population of actual places and cities with relatively low error, and we now have a model that can make rough estimates on the population of any given area based solely on its OSM features.", "To see the analysis in more detail check out the Github repository.", "[1] - Kontur Population: Global Population Density for 400m H3 Hexagons", "Your home for data science.
