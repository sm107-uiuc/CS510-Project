These inferences are hypotheses. In essence, a statistical hypothesis test is a method for testing a hypothesis about a parameter in a population using data measured in a sample.", "In this article, I will be reviewing the steps in hypothesis testing, define key terminology and use examples to show the different types of hypothesis tests.", "Regardless of the type of statistical hypothesis test you are performing, there are five main steps to executing them:", "Let\u2019s break these down and define some key terminology.", "1. Set up a null and alternative hypothesis", "Null hypothesis: Can be thought of as the \u201ccontrol\u201d of the experiment. The hypothesis assumed to be true before we collect data and usually has some sort of equal sign (\u2265, \u2264, =).", "Alternative hypothesis: Can be thought of as the \u201cexperiment\u201d. This is what we want to prove to be true with our collected data and usually has the opposite sign to the null hypothesis.", "2. Choose a significance level \u03b1 (or use the one assigned)", "The significance level \u03b1 is the threshold at which you are okay with rejecting the null hypothesis. It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A significance level of 0.05 is most common, this says that you\u2019re okay with rejecting the null hypothesis if there is less than a 5% chance that the result I am seeing are actually due to randomness.", "3. Determine the critical value (Find the rejection region for the null hypothesis)", "The critical value is a value on the test distribution compared to the test statistic to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.", "4. Calculate the test statistic or p-value", "The test statistic is a value calculated from the data given and then compared to the critical value to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.", "The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as large as the one observed, by random chance, given the null hypothesis is true.", "How do we know what type of test statistic to calculate? It depends on which kind of hypothesis test we run. There are four types: z-test, t-test, ANOVA, and chi-square tests. A z-test is used when comparing population means and when the population standard deviation is known. A t-test is used when comparing population means and the population standard deviation is not known. An ANOVA is used when comparing sample means among three or more groups. Lastly, a chi-square test is a non-parametric test used to test relationships between categorical variables.", "5. Compare the test statistic value to the critical test statistic value, or p-value to the significance level, to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis or not", "If the test statistic is more than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. If the test statistic is less than or equal to the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.", "If p < \u03b1, we reject the null hypothesis. If p \u2265 \u03b1, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.", "And there you have it, five steps to conduct hypothesis testing, so let\u2019s now conduct some hypothesis testing in Python using SciPy.", "For our example, we will be using this dataset from Kaggle, which consists of responses to a questionnaire to determine if a child has traits of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Let\u2019s import the necessary libraries and csv file.", "The first statistical test we can conduct is an independent samples t-test, in which we compare the means of two groups along a dependent variable. For our example, using a significance level of 0.05, we will be looking at sex vs. qchat_score (total score from questionnaire used to determine if a child has ASD traits). Let\u2019s determine our null and alternative hypothesis.", "Null Hypothesis: There is no statisical difference between male and female mean qchat scores.", "Alternative Hypothesis: There is a statistical difference between male and female mean qchat scores.", "Next, we need to separate sex into two dataframes for the hypothesis test.", "Now we can use Python\u2019s SciPy library, which is an open-source library for math, science, and engineering, to calculate the test statistic and p-value.", "As you can see, since our p-value is more than our significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Upon further inspection, we see that there are a higher number of males than females in the sample, which may be why we were unable to detect a significant difference. We could have also used our test statistic and compared it to our critical value to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.", "Now, let\u2019s try an ANOVA. Again, an ANOVA is conducted when comparing three or more groups against a dependent variable. For our example, using a significance level of 0.05, we will be comparing Ethnicity vs. .", "Null Hypothesis: There is no statisticially significant difference of mean qchat scores between groups of ethnicity.", "Alternative Hypothesis: There is a statisticially significant difference of mean qchat scores between groups of ethnicity.", "As you can see, since our p-value is less than our significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, there is a statistically significant difference of mean qchat scores between ethnicity groups. How can we determine where the differences lie within the ethnicity group? We must conduct post-hoc analysis to do so.", "Using statsmodels which is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, we will be conduct Tukey\u2019s HSD for post-hoc analysis.", "As we can see from the output, the differences lie between the White European and Asian group.", "Lastly, let\u2019s perform a chi-square analysis on our current data. Again, a chi-square analysis is used to compared two categorical variables.", "Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between Sex and Ethnicity of those individuals with ASD traits.", "Alternative: There is a relationship between Sex and Ethnicity of those individuals with ASD traits.", "In order to conduct our analysis, we will have to create a new dataframe.", "Awesome, now we can conduct our chi-square analysis.", "From these results, we fail to reject our null hypothesis, there is no relationship between Sex and Ethnicity of those individuals with ASD traits.", "And there you have it! The steps to conduct a hypothesis test, definitions of key terminology, and some examples in Python using SciPy.
