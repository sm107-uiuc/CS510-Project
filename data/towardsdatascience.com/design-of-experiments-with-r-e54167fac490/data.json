It is the essence of the Improve phase from the DMAIC cycle and the basis for the design of robust processes.", "Design of experiments is defined as a branch of applied statistics that deals with planning, conducting, analyzing, and interpreting controlled tests to evaluate the factors that control the value of a parameter or group of parameters. DOE is a powerful data collection and analysis tool that can be used in a variety of experimental situations. It allows for multiple input factors to be manipulated, determining their effect on a desired output (response).", "An adequate use of DOE will lead to the improvement of a process, but a bad design can result in wrong conclusions and engender the opposite effect: inefficiencies, higher costs, and less competitiveness.", "The 2^k factorial design is a special case of the general factorial design; k factors are being studied, all at 2 levels (i.e. high, referred as \u201c+\u201d or \u201c+1\u201d, and low, referred as \u201c-\u201dor \u201c-1\u201d). This type of factorial design is widely used in industrial experimentations and is often referred to as screening design due to the process of screening a large number of factors that might be significant in an experiment, with the goal of selecting them for the measured response. If n replications are considered on the experiment, then the total number of experiments is n * 2^k.", "Factors are usually represented by uppercase latin letters (A, B, \u2026) while main effects are usually represented by greek letters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u2026) corresponding to the latin letter of the factor, and the effects of interactions by the combination of letters representing the factors whose effects interact. For a 2^k factorial experiment with 3 factors and n replications, the statistical model would be", "For the following example, we will consider a 2\u00b3 full factorial design experiment with 2 replicates (i.e. 2*2*2*2 = 16 runs). Let\u2019s name the factors as A, B and C, which will have two levels, \u201c+\u201d and \u201c -\u201d, respectively.", "Let\u2019s take look at the R code!", "The first steps consist in importing the SixSgima R package, designing the 2\u00b3 factorial experiment, randomizing it to eliminate effects of unknown or uncontrollable variables, defining a set of replicates and specifying the corresponding responses for each factorial design.", "Once the experiment has been designed, the next steps consist of aggregating the distinct factorial designs and obtaining the results from the model\u2019s summary table.", "Looking at the p-values, we can figure out, with a high level of confidence, that the effects of factors C and A are significant, while the effect of factor B is not. Interactions among the factors are neither 2-way or 3-way, making them insignificant. After having obtained this statistical information, we can simplify the model by excluding all the nonsignificant effects, obtain the model\u2019s coefficients, obtain estimators for all experimental conditions, and compute confidence intervals for each factor.", "In the same way, we can also visualize the effect of each factor on the model\u2019s outcomes in single plots. Let\u2019s plot factor A\u2019s effect on the model\u2019s outcome with the following lines of code.", "Based on the previous plot, we can observe that when factor A is set on the \u201c+\u201d level (i.e. 1.0), the outcome\u2019s value is greater than when it is set on the \u201c-\u201d level (i.e. -1.0). In addition, we can plot the effects of the significant factors in a single plot by using the facet_grid from the ggplot2 package.", "Based on the plot above, in contrast with factor A\u2019s effect on the model\u2019s outcome, when factor C is set on the \u201c+\u201d level (i.e. 1.0), the outcome\u2019s value is lower than when it is set on the \u201c-\u201d level (i.e. -1.0). In the same way, we can plot both factors\u2019 interactions in a single plot to visualize their effect on the model\u2019s outcome.", "As seen on the plot above, since both lines do not intersect, there is no interaction between these 2 factors. In order to maximize the outcomes\u2019 values, factor A should be set on the \u201c+\u201d level and factor C in the \u201c-\u201d level; on the other hand, in order to minimize the outcomes\u2019 values, factor A should be set on the \u201c -\u201d level and factor C in the \u201c+\u201d level. Finally, we can plot the residuals plots and validate if they follow a normal distribution using a normality test.", "According to the residual plots above, there are no clear patterns in the residuals. However, the normal Q-Q plot is not straight enough.", "The practical case presented is a very representative example of how DOE can be used within a Six Sigma project using R software. From an engineering perspective, it can be used to reduce time to design/develop new products and processes; improve performance of existing processes; improve reliability and performance of products; achieve product and processes robustness; and perform evaluation of materials, design alternatives, setting component and system tolerances. However, DOE is not an improvement itself. It is up to the engineer to get the best out of this tool for achieving multiple goals and better outcomes.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
