When you know your buyers\u2019 personas you can tailor your targeting and offerings to increase their satisfaction and your revenue as a result. When you already have a pool of customers and enough data on them, it can be very useful to segment them. In this article, we are going to see how we can use clustering to segment some credit card customers. The data for this analysis was taken from Kaggle and we will use AuDaS to automatically identify the clusters.", "The credit card data has 17 attributres for each customer which include the balance (credit owed by the customer), cash advance (when a customer withdraws cash using the credit card), the customer\u2019s credit limit, minimum payment, percentage of full payments and tenure.", "The data is fairly clean but has some missing values which are picked up automatically by AuDaS.", "After applying the data preparation advice suggested by AuDaS we are able to look at the histogram view of the credit card customers.", "Now that we have prepared the data we are going to build a clustering model using AuDaS. We need to specify the number of clusters and in our case we will start with 8.", "After applying a K-Means Clustering pipeline, AuDaS produces score metrics and information on the clusters it has identified.", "The Silhouette plot gives us a good indication of how well our clusters are defined. The Silhouette coefficient, between -1 and 1, gives an indication of how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighbouring clusters. Values close to 1 are furthest from other clusters whereas negative points overlap with others. In an ideal situation we would expect all the points of a cluster to have Silhouette coefficients close to 1. In our case, most of the clusters seem fairly well defined except for clusters 2 and 7.", "We can then use the t-SNE visualization feature to validate the distinctiveness of our clusters. As we can see, clusters 2 and 7 have a number of points which overlap with other clusters. In order to improve the distinctiveness of our clusters we might decide to collect some additional information from our customers.", "AuDaS provides the coordinates of the centroids which can be used for interpreting the main characteristics of each cluster.", "We can then expand the table:", "AuDaS will automatically create a new data set with the appended clusters of each customer which you can export and by accessing the histogram view we can understand how the clusters are spread throughout the dataset. We are now going to have a closer look at some of the most interesting clusters identified by AuDaS.", "This segment is characterised by customers who have the lowest balance (104) and cash advance (302) and have a fairly high percentage of full payments (24%). These customers are known as transactors as they pay little interest charges.", "This segment is characterised by customers who have high balances and cash advances and one of the lowest purchase frequencies and percentages of full payments which indicates that they are one of the most lucrative segments for the credit card provider. These are typically known as revolvers who might be using their credit card\u2019s as a loan.", "This segment is characterised by customers with the highest credit limit and the highest percentage of full payments (39%). These are prime customers that the credit card provider can entice to increase their spending habits by raising their credit limits even more.", "This segment includes fairly new customers (low tenures) who have a low balance and cash advance. The credit card provider might encourage them to increase their activity by offering cash backs, promotions, free Uber rides etc.", "In a couple of minutes we were able to build a clustering model that was able to segment our credit card users into distinctive groups. Some of these were fairly classical such as the prime segment, revolvers and transactors but we were also able to identify inactive users. Understanding the behaviour of customers at this level of granularity is key to tailoring offers which improve customer retention and drive revenues.", "A full video of the cluster model building process with AuDaS can be viewed bellow:", "AuDaS is an Automated Data Science platform developed by Mind Foundry that provides a robust framework for building end-to-end Machine Learning solutions (Classification, Regression, Clustering and soon Time Series) . This framework helps identify and act on data leakage before it\u2019s too late. You can try AuDaS by sending an email to audas@mindfoundry.ai and read some other practical use cases here and here.", "Mind Foundry is an Oxford University spin-out founded by Professors Stephen Roberts and Michael Osborne who have 35 person years in data analytics. The Mind Foundry team is composed of over 30 world class Machine Learning researchers and elite software engineers, many former post-docs from the University of Oxford.
