Liverpool won the league with 99 points and broke a lot of records such as winning the league with 7 games to go. Manchester City were 18 points behind the champions even after delivering an above average performance.", "Manchester United delivered some amazing football after signing Bruno Fernandes, who has proven to be a top top player, and qualified for champions league alongside Chelsea who had a decent season under Frank Lampard. Too bad for Leicester and Brendan Rodgers as they dropped from second to fifth.", "Towards the end of the season, Tottenham played some excellent football with some beautiful team play and showed some amazing promise ahead of next season. Speaking of next season, Arsenal will forever be Arsenal as they ended up in the lowest place since 1995 and there is no hope for them.", "After experiencing this great season of football amidst the coronavirus outbreak, I have decided to visualize how the teams and players performed in the Premier League season of 2019/20", "Data was collected on the teams\u2019 and players\u2019 season performance and analyzed using R. The final league table was gotten via this link.", "Liverpool, the new champions have got 99 points, one shy away from the league record of 100 points which was achieved by Manchester City, who came second and are now eligible for champions league after appealing to UEFA. Manchester United and Chelsea finished third and fourth respectively, with Manchester United leading on goal difference. Bournemouth, Watford and Norwich City are demoted to the championship after ending up in relegation zone.", "Not surprised, Liverpool had the most wins. After a very much one-sided season, Liverpool won 32 games. Manchester City were second with 26 wins. Chelsea was third with about 20 wins and a rejuvenated United had 18 wins. At the bottom of the winning chart sees two relegated teams: Watford and Norwich City.", "The biggest loser this season was Norwich after losing 27 games. That\u2019s devastating. Bournemouth and Aston Villa ended up second and third in this section with 22 losses and 21 losses respectively. Liverpool, my team, lost the least number of games with 3 losses.", "The first spot for teams who tied the most was shared by three teams ironically: Arsenal, Wolves and Brighton. They all drew 14 of their games. Sheffield and Manchester United came in second place with 12 draws each. Manchester City and Liverpool drew the least with three games each.", "Manchester City scored the most goals with 102 goals. Liverpool secured second place in this section and were behind by 17 goals. Chelsea was third and scored 69 goals and Leicester came fourth with 67 goals. Watford, Crystal Palace and Norwich City seemed to have lost their shooting boots as they were the last three.", "Norwich City, as expected, conceded the most goals with a tally of 75 which is about 2 goals per game. Aston Villa and Bournemouth came second and third respectively, conceding 67 and 65 goals. Liverpool\u2019s defense proves to be tight once more as they conceded the least amount of goals.", "Information about players\u2019 performance was gathered from the premier league website using this link.", "Jamie Vardy was on top of his game this season and received the golden boot after scoring 23 goals. Aubameyang was second with 22 goals. Speaking of consistency, that\u2019s the same number of goals he scored last season. Ings was also second. Sterling scored lots of goals in the last few games, took his tally up to 20 goals and climbed up to fourth. Salah came in fifth place with 19 goals.", "De Bruyne has been putting in some work as he matched Thierry Henry\u2019s assist record of 20 assists in a single campaign. This landed him in the first spot in terms of assists. He was followed by the two brilliant Liverpool playmakers. Alexander Arnold came in second place with 13 assists and Robertson came third with 12 assists.", "Ederson was formidable at the back after securing 16 clean sheets. He won the golden glove for this season. In second came Nick Pope who had a very impressive season with 15 clean sheets. Alisson, de Gea, Schmeichel, Patricio and Henderson all came third with 13 clean sheets.", "This season was one of my best premier league seasons ever as Liverpool finally lifted the premier league trophy in 30 years. There were battles both at the top to secure a top four spot and the bottom to avoid relegation which made it interesting to watch till the end.", "Liverpool FC has lost 9 games in the last three seasons which is the same number of games Manchester City lost this season.", "The full version of the code that was used to carry out the project can be seen here.", "Your home for data science.
