Hence, it is also called Naive Bayes Classifier.", "As other supervised learning algorithms, naive bayes uses features to make a prediction on a target variable. The key difference is that naive bayes assumes that features are independent of each other and there is no correlation between features. However, this is not the case in real life. This naive assumption of features being uncorrelated is the reason why this algorithm is called \u201cnaive\u201d.", "In this post, I will first cover some basic concepts on probability and show how Bayes\u2019 Theorem, the core of naive bayes classifier, is derived. Then I will show how naive bayes classifier builds up on Bayes\u2019 Theorem as well as advantages/disadvantages of naive bayes and its implementation on scikit-learn.", "We\u2019ve learned where the \u201cnaive\u201d comes from. How about the \u201cbayes\u201d? Bayes comes from the famous Bayes\u2019 Theorem of Thomas Bayes. To get a comprehensive understanding of Bayes\u2019 Theorem, we should talk about probability and conditional probability first.", "Probability simply means the likelihood of an event to occur and always takes a value between 0 and 1 (0 and 1 inclusive). The probability of event A is denoted as p(A) and calculated as the number of the desired outcome divided by the number of all outcomes. For example, when you roll a die, the probability of getting a number less than three is 2 / 6. The number of desired outcomes is 2 (1 and 2); the number of total outcomes is 6.", "Conditional probability is the likelihood of an event A to occur given that another event that has a relation with event A has already occurred. Suppose that we have 6 blue balls and 4 yellows placed in two boxes as seen below. I ask you to randomly pick a ball. The probability of getting a blue ball is 6 / 10 = 0,6. What if I ask you to pick a ball from box A? The probability of picking a blue ball clearly decreases. The condition here is to pick from box A which clearly changes the probability of the event (picking a blue ball). The probability of event A given that event B has occurred is denoted as p(A|B).", "There is one more concept to learn before introducing Bayes\u2019 Theorem. A joint probability is the probability of two events occurring together and denoted as p(A and B). For independent events, joint probability can be written as:", "Let\u2019s say I roll a die and flip a coin. The probability of getting 1 and heads is:", "For this calculation to be correct, events must be independent. The outcome of flipping a coin does not have any effect on the outcome of rolling a die so these events are independent. Let\u2019s also give an example of dependent events. I picked one card from a deck and picked a second card from the same deck. The probability of a particular observation in the second pick certainly effected by the first pick. In the case of dependent events, equation 1 is not valid. It should be slightly changed to hold for any two events:", "Equation (1) is a special case of equation (2) for independent events because if event B and event A independent, p(B|A) = p(B).", "We will start with the fact that joint probability is commutative for any two events. That is:", "From equation 2, we know that:", "We can rewrite equation 3 as:", "Dividing two sides by p(B) gives us the Bayes\u2019 Theorem:", "Now we have an understanding of Bayes\u2019 Theorem. It\u2019s time to see how Naive bayes classifier uses this theorem.", "Naive bayes is a supervised learning algorithm for classification so the task is to find the class of observation (data point) given the values of features. Naive bayes classifier calculates the probability of a class given a set of feature values (i.e. p(yi | x1, x2 , \u2026 , xn)). Input this into Bayes\u2019 theorem:", "p(x1, x2 , \u2026 , xn | yi) means the probability of a specific combination of features given a class label. To be able to calculate this, we need extremely large datasets to have an estimate on the probability distribution for all different combinations of feature values. To overcome this issue, naive bayes algorithm assumes that all features are independent of each other. Furthermore, denominator (p(x1,x2, \u2026 , xn)) can be removed to simplify the equation because it only normalizes the value of conditional probability of a class given an observation ( p(yi | x1,x2, \u2026 , xn)).", "The probability of a class ( p(yi) ) is very simple to calculate:", "Under the assumption of features being independent, p(x1, x2 , \u2026 , xn | yi) can be written as:", "The conditional probability for a single feature given the class label (i.e. p(x1 | yi) ) can be more easily estimated from the data. The algorithm needs to store probability distributions of features for each class independently. For example, if there are 5 classes and 10 features, 50 different probability distributions need to be stored. The type of distributions depend on the characteristics of features:", "It is common to name the naive bayes with the distribution of features (i.e. Gaussian naive bayes classifier). For mixed type datasets, a different type of distribution may be required for different features.", "Adding all these up, it became an easy task for naive bayes algorithm to calculate the probability to observe a class given values of features (p(yi | x1, x2 , \u2026 , xn) )", "I will use one of the available datasets (breast cancer) on scikit-learn. train_test_split module of scikit-learn is used to divide the dataset into train and test sets so that we can first train the model and then measure its performance on new, previously unseen data.", "Then we load the dataset and divide into train and test sets:", "Then we create a gaussian naive bayes classifier object and fit train data to the classifier:", "Finally, we measure the performance of our classifier on both train and test set.", "Accuracy is pretty high but this is a simple task used to show the concept and go through the steps of implementation. One important thing to remember is that the accuracy on the training set should not be much higher than the accuracy on the test set which indicates our model is too specific and not generalized well. This results in overfitting which is a serious problem for any machine learning algorithm.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
