For those who don\u2019t know, bar trivia is a competition where teams try to answer progressively harder trivia questions for points. The team with the most points at the end wins. In the last question of the game, teams can wager 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 points after hearing the question. If they get it right, they add the number of points they wagered added to their score. If they get it wrong, they lose half that amount.", "My friends and I were 5 points behind the first place team when we got to the final question. I thought we had come up with the right answer so I wanted to bet the maximum 10 points but my teammates wanted to be more cautious and instead bet 8 points. The first place team and we answered the question correctly but since the first place team bet 4 points, we ended up losing by a single point! It struck me that if we had bet 10 points, we would have won by a point. I wondered if there was a way to demonstrate that wagering 10 points would have been the optimal wager for our situation.", "In this article, I will derive the optimal wager for a bar trivia team conditional on the point difference between them and the first place team. In the process of doing so, we will also see what the optimal wager is for the first place team. For this analysis, I define the optimal wager as the wager that maximizes the team\u2019s chance of winning. I assume that all teams are trying to maximize this probability. The team in the lead is Team 2, and let the probability that they get the question right be p2. The other team is Team 1, and let the probability that they get the question right be p1.", "There are 5 cases to consider, so let\u2019s get started!", "For every combination of wagers that the two teams can make, I\u2019ve calculated the probability that Team 1 wins and I\u2019ve laid them out in the table before. I should say that this particular table is for the case when Team 2 is ahead by five points exactly but the optimal strategy we derive in this case will be the same for the values of 6\u201311.", "For example, let\u2019s say Team 2 wagers 2 points in the final question. If Team 1 wagers 6 points, they can win if they get the question right and team gets it wrong. This happens with probability p1 * (1 \u2014 p2). This explains the entry in the third row of the table in the top left. If Team 1 wagers 8 points, they can win if they get it right and Team 2 gets it wrong, or if both teams get it right. This means the total probability of winning is p1 * (1-p2) + p1 * p2 = p1.", "Looking at the table, we can see that no matter what Team 2 wagers, Team 1 maximizes their probability of winning by wagering 10 points. Conversely, Team 2 maximizes their chance of winning by wagering 6, 8, or 10 points.", "Strategy: Team 1 should wager 10 points. Team 2 should wager the minimum number of points needed for Team 2 to win in the case both teams get it right. In the case of a 5 point lead, this would be 6 points.", "For this case, I\u2019ve recalculated the probabilities and laid them out in the same table format as the previous case. Similar to the previous case, a value of p1 * (1\u2013p2) means that Team 1 wins if they get it right and Team 2 gets it wrong. A value of p1 means Team 1 wins if they get it right and Team 2 gets it wrong or if both teams get it right. I want to explain the value of (1\u2013p2) which we did not see in the previous case. This corresponds to the probability of Team 1 getting it right and Team 2 getting it wrong and both teams getting it wrong: p1 * (1-p2) + (1-p1) * (1-p2) = (1-p2).", "Strategy: There is no dominant strategy in this case. Team 1 maximizes their chances of winning by wagering 10 points in all scenarios except when Team 2 wagers 10 points. However, wagering 10 when Team 2 wagers 10 is sub-optimal only because Team 1 cannot win in the event they get the question wrong. If Team 1 thinks it\u2019s going to get the question right, it might as well wager 10.", "Just like Case 2, this situation is a bit tricky because there isn\u2019t a single strategy Team 1 can use to maximize their chance of winning. If Team 2 wagers 2, 4, or 6 points then Team 1 always maximizes their chances by wagering 10 points. If Team 2 wagers 8 or 10 points, Team 1 always maximizes their chances by wagering 2 points.", "Obviously, Team 1 can\u2019t view Team 2\u2019s wager so this is not a strategy than could be used in practice. That being said, I think there is a rule of thumb Team 1 can use to come up with a good wager. The key here is to realize that, no matter what, Team 1 will win if they get it right and Team 2 gets it wrong. In other words, every cell in the table has the value p1 * (1-p2) in it. It\u2019s just that the cells with a value of p1 have an extra p1 * p2 term in them. The cells with (1-p2) have an extra (1-p1) * (1-p2) term in them.", "Strategy: Team 1 needs to evaluate if p1 > (1-p1), i.e whether they are more likely to get the question right or wrong. If they think they will get the question right, they should wager 10 points as this maximizes their chances of winning by getting the question right. If they think they will get it wrong, they should wager 2 points. The same rule of thumb applies for Team 2.", "Similar to the previous case, there is no strategy for Team 1 that would be optimal for all of Team 2\u2019s wagers. We can see that if p1 > (1-p2), then wagering 10 points would be optimal for all cases except when Team 2 wagers 10 points. If (1-p2) > p1, then wagering 2 points would be optimal for all cases except when Team 2 wagers 2 or 4. Since Team 1 doesn\u2019t know p2 or Team 2\u2019s wager this is not a strategy that can be used in practice. However, they can approximate the value of p2 with the value of p1 \u2014 after all, the teams are pretty close so they have similar trivia knowledge. By doing so, we recover the same rule of thumb as the previous case.", "Strategy: If p1 > (1-p1), they should wager 10 points. Else, they should wager 2 points. The same rule of thumb applies for Team 2.", "Strategy: This situation is very similar to the \u201cUp by 2\u201d case. If p1 > (1-p1), they should wager 10 points. Else, they should wager 2 points. The same rule of thumb applies for Team 2.", "I think the most important takeaway is that you should almost always wager either the minimum or the maximum amount of points. The only cases when you shouldn\u2019t are when your team is in the lead by at least four points. When the first team is only ahead by 3 or fewer points, we saw that it is not possible to come up with a dominant strategy for all possible wagers the other team can make. In this situation, the team should evaluate if they are likely to get the question right. If so, they should bet the maximum number of points. If not, they should be the minimum.", "This conclusion demonstrates that my team should have wagered 10 points a couple of weeks ago when we were down by 5 points. I can\u2019t wait to show this to my team and improve our chances in the future!", "Your home for data science.
