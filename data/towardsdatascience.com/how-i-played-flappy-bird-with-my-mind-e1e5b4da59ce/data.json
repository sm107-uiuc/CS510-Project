Remember the frustration it caused?", "Well, Flappy Bird was actually removed from the App Store because it was so addicting. But guess what? I created my own version that you can play with your brain \ud83d\ude09", "So the reason that this is possible is because of an emerging technology called a brain-computer interface. Brain-computer interfaces (or BCIs) allow us to connect our brains to external machines or objects.", "Basically, our brains use nerve cells called neurons to transmit information across the body. Neurons \u201cfire\u201d in order to pass a message onto the next, like a chain reaction, until the message reaches the brain or vice versa. This neural activity causes the brain to emit electromagnetic waves.", "This is where BCIs come in \u2014 they work by acquiring these brainwaves, analyzing them, and then translating them into commands.", "You might be wondering how we can obtain brainwaves \u2014 you can\u2019t see or feel them, after all. Well, a popular method that\u2019s used to record electrical activity in the brain is called electroencephalography (or EEG \ud83d\ude05). My device of choice is the Muse headband, which is used for meditation, but can also be used to develop apps.", "The headband connects to the Muse Direct app, which streams data to my computer using the Open Sound Control protocol.", "So the data from the app is received by a Python program in chunks (almost every millisecond or so), and it looks something like this.", "What does that even mean? \ud83e\udd14 Well, the data is received in hexadecimal form, which means that we\u2019d have to convert it to base 10 and then work with it. I did exactly that \u2014 the process involves a bit of math so I\u2019ll spare you the boring explanation and link the code here. After converting the data, I noticed that there were large spikes whenever I blinked.", "At this point, we know that whenever there\u2019s a large spike in the data, the user has blinked. However, that\u2019s not always the case \u2014 sometimes the spikes are caused by other movements or activities.", "In order to determine if the user is actually blinking, we can use a band-pass filter. Although that seems complicated, it basically just means identifying a frequency range that\u2019s associated with blinking \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f. In my case, I did a few runs, and through trial and error, I was able to find a range that worked out pretty well.", "The last step is to simply make the bird \u201cflap\u201d whenever the user blinks \u2014 and that\u2019s it!", "Pretty cool, huh? Well, this is just the tip of the iceberg. From diagnosing depression to helping the paralyzed control robotic arms, brain-computer interfaces hold immense potential!", "Your home for data science.
