And overseeing a machine learning project involves some unique aspects and potential pitfalls.", "In this guide, we\u2019ll go over all the insights you need to deliver a successful machine learning solution.", "For a higher-level overview, also take a look at What Is Artificial Intelligence? Everything a CEO Needs to Know and 4 Critical Success Factors in Artificial Intelligence.", "This article is for people who have been tasked with building a machine learning solution for a medium or large business. If you want to learn machine learning for fun or for general knowledge, building a proof of concept on your own or with an inexperienced team is completely fine. But we\u2019re going to assume you are tasked with building a large-scale machine learning project that takes on real risk (if it fails) and generates real value (when it succeeds).", "While machine learning can add huge value in a large variety of different areas, it\u2019s also often overhyped. We\u2019ve all seen science fiction movies, and it can be tempting to think of machine learning as something that gives machines human-level intelligence. In reality, while machine learning can help you in many ways, it\u2019s better thought of as a specialized tool to analyze data than as a silver bullet to solve any problem.", "Machine learning is ultimately about finding patterns in structured data and making predictions. These can be (and often are) predictions about what will happen in the future. But this is not the only way you\u2019ll find the term \u201cpredictions\u201d used in machine learning solutions. Often it also means predicting answers to questions like: \u201cWhat kind of dog is in this image?\u201d The latter kind of prediction isn\u2019t a time-based prediction (looking into the future), but rather a prediction in terms of: \u201cWhat answer would an all-knowing oracle give if asked this specific question?\u201d", "Machine learning can also be thought of as \u201clearning from data\u201d. Traditional software solutions are built around deduction (a smart person identifies a set of rules and codes them up as a series of if statements, and these rules can then be applied to data), while machine learning solutions are built around induction (a machine learning algorithm automatically discovers rules by looking at a large number of examples, and these rules can then be applied to still more data).", "Traditional software solutions are built deduction while machine learning solutions are built around induction.", "As an aside, we\u2019ll use the term \u201cmachine learning\u201d throughout this article, but in common usage, the terms \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d or \u201cAI\u201d are often used instead. For a more detailed discussion, see Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence. They are not the same.", "Machine learning, especially with recent advances, can almost certainly bring new opportunities to your business, no matter which field you\u2019re in. One of the reasons machine learning has received so much attention is because it\u2019s being used to power breakthroughs in several seemingly unrelated fields, including:", "Each of these fields expands into yet more subfields (for example, the same algorithms we use for facial recognition can also detect cancer in X-Rays), and more importantly, very similar algorithms can be used across all of these fields, meaning that an advance in one algorithm can lead to advances in many fields. This applies to nearly every field, including medicine, marketing, finance, and trading.", "Machine learning in each of these fields is enabled by huge (and growing) datasets. Improvements in machine learning unlock more of the value in this data, so data itself becomes more valuable. And as more attention is given to data, machine learning models improve still further, leading to a virtuous cycle.", "Machine learning has so much potential that nearly every company wants to use it. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s always a good idea.", "As a business manager, you run two risks:", "While every situation is unique, there are some good rules of thumb regarding whether or not machine learning is good for your company or project.", "Keep in mind that these are just guidelines. Nearly every company can find machine learning use cases somewhere. The question is whether you need machine learning now and what the ROI (return on investment) will be. If your company is still small or you only have a little bit of data, you might get a bigger ROI from analyzing your data manually. But if not, machine learning is likely to help you create value.", "It might be tempting to spend 2\u20133 weeks and throw together a PoC (proof of concept): a model that can take in some data your company has and produce some potentially useful predictions. There are millions of tutorials showing you how to achieve this in a few lines of code, using some standard libraries, and it\u2019s tempting to think that productionizing your model will be easy. It won\u2019t. While many people might think that creating the first model takes them 80% of the way to a machine learning solution, people who have built and productionized machine learning solutions before will know that the PoC is closer to 10% of the journey.", "All machine learning solutions can be loosely broken down into three concepts:", "All three of these look very different when comparing a PoC and a production solution.", "A production solution also has many more moving parts. A proof of concept often involves building a simple model and verifying whether it can generate predictions that pass a quick sanity-check. Everything can be done on the same machine. By contrast, this is only the first part of a production workflow. At the production stage, you\u2019ll need a beefy training server and a good process for keeping track of different models. You\u2019ll need a way to test the trained models before integrating them with your existing production services, performing inference at scale, and monitoring everything to make sure it\u2019s all holding up. Finally, you\u2019ll iterate on this process many times, since you can improve the data, code, or model components.", "When you\u2019re building a machine learning team, it\u2019s tempting to hire researchers from an academic background. If they\u2019ve invented new machine learning algorithms, they must be the best people to put them to use, right? Not always.", "Hiring a researcher to build you a machine learning solution is often like hiring someone who designs KitchenAid appliances to cook you a meal. While researchers come up with novel ways of solving problems and have deep theoretical expertise, they often lack more practical expertise in using existing tools, following good engineering practices, and making difficult time/quality tradeoffs.", "Hiring a researcher to build you a machine learning solution is often like hiring someone who designs KitchenAid appliances to cook you a meal.", "More often than not, you want someone who can use existing machine learning algorithms and tools \u2014 much like a chef expertly whips together a delicious meal using standard ingredients and kitchen appliances \u2014 rather than someone to design new tools from scratch.", "The terminology is still not completely consistent, but you\u2019ll usually be looking for at least one machine learning engineer \u2014 someone who specializes in building machine learning solutions for business.", "The main choice you need to make is between building your own machine learning team or hiring a consultancy. Building your own team can take many years, and it\u2019s probably only the right choice if you don\u2019t need to see results urgently and if you expect machine learning to be the key differentiating factor between you and your competitors.", "If you build a team, you might also choose to upskill existing employees instead of hiring new ones. In this case, you might wonder whether to teach engineering skills to your mathematicians or to teach mathematical and statistical skills to your engineers. Either way, it\u2019s a difficult leap, but a good engineer can often pick up enough mathematics and statistics (especially if they have some fundamental background already) to become a great machine learning engineer in around 2 years, while it usually takes a statistician longer to pick up all the engineering background and toolsets required (often around 5 years).", "A good machine learning team doesn\u2019t only rely on expertise in machine learning engineering. Expertise in software engineering, DevOps, and management are all equally as important, and a common structure might look like this:", "At Data Revenue, everyone on our team is a machine learning engineer. This gives us an advantage over companies that see machine learning as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. But it still took us 2 years of trial and error to build a good team, and 4 years to get to the point where we fully trust our hiring process for machine learning engineers (we now hire 1 out of every 150 qualified applicants).", "It makes sense to build a team if you think AI is the main factor that will help you leapfrog your competition. If machine learning is simply part of what\u2019s going to get you to the top, then it might be better to bring in external experts.", "But hiring an agency can be risky too, especially if you hire the wrong one. So you\u2019ll need to know how to choose a machine learning consultancy.", "Structuring just the technical part of a machine learning solution is challenging on its own. It takes a rare mix of business and technical skills to structure the whole project right, and you\u2019ll want to think about all the different stages of a good workflow before you dive in.", "One of the most important things in planning a machine learning project is to plan with production in mind. If you aim for a proof of concept, then that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get. While it\u2019s a good start, you want the people working on the PoC to constantly prioritize the goal of getting to production.", "A good intermediate phase between a PoC and production is the pilot stage. This looks almost exactly like a production solution, but it might be limited in scope, in how many users it\u2019s rolled out to, or in how much data it uses.", "From the get-go, you should carefully structure and timebox the research and experimentation phase. It\u2019s important that everyone knows the goal is: \u201cWhat is the best model we can get in x days?\u201d rather than \u201cWhat is the best model we can get?\u201d Otherwise, you\u2019ll get stuck in the \u201cjust one more experiment\u201d loop forever.", "It\u2019s also vital to figure out which internal and external departments of your company the shiny new machine learning solution will impact. If you\u2019re replacing a non-machine learning solution developed by another team, keep in mind that they might be attached to their approach. \u201cNot developed here\u201d is a hard hurdle to cross, be it between teams within your company, or between an external team and yours.", "Before you start building, make sure your model will scale. Often a solution works fine in PoC or even the pilot stage, but a machine learning solution has intensive and unique resource needs, and without proper planning, it can easily overwhelm your infrastructure. Make sure that your solution will be efficient enough to scale to training on your full dataset and to handle the number of requests you expect it to get once it\u2019s live.", "At a higher level, make sure you\u2019ve considered everything in our Machine Learning Project Checklist before you kick off.", "We\u2019ve mentioned the dangers of getting stuck at the PoC stage, having the wrong team, or using machine learning when it isn\u2019t well suited to a particular problem. But there are more potential pitfalls you should be aware of before you move forward:", "Building a machine learning solution can certainly be a daunting task!
