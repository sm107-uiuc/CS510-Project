In that\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.locale.ai/", "anchor_text": "Locale.ai", "paragraph_index": 18}], "all_paragraphs": ["If you are a city/operation manager of an operationally heavy company, having a bird\u2019s eye view of the day-to-day operations is crucial since on-ground operations are quite chaotic in nature. In that scenario, the ability to make faster decisions with more efficiency can be driven by having quick access to data and relevant insights.", "However, along with data visibility, you also need the ability to find gaps and drill down and get further insights in order to make the right decisions and have the ability to respond to potential challenges or roadblocks. The right dashboard only tells you where the gap exists but also why there is such a gap in the first place.", "One major problem that organizations face is the unification of all the data- Data is spread across formats in various databases and combining them to have a clear and intuitive visual representation becomes challenging. If your organization has a large foot-print or has lots of moving parts in the real world, then this process becomes all the more challenging, given the frequency and scale of data being collected.", "Once access to the data gets solved, the second challenge becomes being able to visualize the data in the right way- to get the right insights & take the right decisions.", "The issue isn\u2019t with dashboards being good or bad. The reason why most dashboards fail at newer use cases is that they are rarely customizable and the new cases are far beyond what the dashboards were designed for. Or in some cases, not built for the right user persona. Which brings us to the next point:", "Today\u2019s growth and marketing teams in most internet companies have a great stack of analytics tools to monitor their online business. But, why isn\u2019t the need for analytics and visibility for ops teams emphasized ever?", "Today, most of these companies end up using either of these three dash-boarding/analytics solutions for getting visibility for their ops teams:", "Before jumping into operations teams, what should a good dashboard have?", "If you are building dashboards for the operations team with location data, here is the list of criteria to follow:", "Having all location data in the same place: Having the bird\u2019s eye view of your demand, supply and trips is very critical. So, the right dashboard needs to integrate data across all sources into one place. Say you want to find the areas where the revenue and customer reviews are both low so as to run campaigns.", "Drilling Down: Users should have the ability to drill down very simply into the data to find the underlying issues. The ability to drill down across time, geo, and attributes is important when you are dealing with the operations team because you need to find areas or user-cohorts with specific behavior.", "Collaboration and Transparency: The need for collaboration and transparency because at times the call for action is immediate and urgent hence it is important that people are on the same page in terms of knowing where the loopholes are or where the strings need to be straightened.", "No code required: Business users and ops teams don\u2019t have the bandwidth to sit and write queries to do data joins together. Hence, all their questions should be answered straight from the UI. In other words, the dashboard needs to be designed keeping the \u201cend-user\u201d in mind.", "We have talked about what it takes to make the operations team agile and data-driven here:", "So now that we have established how does the right dashboard for the ops team looks like, you have 2 options: you can either build it internally or you can buy a software tool.", "At first glance, \u201cbuild\u201d may appear to be the best solution since many organizations believe they are best positioned to understand their own needs and have the engineering capacity to build it internally. Any analytics dashboarding solution must grow to accommodate the changing business dynamics and metrics. It can be challenging enough to build a scalable dashboarding system that meets all business needs within acceptable timeframes and cost.", "However, building an analytics tool or dashboard can take somewhere between 6\u20138 months of time with a team of designers, engineers, and geo-spatial analysts putting all their efforts to build such an analytics platform along with the added costs of maintaining the system as well.", "Other than investment in infrastructure and human resource, one major investment that is very crucial when building internal dashboards is the \u201ctime-to-value\u201d cost, which means how long can you wait before you leverage the real value of the product. Not to forget that these tools require timely maintenance and that sucks up a lot of money.", "Locale.ai is a no-code location analytics product built for analyst and business teams to give them operational efficiency and visibility. Locale helps you achieve operation driven growth which is critical for optimizations. We take care of the grunt work while you focus on your everyday business and operations.
