You can use this technique to create a neighborhood explorer tool to help residents and visitors develop an understanding of points of interest near where you live.", "You can use a publicly available points of interest dataset like I did, or you could scrape data from Yelp or TripAdvisor.", "I was inspired to create this project based on my interest in GIS data and my love of Washington, DC, where I went to data science bootcamp and now work as a federal consultant.", "Hopefully, this walkthrough gets you thinking about your portfolio and how to deepen your appreciation for the places around you.", "Supervised machine learning tends to get all the hype. After all, what\u2019s cooler than providing a bunch of training examples to a neural net and, like a proud parent, watching it ace the test data and come home with an A+ on its classification report?", "By contrast, unsupervised machine learning is a lot more like finger painting \u2014 the results can be difficult to interpret and there\u2019s no clear right answer.", "With unsupervised learning, the researcher tends to be looking for patterns in the dataset. One benefit of this technique is that the data does not need to have labels. In fact, unsupervised machine learning is kind of an unsung hero \u2014 it has many useful applications, such as:", "Don\u2019t let supervised learning hog the limelight \u2014 unsupervised clustering can provide great insight and opportunity for interactivity.", "The first piece of advice I give aspiring data scientists is to work on a project related to your city.", "The goal of the neighborhood explorer tool was to create a way for people to explore similarities between different areas in DC. The resulting Tableau dashboard depicts a subset of DC\u2019s census blocks, grouped into colors based on their similarity in terms of points of interest.", "This tool could then be used by:", "The points of interest dataset from Open Data DC includes schools, historical sites, museums, monuments, galleries, fire and police stations, libraries, public services, universities, hospitals, rec centers, etc. DC is chock full of fascinating places to visit and things to do, providing abundant inspiration to build the tool.", "I followed these three broad steps:", "In a moment, we\u2019ll dive into each step in more detail.", "I ended up with 10 clusters, which I assigned to colors based on my perception of their persona. Clustering is an art, not a science, so this process could have gone any number of ways. Someone else may have chosen a different number of clusters or personified them differently.", "In the final visual representation, blocks of the same color have a similar composition in terms of points of interest. In the accompanying slide deck, I explained the persona of each cluster using the most common features and descriptive adjectives. The cluster with convention centers that also featured a number of art galleries and historic sites became the blue cluster. The cluster with the most recreational areas and city parks became green. Another cluster with a lot of public institutions, universities, and police stations became purple, and so on.", "It will surprise absolutely no one that data cleaning is where the majority of my energy was spent during the project. Maybe you\u2019ll be lucky enough to work with a cleaner dataset, but I spent a lot of time munging through the census blocks and almost 10,000 recorded points of interest. Some transformations:", "Rather than jump straight to the five main categories that appear on the side of the dashboard (arts, civics, history, nature, and recreation), at this stage I actually used almost a hundred place categories drawn from the Google Maps API.", "The Maps API, available from Google Cloud Platform, performed admirably at categorizing the locations in the dataset based on latitude and longitude. Some places were missed, however, contributing to more manual data cleaning. I set up a split screen on my second monitor \u2014 Wikipedia on one side and The Golden Compass, which had just come out on Amazon, on the other.", "Note: you can use your $300 free credit from GCP to use the Maps API, but be careful!! That may sound like a decent chunk of change, but I was shocked at how quickly I blew through it. (Fortunately, Google caps you when you hit the free tier limit \u2014 they won\u2019t bill your card unless you authorize additional charges). You will want to be more diligent than I about budgeting, doing tiny test runs, and ensuring you set up your queries perfectly.", "Let\u2019s talk first about the normalization step. I divided the count of points of interest by the sum within each census block. This made sense as a way to fairly compare census blocks that contained a lot of points of interest with blocks that contained only a few.", "If I\u2019d skipped this step, I believe the algorithm would have just clustered based on the density of the census block rather than by the composition of the census block. I wanted to know about the persona of the census block, not the density of points packed into it \u2014 therefore normalization was required.", "Next up, the 5% of the project that is actually representative of \u201cData Science\u201d in its truest sense.", "Clustering is an unsupervised technique to create groups with high intra-group similarity and inter-group dissimilarity. Here\u2019s a useful visual that depicts k-means clustering:", "That visual is just so dang satisfying. Here\u2019s a comparatively underwhelming description of the process for k-means clustering:", "The number of initial seeds is the key hyperparameter in the k-means algorithm. Computing the silhouette score across a number of potential values for k provides some hint about what might be a good value for your dataset.", "A higher silhouette score indicates better fit. But you\u2019ll want to balance this metric against the fact that a smaller number of clusters provides less information about distinctions in the data. Traditionally, you should pick the value of k associated with the elbow of the silhouette score graph. Based on my dataset, that would have meant three (too few) or five (more interesting but still too few) clusters.", "I ultimately eschewed what the graph told me and went with ten clusters. Largely because that was a neat, round number, large enough to give dashboard users room to explore. Let\u2019s call it artistic license.", "At the last step, I wanted to create a tool so that people accessing my project could interact with the clusters. In order to do this, I first needed to figure out what the clustering results actually meant.", "The k-means algorithm spits out an index for each record in your dataset from 0 to k. Telling someone, \u201cyour block belongs to cluster zero\u201d is not exactly illuminating.", "I spent time scrolling through the data to evaluate patterns and uncover the persona of each of the ten clusters.", "I chose colors to represent the descriptions because this would be intuitive to communicate in the dashboard. Then I quickly and unscientifically scored the clusters based on my perception of their relative strength / weakness in each of the five broad categories that would allow the user to navigate the dashboard.", "To enhance interactivity, I gave dashboard users the ability to filter the clusters based on the desired score within each category. With the sliders on the left side of the view, the user can set the minimum (and maximum) acceptable score for each category.", "I\u2019m a huge fan of Tableau, by the way. I think Data Scientists look down on Tableau because it\u2019s just a drag-and-drop tool. Well, by that logic, coding is just typing. Here\u2019s a fun article where I teach everything you need to know about Tableau, and a couple other things besides:", "Ultimately, this demo received a lot of attention during my bootcamp\u2019s final project showcase. I think the audience really enjoyed the opportunity to use the explorer to better understand the city.", "As potential next steps, this project could be improved by adding commercial data (e.g. the location of coffee shops, bars, music venues, etc.) It would also have been cool to allow users to search for a specific address using a dashboard action filter. Unfortunately, I was never able to get the photos working in the web version of the dashboard, but if I had, it would have been interesting to add more variety to the visual display using the Flickr API.", "For fun, I\u2019ll wrap up by sharing some trivia on five places I learned about through this project:", "The first piece of advice I give aspiring data scientists:", "Work on a project about where you live.", "This should be easy given that metropolitan areas often provide intriguing datasets through an open data portal. Not only will choosing a locally relevant topic help you explore your neighborhood, it will spark an instant connection when interviewing. Everyone will want to know your results for their part of town.", "Working on the Neighborhood Explorer project brought me so much joy, and I\u2019m very grateful to get to share it with you.
