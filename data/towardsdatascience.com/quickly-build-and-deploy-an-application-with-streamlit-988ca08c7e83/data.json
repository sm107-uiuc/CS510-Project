But mostly, to show you the steps necessary to bring your application into production using Heroku.", "A few of the advantages of using Streamlit tools like Dash and Flask:", "Have a look at this post which might help you understand the architecture of Streamlit. Moreover, this post", "Streamlit can easily be installed with the following command:", "Use the following command to see a demonstration of an application with example code:", "Doing this will result in the following page to be opened:", "Above from the streamlit hello demo above there are a few more complex demos available online for you to try out. I will list a few (including mine) below such that you will have an idea of the possibilities:", "This demo shows how the Udacity car dataset can be combined with object detection in less than 300 lines of code to create a complete Streamlit Demo app.", "First, install OpenCV so that the images can be analyzed:", "This is a Streamlit demo to show how you can interactively visualize Uber pickups in New York City.", "Simply run the code below after installing Streamlit:", "As many Board Game Geeks like myself track the scores of board game matches I decided to create an application allowing for the exploration of this data.

There are many widgets available including the following:", "The problem with many dashboarding tools is that data is reloaded every time you select an option or switch between pages. Fortunately, Streamlit has an amazing option allowing you to cache the data and only run it if it has not been run before.", "The code above shows that you can cache any function that you create. This may include loading data, but also preprocessing data or training a complex model once.", "Streamlit supports many visualization libraries including: Matplotlib, Altair, Vega-Lite, Plotly, Bokeh, Deck.GL, and Graphviz.

It behaves differently based on its input. For example, if you throw in a Matplotlib figure it will automatically show you that visualization.", "You can find a full overview of its possibilities here.", "To show how to deploy your application we first need to create a basic application. The example will be a simple demo that has two pages. On the homepage, it shows the data that we selected whereas the Exploration page allows you to visualize variables in an Altair plot.", "The code below gives you a Selectbox on the sidebar which allows you to select a page. The data is cached so that it does not need to reload constantly.", "Running the code streamlit run app.pywill show you the following page:", "Selecting the page Exploration will show you the following visualization:", "Now that we have our application it would be nice if we could host it online somewhere. That way, you can demonstrate the application that you made to others.
