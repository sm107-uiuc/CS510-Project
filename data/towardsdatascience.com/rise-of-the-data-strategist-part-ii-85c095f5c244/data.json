And what is the skill set needed to define and demystify the new role?", "Let\u2019s face it \u2014 Data Science blogs are awash with Venn diagrams portraying the ultimate skill set of one of the most sought-after professions this decade, but as we enter 2020, are we optimizing the management of the data talent? More specifically, are we using data capabilities and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate significant business impacts? That is exactly the question many businesses are currently asking themselves as the data economy evolves.", "Business people know that foresight and good business strategy are essential for maintaining a competitive position. Data strategies are typically developed by business managers seeking buy-in from business leaders. On the other hand, data scientists and data engineers continue to generally have organizational alignment with IT or digital operations, even though the data strategy and vision will be developed by business people. Therefore, there is a current, and growing, need for a translational role between the data professional and business manager/leader.", "In an ideal world awash with unicorn talent, broadening the skill set required for data scientists and engineers to include business expertise, domain expertise and highly versatile communications skills, could be proposed. However, seasoned business leaders know that business decisions benefit from multi-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary insights in the form of a diverse team. The more diverse the team, the higher the collective intelligence. In the previous blog \u2014 The Rise of the Data Strategist Part I by Boyan Angelov (link), Boyan made a compelling case that the role of the data strategist is a highly useful role to connect data science with the business case.", "In a follow-up to that blog, our Data Strategists at DAIN Studios brainstormed and designed an intersectional approach to develop and list the expertise domains, and their associated skills, that define the unique skills sets needed for a data strategist. We add to Venn diagram and data literature by proposing the following Venn for the data strategist in Figure below.", "The three circles present the most important knowledge domains for a data strategist; Business, Communication, in addition to Data & Technology.", "Business skills are important for a data strategist because they are required to link the data use cases with the business goals and operations. The Data & Technology knowledge domain has a clear role in the implementation of any Data and AI Strategy, however, it is important to distinguish the skills and experience on Data & Technology for a data strategist, which differ greatly from those of a data engineer. More specifically, data strategists need a good general knowledge of data infrastructure, frameworks and data management tools, but do not need to be highly experienced or skilled in engineering those frameworks and tools. Ideally, data strategists need to be aware of the broad options for current technology and data solutions, and how they can be applied to support business goals. To be able to effectively link and translate concepts on data and technology with business, strong communication skills quickly become one of the most critical skills in the translational role of the data strategist.", "To further elaborate on the proposed data strategist Venn diagram, we came up with the following top skills in each of the three knowledge domains relevant for a data strategist:", "The need for technical generalist business people is still growing. The skills that support the role requirements of a data strategist bring together the domains of Technology & Data, Communications and Business. On the bilateral data strategy domain intersections, we have Data and Business Architect that are highly versed in cross-domain Data & Technology solutions, with knowledge of cross-functional business processes and objectives; Business Domain Experts are leaders that are confluent in communications and business operations and administration. Data and Technology Advocates are highly knowledgeable and experienced in the Technology & Data domain, with well-developed translational skills that can communicate complex data and technology concepts at the appropriate level of engagement. The data strategist unicorn, we argue, operates within all three domains to guide leaders and organizations towards the implementation of a highly data centric business strategy that capitalizes on and monetizes its data assets.", "Note: This article was published originally at the Dain Studios blog.", "Acknowledgements \u2014 in addition to the authors of this article, the data strategist Venn diagram was developed by DAIN Studios\u2019 consultants, who included, Heiner Albersmann, Erika Grohn, Niina Hagman, Dirk Hofmann, Arttu Huhtiniemi, James Keirstead, Ulla Kruhse-Lehtonen and Leena Pesu.", "Your home for data science.
