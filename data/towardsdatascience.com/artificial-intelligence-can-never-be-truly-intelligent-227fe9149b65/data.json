I don\u2019t know any Chinese, neither written nor spoken. I can\u2019t even differentiate the writing from other similar scripts, such as Japanese. Now, I receive a second batch of writing, but this time with a set of instructions in English (which I do know) on how to correlate the first batch with the second. I use these English instructions to find patterns and common symbols in the writing.", "I then receive a third batch of writing, once again with a set of English instructions, which help me correlate it with the first two batches. These instructions also help me frame a response using the same set of symbols and characters. This goes on.", "After a while I get so good at this game that nobody, just by looking at my responses, can tell if I\u2019m a native Chinese speaker or not. But does this mean I understand Chinese? Of course not.", "This brilliant example, called the Chinese room argument, from John R. Searle\u2019s Minds, Brains and Programs(1984)[1] highlights the fundamental flaws in our understanding of Artificial Intelligence. This article is an ode to the idea that the \u201cintelligence\u201d we try to manufacture artificially, is not really the \u2018intelligence\u2019 that you and I identify intrinsically as a trait of our species. It is but an imitation or an illusion of human intelligence.", "Over the years psychologists, researchers and philosophers have attempted to formally define the concept of intelligence. Several varied attempts at defining intelligence have been made, but no standard definition has been established yet, despite a long history of research and debate.", "Colloquially, we use the term \u201cintelligent\u201d in daily conversation; but the context here implies only a subjective measurement of the relative \u2018cleverness\u2019 in people. When used informally, the word alludes to intelligence to a very specific degree, at an individual level. In this article, we focus only on general intelligence as a defining feature of the human species.", "Legg and Hutter, Universal Intelligence: A Definition of Machine Intelligence (2007)[2] attempted to define a universal measure of intelligence. They proposed a generic definition which takes into account most of the proposed definitions till date[3]:", "Intelligence measures an agent\u2019s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.", "This is probably the closest we have come, but it still falls short. This definition concentrates on a goal-based, observable trait of the agent. It implies that in order for intelligence to exist, it must be perceived by an observer, and the agent must be driven by the completion of some kind of target.", "This article proposes a different take on intelligence, one which is inextricably linked to human nature. And to clarify, this is not a scientific take, rather a philosophical one.", "Humans have evolved into intelligent beings. Yuval Noah Harari in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind drives this point across with the theory of a Cognitive Revolution that set us apart from the rest of the species on earth, and enabled us to become the earth\u2019s dominant species today. We can thus assume human intelligence to be our gold standard for \u2018intelligence\u2019.", "But why do we exclude our innate humanness from our formal definitions of intelligence? Is it only about computational power, information processing and memory? Why only measure productivity and efficiency?", "In addition to task-performing capacities, we also need to take into account the intangibles \u2014 wit, humor, morality, ethics, free will, self-awareness, intuition, and consciousness \u2014 not to mention, the capacity to create fiction. As Harari mentions, the ability to tell stories is what pushed our species to become the masters of the planet.", "Needless to say, this also means taking into account the darker aspects of being human \u2014 deception, selfishness, the ability to lie and cheat. This capacity to create fiction \u2014 the art of storytelling \u2014 is what we refer to as imagination. If Einstein was Einstein only due to the huge repository of information and knowledge at his disposal, coupled with an above-average ability to process this information, then any supercomputer would be able to replace him and we\u2019d be able to reproduce millions of copies of his mind today.", "AI researchers use one of the many available definitions of intelligence[2] as a basis for their work on creating an artificially \u201cintelligent\u201d agent. A quick Google search churns out a definition for AI: \u201cthe theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.\u201d", "Let\u2019s play along then. Envision a machine that follows instructions, performs tasks, and makes decisions \u2014 yet it doesn\u2019t know what it is, doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing, why it\u2019s doing it, or what it\u2019s purpose is. It doesn\u2019t even want to know. The machine is faster than you, better at storing huge amounts of data, and more efficient. It can perform computations at the speed of light, obey instructions to the T, follow orders and play a damn good game of chess.", "However, no matter how fast the moves, how efficient the game play, how \u201cintelligent\u201d the strategy may seem \u2014 it is all still confined to the four corners of a chessboard, and the machine labors under a predetermined set of rules. The machine has either been pre-programmed, or it ingests huge amounts of data and learns from it. Either way, its knowledge is limited to what it has been exposed to.", "Could the machine cheat? Could it suddenly lash out in anger and flip over the board in frustration? It\u2019s goal is well-defined: to win the game. There is no room for the outlandish, the unpredictable. For example, the machine feels no pressure from it\u2019s opponents\u2019 intimidation tactics, because it does not understand the concept of intimidation. Emotions have no bearing on its gameplay. We, on the other hand, might sweat and stress and panic while facing off against Vishwanathan Anand in a chess match.", "The AlphaGo might beat Lee Sedol at a game of Go, and DeepBlue might be able to beat Garry Kasparov at chess, but these are \u201cWeak AI\u201d with a single goal. They are not multi-faceted, intelligent beings. A machine like that is merely a super-productive, highly efficient tool \u2014 a means to an end; not an independent existence within itself. An efficient factory worker can certainly be replaced with a far more efficient machine \u2014 but automation is not the same as intelligence.", "The AI we know today are striving desperately to play the imitation game. This begs the question \u2014 If I behave exactly like a human, does that make me human?", "Chatbots do this very well. A lot of chatbots today can easily pass the Turing test. They mimic human emotion to a frightening extent. This doesn\u2019t make the bot human though. All it means is that bots can be exceptional at creating the illusion of emotion, even though they have none. Naturally, the \u2018emotional support\u2019 you seem to receive from a bot is a farce.", "AI can create music, paint and mimic human voice modulation and speech[4] \u2014 but they are still following an algorithm; a pre-programmed set of rules and patterns. Even if they are capable of creating art, is there any sentiment in their creation? Are they proud of their work? Do they consciously associate emotion to it?", "The question of right or wrong is also not at stake here. Some may argue that it\u2019s better if a machine does not \u2018feel\u2019, so that it can perform in situations where people may lose their sense of judgment or be slow to react under emotional duress. Emotionless agents also ensure fairness and cold, hard rationality, when it comes to decision-making. But if humanity is the bar for intelligence, then these agents certainly do not qualify to sit at the table.", "Today, what we are trying to achieve and what intelligence really is, are very far apart. Our current definition and outlook are misguided \u2014 we only consider a goal-based approach to measure intelligence, but we do not take into account the characteristic that separates man from machine: self-awareness. And as long as we continue to separate the mind from the brain, we may never attain the realization of true intelligence in machines.", "Your home for data science.
