Although Developers have a unique vantage point of working from home (WFH), as teleworking is one of the perks that come with any Software Engineering role, no one was expecting such an abrupt pandemic-driven shift. Conjointly with a crowded house, impromptu home-school, a multitude of distractions and competing demands where everyone is trying to be effective, people are not as prepared as they thought they were.", "For many technology professionals the previous luxury of occasionally WFH, has turned into an uncertainty:", "\u2014 how long will this last? \u2014 how much time, effort, money shall we sink into setting a permanent home office? \u2014 how can we remain productive, especially when having to deal with social upheaval? \u2014 how this limited face-time in the office will affect our careers?", "are some of the questions we all ask.", "I have put together these 5 key strategies that I have learned over the years as a WFH developer, as well as a list of those productivity tools that should be in any developer\u2019s toolbelt, to help you ease the transition to remote work and thrive at these difficult times!", "This is where you have mostly read that what you should strive for is a separate office (impenetrable by the outside world) with big desktop space, an adjustable, leather chair, a huge HD monitor, plenty of natural light, with an ambience that matches your personality style. Reality check:", "Unless you live in a mansion, that\u2019s not likely to happen!", "But you can still design your home office with improved productivity and purpose in mind.", "Try to stay out of trafficked living areas and find a quiet place of the house, if at all possible. It doesn\u2019t matter if you live in a studio apartment or a five-bedroom house \u2014 your home was not built with your job in mind, so as long as you create a space that works for you then it is perfect! Since relocating to Tokyo I had to give up my stylish home office and had to resort to a corner in our bedroom to set up my new desk. Nevertheless, it feels private from the rest of our apartment and when I close the door my husband and 4 year old daughter know I am not interruptible.", "One important aspect to keep in mind here is the work-life separation: the way I tackle this challenge is to only use my desk during working hours \u2014 although I admittedly work longer than I should, when I am done for the day, I am really done!", "If you are working on a laptop, do get an external monitor so you have a bigger screen with more real estate (or use your television). No more squinting and your laptop display can become a second screen dedicated to e-mail, Slack or Jira, allowing you to focus on getting your work done. Antiglare screens can seriously up your contentment level and combined with an external keyboard and mouse, your new office setup can get really close to emulating an actual desktop computer experience.", "Make your workspace comfortable with a chair you can sit in for 8+ hours a day. All I can say is that I should have done it 10 years earlier!!! Believe me, it is really hard to be a focused and productive developer when you are constantly straining to see your computer screen or rubbing your aching back. If you cannot fetch one on time, you may consider using a lumbar support pillow, as a quick fix.", "Never neglect your posture \u2014 when you look at your computer, your eyes should be nearly level with the top of the screen. If the monitor is too low you will end up craning your neck or hunching over. You also want the monitor to be at arm\u2019s length away from your chair.", "Nothing makes me more shaky as an internet outage. Relying on stable internet connection is a must but with multiple concurrent internet users in your household during lockdown, it can get sluggish. Check its speed using fast.com and do not compromise with anything that does not feel right for your needs. In my case the speed is fine, but had to get a repeater to boost the signal to our bedroom.", "For peace of mind having a backup plan is prudent: a mobile hotspot device, or a cell phone plan that allows tethering can be \u201clife- saving\u201d. When everything fails then having a repository of tasks you can complete without an internet connection will become handy :)", "If you are able to, work near a window; it will truly transform your office environment. The variation in natural light has proven health benefits, and being able to maintain a sightline to the outdoors will keep you alert, boost your creative thinking and will be a source of inspiration. If you have houseplants position them in or near your workspace \u2014 it is a great way to bring the outdoors inside and will definitely increase your creativity and decrease stress. And last but not least, even the simplest of touches (think, a framed photograph) can go a long way toward keeping you grounded and focused.Confession: I used to scoff at these \u2b06\ufe0f ideas, but they really make a difference!", "Every work environment has its distractions. Make no mistake, every time your attention is drawn away from the task in hand, it may raise your stress levels making your ability to sustain productivity far more difficult. But as you have found a way to tune out that colleague whose voice was very irritating, you will find a way to overcome the disruptions that come with your new home setup.", "Background noise is a very subjective topic, some people prefer absolute silence to concentrate, while others find silence an impediment to their productivity and love a bit of ambient noise.", "When I am into a creative mode, I do not mind a level of background noise, but when I am trying to find a bug, understand complex technical concepts or perform any other task that involves deep thinking, I do not tolerate any noise at all.", "As sound levels increase, the complexity of the tasks you can perform generally decreases.", "\u2014 Minimise at Source: My husband and I have different \u2018acceptance criteria\u2019 to noise tolerance, so we have created a home office etiquette: we share our schedules in the morning and we let each other know when we are not to be disturbed. This way the noise is minimised at the source 80% of the times \ud83d\ude43. For the rest 20%, if only there was a simple solution...", "\u2014 Noise Cancellation: Noise cancelling headphones attempt to fight sound with sound, blocking unwanted sounds with waveforms that are \u201cequal and opposite. Do splash the cash getting a decent pair, and you will not regret it! I have these Sony ones \u2014 great quality and very comfortable to wear, even for long periods of time!", "\u2014 Noise Masking: When the noise cannot be stopped at the source, or cancelled with the headphones, I resort to masking it with other, less distracting sounds. While this is a sub-optimal solution, it is far better than suffering the stress and distraction of pretending to ignore it. These are the tools I live by:", "Emails, Jira notifications, slack popups, calendar alerts, virtual meetings, calls are just a few of the interruptions we experience on a daily basis. They enhance the context switching and they are killing our performance. To regain control over my time, I practise notification detox\u2026This is what you can do:", "Another topic that really puts me off when I browse the internet are Ads. Aside from being intrusive and creepy, they clutter the screen, reduce network performance and deflect my attention, big time. Ghostery does a pretty good job eliminating them.When Ads blocking is not enough, I use Text Mode which removes any visuals in a page (pictures, videos, etc) and lets me focus on what is important: the text!", "It is not necessarily the distraction itself that is the real issue, but the post-distraction period \u2014 distractions derail your mental progress for up to 20+ minutes afterward. Even if you only get distracted a few times a day, the amount of time you lose as you struggle to get back into your happy work place is significant!", "This brings me nicely to the next section\u2026", "Popular blogs are packed with \u201cgame-changing\u201d productivity techniques: Pomodoro, Getting Things Done, Pareto Principle to name just a few. I have tried a few of them, but the main issue is that when you do something creative like programming, they do not fully apply.", "I will share those techniques that work best for me, they span from staying focused to beating procrastination and better time management:", "Yes \u2014 this is exactly what it sounds like! I first came across the term when I attended a workshop in the City of London where Daniel Pink was promoting his new book, \u201cWhen: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing\u201d. I thought to give it a \u2018\u2018shot\u2019\u2019 and it was a.m.a.z.i.n.g! Here is how it goes:", "When you feel a bit drowsy (normally after lunch) drink a cup of coffee, put your alarm for 25 minutes and take a nap. When the alarm goes off is when the caffeine takes effect and helps you wake up feeling clear-headed; it \u201cresets\u201d your biological clock and improves your cognitive performance. It sounds counter-productive, right? It is not! You will really feel more alert afterwards!", "I use To-Do lists to keep organised, but for me personally, it has been more effective to use a calendar. A To-Do list sets inflexible limits and gives \u201cthe paradox of choice\u201d, while a calendar keeps me on top of my work by constantly reminding me of deadlines. So what I do is to keep my To-Do list as a backlog and transfer my daily picks in the calendar. Once a task is in the calendar, it is official \u2014 I commit to completing it.", "What I love about this method is that it motivates me to base my daily schedule on real factors and time constraints. There are 24 hours in a day after all\u2026 so if my To-Do list is a mile-long it is impossible to address all the tasks and it quickly becomes overwhelming.", "A few tips to keep in mind:", "An added advantage is that instead of leaving your calendar as a blank open slate for others to populate, you are in charge of when work is to be done!", "If you don\u2019t prioritise your life, someone else will! \u2014 Greg McKeown", "Tracking the time you spend on various programming activities is essential. Clockify is primarily a work hours tracker that helps you track the time you spend on projects and collects data that shows how productive you are. It is easy then to log accurate time in Jira so your manager is happy and can plan better based on your velocity. You also get insights on your productivity and contribute to improving your estimation skills as you recognise the real time a task has taken.", "It is part of our jobs as Developers to research a subject. I normally have a few tabs open on my browser over a few windows with my work-in-progress resources. Along with Outlook, WebEx, Visual Studio, Excel, SourceTree (and the list goes on) my desktop becomes too busy, too quick. To keep my workspace organised, my two favourite apps are HazeOver and Magnet. If you work on Mac, do check them out! There are similar ones for Windows too.", "Every time you fight off a temptation, you spend some willpower points. Simply put: actively resisting the urge to eat a chocolate bar is harder than not having the chocolate at all. So instead of fighting off temptations, you remove them from your surroundings altogether; no temptations, no willpower wasted. My employer does a pretty good job blocking most of the social media websites, but I tend to get hooked in tech news websites and Medium.I use Timewarp, a Chrome extension which lets you set up different redirections in case you visit an unproductive website during work. You can have the add-on redirect you to a more productive site, show you a motivational quote, or display the time you have spent on it.", "The right methodology can make your day, every day. The trick is to be intentional about what you need to achieve!", "One of the biggest perks of working from home is that you do not have to deal with long commutes. But beyond passive media consumption or hitting snooze until 8:59, starting your day as early as you used to and focusing on self-development can be very beneficial: not only you can maintain good mental health, but you also expand your knowledge and unlock new potentials. Besides, \u201cGreat developers never stop learning\u201d! Please refer to my popular article for inspiration and actionable ideas on how to develop your know-how excellence:", "\u26d4\ufe0f Important Note: Your commute time should translate to your \u201crest\u201d allowance i.e. detaching from work and having some \u201cyou\u201d time! Although focusing on your self-development is pivotal, when you do need to snooze until 8:59, do not feel guilty!", "Most developers prefer to have less contact with colleagues, but this can be detrimental to team cohesion and affect both productivity and career progression. A communications strategy on how often the team should check in and how they will convey any changes or blockers to one another, should be employed from the outset and followed. Regular catch-up (audio or video) meetings can help bridge the gap between the old/collocated and new/remote way of working and keep all staff integral to the team.", "Let your colleagues know when you are not working so they are not left hanging if they need to get in contact. Courtesy \u2018Be right back\u2019 or \u2018Off work\u2019 Slack status updates can set the right expectations and help the team\u2019s workflow.", "When working for a company that follows a cadence of daily meetings (e.g. morning Scrums) and core working hours, it will be good to synchronise your routine with that of the team for near-seamless collaboration.", "Do not default to email or Slack if you would have spoken to a colleague face-to-face while at the office \u2014 pick up the phone or set a video call. This will cut down on miscommunication and break up some of the social isolation that can come from working from home.", "In a remote work environment we are mostly judged by the volume, quality, and timeliness of our output. As developers, our commits, pull requests or Jira transitioning (Open, In Progress, Done) are talking for our work and offer a good degree of transparency. But how do you explain to your Dev Lead about that pesky bug that took 2 hours to find out, and it was a\u2026 typo? \u2014 We have all been there!", "The key to steering through this long period of remote working is clear communication!", "When working remotely the lack of access to information is one of the most frustrating factors and at times can feel like a big obstacle to completing your work. Documentation is very important here \u2014 Use your company\u2019s wiki (e.g. Confluence) to create How-To articles, document the technical design of your new masterpiece, or anything else you think your team will appreciate.", "Although COVID-19 has accelerated the process, remote work has been trending upward for the last few years. I hope after reading this guide you will supercharge your success as a remote Developer!", "I regularly write about Leadership, Technology & Data on Medium \u2014 if you would like to read my future posts then please \u2018Follow\u2019 me!", "Your home for data science.
