The API is free to use and it is public, meaning that the user does not need an individual API key.", "In the first section of the script, the user needs to define the variable called \u201cdepth\u201d to defines the level of detail of the analysis. This can either be set to \u201csector\u201d or \u201csub_sector\u201d. Choosing \u201csector\u201d will produce a plot such as the one in Figure 1, whereas \u201csub_sector\u201d will produce a plots similar to the ones in Figure 2 and Figure 3. In this last case, the user has to also specify the \u201cfilter\u201d, that is the sector of interest. The available values of filter are: Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Energy, Financials, Health Care, Industrials, Information Technology, Materials, Real Estate and Utilities.", "All the other inputs such as the list of S&P 500 stocks, and the date to compare current market performance against (beginning of 2020) are automatically set.", "At this point, the data are downloaded and all the calculations are performed. As anticipated, the yfinance API is used to gather the financial data.", "The last section is where all plots are created.", "You can find further comments to the code and additional details in the notebook on the GitHub page.", "In this section, the outputs of the code presented above are summarised in Figures 1, 2 and 3.", "COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on our lives, our habits, on the real economy and on the financial markets. The financial shock caused by the pandemic has not been uniform, and the various business sectors have responded differently to the crisis.", "It can be seen from Figure 1 that all sectors, as an average, have been negatively impacted by the pandemic, with the highest losses in the energy sector. In fact, due to a large portion of the world population being in lockdown, the demand for oil and gas has significantly dropped. The industrial sector has experienced significant losses as well, especially in the \u201caerospace and defence\u201d and \u201cairlines\u201d sub-sectors. The main reason is the reduced demand for these services, due to the restrictions in place and the fear of COVID-19 spread.", "Health care is the business sector that has suffered the least, with some companies in the biotechnology sub-sector gaining an average+16% in stock price, Figure 2. This is because many companies are investing resources on the COVID-19 vaccine. The company to win the race could have stellar profits.", "Smart working and the desire of people to speak and to see their loved ones have increased demand for video conferencing apps and software in these unprecedented times. As people are quarantined in many countries, they tend to spend more time on streaming services. As a consequence, home entertainment and telecom services have performed well during the pandemic (+12% and +23%, respectively), Figure 3.", "If you want to read more on the topic, please refer to this article I have written a few weeks ago (May 2020) to explain the effects of COVID-19 on each business sector and sub-sector.", "Disclaimer: investing in the stock market involves risk and can lead to monetary loss.
