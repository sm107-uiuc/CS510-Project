After extensive job searches and talking to many people, I realized those skills are not enough for me to actually start working as a data scientist. They lack some connections to reality.", "So I started Udacity\u2019s Data Science Nanodegree. It is a lot more comprehensive than an online course. I am halfway through now and I want to share some very practical things I have learned so far.", "The CRISP DM process is a framework that\u2019s commonly used to guide the data mining process. The nice thing about this is that it is comprehensive. It also captures all the necessary skills that a data scientist would need.", "As you can see in figure1, there are six steps in the process.", "The problem with a standard data science curriculum is that it tempts you to think data science is 70% modeling and 30% data wrangling.", "The truth is it might be only 5% modeling, 80% data-wrangling and there are other crucial components there too.", "This reminds us that when we are looking for a data science job, we should show that we have the skills for all six steps, not just the 2 steps. For example, when we are building our portfolios by analyzing a public dataset, start by stating the business problem instead of directing jumping into EDA.", "TDD stands for test-driven development. It is different from testing your code because TDD means you write your tests even before codes. I will give an example below. It is a common practice for software engineers but it has just started to incorporate into data science in recent years.", "Most of the standard online courses don\u2019t even mention testing your code, not to mention TDD. As a newbie, these terms also sounded foreign to me, but here\u2019s why you must know them.", "For example, you designed a model to predict which customers are likely to churn. Then the engineering team incorporates your model into the company\u2019s system. Now, every time after an update in the customer database, account managers can automatically see the results. It means a real impact!", "For codes that will go into production, you don\u2019t want your code to break just because of someone inputs some different customer data. You want to make sure your code runs smoothly and you have considered all the circumstances that could happen. For this, we need testing.", "Here is an intro to testing:", "Problem: every time we want to test, we need to reprint this code. This is very labor-intensive if I need to run many tests. Also, I need to manually check if the result actually matches 4. In other words, this method doesn\u2019t directly tell me if the test passed or failed.", "Pytest automatically runs the tests for you and it tells you PASS/FAIL. Here is how you start using it.", "Then you created a folder that has contains the files of your test function. The two key tricks here are:", "Otherwise, Pytest will not run any tests.", "Make sure you are in the directory where it contains your test files. Then you just type \u201cpytest\u201d in the terminal.", "Pytest automatically runs all the tests and tells you how many passed, how many failed, and which one failed. As we expected, I got 1 failed and 1 passed.", "There are other forms of tests we can use in Python. For example, mock and hypothesis. Here is a good guide that introduces all the methods if you want to read further. I also attached additional resources at the end of the blog.", "TDD only means we write that test file before we write any functions. So all our tests will be \u201cfailed\u201d to start with and our job is to write codes that can pass all the tests. Though it is just a difference in order, it makes lots of difference in output. Here is why:", "2. At least for me personally, writing tests before writing the code makes me write better tests. In other words, writing tests after I am done writing my codes, it is so easy for me to forget to consider some circumstances.", "I think it is because after we wrote our codes, our minds have already bounded by our thinking process when writing the code. It is hard to jump out of our own box. It is the same reason why we always want someone else to read over our essays because we can hardly do it. We need a fresh pair of eyes.", "I found that lots of times, online courses are like a recipe that only gives you the ingredients. It didn\u2019t tell you the spices that you will also need to bring out the aroma or to make the dish tastier.", "I hope my blog helped. Next week, I want to talk about the ETL pipeline. See you next week!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Share what I learned, and learn from what I shared.
