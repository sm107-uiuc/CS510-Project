However, this article will go over one of the most common and quickest methods to evaluate the performance of a model known as Precision and Recall.", "Before we get into precision and recall, we must first understand what the True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative outcome classifications mean.", "In order to better understand these outcome classifications, let\u2019s say we\u2019re building a classification model to determine if a patient has cancer. In this case, as the purpose of our model is trying to predict if a patient has cancer, the positive outcome would be if a patient has cancer, and understandably, the negative outcome would be if a patient does not have cancer.", "True positives (TP) are positive outcomes that the model predicted correctly.", "In our example, this means that patients who were predicted to have cancer by the model indeed does have cancer.", "True Negatives (TN) are negative outcomes that the model predicted correctly.", "In our example, this means that patients who were predicted to be healthy indeed does not have cancer.", "False Positives (FP) are positive outcomes that the model predicted incorrectly. This is also known as Type I error.", "In our example, this means that patients who were predicted to have cancer were actually health.", "False Negatives (FN) are negative outcomes that the model predicted incorrectly. This is also known as Type II error.", "In our example, this means that patients who were predicted to be healthy actually had cancer.", "Although the TP, TN, FP, and FN values can give the data scientist some indication of how a model is performing, it is hard to numerically evaluate each value individually without referencing the other values. This is why data scientists often use Precision and Recall for evaluating models.", "Precision is the percentage of outcomes that are positive (or relevant). This is calculated as below:", "In our example, precision would be the proportion of the number of patients who actually had cancer and were detected to have cancer over the number of patients who were predicted to have cancer.", "Recall is the percentage of actual positives that were correctly identified. This is calculated as below:", "In our example, recall would be the proportion of the number of patients who actually had cancer and were predicted to have cancer over the total number of patients who actually had cancer.", "Ideally, a well-performing model should produce both high values of precision and high values of recall.", "Having high precision but low recall means that although the model is good at predicting the positive class, it only detects a small proportion of the total number of positive outcomes. In our example, this would mean that patients who were predicted to have cancer most likely have cancer but out of all the patients who have cancer, the model only predicted a small proportion of them to have cancer. Therefore, the model is under-predicting.", "Having low precision but high recall means that although the model correctly predicted most of the positive cases, it also predicted a lot of negatives to be positive too. In our example, it would mean that of all the patients who actually have cancer, most of them were correctly predicted to have cancer, there were also a lot of patients who didn\u2019t have cancer that the model predicted to have cancer. Therefore, the model is over-predicting.", "This is a quick introduction to a simple method to evaluate models. These values are really quick to collect and calculate and can give an estimate of how well a model is performing.", "Your home for data science.
