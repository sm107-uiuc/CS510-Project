But wait wait\u2026. \u015bwhat does occluded face means? Well occluded face means face which is not completely visible, I mean some of it is with covered with something like mask or camera is not able to capture the footage of face due to blocking or something.", "Why would we need this? Well, this can find a lot of application in capturing someone performing some miscreant activity or something.", "I am you all would be pretty well versed with it the first two, and get to know about the third one as we proceed further.", "Here is our outline for the article.", "We will be maintaining two files titled as gen_encoding.py for generating encodings and face_recognition for detecting faces.", "We will be using the images of the person whose face we want to detect. It would be better if we are provided with couple of photos. We will be storing the images of the persons in seperate folder named as name of the person whose Image is.", "In the above code snippet we are importing the required libraries on the top and using for loop we are reading images from the image directory serial wise and getting name of the image by splitting image extension.", "In the above code snippet we are converting the color of the image according to the model in face_recognition library.", "In the second line we are getting the location of images from face_location function which returns squared dimension.", "Further using those locations we are cropping out the face area and generating encoding of the image using the face_encodings function of face_recognition, which used certain neural network model to do the some but I won\u2019t go into details about it as it is out of context.", "In the above code we are storing the encoding and the name of the image in a list and storing them in a pickle files as dictated below.", "Now enough with the encoding part. Now we will be working with the real slice of detecting faces.", "For writing our code we will be using face_recognition.py named file.", "In the code below we will be opening the encoding file generated as above and storing it in the data variable.", "In this section we will be working on face detection in the provided image. So first we will be loading the image and converting it into standard color format we will generate its encoding for comparison.", "Now in the code snippet below I am comparing the image\u2019s generated encoding with all the encoding of the face\u2019s encoding already stored. If in case the difference between them comes below the threshold, we take it as encoding of the respective persons faces and displaying the same with imshow() function.", "Now repeating almost the same process as above with now with videos frames not with images.", "In the code below we are initializing the our PC\u2019s web cam.", "In the code given below we are just reading each frames and converting it into standard color format according to the model in face_recognition library.", "Now using the face_location function we are detecting the face location in the video frame and generating its encoding in the last line of the code.", "Now in the below code we are comparing frame\u2019s encoding with the encoding of the faces already stored, and if we find the difference to be below some threshold, take that frame to be containing the face of the person whose encoding is already stored.", "Now in the below code we are just drawing boxes around the face and displaying name of the person above that.", "Hurray\u2026. you made it. Congrats on developing your first advance face recognition model.", "Though the code seems complex at first but the concept behind the whole code\u2019s working is quite simple. OK, let me brief for you all what we have done. First we have generated encoding for all the images available. Now at detection time we are just comparing the encoding of the person we are detecting with the encoding of the person\u2019s already stored. So it is quite obvious that the same person will show less difference. And in case if the difference doesn\u2019t cross the threshold, we mark that face to be of unknown person.
