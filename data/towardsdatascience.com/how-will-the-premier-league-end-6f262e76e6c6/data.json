It is not clear if the leagues will continue or not. But if they continue, how will they end? In this article I will create a model that predicts the result of the Premier League games left, to complete the league table. Will Liverpool win the league? Will Manchester United qualify to the Champions League? And which teams will be rejected? These are some of questions that will be answered at the end of this article.", "To create a useful dataset, we need lots of match statistics. Luckily for us, http://www.football-data.co.uk/ is a website that provides statistics on every Premier League match from 2005 to today. Here, I have downloaded the data from each season and merge it into one dataset.", "This dataset contains 5592 observations with 144 variables. However, we will not use any of the variables in the final model. Instead, the variables will be used to create new ones, such as \u2018Average Goals Scored by the Home Team\u2019. In fact, the model will mostly depend on average-variables. Since the aim is to predict the games left, variables such as \u2018Form\u2019 would be dependent on earlier predictions. To make this more clear, say that we have the variable \u2018Form\u2019(that measures the amount of points in the last five matches for the home- or away team), and we want to predict the last match of the season. Then the variable will only depend on the outcome of earlier predictions. This could skew the predictions and thus skew the final league table. However, when creating regular betting-models, variables such as \u2018Form\u2019 are vital and should be added.", "The complete dataset ended up with eight variables split into home- or away team and season- or total average. This makes the total number of variables 8*2*2 = 32. These are the variables:", "Of course, it would not hurt to add a couple of more variables. But this will do for now. Below is the code for creating the total average variables for both home- and away team(A similar approach is used when calculating the \u2018season average\u2019 variables).", "Now that the dataset is complete, let\u2019s explore it! First off all, it should not contain any NA:s", "Perfect! Now the dataset is split into a training- and a test dataset. But first, all games from Matchweek 1 are removed since they have zeros across all average variables. Thereafter, one XGBoost model is created for \u2018Home goals\u2019 and one for \u2018Away goals\u2019. This will make us able to predict the result of the coming matches. In XGBoost one can plot the importance of the variables, below is that plot for the \u2018Home goals\u2019-model.", "As expected, there are a few variables that contributes a lot and some that don\u2019t contribute as much. \u2018Average Corners for the Away Team\u2019 and \u2018Average Yellow Cards for the Away team\u2019 seems to be the least important. Whilst \u2018Average Corners for the Home Team\u2019 and \u2018Seasonal Average goals for the Home Team\u2019 seems to be the most important. This makes total sense due to the fact that we want to predict goals for the home team. How many corners the away team will have does not change the probability of scoring significantly. Nevertheless, all the variables will still be in the final model since this will not be too computationally heavy.", "Since Liverpool already have a huge lead of 25 points and since there is only 9 games left to play, they only need to win two more games to lift the trophy. Here is how the models predicts Liverpools upcoming matches.", "Easy! Liverpool walks home the league with 7 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss in the 9 last games. Liverpool are not only winners, they are winners in style. With 104 points they break the current point record of 98(Manchester City,2018/19). This would be their first PL title in 30 years(season 89/90)!", "So, how did the other teams perform? After predicting the rest of the games, the league table ended up like this.", "The Champions League tickets goes to Liverpool, Man City(But they are banned so who knows), Chelsea, Man United and perhaps Leicester since City are banned. The two other teams from the \u201cTop 6\u201d, Arsenal and Tottenham, gets to settle with a 6:th and a 7:th position. The teams that unfortunately are predicted to play in the championship next season are Brighton, Aston Villa and Norwich.", "The model seems to favour the big teams. For example, Leicester are right now placed 3rd in the PL and Man United 6th, but the model predict Man United to finish above Leicester. Similar thing happened to Brighton, who sitts in 15th place, but are predicted to be relegated. My hypotheses is that the model favours the big teams because most of the variables are dependent on how the teams performed many seasons ago. Of course the big teams will benefit from this. After all, they are considered big because of how good they performed the last couple of seasons. If one would try to do this themself, this is an area that could be improved.", "There you have it! Liverpool wins, Chelsea plays Champions League next season and Norwich only scrapes together 21 points. That is, if my model is 100% correct. Which no model is.", "Your home for data science.
