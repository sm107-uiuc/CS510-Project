The aim was to provide investors with the best zip codes to buy and develop homes in the state of Texas.", "The dataset contained descriptive variables like state, city, region ID, and county. It also contained a variable called SizeRank, which after data exploration, ranked zip codes by urbanization. The more urbanized area, the higher the size rank. The data also included the median housing prices from April 1996 to April 2018. These are the values that I used to perform time series analysis. Before diving into that analysis, some pre-requisites needed to be met to be considered for investment.", "The investor had several preferences to invest:", "When all the zip codes were filtered and ranked, I ended up the following five zip codes:", "The zipcodes pertained to the following cities in Texas:", "Now that the 5 zip codes were obtained, I proceeded to perform a time series analysis to rank these zip codes according to forecasted 10-year returns.", "Now a time series can be plotted and we can visually inspect the data.", "The median housing prices had a positive trend and the prices are probably not stationary because the next period prices depended on the previous period price. So, I calculated the monthly returns, performed a model fit for each zip code and calculated forecasts using the monthly returns. The returns are more likely to be stationary and have a constant mean of zero. Next, I proceeded to calculate and plot the monthly returns for the five zip codes.", "From the above plot, I noticed that there was no clear trend in the data and it appeared that the data was stationary, which is an assumption to build the model. A helpful visualization to check for stationary is the rolling mean and standard deviation which shouldn\u2019t display a trend for the data to be stationary.", "While the data does not appear to be stationary, it is not enough to just rely on the visualization and proceed to fit time series models. Therefore, it is necessary to perform an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationary.", "From the results above, two of the five zip codes resulted in non-stationary at a 95 % confidence level. Therefore, these four zipcodes will need the \u2018I\u2019 parameter in the ARIMA model is going to be set to 1.", "ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. So far, only the value for the \u2018I\u2019 parameter is known. Now it is time to search for the AR (p) and MA (q) parameters to best fit each zip code.", "The AR & MA parameters are estimated using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots of stationary time series.", "Plots were created for each of the zip codes to find the best estimates for the AR and MA parameters. For most of the zipcodes, the plots followed a decaying pattern. Therefore, the models will likely include both parameters.", "To further aid in finding the parameters, a nested for-loop was performed using the Akaike Information Criterion or AIC. AIC is a value provided by statsmodels that estimates the relative quality of a statistical model and provides a means for model selection. A model with many features that fits the data well will be assigned a larger AIC value than a model with fewer features to achieve the same goodness of fit. Therefore, we are interested in the lowest AIC value possible.", "From this estimate, the ARIMA parameters (p, I, q)obtained were (1, 1,1) and the seasonal components(P, D,Q,S) were (0,0,0,12). This tells us that the data has a seasonality of 12 periods. This was repeated for the other zip codes. The parameters were passed onto a model and summary is as follows:", "From the above plots, we can see that the KDE curve is relatively close to the N(0,1) curve which indicates that the residuals are normally distributed. The Q-Q plot also shows us that the residuals are normally distributed because the blue dots(the residuals) are along the red line(normal distribution). The graph at the top left doesn\u2019t show any obvious seasonality and appears to be white noise. This is confirmed with the graph at the bottom right because the time series residuals have a low correlation with lagged versions of themselves.", "The next step after fitting the model is to validate the model by comparing the predicted value to real values to the accuracy of our model.", "I decided to leave the last three years as the test set and train the model on everything before that point. Once a model was created, I calculated the RMSE on the train data set and then performed a one-step forecast on the test set to calculate the goodness of fit of the model.", "As we can see from the graph above, the one-step forecast seems to align with the true values very well. It will also be useful to quantify the accuracy of our forecasts. We will use the MSE or mean squared error, which summarizes the average error of our forecasts.", "With dynamic forecasting, we only use information from the time series up to a certain point, and after that, forecasts are generated using values from previous forecasted time points.", "Once the model was trained, I used the model to generate the monthly returns for the next 10 years. With this information, I calculated the total returns for periods of 1, 3, 5, and 10 years.", "After performing the times series analysis on the five zip codes and forecasting the total returns for up to ten years, I recommended to the investor the following zip codes:", "Having more domain knowledge in real estate investing will improve analysis. These models can be improved by taking other external variables into account. These other variables can include tax rates, crime rates, school district ratings, and interest rates. It may to interesting to compare a time series analysis on just housing prices and the monthly returns discovered in this analysis. The results from both would improve the decision-making process.", "Please note that this project was just an exercise in time series modeling and shouldn\u2019t be taken as an actual real estate investment.", "Your home for data science.
