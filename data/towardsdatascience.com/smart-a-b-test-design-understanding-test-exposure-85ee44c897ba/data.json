However, I was fortunate to have colleagues that helped me understand these ideas intuitively, including basic concepts behind test design. I wrote about this in another article titled \u2018The intuition behind A/B Testing \u2014 A Primer for New Product Managers.\u2019", "Once I got past the basics, other techniques helped me optimize the design of my tests. In this article, I will talk about one of these techniques \u2014 Test Exposure.", "Understanding \u201cTest Exposure\u201d is essential because it helps design the test in a manner that can help you get to results faster.", "We\u2019ll start with a simple example. Imagine your product is a website www.merchant.com that lets users buy furniture. The following diagram explains how the user may navigate through the various sections of the website.", "X refers to the total number of users who arrive on your website on any of the landing pages. Y is the number the users who visit on the shopping cart page. Z is the number of people who click Checkout on the shopping cart page and enter the checkout process.", "Let\u2019s assume that the following numbers reflect the value of X, Y, and Z.", "X = 12,000 unique users per day (averaged over the last month)", "Y = 1,200 users per day (or 10% of all landing users add something to the cart and visit their shopping cart)", "Z = 400 users per day (3.33% of all users who visit the website end up buying something. Alternatively, 33.33% of the users who start the checkout process end up buying the item.)", "Let\u2019s imagine your shopping cart page looks like the following:", "Let\u2019s imagine your design team has come up with a test hypothesis:", "In research related to how people read, they expect an action that takes them forward to be present on the right side and an action that takes them back to be on the left side. By moving the checkout button to the right, we can increase the conversion of our website by 10%, because people who may not be converting because they can\u2019t find the checkout button will not easily find the checkout button.", "So, you come up with the following design as your variant.", "The next step for the test designer is to determine how to split the traffic between control and variant groups. You have two options:", "You have to make this decision, and if you are new to A/B testing, you wonder", "Does it really make a difference?", "To answer the previous question, let\u2019s evaluate the size of the sample set you will need. To answer this question, we will use Evan Miller\u2019s excellent A/B testing sample size calculator. We shall use the standard value of the significance threshold of 0.05 and a power of 80%", "The sample size for Option 1", "What this is saying is that you will need 46,224 users per variation or approximately 92,448 unique users entering the website.", "The sample size for Option 2", "What this is saying is that you will need 3,161 per variation or 6,322 users entering the shopping cart. If 10% of all users who visit the website end up in the shopping cart, then to get 6,322 users onto the shopping cart, you will need 63,220 users entering the site.", "Compared to Option 2, Option 1 requires 46.23 % more users. Option 2 is superior because it detects the same outcome faster, thereby speeding up the tests.", "When I first identified this issue, my reaction was the same.", "How could just changing the way you allocate users into the variant and control bucket change the number of test participants when everything else stays the same?", "To find out why I did some online research, and here is what I learned. To understand this, you have to map out the user flow and identify the users who fall into the two buckets of \u2018converting\u2019 and \u2018non-converting users.\u2019", "Note that the group of people who don\u2019t convert is composed of people who enter the checkout flow as well as people who don\u2019t. Evan Miller calls the latter \u2018Dead Weight.\u2019", "In the scheme above, there is significant dead-weight. Therefore the ratio of \u2018signal\u2019 to \u2018noise\u2019 is low, and you will require more samples leading to a slower test result (as you saw in the calculations above)", "In this scheme, there is no dead-weight. Therefore the ratio of \u2018signal\u2019 to \u2018noise\u2019 is going to be high, and you will see your test results faster (as you saw in the calculations above)", "Intuitively, the amount of dead weight in Option 1 compared to Option 2 will be dependent on two things:", "The efficiency gain (through a fewer number of users needed to run the test) of designing your test via Option 2 vs. Option 1 is calculated by", "For a more mathematically rigorous explanation of this, feel free to dig into the details.", "Test exposure refers to the concept of splitting your users into control and variant groups at the right moment in the user journey. The right moment is when the user would see the altered design had it rolled out 100%.", "I want to give my colleague Stas Blade from VRBO credit for introducing me to this particular concept, and to Evan Miller for his excellent sample size calculator and his thought leadership on the topic of A/B testing.", "About Me: Aditya Rustgi is a product leader with over 15 years of product and technology leadership experience in Multi-sided Marketplaces and B2B Saas business models in eCommerce and Travel Industry.
