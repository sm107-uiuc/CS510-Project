With lots of things happening around the world of software development, it is time for software powered firms to take responsibility and move up in the digital transformation ladder. DevOps being the center of attraction today, every firm wants to embrace it and move forward. But DevOps isn\u2019t easy, legacy companies find it hard at times while technology startups don\u2019t have enough funding to invest in the infrastructure and required resources.", "We all agree that cloud and DevOps aren\u2019t about tools, but somehow tools have become the focal point when we talk about today\u2019s digital transformations. The cloud firms today are impacting the developers\u2019 life in one or the other ways. Just like how Jenkins became a defacto tool for CI/CD in DevOps, it has its own community, and if anything shifts in the tool, the developer gets impacted.", "When it comes to adopting the new technology, some firms play it safe while others move out of their comfort zones. Not all firms are ready to embrace cloud and DevOps, but when they do, they keep their faith and trust in the tools they believe. The recent DevOps and cloud acquisitions like Docker getting acquired by Mirantis, Microsoft acquiring GitHub and Travis CI getting acquired by Idera have left the developer community in chaos.", "We will discuss such acquisitions here in the article today and their impact on the developer community.", "The cloud business is more competitive, and more players are popping up each day. The customers have so many choices, but evaluating a proper tool and technology is becoming hard. It is becoming a challenge for cloud companies to grow along with the ever-changing technology advancements like AI, IoT, Big Data, etc and the recent players having all the capabilities are giving a hard time for legacy companies.", "One important thing to say here is, acquisitions don\u2019t necessarily mean winning. For example, despite having acquired so many technology companies, Google still lags when compared to its competitors like AWS, Microsoft, and Oracle in the cloud business.", "As a result of this acquisition, you know what happened next, Idera owners fired most of the engineers, including some senior management.", "Also, you might have seen what these private equity firms do after buying your business, first off, they fire the existing management because the company goals change. Then the whole strategic business approach changes as the administration get a replacement; they will aim to get out of the existing brand and business as much as possible.", "CloudBees has a name in continuous delivery, and the Jenkins automation platform and Electric Cloud in application release automation, so the synergy is pretty evident and seems in good hands.", "Docker co-founder Solomon Hykes tweeted about it with a pinch saying it was a difficult time for Docker and, it is a good move.", "The developers in the organization are liable for most of the decisions that happen around the technology stack and tools because they are the ones to use them for the betterment of the company. The worst part is, some software powered companies don\u2019t even consider the developers vote while selecting a technology or a tech process for the company, that is where things start misaligning. That is when the blame game starts; the company begins blaming developers and vice versa.", "When a new tool or a platform enters the market, it is either well accepted or rejected by the community. Let\u2019s take one example, Docker Swarm; it created a significant impact since Docker already had a community in place, and this made a massive impact on the adoption of Docker Swarm until the community saw Kubernetes. Docker Swarm didn\u2019t make much impact with big firms where more workloads and orchestration was required, Hence soon, Kubernetes replaced Docker Swarm and became the de facto tool for container orchestration. But when compared with Docker Swarm, Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and a complex setup.", "When companies like Docker get acquired, the community who is very familiar with the tool gets impacted since the developers will be unsure of the future of the company. In turn, it affects the companies using such technologies. Docker Swarm got replaced by most of the companies already, and the whole developer community is learning and interested in knowing how to use Kubernetes efficiently.", "Hence, when the acquisitions don\u2019t align well with the community, the developer gets impacted. The productivity and morale go down as the tools and platforms he (developer) knew from long ago eventually go away into different hands.", "It is time to empower the developer community, it is time to take responsibility, step up and developers need to make a move:)", "We aren\u2019t talking about some successful acquisitions here; instead, we are talking about the ones that will have an adverse impact on the developer community, just like Travis CI getting acquired by Idera, which itself is owned by a private equity firm and a similar Sonatype acquisition. Anybody in the software field can easily guess what type of acquisition is this and what is the future of such acquired companies when they get acquired by private equity firms. As mentioned before, when such cloud firms got acquired by any private equity firms, they lost all the reputation and fired the old employees and squeezed all the money left by leveraging the brand. (Example: Travis CI)", "No matter what, the developer community should evolve and thrive to newer heights. It is time for developers to be a part of the strategic engineering decisions that happen inside the company and they are required to present their view on what is good in the long run for the overall company.", "Your home for data science.
