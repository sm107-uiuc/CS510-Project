Building a data warehouse | by Adriana Cano | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Data warehouses: The theory", "description": "We have reached a point in the field of data that keeping up with the different technologies and the different steps of using and processing the data has become like a job itself; applying them to\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["We have reached a point in the field of data that keeping up with the different technologies and the different steps of using and processing the data has become like a job itself; applying them to practice even more so. There is the collection of the data, the storage, the cleaning, the analyzing, use of the data: each of these steps has multiple tools and programming languages that one can use, each of these steps has many different ways to handle your data, on cloud or corporate servers, aiming for the same goal. Recently I had the chance to get my hands dirty with data warehouses.", "One simple definition of a data warehouse (DWH) is as a database dedicated to data analysis and reporting, maintaining the history of data. DWH applications are often called OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), they are not however optimized for transaction processing, that is the domain of OLTP systems. The data is usually loaded through an ETL (Extract Transform Load) process of the different sources like OLTP applications, external data providers or mainframe applications. The users can read the data but they cannot write; often-wise they perform time-related data analysis.", "A data warehouse is typically described as a collection of different data sources, transformed in order to be easily queried and maintained, adapted to the needs of the business for doing analysis; the foundation for business intelligence environment.", "The advantages of building a DWH are many but some of the most important ones are:", "As with any other processes, there is a source and there is a destination. In the case of data warehouses the data sources can be just about anything, the idea is that we aim to put together many different sources, being that flat excel files or operational systems, feed them to the warehouse and thus preparing them to be analyzed by the end users. However there are some intermediate steps in the whole process of building the warehouse.", "Between the data source and the warehouse we have the staging area. The purpose of the staging area is that of being a bridge between the sources, collecting the data from the different sources, duplicating them and storing them with some system data. They are often loaded daily but can be loaded even more frequently. The staging data bring also some perks:", "Right after comes the actual warehouse. The warehouse consists of a dimensional model. A DWH has a broad vision as it has data of all the different units within a company being thus the central point of the structured data. Therefore there exists another possible step before reaching the end user: data mart.", "A data mart is a subset of the DWH that has pre-processed data and is aimed at a business unit for analysis.", "The utility of a data mart is that of separating the data for the different units, reducing the amount of data being considered, making it easier to access the data as well as isolate them from the rest of the units. The presence of data marts is however optional.", "With or without the data marts the processed and well organized data is used for its original purpose: analyzing the data in attempts to find useful facts and insights, building reports on top of these data to make visual the information extracted or do even more complicated stuff like data mining.", "The data model of a data warehouse is called a dimensional model. The reason of the name comes from the fact that the model consists of dimensions and facts.", "Fact tables are those tables that measure the performance of the business and how it changes over time.", "These tables contain two type of columns: facts and foreign/surrogate keys to dimension tables. It can contain additive, semi-additive and non-additive measure types and usually take up to 90% of the DWH. They can be of three different types: transactional, periodic snapshots and accumulating snapshots. Examples of fact tables are all those tables that traces periodic (daily, monthly, quarterly etc) activities within the company likes employee\u2019s daily activities, sales, ticket signing and so on.", "Dimension tables are tables that provide basics for fact tables, have descriptive attributes for filtering records, grouping records and labeling reports.", "Dimension tables instead provide well structured information to the fact tables which also means that their main purpose is that of providing filters, grouping and labeling of the data. Examples of dimensions are people, hierarchical organization of people, products, places etc.", "The first step in designing a dimensional model is that of identifying the two types of tables, their grain and the relationships that exists among them. Each of these two tables are advised to have surrogate keys and to keep a clean naming convention. One important aspect to keep in consideration when designing these tables are Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD). These kind of tables are those that keep track of the attributes that change over time. E.g. in a table where the positions of the employees are kept it is important to keep track of the changes over time of the positions so that to know the start and the end date of each one of them. There are 6 different types of these tables and the choice on which one to adapt for your model depends on the needs of the business on the analysis that will later be done on these data.", "Star schema is the most basic and effective schema for a data model where the fact tables are in the center connected to the dimensions.", "There exists yet another schema for the model called snowflake schema.", "Snowflake schema is quite similar to the star schema with the difference that dimensions are also connected among them.", "The star schema is a special case of the snowflake schema. The snowflake schema affects only the dimensions, the fact tables do not change with respect to the star schema: dimensions are kept in a normalized form to reduce redundancy which makes them easy to maintain and reduce storage space but it also leads to an increased number of joins needed when querying the data.", "When all is said and done, as per Kimball\u2019s advice and as almost any kind of documentation requires a bus matrix can be produced where we once again put in display the relationships between the tables, in this case putting the emphasis on the distinction between facts and dimensions.", "As with anything else in the data world there does not exist a golden rule that works in all cases therefore very specific guidelines cannot be given and it depends on the data at hand as much as it does on the business need. So what to take into account when considering to build a data warehouse is that a great part of the time before building the model is spent understanding the available data and what you/the business units aim to obtain from them. By doing so you can be able then to think of a model and how to structure each single table and how to connect them. There are however two crucial aspects to keep in mind:", "Your home for data science.
