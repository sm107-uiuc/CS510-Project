There is also a huge amount of discussion about it\u2019s impact on society today and in the future.", "Yet \u2014 I\u2019ve seen very little material explaining well how an AI actually works. How is an AI built? What does it actually do inside the black box?", "Albert Einstein said once that \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough.\u201d I rarely see explanations about AI that are simple. So I am going to try.", "I\u2019ve called this blog \u2018AI for the Rest of Us\u2019 \u2014 for those who are not currently participating in the AI revolution and want to understand what is going on. I suspect there are many people who fit into this category.", "I know before I started learning about it I felt a little like there was this revolution going on which had no place for me to be part of \u2014 or even understand. I want to fix this for everyone else who feels like that.", "This is the first of a series of blog posts. To start, I will work through an example of the simplest type of machine learning \u2014 linear regression. Many knowledgable people would argue it\u2019s not really even machine learning \u2014 it\u2019s more a statistical technique that has been around for ages. And they are right.", "Understanding linear regression though will provide a great basis for understanding the more advanced techniques that truly have driven the AI revolution over the past few years.", "The use of the term Artificial Intelligence implies that what is being built is intelligent. It\u2019s not. It has no initiative beyond working towards whatever aims you have set it. It has no awareness.", "Before I start, a very quick note. The use of the term Artificial Intelligence implies that what is being built is intelligent. It\u2019s not. Not the way we are.", "If you teach a machine to do something today, it can only do that. It hasn\u2019t learnt how to do anything else and without you teaching it to do something else, it will never learn it. (It might learn other things faster though on the next thing you teach it if it is a similar task \u2014 known as \u2018transfer learning\u2019).", "It has no initiative beyond working towards whatever aims you have set it. It has no awareness. It doesn\u2019t \u2018think\u2019. It simply has learned a way to answer a question which is not easy for a human to figure out themselves easily. This is known as \u2018narrow\u2019 AI. \u2018General\u2019 AI may be coming (where the machine is self-aware and can learn without a human training it \u2014 and much more) but it\u2019s not here yet, and even then the building blocks are most likely to come from \u2018narrow\u2019 AI.", "Linear Regression comes from a segment of machine learning called \u2018supervised learning\u2019.", "You would use \u2018supervised learning\u2019 when you have some data, and you want this data to give you insights about a question you need to answer.", "Additionally, to train the machine in the first place, you have plenty of examples of where you have the data, and you have the answers for that data for your question (this is the \u2018training data\u2019).", "For this, you would need past data on shopper characteristics (eg age, sex etc) and info on whether they bought or not to feed into the algorithm.", "For this you would need previous scans of lungs and answers as to whether the person had lung disease.", "Again, you would have examples of houses with all this info provided \u2014 and the price it was worth (ideally what it sold at)", "You would need previous examples of speech fragments (ideally from a range of different people with possibly different accents!) and the transcription of what they said).", "So \u2014 how does it work?", "This is how you \u2018train\u2019 an AI. It\u2019s pretty simple actually right?", "Note that to make this work, you need a meaningful amount of examples as training data to train the machine. In fact, getting the right data, and making sure you use it correctly is one of the biggest challenges to building a high-performing machine learning algorithm.", "Of course, there is more complicated maths etc that goes into all this, but I will give you a simple example below of linear regression so you can get understand how this works.", "When do we want to use linear regression? It\u2019s when the answer to your question is a number. eg share price, house price etc. You wouldn\u2019t use it when trying to predict whether someone has lung cancer \u2014 the answer to that is yes/no. The branch of machine learning for that isn\u2019t vastly different but it is a different technique which I will work through in subsequent posts.", "Linear Regression is used when the relationship between the data you have, and the answers of your questions are not very clear and easy to figure out. For example \u2014 everyone can add two numbers. It\u2019s easy. Furthermore, it\u2019s also easy to program a relationship like this:", "Even if the formula looks complicated to you \u2014 you can probably figure out the answer with a calculator. Furthermore, you could add a 100 more variables \u2014 and you could still calculate the answer (most likely you would write a program to do so or use a spreadsheet) if you knew the relationship between the answer and the inputs.", "The key here is that you have a well-defined relationship here between the answer you seek \u2014 the house value \u2014 and the inputs. You can just do the maths.", "The problem is \u2014 in the real world \u2014 house price value doesn\u2019t always follow a strict formula. It\u2019s not clear and consistent how a house will be valued. Often it will vary for reasons that are hard to figure out. Even if you input every single thing you could possibly know about a house \u2014 it might still vary from the best guess.", "Furthermore, if you have identified 40 different variables which can affect the house price, it\u2019s very hard for a human to discern and figure out how all those factors affect the price. Things like what is happening in the national economy, the local economy, performance of local schools, changes in local demographics, age of the house, state of decor of the house, sizes of actual rooms, layout of rooms etc etc could all affect the price \u2014 and many of the variables themselves will affect how other variables impact the price.", "For example, in one zipcode people might really value extra garden space. In others, they value more how close the nearest restaurants are. How the local economy is doing might impact how much people value the size of the rooms so how the price varies with respect to the room sizes will change as the local economy changes! How much each factor affects the price itself will vary depending on other factors.", "Ultimately it can get pretty hard to identify the relationship between all these inputs and the house price.", "This is where machine learning comes in.", "Machine learning can be eloquently described in one line \u2014 it\u2019s an advanced pattern recognition algorithm. With enough data, it can identify the relationship between tens, hundreds or even thousands of variables and the outcome \u2014 although rarely is it right all of the time.", "Ultimately, a typical example of a good use case for a linear regression machine learning algorithm would have the following characteristics:", "OK. Hopefully this all makes sense so far. Now it\u2019s time to go through an example \u2014 part 2 of this post. Note there is the odd deviation to how linear regression is actually programmed in my description below \u2014 but what happens in the algorithms is as explained.", "Founding team of @Markit.
