Some questioned whether he was secretly injured or simply his playing days were over. Matt Ryan, meanwhile, was performing much better with an average of 22.1 points per game. Given Rodgers\u2019 preseason ranking and name value, I made a play to trade him for Ryan, which my opponent accepted.", "The trade was looking good until Week 7, when Ryan left the game injured with only 3.6 points. To add insult to injury, Rodgers put up his largest performance of the year in Week 7 as the #1 overall player with 43.8 points.", "Ryan sat out Week 8 and never really returned to form, scoring more than 20 points only once in the last 6 weeks of the season. Rodgers struggled at times down the stretch, but still put up two 25+ point games after Week 7.", "This would turn out to be my best trade of the season. I wasn\u2019t even looking to trade for Jones, but wanted to get rid of Mixon after a horrible start to the season. When my opponent offered Jones, I thought it was a good deal; Jones had been performing better over the first few weeks of the season.", "The imbalance would continue for most of the duration of the season, with Jones giving five (!!) 25+ PPR point games with an average of 21.1 points per week compared to Mixon\u2019s sole 25+ point game in Week 14 and an average of 14 points per week.", "This trade would give me a massive 7.1 point weekly advantage for the duration of the season.", "In the same trade group, I also had my worst trade of the season. While Lindsay didn\u2019t dominate in 2019 (only one 20+ point game, in Week 5), bad luck would strike Williams with a rib injury in Week 11, where he would leave the game with only 2.3 points and not return until Week 16, at which point I had already dropped him from my lineup.", "This trade would cost me a calculated 5 points per week.", "The Patriots defense would end up being a historically great defense, and despite their incredible first three weeks, I suppose my opponent suspected regression to the mean and was willing to part ways for a Vikings defense that was highly ranked in the preseason.", "Luckily for me, the Patriots D/ST would continue their dominance, scoring 20+ points in four of their next five outings between Weeks 4 and 8. They did regress to the mean a bit in the second half of the season and would have been a bad trade with the Vikings starting Week 9 through the rest of the season, but those monster weeks in the first half of the season made for a great trade.", "As part of my final trade of the year, in Week 5, I traded for the top-ranked kicker. The trade didn\u2019t do much, as Greg the Leg would end up scoring 74 points to Crosby\u2019s 76 points the rest of the season, essentially rendering the trade useless, although given the way I streamed kickers the rest of the season, it didn\u2019t matter much.", "I almost didn\u2019t propose this trade, but I\u2019m very glad I did and my opponent accepted. OBJ was drastically underperforming relative to expectations at the start of the season, but due to name value, I figured I could get a trade. Cooper seemed to be a reasonable risk-reward option, and luckily for me it turned out to be the right decision. Cooper, despite some serious inconsistency in the back half of the season, would go on to deliver 159.1 PPR points to OBJ\u2019s 126.4 the rest of the season, a net of +3 points per week.", "Overall, I made some pretty good trades, earning a theoretical 8.5 extra points per week because of my trades. Of course, I didn\u2019t play each player I traded for each week, but it does validate my sense that I made out pretty well this year.", "While the Trade Evaluator is a good tool to get a sense of whether you should have made the trades you did, keep in mind the following:", "What were your good, bad, and ugly trades of the 2019 fantasy football season?
