In a Monte Carlo simulation, we randomly generate multiple scenarios to understand the probabilities of achieving different sales figures. We could for example have a scenario where we don\u2019t get a patent and we sell $3 million or\u2026 we don\u2019t get a patent and sell $9 million or\u2026 we do get a patent and sell $15 million etc.", "Different scenarios have different likelihood of being generated based on their likelihood of occurring in the real world.", "Below are 10 randomly generated scenarios.", "We can see, for example, that in 5 out of the 10 scenarios we would generate sales exceeding the $6 million offer. So far, it is hard to tell if this is a good deal.", "To draw better insights we will re-run the simulation using 10,000 rounds/scenarios instead. Below is the code to run the simulation in Python, but you can also run your Monte Carlo simulations in other programming languages or even in Excel.", "Note: We use a triangular distribution to model the base sales which ranges between $1\u20139m and the increase in sales due to patenting which ranges between 25% \u2014 75%.", "The triangular distribution is appropriate to use when we have an understanding of the minimum of a range, the maximum, and the mode (most likely case).", "When generating random samples using a triangular distribution, we are more likely to sample values near the mode (most likely case) compared to the extremes (min/max). For example, a scenario where the increase in sales due to patenting is 47% is more likely to be generated compared to one where the increase is 27% since 47% is closer to the mode that we specified in our assumptions (i.e. 50%).", "Now that we have simulated 10,000 scenarios, let\u2019s see whether or not we received a good offer.", "We can now see that we only have a 36% probability of generating more than $6 million of sales. If we average across all 10,000 simulations, we expect to sell $5.45 million on average.", "Not only does this deal eliminate the variability in sales, but it is a good deal that you are less likely to beat if you forgo the wholesaler\u2019s offer.", "Of course, if you still prefer to take on the risk with the hope of achieving a higher sales figure, let\u2019s say +$10 million, then you can take that call. The Monte Carlo simulations would help you by giving you a heads-up that you would have a 5.9% chance of achieving that according to the simulations.", "Now suppose you are running an online subscription-based service.", "Problem: You want to set aside enough cash today to ensure, with 99% confidence, that you will have at least $1 million to pay for your annual costs of maintaining the service next year.", "What we can do in this case is simulate scenarios of what the next 12 months could look like based on the available history.", "In the example below, the -5.4% growth in Month 1 was randomly chosen from the historical data (Month 4 in history), the 0.3% growth for Month 2 corresponds to Month 45 in the historical data and so on\u2026", "Note: We did not make any assumptions about the statistical distribution of the data in contrast to what we did in Example 1, where we assumed triangular distributions for some variables.", "Our approach in this 2nd example is entirely non-parametric since we are now directly sampling net growth values from examples in history.", "The only assumption we make is that net growth in the next year should resemble historical net growth figures over the past 5 years.", "Next, based on the randomly simulated 12 months, we calculate the total revenue accumulated over the simulated 12 months.", "In the above example, we can see that $1.18 million was generated in this scenario which is enough to cover the $1 million of expenses. If the revenue is below $1 million we should have access to some cash that was set aside in order to cover the expenses.", "Now let\u2019s look at the distribution of revenue\u2026", "The average annual revenue is USD 1.2 million across all 10,000 simulated scenarios. The chart above shows the probability distribution for total accumulated annual revenue. For example, if we look at the area between USD 800,000 and USD 1 million, we can see the small bars reflecting that such low revenue figures have low likelihood of occurring, but are still possible.", "To solve our problem, we need to know what annual revenue are we able to achieve or exceed with 99% confidence. We can sort the 10,000 simulated total revenue results from lowest to highest and take the 101st lowest result. 100 out of 10,000 (1%) simulated total revenue results are lower than this number, 99% are equal or higher, so we are 99% confident we would achieve or exceed that number.", "We are 99% confident that we can achieve or exceed $950,497 over the next 12 months based on this simulation. This would keep us $49,503 short of the $1 million needed to cover our annual expenses.", "We need to set aside $49,503 to be 99% confident of being able to pay the $1 million of annual expenses in the next year.", "The above examples are intended to demonstrate sample real-life problems Monte Carlo simulations can help with.", "For many real-life use cases, the implementation would be more detailed where we would need to put additional effort, especially in handling correlations.", "Monte Carlo simulations are flexible enough to help in many different use cases and there are plenty of use cases that cannot be encompassed in a few examples.", "Your home for data science.
