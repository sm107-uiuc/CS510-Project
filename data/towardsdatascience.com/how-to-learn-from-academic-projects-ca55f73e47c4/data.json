While a lot of the discussed points are experiential , it is my idea that they hold good for most CSE undergrads.", "\u201cCompanies will want to see the work you have done, other than what you did as a part of the curriculum\u201d. These were the words of a \u201cplacement teacher\u201d at my institution. This was his subtle way of letting us know that the projects done for the grades didn\u2019t mean much to an employer. I do not know if this is how it is everywhere.", "But, the people I knew corroborated the above statement. They felt that recruiters did not care too much about academic projects. In fact, they wanted to see what else these candidates had done. Now wait, do not paint the employers as villains yet.", "A significant amount of academic projects are completed by students because they must do so. There is no sense of passion or desire to learn of these endeavours. This results in work that lacks quality. Work that is boring, uninspiring and not very valuable to anybody.", "And if we, the students ourselves undervalue our work, why should recruiters not? Besides, the perception of a recruiter with regards to our project must be secondary. The most important task is to acquire knowledge from these projects.", "The competition is not between the candidates\u2019 projects, it is between the ideas and implementations in those projects. It is about how much you have learnt and applied.", "A significant amount of academic projects are completed by students because they MUST do so.", "The foundations of Project-Based Learning advocate the importance of hands-on approaches. These are guided at providing students a paradigm to learn by exposure. However, like what is so traditional of the human race, this approach is frequently misused by us.", "PBL integrates knowing and doing. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum \u2014 a shift mandated by the global world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resiliency. These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience. \u2014 Thomas Markham(Source)", "The above definition is arguably the greatest summaries of what PBL is at its core. For the sake of brevity, let\u2019s compress PBL into one fundamental phrase \u2014 Learning By Doing.", "Working on a project allows students to :", "As ill luck would have it, PBL in today\u2019s classrooms usually do not work along these lines. It is not a fault in the method. Instead, it is a shortcoming in the general understanding of academic projects. We tend to misunderstand the whole purpose of academic projects.", "Well, you are reading this because you do. In fact, almost everybody does. It does not matter whether you spend your sessions in the front of the class or at the back benches. It has nothing to do with your grades either.", "Having stated that we all misunderstand the meaning of projects, its about time I back up my argument with some facts. So, I want you to go through the following questions and mentally answer them(yes/no).", "If your answers to at least 2 of these 8 questions are a \u201cyes\u201d, welcome to the club of those who have misunderstood the purpose of academic projects. I have already joined you with a score of 3.", "What we see as 40\u201370% of our final grades, is in reality way more than that. It\u2019s not just the grades that the projects help us in achieving. It\u2019s the substantial amount of knowledge we gain from working on these projects that help us build our foundational base for our future careers.", "Each part of a project helps us know a little more about an aspect we didn\u2019t know much about before.", "An academic project is way more than the 40\u201370% of marks it accounts for.", "In this section, I list out a few of the most common mistakes we all make as students at college when we work on our academic projects. This list is not exhaustive by any means, so feel free to add in more in the comments section!", "Choosing a topic everybody is working on or writing about is too easy. It squanders terrific opportunity to work on a unique or valuable problem statement. Less-popular projects interest your audience more. So, to stand out one must work on less common ideas.", "An idea that seems like the next greatest invention is usually a trick of your mind, unless you have a proper plan to make it happen. It\u2019s usually difficult for undergraduates to differentiate between rational ideas and unicorns. Hence, it is important to measure project choices using realistic scales.", "I don\u2019t mean to sound offensive, but it seems like almost everybody is working on a problem because they want to use data science. Data science is a great field. But if we are going to be driven by the hype, we will become blind towards the problem. The longer we dwell on the technology or the tools we use than the problem itself, the more limited is our solution.", "Copying code from the internet and submitting it as your own might have it\u2019s own set of ethical issues. But, often students skittle around these as most of us believe that, \u201cIt\u2019s not a crime. So, why care?\u201d. The folly in that thought is out of this article\u2019s scope. By blindly copying code, all we usually get is a temporary fix and a lot of missed opportunity to enhance skills.", "Beginning work on any academic project in the day before submission is not an efficient way to learn. You might finish it and pick up a grade, but it was never your best work. And your score on the learning code is pretty much going to be nil.", "Documenting academic projects is the most overlooked aspect of any project. This is why it is difficult to explain our projects well to others, even though we have done some real good work. It is always important to maintain a record of all the steps undertaken, including those that failed.", "There are no perfect team members. There are only team members who complement each other\u2019s weaknesses and learn effectively together as a cohort. Unfortunately, this is one of the toughest ideas to understand. There can be several reasons why we become bad team players:", "Of course, the blame game is not the right thing to do here. The smarter alternative would be to choose your team such that it lets you work and serve the problem you are trying to solve.", "While the previous section highlights the hindrances to learning, this section discusses the solutions. I have spent 4 years of undergraduate study in a discipline where the depth of your knowledge is measured by the quality of your projects.", "The following points summarize these tips that have seemed to work for me. Hope these help your cause.", "Think of marks as a bonus to what you do. The real idea of incorporating projects into the curriculum is to provide students a chance to self-acquire skills that can\u2019t be covered within the confines of an academic semester.", "If it is in your control to choose your team mates, build a team that can work together. Choosing our closest acquaintances onto our team is a mistake we all do. A team must ideally not be built on who is friends with whom, rather it is to be based on who can contribute effectively with whom.", "We learn more when we have a goal in place. In a project, our goal is the problem we wish to solve. So, undivided focus on this is can do wonders.", "Do not wait for the last moment to start your project. Be pro-active and make a plan to work on it the moment you are informed about it. While there are several ways to plan successfully, I am not sure which one will work for you. So, I will leave you to decide on that!", "An organized structure of your project will facilitate in easy understanding of the work you have done. This will prove beneficial to both you and your project reader. If you are working on data science projects, one template that could help you is Cookiecutter Data Science.", "A rough book to scribble in all your experiments, results, questions and interactions w.r.t the project will help with knowing what to write in the final report when you prepare it.", "Every solution is flawed. Every. So, always know the pitfalls of your work and the assumptions you have made. In this way, you are indicating to your evaluator or employer or critic that you are aware of your project.", "Be open to feedback. There are always multiple sides to every argument made. So, look at criticism as a new way to improve.", "Discuss your work, if it is not too confidential. An external perspective will help improve your work.", "Do not rely on the internet for the simplest code snippet. The internet must not be what adds value to you, you should be what makes you valuable.", "If your project has hit a bottleneck or failed, don\u2019t hide it. Report your issues and diagnose the problems that you faced. If people know where you failed, they have a much better chance of helping you out with it.", "Picking up another\u2019s code is not wrong as long as you give them attribution. It is always encouraged to use what others have written to build and improve on those to create your projects. However, if you are going to pick up entire programs and pass them off as your own, then that\u2019s just plain stupid.", "There are no \u201cbetter\u201d projects. Every project stands on its own. It could be your simple data analysis with the iris dataset or it could be a whole new deep learning framework, but both require equal respect. Not everybody has the same resources and abilities, so be respectful of others\u2019 work.", "In the contemporary world, an educational degree is the most important yardstick with which they measure people in a lot of aspects. However, the irony lies in the fact that academic projects that are a part of the journey to get these degrees are severely undervalued.", "Well, some of us might work very hard on certain projects but honestly, nobody would care unless our hard work transforms into value for them. Therefore, the only thing holding us back from learning from and creating amazing projects is our own mind. We need to improve on this.", "A well-planned, well-structured project helps you learn new concepts with greater ease than doing a course on it. Moreover, a well-written project shows your readers that you care. And in an increasingly selfish world, being able to care for others\u2019 comfort will definitely put you above a lot of your competition.", "Your home for data science.
