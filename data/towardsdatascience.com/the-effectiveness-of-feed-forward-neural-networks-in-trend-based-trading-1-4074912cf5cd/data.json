You should not rely on an author\u2019s works without seeking professional advice. See our Reader Terms for details.", "With the interest in artificial intelligence on the rise, numerous people have attempted to apply machine learning techniques in predicting the market, especially in the field of high-frequency trading using stock price time series data.", "Just on Medium alone there are tens of posts on stock price prediction using RNN, LSTM, GRU, feed-forward neural nets, etc. Predicting the market, however, is no trivial task: it seems that most revealed attempts show less than required performance for a strategy based on the model prediction to succeed. In most posts the situation is either a perfect prediction (an indicator that the writer has definitely done something wrong) or a dismal result that discourages any further research.", "Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019), however, shows that there is hope in using neural networks for predicted returns. While the paper definitely demonstrates the limitations of a simple neural net, it also shows that through careful selection of training period and input data, a simple strategy based on neural net prediction could outperform the buy-and-hold strategy.", "Our research hopes to reproduce Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019)\u2019s results while also taking more time to explore the financial theoretical background. In the end we will use the research\u2019s validated results to introduce more robust prediction models and strategies.", "In this specific article, we will discuss the early failures we had. More specifically, we will be training a feed-forward neural network with a fixed-window time-series input, explain the hypothesis behind why such training should work, and then explore why that hypothesis fails.", "Since there are a million medium posts explaining the effectiveness and limitations of neural nets, we will cut to the chase and discuss why stock price trend-based analysis might work. That is, past stock price data + a few other data points might hold enough information to provide meaningful prediction.", "Pedersen (2015) describes the life cycle of a trend as the following:", "Pedersen (2015) mentions trend-following investing as a strategy for managed futures, but maybe some of the ideas could be applied for our case here.", "Although the extreme form of efficient market hypothesis states that the market instantaneously incorporates every information, both public and undisclosed, researches like Ho, Danny et al. (2019) has shown that people underreact to even publicly available data. Likewise, overreaction because of \u201cherding\u201d effect and events like margin call during a market crisis could cause the market price to move away from the asset\u2019s fundamental value.", "It is true that many of the inefficiencies of the market have already been exploited, thus strengthening the market efficiency. This is where the reason for using a neural net comes in. As underlined by Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019) and QRAFT (2020), the ability to detect nonlinear patterns in data could be essential in detecting financial patterns that have not been detected before. For example, Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019) cautiously attributes the superb performance of a neural net prediction operating on both SPY and target asset\u2019s stock price data to the ability of neural nets to detect nonlinear patterns, overcoming the limitations of the famous CAPM\u2019s dependence on linearity.", "The hypothesis that we held beginning the research was that a neural network trained with a large amount of stock price data would be able to detect the related stock\u2019s deviation from its fundamental value. Although stock price data holds numerous noises and biases, we assumed that a large amount of train data will allow the neural net to train properly.", "The goal of the research was to beat the buy-and-hold strategy. As we were focused on uncovering the ability/inability of the neural net to make accurate future price predictions, we only emulated the trading strategy to work with one given asset. In hindsight, this was an incredibly ambitious project as beating the buy-and-hold strategy for one given asset while only using minimal financial data would promise phenomenal returns if expanded to a diverse portfolio. However, Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019) already shows that using stock data from only two assets (the target asset and the SPY) is sufficient to beat the buy-and-hold strategy with a relatively simple feed-forward neural net. So perhaps while this method might not work for any given asset, it could work for certain ones.", "There are common pitfalls observable in too many Medium posts on time-series data analysis on stock price prediction.", "While our research is not perfect, you can be assured that the pitfalls mentioned above are avoided.", "As mentioned above, our test trading strategy does not create a portfolio; we use one asset\u2019s return prediction to make an all-out-buy/sell decision.", "In theory a well-trained neural net will be able to beat the buy-and-hold position with this strategy. The key factors that will enable excellent returns with this strategy are:", "The reason for selecting such a simple trading strategy is, firstly because this enables the performance of the strategy to be more directly ascribable to the prediction model, secondly because we lack more sophisticated financial knowledge, and thirdly because as a soldier with 400 dollars monthly income and a university student, we cannot afford the required computation power for complex portfolio management backtesting.", "Also note that we will be assuming the risk-free rate is zero, and that we haven\u2019t incorporated transaction cost in our backtests.", "Those familiar with the subject might scoff as they read the specifications of the prediction model discussed here, as it is quite blatant that such model should not work. However, the failure of this model does provide key insights, and helps eliminate false assumptions, so it should be worth exploring.", "I used yfinance to collect Yahoo Finance historical data. For ease of understanding I will introduce three terminologies that I used in the process.", "For the example here we will use training period of 18 years (using trading days between 1993, June 30th to 2010, June 30th), a training size of 100 days, and a prediction period of 21 days (= making monthly return predictions). The chosen asset will be the SPY ETF. We will only consider monthly returns as training data.", "Using pandas DataFrame makes the pre-processing process quite trivial.(Note that the description below explains the input and output as a numpy array, not in form of tensors)", "As you might notice step 3 and 4 could be modified so that instead of forward returns, historical returns [(close_t / close_(t - prediction_period)) - 1] could be used for the same effect.", "You could also be wondering here why we chose to use the daily closing price and not the adjusted closing price. We assumed that the closing price will be \u2018safer\u2019 to use than the adjusted closing price considering the possible look-ahead bias. There are other opinions asserting that using the adjusted closing price is more adequate when backtesting on returns (not price!); this is something that we are continuing to look into. Through feature engineering, we hope to minimize the survivorship bias and look-ahead bias altogether in near future.", "Then what of the test set? We followed the same process detailed above, except that the data was gathered from about 10 years (using trading days between 2010, July 1st to 2020, July 1st), and that when scaling the test input, we used scaler.trasnform to avoid data leakage.", "As it is obvious from the title of this article, we experimented with a feedforward neural network.", "To optimize the neural net and gain insight we tried numerous hyperparameters, activation functions, number of layers, etc, but there is one similarity that is shared.", "In all models we use the tanh activation function for the final output layer. As tanh returns a value inbetween -1 and 1, it is a better choice than sigmoid as the output layer\u2019s activation function, and since we are discounting leverage in our strategy there should not be a case in which the actual return goes beyond the range of a tanh function.", "Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019) shows that quite surprisingly, a simple neural net with a single hidden layer has enough computation power to emulate a crossover moving average strategy. It however becomes less clear whether Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019) maintains that same model structure throughout the paper, and it is only at the end of the paper that we see a successful instance of a prediction model that beats the buy-and-hold strategy.", "We therefore tested performance with a neural net with one hidden layer first. Quite surprisingly, the first backtesting we tried with this model structure showed outstanding results.", "A stunning 0.903 Sharpe ratio (zero risk-free rate) compared to 0.750 Sharpe (zero risk-free rate) of the buy-and-hold position of SPY ETF. Impressive, right? What could be wrong?", "The first problem is that as excellent as the graph above seems, such results are not readily reproducible. Running the same code several times shows that the graph above is the result of pure luck. Most iterations of code shows poor Sharpe, returns, etc, and at that point, tinkering with the model to achieve a similar result as the one above effectively turns the test set into a validation set, putting credibility of any result in question.", "The second problem, and the major problem, is that the performance of the model above mainly comes from predicting a positive return and leeching off the buy-and-hold position of the SPY. To put it in numbers, the model trained for the graph above predicts positive return 78% of the time, and in cases where it predicts a negative return, it is wrong 62% of the time.", "In other words, the model gets lucky so that the 38% of the time it is right with the negative return predictions, it nails it at critical locations where the asset\u2019s price fluctuation is high, and then resorts to hugging onto the asset.", "The last problem is that the training loss stops decreasing at a pretty high point. This perhaps should have been the first indicator that one hidden layer is not going to do the magic; the neural net lacks the computation power to train properly, otherwise the training loss would keep decreasing.", "There\u2019s really nothing to be said here. The model prediction is awful.", "The model with multiple hidden layers shows more promise than the one hidden layer one, in that predicted returns are not so lopsided to either the positive or negative realm. Which in turn just translates to the model sucking at making useful predictions. Yikes.", "All the efforts above turned avail and confirmed that a fixed-window prediction model utilizing a feed-forward neural net cannot beat the buy-and-hold position.", "NO. The terrible performance of our backtests above is caused first and foremost by the deviation of our strategy from the one mentioned by Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019). One such major deviation is the use of fixed-window prediction model itself. From our interpretations of the paper, Aldridge and Avellaneda (2019) seems to have used a moving-window prediction model.", "In fact, digging into the theoretical background shows that fixed-window prediction model is bound to fail in making useful predictions.", "We had more than 4000 data points as our input to the feed-forward neural net in the example above. In a traditional machine learning research, this might seem like an ideal amount of data. That is not the case with our project here, however.", "It is important to consider what pattern we hope our neural net trains to learn. Remember we mentioned in the beginning of the article, under Rationale Behind Stock Price Trend-Based Analysis, that the neural net should be successful if it could detect the overreaction and underreaction of the market.", "What we conclude here is not backed by any evidence, but it seems that there are too many deviations of the market from the fundamental value of the asset that it becomes impossible for the neural net to detect the specific trend-based pattern we are looking for. That is, the market is not as efficient as we thought it would be, causing too much noise in the data.", "If there are certain patterns that only exist dominantly within the training period (1993, June 30th to 2010, June 30th), they could cause overfitting, which would hurt the prediction. Also, note that the pattern we hoped to look for can be described as an universal pattern \u2014 it should exist within any time frame because, as of yet, people do overreact and underreact to market information.", "The effectiveness of the contrarian strategy demonstrated by Khandani and Lo (2007) shows us that even quite recently there existed large inefficiencies in the market that persisted for more than a decade (a Sharpe exceeding 50 was once achievable with a relatively simple strategy!). Taking this into consideration, a proper training of the neural net could require a century, if not multiple centuries, of raw data to be able to rid of persisting noise.", "The conclusion can be the following: if we want viable feed-forward neural net predictions, we either need immensely more data, or more polished and engineered data (unlike the raw ones we used here).", "Another alternative is to switch the trend pattern we are looking for; we stop looking for a universal pattern, and instead go for the most recent pattern that we can detect. This is the idea behind the moving-window prediction.", "Another problem with our selection of time period is that it is slightly more bullish than bearish. By just predicting every future return to be positive, the neural net could achieve a directional prediction accuracy near 56%.", "This would not be a problem if it is mechanically possible to achieve a higher prediction accuracy than the 56%. But what if the best prediction accuracy we could achieve through this method, when not sticking to one specific directional prediction, is below 56%? Then it makes sense for the neural net to predict every next return to be between 0 and 1, as that might be a straightforward way to achieve the lowest loss.", "The dialogue above in reality is actually irrelevant to most of the processes undertaken during the research, as in most cases the neural net overfits, meaning it surpasses the 56% accuracy in direction prediction. But it has proven to be impediments in our earliest efforts, so we mention it for those who might attempt to reproduce our work.", "When we pause to think again about the goal of the task and the little amount of information we utilized to make strides towards that goal, the more we realize the ambitiousness of the task.", "Up so far, the results of the experiments above do tell us that more sophisticated methods are warranted.", "The results above are far from discouraging. In a sense, the methods for asset return prediction we described in the article were bound to fail; our actual implementations only confirmed that belief.", "As we discussed above, there are alternate methods to punch through the problem of lack of data. Currently we are implementing moving-window prediction model with varying engineered features and different machine learning models, and are beginning to see improvements.", "Please give us feedback if you notice logical fallacies or errors in implementation!
