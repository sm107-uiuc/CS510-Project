Wolfram Alpha can; however, do much more than that, including chemistry, linguistics or history and most importantly \u2014 it can give you all the answers using its public API. So, in this article we will explore how you can use it to answer simple questions, solve mathematical problems, render plots or even describe DNA sequences!", "Wolfram Alpha API is free (for non-commercial usage), but we still need to get API key (AppID) to perform queries against the API endpoints. To get API key we will first create Wolfram ID at https://account.wolfram.com/login/create. When account is created we can navigate to developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps, click on the Sign up to get your first AppID button, fill out Get a New AppID dialog. After that we will be presented with API key which is called AppID here, which we can test out with following sample query:", "The above code uses Wolfram|Alpha Full Results API to find out what is lifespan of mosquito. To do so, it makes GET request to http://api.wolframalpha.com/v2/query with parameters specifying our AppID for authentication, question in the input field, format parameter as plaintext (instead of image) and finally, output type which is JSON (instead of default XML).", "We traverse the result as dictionary, looking for interesting fields to print out. The returned JSON (or XML) can be pretty complex and really the easiest way to parse it, is to print it and look for any useful fields in there. Trimmed down example of response for above query would look something like this:", "The most useful part of Wolfram Alpha (in my opinion) is the ability to solve complex mathematical problems. So, let\u2019s try using the API to do some math:", "The Full Results API shown in previous section doesn\u2019t just answer some curious questions, but it also does math (and really almost everything). To make the API aware that we want to do math \u2014 in this case \u2014 solve equation, we need to prepend the actual equation with word solve. Apart from the input itself, the query looks very similar to the one in previous section. One extra thing that's added to this one is includepodid parameter, which tells the API that in this case we only want Result pod to be included in the response. \"What is pod, though?\", you may ask.", "Every result from Wolfram Alpha (both website and API), generally includes multiple categories of data. This can be for example graph, image, step-by-step solution or table. Each of these belongs to its own section called pod, which in turn includes subpods which hold individual pieces of data. Considering that each response can sometimes include even 10 or so pods, it\u2019s desirable to describe what we want to receive from the API. To do that \u2014 podtitle and more robust includepodid - parameters can be used, as shown above.", "The filtered response for above query would therefore look like so:", "And for comparison same (but graphical) result, but with all the pods would look like this:", "Wolfram Alpha can be great learning resource thanks to ability to show not just results, but all the computation steps and API can do that too. To get step-by-step solution for a query, we need to include another parameter called podstate, which specifies pod state change. This will replace the original pod with modified version, which can be - for example - more digits for decimal number like Pi ( DecimalApproximation), extended weather data (more days/months/years) or as in our case - steps to equation solution:", "One neat trick you can use Wolfram Alpha API for is to render MathML. If you\u2019re not familiar with MathML, then here\u2019s quick rundown \u2014 MathML stands for Mathematical Markup Language, it\u2019s an XML based format for rendering LaTeX-like mathematical expressions in web browsers. Even though this format has been around for a long time, it\u2019s only really supported by Firefox, which might make it seem like a bad choice, but JavaScript display engine called MathJax.js makes it possible to render MathML in any browser, which makes it a good choice if you want to show really nice looking complex formulas in LaTeX format in your web application or blog. With that said, let\u2019s query it!", "We again use the example from previous section for querying equation with step-by-step solution, but substituting format=plaintext for format=mathml and similarly replacing all other occurrences of plaintext with mathml, e.g. result = data[0][\"mathml\"]. Above you can see little bit of the MathML output that was given by the API, it's very trimmed as the full output is veeery long, but I would encourage you to try running the query yourself, pass it through MathJax.js and enjoy the beautiful LaTeX math expressions.", "Another pretty common use case for Wolfram Alpha is solving boolean algebra. Same as with basic equations, all we need to do is pass the formula to the API and this is what we will get back:", "The query above doesn\u2019t really show anything new except for specific pods we selected \u2014 Input, MinimalForms and TruthDensity. After parsing data in these 3 pods, we can see the output which includes nicer form of submitted input formula, it's other computed forms (CNF, DNF...) as well as truth density both as fraction and as percentage.", "One of my favourite things to do with Wolfram Alpha has always been rendering complicated plots. Implementing this doesn\u2019t even require much of a code change, the only real change is selection of pods and their fields:", "In this case we use includepodid parameter to select 3DPlot and ContourPlot pods which hold URLs to images of the respective plots in their img.src fields. These plots can be then downloaded and written in binary mode producing following image:", "At this point, I think we\u2019ve seen enough applications for Wolfram Alpha and math. So, what else we can do? As a simple example, let\u2019s explore some DNA sequence:", "We\u2019re again using same API endpoint, but this time we submit string representing DNA sequence. You might notice that we didn\u2019t need to include keyword before the query like earlier with solve or plot. Well, this time instead of using keyword, we added scanner parameter, which specifies the subject area of search query, which in this case is Genome. To find which scanner will return relevant data for some query, it's easiest to run the query without scanner parameter and look for the scanner attribute of each pod that has the expected data.", "DNA sequences are obviously not the only cool thing that you can search for. Some of the other interesting topics can be for example history, chemistry, transportation or music \u2014 just to name a few.", "If you only look for information, then the examples and APIs in previous examples are sufficient. However, if you want/need more natural sounding answer to your queries, then you can use Spoken Results API:", "Queries for the v1/spoken endpoint are very simple. All we need to pass in is an AppID and our questions in the i parameter. This produces response in form of a full sentence rather than plain fact. This can be quite useful when building clever chat bots or maybe as an input for text-to-speech engine.", "As kind of an extension to Spoken Results API, Wolfram Alpha also provides Conversational API, which allows you to ask follow up questions and therefore have conversation with the API. So, let\u2019s try it out and ask Wolfram Alpha something:", "Considering that we want to ask multiple questions, we also have to make multiple queries. First of them is directed at v1/conversation endpoint and includes a questions in the i parameter. We also specify our location with geolocation parameter - this is one of the optional values (other are ip and units) that can provide context for the questions. This first request pretty much does the same thing as Spoken Results API, meaning that it returns information in form of full sentence.", "The fun starts when we ask followup questions. To do so, we make another query, this time however, we send it to the host that was provided as part of the response to first query ( host = r[\"host\"]). The first response also included conversationID which we also have to pass in for API to know what was said prior to that.", "The second query then returns same type of result as the first one, which allows us to keep on asking more questions using provided conversationID and host.", "One last thing I want to highlight here is how the the questions and answers can nicely flow and use context. In this particular example, we used \u201cHow far is it from here?\u201d as followup question, without actually specifying what \u201cit\u201d or \u201chere\u201d really is. These information were automatically inferred from previous question and geolocation parameter.", "This article is really just a tip of the iceberg as far as information available from Wolfram Alpha goes. These APIs can be used for much more than just some math and I think it\u2019s great starting point for building cool bots, smart devices or voice-based applications. Even though it\u2019s not free for commercial use, you still get 2000 requests per month which is plenty to start some cool project. I recommend checking out https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/ for documentation for each API endpoint as well as Wolfram Alpha landing page which shows all the different topics that might give you some idea as to what you could build with it. \ud83d\ude09", "This article was originally posted at martinheinz.dev", "Your home for data science.
