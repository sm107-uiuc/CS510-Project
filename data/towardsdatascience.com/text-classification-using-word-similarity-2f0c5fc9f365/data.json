Following initial consultations last summer, they have recently updated the guidance to better clarify the drivers of vulnerability:", "We have identified 4 key drivers which may increase the risk of vulnerability. These are:- health \u2014 disabilities or illnesses that affect the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.- life events \u2014 major life events such as bereavement, job loss or relationship breakdown- resilience \u2014 low ability to withstand financial or emotional shocks- capability \u2014 low knowledge of financial matters or low confidence in managing money (financial capability) and low capability in other relevant areas such as literacy, or digital skills", "With COVID-related illness and job loss creating fertile grounds for these drivers to flourish, I wanted to look at how a Data Scientist could help a bank identify such vulnerability so they can more proactively offer services of support.", "I imagined a transcript of a phone conversation between customer and bank, or a typed conversation with a chatbot or customer service agent. And looked to NLP techniques to help automatically detect these drivers.", "Potential Strategies:1. Word similarity: scanning the passage of text for keywords (e.g. furlough) or their synonyms.2. Bag-of-Words: derive n-gram features from labelled examples, and use that model to classify future text.", "Given the lack of training data, we\u2019re going with Strategy 1.", "First we unpack the 4 drivers of vulnerability into a longer list of distinct categories that we can then explicitly search for in the text:1. Death,2. Redundancy,3. Illness,etc\u2026", "Since we are going to be using similarity scorer available in NLTK we will need to translate these categories into the correct definition as described in Wordnet (NLTK\u2019s lexical database/dictionary). For this we can use a simple function that gives a list of synonyms for that word and their definition:", "and would therefore help us create the topic dictionary we will search against (where the keys here are the user-friendly topic, and the values are the Wordnet-friendly representation):", "Here\u2019s a passage we may want to analyse (clearly about redundancy):", "I worked in Adult Learning for a county council and my job was paid for by government funding. When the funds ran out, halfway through the financial year, there was suddenly no money to pay my wages. I was called to a meeting with four others (whose jobs were also dependant on the funding) and the news was broken to us. There would be a 12 week consultation period before the redundancy became final. We could choose to take the redundancy payment and go, or we could take another job in a different part of the council. If we refused the job offered to us, we could lose the redundancy settlement.", "which we will tokenize, such that we can iterate through a list of word tokens", "We are going to implement a function that will follow these steps:", "We can then reuse our function to iterate through each topic in our topic dictionary:", "and therefore compute that passage\u2019s similarity with each topic and return the words that were deemed similar.", "After packaging the functions in a module I called synonym.py, running this final function was simple:", "which outputs the below dictionary of results, where we can see the topic of redundancy has been mentioned 3 times in the passage, all times due to the mention of the word \u2018redundancy\u2019 although it could have been any other similar word or similar that could have added to the score had that been used instead:", "We can also use our previously mentioned word_scorer to compare the words listed above (in this case it\u2019s just \u2018redundancy\u2019) with the topic\u2019s wordnet definition (ie. \u2018redundancy.n.02\u2019) to see which usage of the word \u2018redundancy\u2019 was deemed to be similar", "The similarity scores returned point to the 2nd entry (itself) so in this case it\u2019s a redundant test, but in cases where a word is listed as similar which isn\u2019t expected, running this test can uncover which usage of that word exactly was deemed to be similar.", "All in all: a simple, elegant, flexible solution!", "The GitHub repo is included below, any feedback is appreciated.", "Your home for data science.
