This is a full transcript of the lecture video & matching slides. We hope, you enjoy this as much as the videos. Of course, this transcript was created with deep learning techniques largely automatically and only minor manual modifications were performed. Try it yourself! If you spot mistakes, please let us know!", "Previous Lecture / Watch this Video / Top Level / Next Lecture", "Welcome back to deep learning! Today we want to talk about a couple of the more advanced GAN concepts, in particular, the conditional GANs and Cycle GANs.", "So, let\u2019s have a look at what I have here on my slides. It\u2019s part four of our unsupervised deep learning lecture. First, we start with the conditional GANs. So, one problem that we had so far is that the generators create a fake generic image. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not specific for a certain condition or characteristic. So let\u2019s say if you have text to image generation then, of course, the image should depend on the text. So, you need to be able to model the dependency somehow. If you want to generate zeros then you don\u2019t want to generate ones. So, you need to put in some condition whether you want to generate the digit 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. This can be done by encoding conditioning which is introduced in [15].", "The idea here is now that you essentially split up your latent vector into the set that has essentially the observation. Then, you also have the condition which is encoded here in the conditioning vector y. You concatenate the two and use them in order to generate something. Also, the discriminator then gets the generated image, but it also gets access to the conditional vector y. So, it knows what it\u2019s supposed to see and the specific generated output of the generator. So, both of them receive the conditioning and this then essentially again results in a two-player minimax game that can be described again as a loss that is dependent on the discriminator. The extension here is that you additionally have the conditioning with y in the loss.", "So how does this thing work? You add a conditional feature like smiling, gender, age, or other properties of the image. Then, the generator and the discriminator learn to operate in those modes. This then leads to the property that you\u2019re able to generate a face of a certain attribute. The discriminator learns that this is the face given that specific attribute. So, here, you see different examples of generated faces. In the first row are just random samples. The second row is conditioned into the property of old age. The third row is given the condition old age plus smiling and here you see that the conditioning vector is still able to produce similar images, but you can actually add those conditions on top.", "So, this allows then to create really very nice things like the image to image translation. Below, you have several examples of inputs and outputs. You can essentially then create labels to street scenes, you can generate aerial images to maps, you can generate labels to facades, or black & white to color, day to night, and edges to photo.", "The idea here is that we use the label image again as a conditioning vector. This leads us to the observations that this is domain translation. It is simply a conditional GAN. The positive examples are given to the discriminator. The example below shows a handbag and its edges. The negative examples are then constructed by giving the edges of the handbag to the generator to create a handbag that fools the discriminator.", "You can see that we are able to generate really complex images just by using conditional GANs. Now, a key problem here is, of course, that you need the two images to be aligned. So, your conditioning image like the edge image here has to exactly match the respective handbag image. If they don\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be able to train this. So, for domain translation using conditional GANs, you need exact matches. In many cases, you don\u2019t have access to exact matches. So, let\u2019s say you have a scene that shows zebras. You will probably not find a paired data set that shows exactly the same scene, but with horses. So, you cannot just use it with a conditional GAN.", "The key ingredient, here, is the so-called cycle consistency loss. So, you couple GANs with trainable inverse mappings. The key idea here is that you have one conditional GAN that inputs x as the conditioning image and generates then some new output. If you take this new output and use it in the conditioning variable of F, it should produce x again. So, you use the conditioning variables to form a loop and the key component here is that G and F should be essentially inverses of each other.", "So, if you take F(G(x)), you should end up with x again. Of course, also if you take G(F(y)) then you should end up with y again. This then gives rise to the following concepts: So, you take two generators and two discriminators, one GAN G is generating y from x. One GAN F is generating x from y. You still need two discriminators D\u2093 and the discriminator D\u1d67. The Cycle GAN loss further has the consistency conditions as additions to the loss. Of course, you have the typical discriminator losses the original GAN losses for D\u2093 and D\u1d67. They are, of course, coupled respectively with G and F. On top, you put this cycle consistency loss. The cycle consistency loss is a coupled loss that at the same time translates x to yand y to x again and makes sure that the zebra that is generated in y is still not recognized as fake by the discriminator. At the same time, you have the inverse cycle consistency which is then translating y into x using F and then x into y using G again while fooling the discriminator regarding x. So, you need the two discriminators. This then gives rise to the cyclic consistency loss that we have noted down for you here. You can, for example, use L1 norms and the expected values of those L1 norms to form specific identities. So, the total loss is then given as the GAN losses that we\u2019ve already discussed earlier plus \u03bb the cycle consistency loss.", "So, this concept is fairly easy to grasp and I can tell you this has been widely applied. So, there are many many examples. You can translate from Monet to Photos, from zebras to horses, from summer to winter, and the respective inverse operations. If you couple this with more GANs and more cycle consistency losses, then you\u2019re even able to take one photograph and translate it to Monet, Van Gogh, and other artists and have them represent a specific style.", "This is, of course, also interesting for autonomous driving where you then can for example input a scene and then generate different segmentation masks. So, you can also use it for image segmentation in this task. Here, we have an ablation study for the Cycle GAN where we show the Cycle alone, the GAN alone, the GAN plus forward loss, the GAN plus backward loss, and the complete Cycle GAN loss. You can see that with the Cycle GAN loss, you get much much better back and forth translations if you compare this to your respective ground truth.", "Okay, there are a couple of more things to say about GANs and these are the advanced GAN concepts that we\u2019ll talk about next time in deep learning. So, I hope you enjoyed this video and looking forward to seeing you in the next one.
