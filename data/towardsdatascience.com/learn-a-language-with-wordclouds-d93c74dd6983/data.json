And as both an aspiring data scientist and a linguaphile, I\u2019m concerned. The NLP sector of data science is overwhelmingly focused on English, so much so that Professor Emily M. Bender of the University of Washington felt the need to tweet this:", "And thus began the #BenderRule. This was not a hashtag that Professor Bender created herself in order to become a trending topic, but rather a personal view of hers that struck a chord with many other linguists and computer scientists who felt Bender had simply stated it best. In response to the question \u201cIs there a formal statement of the Bender rule?\u201d Bender tweeted:", "\u201cAlways name the language(s) you\u2019re working on.\u201d", "Anyone interested in furthering the cause of the #BenderRule will enjoy reading her article co-authored with Batya Friedman that I\u2019ve linked here, as well as another article on Towards Data Science that addresses some other needs on the list of Importance for Natural Language Processing in Non-English Languages by Mehrnaz Siavoshi.", "That said, I am a novice in NLP and just wanted to get my feet wet and create my very first wordcloud and further my own linguistic diversity, as well as do my own part to bolster the #BenderRule by bucking against the notion of English being the default \u201cnatural language.\u201d Now my example below is a minuscule task in helping me achieve the personal goal of one day reading Don Quijote in Spanish (fingers crossed), and hardly fights for the kind of equity needed in NLP today as Spanish is also a relatively well documented language of the 7,000 we are aware of today, but I hope in the very least this article has opened your eyes to the disparity within NLP, and furthers the Bender Rule of naming the languages you\u2019re working with at a bare minimum \u2014 even English.", "So today I am going to be working with English and Spanish working with some code I learned from YouTube by Kostadin Ristovski, creating two simple wordclouds that will help me read Don Quijote in its original Spanish one day. I started by downloading .txt files of both the original and English translations of the book from Project Gutenberg. They compile and publish free e-books that are available in the public domain in the US. Let\u2019s begin by importing the proper packages:", "We\u2019ve included numpy and matplotlib to help visualize. Of course if wordcloud is not already installed you can always add it through the command line:", "For our most basic version we can read our .txt file, instantiate a WordCloud object, and then visualize. Below you can see some of the arguments you can play with including the background color as well as the number of words and even the fontsize. I let those work on default for this. I gave the wordcloud the name wc_eng to indicate that this is my English wordcloud.", "One more thing before we get to making our wordcloud in Spanish is stopwords. Stopwords are the basic words in any language that don\u2019t significantly alter the meaning of a sentence. For example, in English, stopwords are like \u201cthe, a, and, for, etc.\u201d They are usually very common, and are thus included in lists called stopwords that you can keep from being part of your wordcloud. You can also manually enter specific words you would like to refrain from entering the wordcloud. You\u2019ll see that we already imported the STOPWORDS from wordcloud, so let\u2019s see what we can make. Let\u2019s read in the Spanish text now and plot them side by side:", "As you can see we\u2019ve spruced it up a bit. We changed the background color and gotten rid of the ugly axis ticks, but anyone who speaks Spanish is going to notice that the stopwords here did not work. The wordcloud contains all of those things that would normally be considered stopwords like \u201cy, que, de, la, lo, etc.\u201d So we need to apply one more step. Granted this step is still quite easy because there is plenty of material and content available for Spanish on the web, but had this been a much lesser known language, I might not have found the time myself to do this. First we install one more package:", "Then we can implement the package and get those unhelpful stopwords out of our wordcloud:", "As you can see, English being the \u201cdefault\u201d doesn\u2019t conjure up too many problems when generating a simple wordcloud, however it becomes more problematic when we evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of NLP software against English alone. Another tip Professor Bender gives is to always ask which languages a scientist tested their model on, if the answer is solely English, odds are the technology is English specific and doesn\u2019t generalize well to other languages. Again, this was not such an issue with our example here, but stay tuned as I go deeper into NLP and explore how to fight linguistic bias in my own practice of NLP.", "Your home for data science.
