The way that neurons interact and form in our brain, though, also makes a huge impact. That\u2019s why in Chapter 2, we explored the viral origins of intelligence, which affects how the brain stores long-term information and reconfigures itself over time to optimize.", "In this chapter, we will take a look at one of the main factors that set the human brain apart from other animals, which we alluded to in Chapter 1. That factor is the size of our brains; specifically, humans have the largest relative cerebral cortex size of all mammals. But as we also learned in Chapter 1, it\u2019s not the size that counts \u2014 it\u2019s the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex, which also gets awarded to humans.", "Because of the number of neurons that get jammed into that area, human brains are especially sexy for its folds, which occur as a result. Not all animals have that neural luxury; take a look at the comparison between a human and mouse brain. The lack of folds makes the mouse brain look more like a skinned chicken than a cognitive powerhouse. A mouse\u2019s brain is pretty much take-it-as-it-is, whereas a human\u2019s brain, once unfolded into a flat mass like ironing a shirt, covers much more surface area than meets the eye (read: we have more neurons than a mouse, even relative to size).", "Of course, there\u2019s a wide spectrum of animals between a mouse and a human; our folds are not unique \u2014 other animals have developed them in their brains as well. And many animals, such as the elephant, have more folded and larger brains than us. But the neural count in our cerebral cortex remains something to boast about.", "The origin of our superpower is much like an X-Men nemesis backstory. We were once just ordinary monkeys, doing typical things that monkeys with fewer neurons do. At some point during our evolutionary timeline, a mutation occurred from a DNA replication error. That error gave us the power of hyper-intelligence (well, compared to our monkey brothers and sisters), which we used to eventually enslave the world as a collective species.", "Alright, now that you\u2019ve read the dramatic recreation of events, I\u2019ll break it down into several parts based on recent evidence that led to the formulation of this blockbuster backstory.", "While the evolution of hominid intelligence (hominids are any type of great ape, which includes gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, humans, all of our extinct ancestors \u2014 not to be confused with hominins, which are humans and ancestral branches of humans like Neanderthals) is impressive, at some point during the timeline, hominin (don\u2019t confuse with hominid) intelligence stepped on the gas pedal and left the other poor creatures in the dust. Recent research has shown that one of the genetic culprits has been the gene family NOTCH2NL, paralogs of the NOTCH2 receptor.", "Paralogs are the results of changes that occur from a specific gene within a species\u2019 genetic codebase. It\u2019s just a fancy way of saying: it\u2019s a mutation that happened within the hominin branch. The interesting part is that NOTCH2 is found across mammals (not unique to humans) and is involved in the process of making neurons (referred to as neurogenesis).", "On the other hand, NOTCH2NL is only found in humans, not even in our hominid cousins. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a paralog instead of a what\u2019s called an ortholog. An ortholog is a mutation that comes from a common ancestor; for example, if we and our hominid cousins had it, but no other species outside of hominids have it, then it is likely an ortholog. If on the other land (like with NOTCH2NL), only we have it, but none of our hominid cousins have it, it is a paralog.", "A 2018 NOTCH2NL research paper published in Cell linked those genes with the increased development of neurons within humans during the fetal stage. According to David Haussler, co-senior author of a separate paper on NOTCH2NL research, the paralogs are the reason why our brains are 3x larger. In order to test the hypothesis, researchers artificially expressed the NOTCH2NL gene in mouse embryos; those embryos showed increased amounts of progenitor stem cells, which are used in neurogenesis. On the other hand, removing NOTCH2NL from the equation resulted in fewer neurons being developed.", "\u201cFrom one stem cell, you can either regenerate two progenitor cells, generate two neurons, or generate one progenitor stem cell and one neuron. And what NOTCH2NL does is bias that decision in a slight way towards regenerating progenitors, which can later go on to make more neurons.\u201d", "- Pierre Vanderhaeghen, co-author of the Cell-published research paper on NOTCH2NL", "To further support the role of NOTCH2NL in a human\u2019s brain development, duplications or deletions of the genes impact the development of the human brain. Scientists have linked it to bigger heads (macrocephaly) or smaller heads (microcephaly \u2014 like the ones caused by the 2016 Zika virus outbreak), as well as neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD and autism.", "As I mentioned before, artificially expressing NOTCH2NL in mice resulted in a greater amount of progenitor stem cells, which leads to more neurons. While you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks, we might not be far from teaching new ones quantum physics. Just kidding \u2014 kind of.", "NOTCH2NL is only one of the gene families we have discovered that puts the pedal to the metal for neuron development, but it may not be the single line in the sand between human intelligence and all other intelligence. Environmental factors may have also played a key role in our brain development (e.g., mastering fire to cook food); that result came about from a computer simulation of the social and environmental impact on brain development (spoiler alert: the environment had a much bigger impact than social situations).", "That being said, talking dogs might have just taken one extra leap towards becoming a reality. NOTCH2NL can help provide the brain capacity for learning, and our own support can provide the right environment to nurture the development of a resource-hungry intelligent brain. It\u2019s enough to get the conversation started about what the potential impact would be on other life on Earth. Who knows, maybe we\u2019ll end up manufacturing intelligent life on our own planet before we discover any in space. But that\u2019s a story for another series.
