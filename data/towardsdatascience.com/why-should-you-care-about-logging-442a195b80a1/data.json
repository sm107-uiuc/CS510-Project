Very little thought is given to the design of the overall application and best practices that should be followed. While that is okay for a beginner, as we move forward in our programming journey, we need to consider other aspects of the application as well, before we can move the code to production. Proper logging is one of those aspects that differentiates intermediate or advanced developers from a newbie. In this article, we will learn the basics of \u2018Logging\u2019 module of Python. It is important to note that although we are showing Python examples, the overall concept is not limited to just Python and can be applied to other languages as well.", "As noobs, we always use the mighty print() function to print things out in the console, perhaps for the purpose of debugging or displaying intermediate variables and output values. That\u2019s all good during the coding phase, but when your application is Live in a Production environment, they need proper tracing & monitoring. Logging is the process of providing information about an application as it performs different tasks or events. Logging offers benefits such as:", "Issue Diagnosis: Let\u2019s say a bug was reported by a user and you want to replicate that scenario in your development environment. Now if you had logged the user activity in a log file, it might be easier for you to refer those logs and replicate it in a non production environment for further analysis.", "Analytics: By analyzing a website logs, one could get more information on the rush hours for the site, or what region the traffic is coming from, or how much time a user spends on a particular page etc. By recording more data in the log files, you can further analyze user behavior that could potentially improve the users\u2019 overall experience.", "The information to be logged is subjective and depends on the context of the particular application. However, it is advisable to include at least the following information:", "When: The timestamp of the logged eventWho: The application name or user nameWhere: The context of the event (login module, file upload module etc.) What: The type of activity or error category (Database error, File I/O etc.)", "Do keep in mind not to include any sensitive information in your logs.", "Python offers a built in module for this purpose that we will explore below. Before getting into the code, let\u2019s take a look at the various levels of logging this package offers. The 'logging levels' basically talks about the type of information to be included in our logs. There are 5 such levels:", "Based on our specific needs, we could choose one or more of these logging levels. They have a numeric value associated with each one of them. Typically we select one of these levels and all the other levels greater than or equal to the selected logging level are captured in our log files. Let\u2019s see this with the help of an example.", "In the code snippet below, between lines 1\u20137 we are importing the python logging module, creating a logger object with the name \u2018MY_FIRST_LOGGER\u2019 and setting the logging level to \u2018WARNING\u2019. This tells the program not to capture the logs that are below \u2018WARNING\u2019 level (i.e. DEBUG & INFO).", "From line number 9\u201313, we are simply specifying a file handler and attaching it to our logger object.", "In lines 15\u201319, we are sending messages to all the different logging levels listed above.", "Let us see the contents of our log file (my_log1.log) after running this code. As shown below, it only has the records printed for level \u2018WARNING\u2019 & above. If we had set the logging level to \u2018DEBUG\u2019, all the lines would have been present in the log file.", "The current level of logger can be checked using the parameter logger.level.", "Next, let us add this logger function to a program which performs division of two integers and returns a remainder. We will also add more information to our log record like timestamp, context etc. The log records used here are just for the purpose of illustration and maybe not necessarily be that relevant. It is a common practice to add these logging commands in your exception catch block to make your logs more comprehensive.", "The function \u2018division\u2019 is called 3 times with different parameters. Let us check what the log file looks like after execution.", "As can be seen above, the 3rd call to the function results in an ZeroDivisionError error due to the divisor being zero. Looking at the logs, we can tell that the program failed to execute fully (because the \u2018Remainder calculated.\u2019 is not printed due to failure). However, since we logged the input parameters in the log file, we get a fair starting point on what might have caused the issue and pick it up from there. Clearly this is an oversimplification, but for a more complicated application with tens of methods, this is something that we must consider.", "Now, we can choose one or more of the above levels depending on our specific needs and based on the selected logging level they will be displayed in the log files. Usually in production, it is set to info and above.", "In conclusion, we explored the motivation behind using logging modules in our development process. We also ran through the different levels of logging and how to implement them in our Python code.", "Thank you very much for reading and I hope this article leaves you with a basic understanding and knowledge to include loggers in your next project.", "Your home for data science.
