The rest is obtained through the prognosis formula. I know how to get the rest using prognosis formula except mixing ratio. But here I know the fact that", "Mixing ratio is affected by pressure, temperature and relative humidity", "This is the perfect chance and perfect case to use machine learning. Why? Because we just need to get the approximation of the unknown fixed-function, not empirical function. When you want to find the nonlinear empirical function in the real case of meteorology (for example, rainfall amount prediction, temperature prediction, etc) often, you have to take into account factors such as day and night, topography, season and so on. So you shouldn\u2019t just use all the existing datasets and train the model. No, I bet your model performance will be poor. But here we know the fact that, in this case, the formula of mixing ratio in any season, day or night, in any topography, in any condition is always the same. So here, you can just include all of your datasets with no brain!", "There are 3 parameters affecting the mixing ratio, namely pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. So these parameters will be the parameters of the machine learning model and the mixing ratio as a label.", "Here I already grabbing 2 years' worth of TEMP data in Wyoming format from Wyoming university website. You can download it here but\u2026", "but don\u2019t worry, I already save parameters (pressure, temperature, relative humidity) and the label (mixing ratio) extracted from Wyoming format data in npy format for this Machine Learning experiment here.", "Here the script to extract the parameters and the label from Wyoming data.", "After we extracted the data and obtain the matrix, now we train the Machine Learning model with this data.", "Here we use linear regression (as a comparator, any model whose accuracy is under linear regression means that the model is not very feasible in this case or the unknown mixing ratio function, in this case, is linear so using Machine Learning is excessive), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). We will use the default setup of the hyperparameter of all models in this case except for MLP. This is because the default setup of MLP is 1 layer with 100 neurons and it\u2019s excessive for this case with just 3 parameters. This is also because the MLP model is the one that I understand the most compared to the other models here. If I understand the other models as I understand MLP, I will set the hyperparameter of the other models too to avoid the unbalance setting.", "I set 10,000 data as test data and the rest as training data. We use Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and running time as performance indicators. And the result is", "The biggest RMSE but with the fastest running time comes from regression linear so it\u2019s mean our unknown function is nonlinear. The second biggest RMSE is MLP and it\u2019s mean the worst model, in this case, is MLP. The smallest RMSE is from the random forest and it\u2019s far-left the other models.", "If we review it from the running time, the longest has come from SVR. It\u2019s running time far left the other models and its RMSE is the third biggest. The fastest Machine Learning model is gradient boost with RMSE is the second smallest. It\u2019s a great performance.", "The last is if you want to really use the Machine Learning model here, you can save it with", "Because we already train the model and the largest portion of the running time is the training time, the best choice is saving the most accurate model no matter how long it\u2019s training time.", "You can access the full code and data here.
