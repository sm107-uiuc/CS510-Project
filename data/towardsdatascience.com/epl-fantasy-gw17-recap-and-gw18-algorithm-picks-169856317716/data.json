My partner in crime for this project has been Andrew Sproul, who just like me has lots of passion for Data Science, ML / AI and the Fantasy EPL.", "Another really strong week for the Top100 players in the world, averaging 72pts, compared to the GW average score of 56 for the common folk! Still, there were a few top100 players with scores in the 50\u201360 range (including the top player in the world who only scored 56pts), so if you scored near or above that you can still feel pretty good about yourself.", "While we\u2019re on the topic of the Top 100 players in the world let\u2019s look at who the most selected players on their teams by position and the most preferred team formations for GW17.", "We used this data and the current player prices to create the team below which is a blend of the most selected players by Top100:", "Pretty good looking team, and lots of wiggle room to try some different picks on key positions, while still keeping a solid core of players.", "Looks like we\u2019re back to a more attacking 3\u20134\u20133 formation taking over as the top choice, so people are back to trying to optimize points gained from offensive players \u2014 MD and ST.", "Not a very strong week for us with 48 points, just below the average of 56. Selling KDB to get Rashford and Kane, turned out to be the wrong move so far, so we dug ourselves into a deeper hole, which only strong performances by Rashford and Kane can dig us out of over the next few games. Unfortunately, we also left 10pts on the bench with Traore, so a very unfortunate week for us :(", "Let\u2019s start with the Adjusted Opponent Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "This is going to be a VERY VERY week of picks for our Algo with Man City, Leicester and Liverpool having a relatively difficult program, so our ALgo will not be making any picks from these teams. Teams with relatively easy schedules are Villa, Crystal Palace, Sheffield, Man Utd, Spurs and Chelsea.", "The data below comes from an independent site that updates latest injuries much more frequently than the Fantasy Website:", "As per a reader\u2019s request last week I will now be posting the top and bottom 50 players in terms of ROI, so our readers can have a look at a broader pool of high-ROI players to pick from and overpriced and under-performing players to stay away from.", "Note that it is normal to see lots of DFs and GKs in this list since they are a lot cheaper than the attacking players, allowing them to yield a much higher ROI overall. Still, you can find a decent number of attacking players in there, who have been a good long-term investment so far.", "In this list we see a lot more attacking players who are overpriced and under-performing so far this season. Note names such as Jesse Lingard, Benjamin Mendy, Seamus Coleman, Chirstian Eriksen who did well last season and got a high price tag, but have been injured or just not playing well this season.", "Reminder that our algorithm takes in adjusted budget per team formation and tries to maximize spend per position for the main 11 players, and then get you subs which are good ROI value. Based on current ROI scores, filtering out any team with AVG opponent difficulty (FDR \u2265 75th %) over next three games and removing injured players from the list of available picks, our algorithm picked the team below as currently optimal for spending the full $100MM budget:", "Lots of money left in the bank with this team due to our Algorithm not picking players from City, Liverpool and Leicester, except for De Bruyne picked as top MD by total points.", "As far as our own team is concerned, there wasn\u2019t much we can do after our bad move to sell KDB last week, so now we have to stick to that decision, as the plan was to buy him back after the Leicester game. We made one transfer this week \u2014 Grealish-in : Tielemans-out \u2014 due to Villa\u2019s easier schedule and Leicester\u2019s tough program. We are also considering selling TAA, so we can free up some money for KDB next week, but we haven\u2019t made up our mind yet.", "Looking at Best / Worst defense and offense can be used in a few different ways \u2014 for example, if a best offense team is playing a worst defense team, you might want to captain your attacking mid or striker. Also, you might want to give preference to DF and GK from the best defensive teams when looking at the algorithmic recommendations for these positions.", "Below you can see the teams, sorted by cumulative player ROI. Note that an active player is any player that has played at least 33.33% of the total possible game time. So, we are counting any player that has played a total of at least 460 minutes as active on that team.", "After a few more strong performance, Sheffield Utd have now climbed to #2 in the team_ROI table.", "We\u2019re just excited for the next couple of weeks of non-stop EPL action and we hope our Blog helps you make some good transfer choices that bring some extra joy to your holiday season. If there was an EPL Santa (and I don\u2019t mean the ones that flood the streets of NYC during Santa-con each year :P) and they were reading my blog, we would like to ask them for plenty of points from Rashford and Kane for the next few GWs as my early Holiday gift.", "As always, thank you for reading and we hope you enjoy the holiday season and the exciting EPL action ahead!", "Your home for data science.
