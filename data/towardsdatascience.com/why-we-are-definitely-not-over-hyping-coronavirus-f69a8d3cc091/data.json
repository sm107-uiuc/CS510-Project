The important takeaways of this article are printed in bold (and they are important!). Plus there\u2019s plenty wisdom in the diagrams, even if you don\u2019t care how all that was calculated.", "The news are telling us to do social distancing. The governments are telling us to self-quarantine. The World Health Organization is talking about flattening the curve of new infections so we don\u2019t overload the world\u2019s health system.", "Some people are alleging that this is all a hoax. Others see the gravity of the situation but can\u2019t figure out why this is worse than the seasonal flu. Others again argue that people die from many different reasons, and the death toll by Coronavirus looks quite small compared to all-cause mortality.", "Corona is a huge threat. The numbers speak for themselves.", "In this story, I will conduct a quantitative analysis of the outbreak worldwide. The goal of this is to estimate how many dead people we will have to mourn if we don\u2019t act. This should make it very clear whether you need to be concerned (i.e. self-quarantine) or not.", "I use the data from Germany as an example, for a few reasons. One the one hand, Europe is the new epicenter of the pandemic, so it makes sense to choose a European country.", "On the other hand, Germany wasn\u2019t the first European country that was hit with Corona, so it has had more time to prepare itself. This includes setting up testing centers. Therefore, the numbers of confirmed cases may be closer to reality.", "I chose Germany over France, where I live, because the testing seemed to be a lot better. At press time, Germany currently had about 50% more confirmed cases than France. But there were also 8 times less dead people! Since the healthcare systems are similar in both countries, this suggests that a lot of cases in France have gone undetected.", "The official German data is recorded by the Robert Koch Institute. Data from March 4 onwards is extracted from their archive; for the data between February 24 and March 3, I used the corresponding Wikipedia page. Unfortunately, I could not extract the number of recovered people since the data is not available from official sources. But since this number is rather small so far, ignoring it shouldn\u2019t skew the results very much.", "Measures of social distancing \u2014 such as closing schools, kindergartens and universities, bars, theaters and cinemas, and encouraging people to work from home \u2014 were rolled out in Germany from March 16. Since these measures take some time to produce visible effects, we include the data from March 16 until press time as well.", "Figure 1 shows the proportion of people in Germany who have been tested positive to the Coronavirus since the outbreak. At press time, this is around 17 in 10,000 people. As a comparison, the common flu affects an average of 61 in 10,000 people per year.", "What follows now is some mathematical nitty-gritty \u2014 if you can\u2019t be bothered with that, you can scroll down to figure 2.", "I use the SIR model to estimate the number of infections that will occur in Germany.", "In this model, we have three groups of people: S are the susceptible ones, i. e. people who haven\u2019t been infected yet. I are the currently infected people \u2014 this is what we\u2019re interested in. And R are the people who have recovered or died.", "For a point in time t, I denote the fraction of the population that is susceptible, infected or recovered as s(t), i(t) and r(t), respectively. Note that I use lowercase symbols to talk about the fraction of the population.", "How do these fractions change in time? At the beginning, everybody is susceptible except for a small number of infected people \u2014 16 out of 82.79 million in Germany on February 24. So, at time t=0, we have the following situation:", "Gradually more people get infected and eventually recover (or die). Let b be the average number of times per day that an infected person could transmit the virus. Then the number of susceptible people will decrease as a function of b, and the amount of times that an infected person meets a susceptible person. We can write this as follows:", "Similarly, let k be the fraction of people who recover each day. Then change in the number of people who eventually recover (or die) is:", "We\u2019ll assume that the amount of people in the country stays constant, i.e. there are no significant migration waves and not many births and deaths from other causes. This is a valid approximation, given that the EU-borders are closed at the moment and the birth rate isn\u2019t exorbitant. Then the changes of all groups must add up to zero:", "Therefore, the fraction of infected people changes as follows:", "Analytical solutions to this set of differential equations exist, but they\u2019re a bit hard to handle. So I let my computer do the hard work and solved it numerically.", "Of course we want the model to be a good description of reality. I made an educated guess that people are sick for an average of 15 days, therefore k=1/15. Also, I guessed that a sick person would infect somebody else on average about every three days, so b=1/3=0.33.", "I tweaked the model a bit to fit the data better. In figure 2, b=0.32 but b remains at 15. The infection rate is underestimated between days 12\u201323, but it is on par after that. This might affect our outcome slightly; I will go into more detail on that later.", "Now comes the interesting part: How many people will be infected at the peak of the outbreak? This is shown in figure 3. I used the same model as before, but it is shown for months to come.", "According to our model, at about day 65 \u2014 that is forty days from press time \u2014 almost half of the German population will be infected without any governmental intervention. That is horrendous.", "There is one caveat to this model: Even though it is mathematically well constructed, there was no way to tune the parameters to get it match the data between day 12 and day 23 better. Therefore, it might be steeper than reality, and the peak might be too early in the model.", "The only alternative is to under-estimate everything. If I slightly change the infection rate to 0.31 (instead of 0.32), the model curve is below the data at all times. Funnily enough, that doesn\u2019t change the things dramatically. When I underestimate, the peak is at 45 days from now, and 46% of the German population would be infected \u2014 which is very close to the peak at 47% as shown below.", "If the government and the people wouldn\u2019t act, almost half the German population would be infected with Corona in early May.", "According to the largest study so far, many cases go by very mildly, and only 19% of all cases are severe.", "It is unclear how many of the severe cases require hospitalization, but let us assume that it is about 5% of all cases. This is an optimistic guess; I\u2019m assuming that the other 14% of severe cases have enough carers and equipment to be treated at home.", "If 5% of sick people are infected, this means that 2.35% of the German population would need a hospital bed at peak time.", "Germany has one of the highest densities of hospital beds per capita worldwide, at 8 beds per 1,000 inhabitants. But at peak time we would need 24 beds per 1,000 inhabitants!", "The situation is even worse if you look at the need for beds in intensive-care units. These are desperately needed for patients with Corona, but Germany only has 3 intensive-care beds per 10,000 inhabitants.", "Plus, I\u2019m not counting the people who are sick for other reasons than Corona. Which means the hospitals would be very, very full\u2026", "Even if only one out of four severe cases requires hospital care, Germany would need three times more hospital beds (and doctors, and nurses\u2026) than it does. This does not count the additional requirement of intensive care units, artificial ventilators, et cetera.", "The peak of the outbreak in Germany would be reached in less than two months. That is not enough time to develop a cure or a vaccine.", "Therefore, one can easily say that the death rate will be at least 2.3%, which it has been so far.", "To estimate the number of dead people from Corona in Germany, we will first have to estimate how many people got infected. I do this by taking the integral of the curve in figure 3, and multiplying that by k.", "Remember that k is the rate of people who get better each day \u2014 so the inverse of k is the duration of the infection. Therefore, the area underneath the curve divided by the duration gives the number of people that got infected.", "It turns out that 99% of Germany will get infected in the next 6 months. Therefore, more than 1 out of 50 people in Germany would die.", "Everyone in Germany \u2014 or any other country dealing with Corona \u2014 would have at least two or three dead acquaintances, friends, or relatives to mourn within the next six months.", "A lot! Namely, social distancing and quarantine.", "In our model, this means decreasing the parameter b because we want to reduce the average rate of infections per day. We cannot really change k because that\u2019s an intrinsic property of the illness.", "Figure 4 shows the number of infected people when the rate of infections by day is down from b=0.32 to b=0.14. This means that an infected person would only infect another person every seven days, compared to every three days in the model above.", "You can see two things: First, the peak is down to 16% of the population. This would be just enough for the healthcare system to handle if there are no people at the hospitals who are sick of other diseases and there are no requirements for additional intensive-care-units. In this scenario, it is still unlikely that everybody gets the care they need without building additional facilities. But at least it\u2019s not so bad.", "Secondly, the peak is almost three times further in the future. This means that if we cut our social interactions in half, the major outbreak would be in fall 2020. This would give us more (but probably not enough) time to develop cures and vaccines.", "The total number of infected people would go down, too \u2014 from previously 99% to 83% in this scenario. Assuming the death rate stays the same, this means you\u2019re saving the life of one out of six people by quarantining. That\u2019s 300,000 lives saved in Germany.", "Social distancing will save the hospitals from overflowing, give us time to develop cures, and save hundreds of thousands of lives in every country.", "I know it doesn\u2019t feel very heroic when you\u2019re hanging around in your PJs all the time and your outing for the day is a half-hour walk with your dog. I know \u2014 I\u2019m living in France and we\u2019re all quarantined over here.", "But you are doing something heroic. Delaying the peak of this crisis \u2014 flattening the curve \u2014 must be our top priority right now. Wash your hands, don\u2019t touch your face, and stay at home. Stay. At. Home.", "Yes, I\u2019m just repeating what the governments all over the world are saying. Because my quantitative analysis confirms everything they said! You don\u2019t have to understand all the analyses, but feel free to explore them in more detail if you\u2019re a geek like me :D", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
