Analysts are now divided between calling it the automotive industry\u2019s next $1 trillion company based on its long-term prospects, to calling it a fad and comparing it to previous speculative bubbles like Bitcoin, the question is: can we predict what happens next using artificial intelligence\u2019s LSTM?", "Data Scientists have been claiming that Artificial Intelligence will revolutionize the way we use data to predict and analyze patterns in finance, and the most liquid financial ecosystem in the world, NASDAQ, has just recently certified that by acknowledging it leverages Machine Learning & AI in order to learn from the intricate patterns and hidden relationships in its massive datasets.", "Before Tesla\u2019s sudden rise, pessimistic investors were betting against the car manufacturer, and Google Trends shows a massive surge in people searching for \u201cShould I Short Tesla?\u201d leading up to the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.", "This is driven by investors betting on Tesla\u2019s track record of being unable to meet production and delivery schedules, along with one main expectation: that Tesla will as it has for 16 years, not be able to deliver a profit.", "This drop in investor confidence might have also been fuelled by the recent Cybertruck blunder, where Musk\u2019s new \u201cbulletproof\u201d vehicle\u2019s glass was shattered on live television, during which the stock price dropped by 6%.", "However, when Tesla announced it had $1b in cash and made a $386m profit in the final three months of 2019, leaving it with a narrow margin of $35.8m profit for the year, it set itself up for a pivotal change: Tesla could now stop relying on debt to make up for its losses and lack of liquidity, and start being self-sufficient. This was one of the biggest shocks to investors, and critics were left without their main point of criticism of Tesla: profitability.", "Our job is to demonstrate how neural networks are able to learn from the historical data in order to make a prediction of what is going to happen tomorrow, offering a tremendous opportunity at people looking to make a profit by taking daily market positions on this historic bubble.", "TSLA broke above resistance at the end of 2019, signalling that traders were going to be bullish, but defying all odds it not only went in the opposite direction, but reached all time high of $961.86.", "Additionally, Tesla\u2019s returns for the past year have been fairly volatile, making it an unpredictable stock, especially towards the end due to the proximity of the annual shareholder meeting.", "What if there was a way to make an accurate prediction for tomorrow\u2019s stock price, one day at a time?", "Let\u2019s put ourselves back in Q4 of 2018, and we need to predict what is going to happen in the future. This is where we build a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model that will train on 80% of the historical data and predict the next 20%, this process is called back testing. We can evaluate our model by comparing our predictions to the actual prices.", "LSTM is an artificial recurrent neural network used in the field of deep learning.", "These neural networks are usually pretty good at extracting patterns from long sequences by looping through the information, relearning and adjusting from their previous committed errors.", "As humans, we learn as we go, as you read this sentence, you understand each word based on your understanding of previous words. You don\u2019t throw everything away and start thinking from scratch again each time you read a word, your thoughts have persistence.", "The model did a brilliant job of recognizing and learning from the patterns, as it slowly foresaw the boom happening.", "Far from it, but for every prediction, the result was off by only a mere $23 on average.", "As you can see, the model does a decent job of predicting which direction the stock will move in. However, when we were wrong, we were only wrong by minimal amounts most of the time, with our latest prediction for 6th February 2020 being off by only 0.22%. When our model was off by 28% during Tesla\u2019s all time high of $961.86, our model still predicted the correct direction, which would have made money for anyone taking a long position in the stock.", "Regardless, even when our estimates are off, the general direction converges back to our predictions. This makes our prediction model not only more accurate, but also much more intuitive relative to the stock market, this industry has only just started understanding the benefits AI offers in pattern recognition, creating a rare niche opportunity to take advantage of.", "When investors short a stock, they borrow shares and sell them hoping to buy them back at a declined price and make a profit on the difference. However, this also means that if the stock prices goes up, their losses could be infinite, creating a pandemic that drives them to sell it as soon as possible to limit their losses, and in turn, this magnifies the stock price up drastically.", "All these factors combined have propelled Tesla\u2019s stock price up by 100% to an all time high of $961.86 on Tuesday, with 40% attributable from just the past two days. This phenomena is called a short squeeze, and short-sellers have already lost over $8b in 2020, with $2.5 billion of that figure lost on Monday alone.", "Tesla is by definition an emotional stock, and the fact that our model is able to have this high of an accuracy on top of learning how to have a high degree of emotional intelligence in terms of understanding how that investors sentiment is reflected in the numbers is nothing less than revolutionary.", "It may not be the most accurate in terms of prices, but our objective here was to predict which direction Tesla stock will go in, and the model served its purpose in that regard.", "In improving our model, it would be useful to incorporate more sentiment through extracting indicators from Google Trends & Twitter Analytics, if a stock is deemed emotional, then it\u2019s only rational to extract as much emotion as possible in predicting it.", "We are not saying we figured out how to become billionaires, but we are saying this could act as the building block to refining an existing trading strategy amidst all the chaos in the news.", "Update: As of 6th February 2020, the model has been able to reflect the current Corona virus pandemic\u2019s implications on China and the supply chain that directly impacts Tesla stock prices.", "Your home for data science.
