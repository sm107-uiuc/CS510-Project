It also allowed employees to review and anonymously give feedback about their organizations online in order to facilitate information retrieval for others.", "Therefore, since most of the feedback from individuals is being published online in the form of reviews on platforms such as Indeed and Glassdoor, it is very important that each organization take advantage of that opportunity and give attentions to online discussions through Text Mining & Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. While, collecting survey data is also a good way to gain a better understanding of your employees\u2019 work-life needs, not all assessments produce useful and non-biased information, and in some cases questionnaires themselves can be the cause of the company\u2019s problems.", "Collecting online reviews can provide businesses with a good idea to know if their employees are happy, why they are happy, what could get better and the issues that concerns them, by understanding this, not only we can evaluate the efficiency of the current company internal policies, but organizations can also develop better data driven decisions making in the future.", "In this project we will be investigating the trend of company employees reviews on Glassdoor Italy, we will be scrapping the last (110 - 120) reviews posted online for the following organizations.", "Glassdoor is a website where current and former employees anonymously review companies. Glassdoor also allows users to anonymously submit and view salaries as well as search and apply for jobs on its platform.", "Enough talking for you, let\u2019s get to business.", "It\u2019s important to note that most of the reviews were collected in the Italian language, and then were translated to English. Each company will have a column for advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons), moreover, each company will have a rating from (0 to 5) for the following measures based on employees anonymous entries:", "(Work/Life Balance \u2014 Culture & Values \u2014 Career Opportunities \u2014 Salary & Benefits\u2014Senior Executives)", "We will start by knowing that PwC achieved overall average rating 3.8/5 stars.", "In the next two figures we are presenting the relationship between ratings and the length of each review, from this we can notice that people tend to write a longer positive & negative review when they give 4 stars.", "In the following 5 figures we are presenting the ratings for the previously mentioned measures. PwC achieved an average of 2.3/5 for work/life balance, 3.8/5 for culture & values, 4.1/5 for career opportunities, while having 2.8/5 for salary & benefits and 3.2/5 for senior executives.", "In the next part we are performing Natural Language Processing techniques to visualize the top 35 repeated and frequent words employees used when speaking about positives.", "The top of the list are as following:", "(Environment \u2014 Opportunities \u2014 Learn \u2014 Great \u2014 Career)", "Visualizing the previous results in a WordCloud", "However, in this part we are exploring the top 35 repeated and frequent words employees used when speaking about negatives.", "The top of the list are as following:", "(Work \u2014 Life \u2014 Hours\u2014 Balance \u2014 Long)", "Again a WordCloud representing the results.", "PwC sample of the positive comments:", "PwC sample of the negative comments:", "Deloitte achieved overall average rating 3.8/5 stars.", "Moreover, we can notice that the trend is the same as before, people tend to write a longer positive & negative review when they give 4 stars.", "Deloitte achieved an average of 2.3/5 for work/life balance, 3.7/5 for culture & values, 4.1/5 for career opportunities, while having 3.6/5 for salary & benefits and 3.4/5 for senior executives.", "Following next, we will visualize the top 35 repeated and frequent words employees used when speaking about positives.", "The top of the list are as following:", "(Growth \u2014 Environment \u2014 Word \u2014 Good \u2014 Experience \u2014 Young)", "Last but not least, we will visualize the top 35 repeated and frequent words used negatively.", "The top of the list are as following:", "(Work \u2014 Hours \u2014 Balance \u2014 Life \u2014 Time)", "A sample of the positive comments:", "A sample of the negative comments:", "Accenture achieved overall average rating 3.7/5 stars.", "From the next figures, we can notice that people tend to write a longer positive review when they give 4 stars, while they tend to write a longer negative review when they give 3 and 4 stars.", "In the following figures, we are presenting as before the ratings. Accenture achieved an average of 2.6/5 for work/life balance, 3.6/5 for both culture/values and career opportunities, while having 3.3/5 for both salary/benefits and senior executives", "Furthermore, we can see the top 35 repeated and frequent words employees used when speaking about positives.", "The tope of the list are as following:", "(Growth \u2014 Environment \u2014 Opportunities \u2014 Salary \u2014 Benefits)", "However, in this part we are exploring the top 35 repeated and frequent words employees used when speaking about negatives.", "The top of the list are as following:", "(Work \u2014 Hours \u2014 Little \u2014 Balance \u2014 Stress)", "A sample of the positive comments:", "A sample of the negative comments:", "We can conclude by saying that Career Opportunities and Work/Life Balance were the most positive and negative topics discussed in our sample. The data shows that Employees of PwC believe that they don\u2019t get paid enough, however they have more satisfaction toward their senior executives and career opportunities.", "Furthermore, Deloitte had the maximum amount of positive and negative words collected, while Accenture had the lowest amount of positive and negative words.", "In a nutshell, we managed to obtain a sample of text data from online platforms, that can tell us explicitly and capture employees needs, preferences, requests and concerns. Therefore, Text Mining and Natural Language Processing can be a competitive advantage tool for companies to be integrated internally, to derive meaningful feedback and insights from their employees online. Together with corporate performance questionnaires and surveys, biased results that allow organizations to be seen in their most favorable positions can be prevented. This is meant to help all employees feel a sense of value and satisfaction at work. When employees feel valued, they\u2019re more likely to remain loyal to the organization, deriving better performance, productivity and revenues.", "Your home for data science.
