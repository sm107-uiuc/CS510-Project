But is a single activity worth for our scarce holiday time to be dependent on it? What should we tell our family members to do on the other days of our two week holiday? Indeed, a single activity might not just be enough yet to decide our next holiday destination. In order to really establish destinations, we will have to establish groups of activities that are within reasonable travelling time from each other. In other words: time for a Cluster Analysis on our geodata!", "Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters) \u2014 Wikipedia", "The data we need for clustering today is the geodata in terms of the Longitude and Latitude for each activity. As we have already derived these using Google Maps\u2019 Geocoding API in episode 1, there is no further data to be extracted to complete our task.", "The biggest pitfall in applying any clustering analysis to your data is choosing the wrong clustering algorithm. There are numerous different algorithms with different properties used in the way to calculate groups of data points that form a cluster. Each problem is different, and each algorithm will yield different results. Therefore whenever starting a clustering analysis its important to start by evaluating the pros and cons of the most common clustering algorithms. Don\u2019t apply the algorithm that you are most familiar with for each problem as it will not necessarily give you the optimized solution.", "In this article I will not go in depth on each clustering algorithm, only analyzing which is best for our problem. For a good read on the subject, and the algorithms we will explore today, I recommend this article by George Seif.", "Personally I like schematic comparisons, so as a first step, in Fig. 1, you\u2019ll find a very simplified comparison of the key properties of our problem, for the following algorithms: K-Means, Mean-Shift, DBSCAN, Expectation-Maximization and Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering. please note:", "Let\u2019s breakdown and explain our requirements one by one:", "Out of these five options, only the DBSCAN clustering algorithm ticks all the boxes for our problem (although still scoring only medium on time complexity) and on top of that, its required parameters are an excellent fit to our desired clustering. Therefore, we are going to continue with DBSCAN and if we cannot get to the desired clustering results, we can always proceed with exploring the runner up algorithm: the Mean-Shift.", "First, we\u2019re gonna set the boundaries of what detail we are going to cluster. At this stage I want to keep countries separated and only cluster activities within a single country. Therefore, by the nature of clustering, small countries will probably become a single cluster. And although there could be cross-border holiday destinations in the \u201creal world\u201d, we will still be able to form these at a later step in the process by combining neighboring clusters.", "Further, specifically for DBSCAN we have to define two variables. As DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm, it requires an epsilon and the minimum population of a cluster, to define exactly what is the density that it should be looking for.", "Epsilon: In our case we can use this epsilon variable to define the range in travel distance that we are willing to travel between activities within one full holiday. However, since the distance will be extracted from coordinates, the actual input value required will be the linear distance instead of the travel distance.", "Let\u2019s be very pragmatic on this one and say that we do not want to waste a full day driving to the next holiday activities and that the maximum we are willing to cover is roughly half a day. Assuming that it translates into an maximum amount of 500 km; and considering a 1.4 benchmark, this will result in 357 km of linear distance that we will enter as our initial epsilon variable.", "Minimum population of activities: The minimum number of activities that we wish in a single cluster is directly related to the actual duration of the holiday (which will be a required parameter at a later stage). But the number of activities we can filter later at the moment of executing the algorithm. Therefore for the clustering process we should go for the minimum number of activities that would fill the minimum possible duration of a holiday.", "This minimum possible duration that we\u2019ll consider, is a weekend get-away; three days and an equal minimum amount of activities. Automatically meaning that if there are only two or less activities, within the epsilon distance, these will be considered an outlier and not part of any holiday destination.", "Finally time to get to the fun stuff and apply the DBSCAN clustering to our data-set. We will use python and the scikit learn clustering package for the actual implementation.", "As an example of clustering we will pick the USA. A large country with major activities scattered all around:", "Now let\u2019s apply the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, with the 500 km travel distance as an epsilon requirement and three activities as the minimum required population within a cluster.", "The cluster name starts with the country ISO code, then the number of the cluster within that country and last the number of activities in the cluster. Please note that \u2018-1\u2019 refers to an outlier.", "That\u2019s looking a lot more structured into actual destinations that we can travel to! The clustering resulted in this case in 7 destination clusters:", "Another 7 activities did not make it into any cluster and are considered outliers. Some great and exciting looking road-trips! The size of the clusters is of lesser importance at the moment as this will still be fine-tuned at a later stage, when holiday duration comes into play.", "Curious to how the variables influence the clustering? Please see below a matrix with three different travel distances as epsilon variables (250, 500 and 700) and three minimum population requirements (1, 3, 5):", "In general the trend is clear: less travel distance means more and smaller clusters as well as more outliers. While more travel distance means larger clusters and less of them. Also, less minimum population means less outliers and thus more (small) clusters, while a higher minimum population automatically leads to many more outliers and less clusters.", "Our choices of variables (the middle one) seems a very reasonable outcome for exploring holiday destinations in the US; Well balanced between number of clusters, cluster sizes and the number of outliers.", "But what about the rest of the world? Let\u2019s explore it in the interactive chart below. Be sure to zoom in to explore clusters and find a gem within these 248 different holiday destinations!", "As per our logic, much of the smaller countries (so basically everything in western and southern Europe) will be one cluster per country (except for island destinations), but larger countries have been separated into multiple destinations nicely. Overall it is exactly the result that we aimed for at this stage; giving us the ability to start analyzing destinations instead of single activities.", "Now that we have our holiday destinations, we can add back our scoring measure that we created in chapter 1 based on its activities\u2019 reviews. Let\u2019s start with diving into the top 10 holiday destinations and their main city (in number of activities):", "Well, it seems we definitely have to put Colorado on the top of our bucket list! Also interesting to see the neighboring clusters in Brazil and Argentina, around the Iguazu Falls, both in the top 5. Lastly, also Easter Island is scoring very high as a holiday destination. Probably not the first place that came to mind?", "Finally, we would like to see the weighted average score per holiday destination mapped out on the globe in a similar way that we mapped out all activities in chapter 1. Please note that the size of the cluster refers to the number of activities included and the darkness of the color fill to the scoring measure (the darker, the better):", "Going forward we will consider these holiday destinations as our analysis objects and no longer talk in detail about single activities and / or countries as a destination.", "Thank you for reading today\u2019s article, next time we are going to tackle the TSP problem and create optimized road trips for each destination!", "For more information about myself feel free to checkout my LinkedIn", "Your home for data science.
