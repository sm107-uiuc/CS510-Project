RNN cells form the backbone of recurrent networks.", "On a mathematical level, a sequence of inputs are passed through an RNN cell, one at a time. The state of the cell helps it remember the past sequence and combine that information with the current input to provide an output. An easier way to look at it is by unrolling what happens during the sequence which reveals a simpler Deep Network.", "The two most commonly used RNN cells are GRUs and LSTMs. Both of these cells have \u2018gates\u2019 present in them, which are essentially values between 0 and 1 corresponding to each input. The intuition behind these gates is to forget and retain few selected inputs, showing that these cells can both remember information from the past and also let it go when required. This allows them to deal with sequences better.", "To understand the working of these cells in detail, refer to this rather nice blog containing animations to ease the explanation.", "Let us look at the equations governing the working of an LSTM, one of the most commonly used RNN cell. Here x_t represents the input to the cell, while h_t-1, h_t and c_t-1, c_t represent the hidden states and the cell states. All the rest of the variables are trainable weights and biases.", "They do look rather intimidating, and to think all of this happens inside one RNN cell. Without getting into the details, do these equations remind you of something else? Let me emphasis on it, Matrix multiplication of weights with the input followed by activation functions!!! Yes!!! Deep Networks!!!", "RNN cells contain in themselves a small Deep Network. And while the architectures in LSTMs and GRUs are most commonly used, doesn\u2019t mean they are the best for every task at hand. There might be more complex, uncanny looking architectures that may perform better than these standard cells.", "Just like developments in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and AutoML, researchers have also been working of creating their own RNN cell architectures. If you don\u2019t know what NAS or AutoML is, just give my earlier blog on AutoML a read.", "Work and development in the field of AutoML and NAS is recent and tremendously growing every year. However, not only is there not an algorithm that integrates and can truly create any Deep Learning network (including CNNs and RNNs) but the computation time taken by the existing algorithms is also humongous. These are the directions in which the research can and will improve in the future.", "This blog is a part of an effort to create simplified introductions to the field of Machine Learning.
