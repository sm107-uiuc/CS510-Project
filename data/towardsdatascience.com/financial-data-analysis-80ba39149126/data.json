Recently, due to the availability of computational resources and tremendous research in machine learning made it possible to better data analysis hence better prediction. In the series of articles, I explain how to create a predictive loan model that identifies a bad applicant who is more likely to be charged off. In a step by step processes, I show how to process raw data, clean unnecessary part of it, select relevant features, perform exploratory data analysis, and finally build a model.", "As an example, I use Lending club loan data dataset. Lending Club is the world\u2019s largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors. An inevitable outcome of lending is default by borrowers. The idea of this tutorial is to create a predictive model that identifies applicants who are relatively risky for a loan. To accomplish this, I organized the whole series into four parts, as follows:", "Alright, let\u2019s get started with the part-1: data processing, cleaning, and feature selections. Before that, you need to download the dataset from this link to code along with me.", "In this project, I used three years of datasets (2014, 2015, and 2017(first-thrid quarter)) and stored in five separate CSV files. Lets read the files first:", "Since data are stored in different files, we have to make sure that we have the same number of features in each file. We can check using the following code snippet:", "The above code is self-explanatory, we first extract the column names the stack them together using Numpy \u2018dstack\u2019 object. If you look at the Jupyter-notebook on Github, you would see they are the same. Which is good for us. We can move on to the next step. It\u2019s time to check the shape of the data:", "We see that there are approximately one million examples, and each of the examples has 151 features, including target variable. Let\u2019s look at the feature name to get familiar with the data. It\u2019s imperative to get to know the domain, especially the details of the relationship of the feature with the target variable. It\u2019s not easy to learn overnight, that\u2019s why need to spend some days or maybe a week to get familiar with the data before jumping into further detail analysis. Let\u2019s see the feature names:", "Looking at the above features, it may seem scary first. But we will get through every feature and then select the relevant features. Let\u2019s start with the target feature \u201cloan_status.\u201d", "We see that there are seven types of the loan status. However, in this tutorial, we are interested in two classes: 1) Fully paid: those who paid the loan with interests and 2) Charged off: those who could not pay and finally charged off. Therefore, we select the data sets for these two classes:", "Looking at the shape, we see that we now have half of the data point than original data and the same number of features. Before processing and cleaning manually, let\u2019s do some general data processing steps first:", "Alright, let\u2019s get started with the typical data processing:", "In the above result, we see that there are 53 features which have 400000 missing values. I use the pandas\u2019 drop method to remove these 53 features. Notice that in this function I set the \u201cinplace\u201d option to True,\u201d which removes these features from original data frame df without returning anything.", "2. Remove constant features: At this step, we remove features that have a single unique value. A feature associated with one unique value does not help the model to generalize well since it\u2019s variance is zero. A tree-based model cannot take advantage of these type of features since the model can not split these features. To identify features with a single unique value is relatively straightforward:", "In the above code, I create a function \u201cfind_constant_features\u201d to identify constant features. The function goes through each feature and sees if it has less than two unique values. If so, the features are added to the constant feature list. We can also find out constant feature looking at the variance or standard deviation. If the feature has zero variance or standard deviation, we are sure that the feature has a single unique value. The print statement shows that five features have a single unique value. So we remove them using the \u201cinplace\u201d option true.", "3. Remove duplicate features: Duplicate features are those who have the same value in multiple features with the same/different name. To find out the duplicate features, I borrowed the following code from this stack overflow link:", "We see only one feature which seems to be duplicated. I am not going to remove the feature yet rather wait until we do EDA in the next part.", "4. Remove duplicate rows: In this step, we remove all the duplicate rows. I use pandas built-in \u201cdrop_duplicates(inplace= True)\u201d method to perform this action:", "The above four processings are basic, which we need to do for any data science project. Let\u2019s see the shape of the data after all of these steps:", "We see that we have 93 features after performing the above steps.", "In the next part of this tutorial, I will go through each feature, then perform cleaning and remove it if necessary. In the meantime, if you have any question regarding this part, please feel free to write your comment below. You can reach out to me:", "Your home for data science.
