They don\u2019t tell you anything about what are the strengths and weaknesses of the model or what characteristics of the data are most influential on the model performance.", "You are left guessing whether the model is suffering due to long sentence length, or is it because there are too many (or too few) entities, the entities are spread out too far (or too close), or the entities are highly ambiguous, etc.", "To tackle this problem, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Fudan University, China have come up with a novel evaluation technique which tackles some of these problems. You can read the original paper here.", "The authors have also released an open source repository that has the implementation of the concepts in this paper.", "This article is my attempt to explain the findings in this paper to a broader audience in a simplified way. It is in no way a complete and exhaustive reproduction of the paper. The original paper is rich in details and nuances, so do give it a read to know more.", "The main idea in the paper is to divide the data into buckets of entities based on attributes such as entity length, label consistency, entity density, sentence length, etc. and then evaluate the model on each of these buckets separately.", "This makes it easy to locate the factors where the model is performing (or not performing) well.", "Let\u2019s go into some of these details.", "Attributes are different characteristics of the training examples, which may affect the performance of the model.

To test the significance of these correlations, they use the Friedman Test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test as appropriate.", "To quote a wise man, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it if you don\u2019t understand it right away\u201d.", "With this framework, the authors carry out an extensive analysis of 12 models, 8 attributes, and 6 datasets.

The analysis is roughly divided in 3 types:", "This analysis is similar to how traditional multi-dataset analysis are performed (without fine-graining into attributes or buckets). The authors argue that it does not create a very clear picture of what are the crucial factors for the performance.", "This is the analysis which takes full advantage of the new ideas presented in the paper. After measuring the performance of all the models on all the buckets of all the datasets, the authors present 2 methods to make sense of all the results.", "Here, the authors talk about the Spearman\u2019s Rank Correlation between model performance (F- score) and the attribute values. The authors make the following observations:", "Here the authors discuss how an attribute affects the NER (independent of the model). They make the following observations:", "The authors also characterize the datasets themselves in terms of average values of attribute values (without referring to any NER model at all). This gives us a great way to assess the character of a new dataset (which may be specific to a particular application). This kind of characterization may enable us to choose the model in an informed way (e.g. if your dataset has high OOV Density, then you might choose a CNN based model rather than BERT). The following graph maps this characterization:", "With the use of these fine-grained and interpretable evaluation metrics, we can take informed decisions about how to improve model performance.", "The authors present the case that since BERT and Flair are most sensitive to Label Consistency, adding more context to each training example would enable the model to make substantial improvement.", "To test this hypothesis, they train the models again with multiple sentences in each training example.
