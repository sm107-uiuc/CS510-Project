That comment made me wonder: What factors make a book skyrocket to success? What is it about certain books that make them popular?", "Is there research that might help writers understand the essential traits of a popular book? Can data help writers get to the elusive and much-desired bestseller list?", "The term \u201cbestseller\u201d originated with a guy named Charles Reade, an English writer who was extremely popular and prolific in the mid-1800s, but who we\u2019ve never even heard of today. John Sutherland, a literary critic, suggested that we don\u2019t know about Charles Reade now because he\u2019s the perfect example of the idea that a \u201cBestseller\u201d is temporary. Bestsellers are simply \u201ca snapshot of an age.\u201d Here today and gone tomorrow.", "First, you might want to know what, exactly, is the definition of \u201cbestseller\u201d?", "A bestseller is defined as a book that sells 5,000 or more diverse sales in a week. The term \u201cdiverse\u201d means that the sales have to have come from multiple sources. In other words, you can\u2019t sell five thousand books to your loyal fans on your private website. The sales have to come from a number of vendors.", "Lots of Bestseller Lists exist, but the most widely recognized (and the one most desired by authors) is the New York Times Bestseller List. This list is compiled from sales figures submitted by vendors throughout the United States. Data comes in from independent bookstores, national chains, newsstands, universities, gift stores and supermarkets, as well as online book retailers.", "The New York Times Best Seller List has its controversies, but that\u2019s a story for a different day. It is still considered to be the most powerful list in the publishing industry.", "One data analyst, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, has evaluated thousands of fiction and non-fiction titles that hit the NYT Best Seller List, and his findings shed some light on general patterns.", "Another team of researchers programmed computers to see if they could predict bestsellers. Jodie Archer and Matthew Jenkins wrote a book titled, The Bestseller Code based on the data they accumulated after taking 20,000 books and sorting them into 500 categories. They created unique algorithms that tracked emotional language and word patterns. Their data suggested that", "Does knowing these facts alter what you want to write about or how you want to structure your next book? Do you suddenly start putting a dog into every book, even though you don\u2019t own one yourself? Do you change the setting of your novel from the jungle to the park because you think it might sell better?", "Nope. Writing is still an occupation not mandated by computer-driven criteria. Whatever you write, it has to be authentic. Writing to some assigned formula takes the joy out of the writer and passion out of the book.", "Can data predict bestsellers based on the intangible emotional appeal a book might have for a reader? Can algorithms understand beautiful language? Do scientists understand the impact of crafting a universal experience in words? Can computers detect perfect pacing or the charisma of a character?", "Nope. The quality of writing may be subjective. Editors, agents, and critics never agree on those elements, so how could programmers agree on creating an algorithm that could detect that?", "I appreciate these extrapolations. They may even subtly influence my subconscious. But I\u2019m a writer who creates from the wellspring of her heart and data doesn\u2019t drive me. Landing a book on the bestseller list would fulfill a fantasy, but the hope of that happening is NOT why I write.", "Writing with the sole purpose of landing on the bestseller list is a fool\u2019s errand. I would wager that most writers don\u2019t even think about that when they\u2019re pounding out their manuscript page by painful page.", "We write because we \u201cfeel\u201d a book \u2014 not because it\u2019s prescribed in some formula somewhere.", "\u201cThe Long Tail of Where the Crawdads Sing\u201d by Alexandra Alter explains it best:", "Alter suggests that \u201cCrawdads\u201d succeeded in part because it spoke to the quiet and isolation that we often crave in our modern world: It had", "\u201c\u2026an oddly unifying effect in a time of rapid technological advances and constant social media connectivity.\u201d", "The unexpected success of Where the Crawdads Sing proves that data, predictions, and prescribed expectations of publishers can\u2019t account for the response of the human heart.", "While computers can analyze thousands of books and millions of words and compile findings, they can\u2019t account for the unexpected appeal of a unique story or a \u201cdifferent\u201d kind of book that touches a reader in surprising ways.", "The computers would never have predicted the success of Where the Crawdads Sing. They wouldn\u2019t have guessed that the novel would defy the typical pattern of peaking sales immediately after it was released and then faltering. Instead, it built up sales, hundreds of thousands of them as people talked about it and bookstores promoted it.", "A book\u2019s emotional and psychological impact on each individual can\u2019t be put into a statistical analysis. We laugh, cry, get angry, or feel pain with a book because it touches us on a soul-level, something we can\u2019t measure or even anticipate.", "As Frances Wilson so eloquently states in her essay, \u201cWhen Harry Met Fifty Shades: What Makes a Book Popular\u201d", "The point about bestsellers, from Grisham to Gone Girl, is that they echo stories we already know and which have sunk, like shipwrecks, deep into our psyche. The books that sell by the shedload are those that return us to the narrative shapes of our childhood, to the plots that shaped us.", "Go for it. I wish you luck.", "Knowing the patterns of the bestseller list might help in your quest to write a popular book. Understanding the data may give you an inside scoop on what to write and how to write it.", "I\u2019m fascinated by the ability of data scientists to create algorithms intended to predict popular success. I respect the intellect required to develop technology and methodology that might help me advance in my chosen profession of writing.", "I want to ignore the data and just write my story. I want it to rush out of the river of my being, roaring and wild, uncalculated and free. I want to caress it, shape it, nurture it, honor it, and put it out into the world, hoping that \u2014 despite the odds \u2014 the unexpected will happen and it will shoot miraculously to the top.", "If you liked this, you\u2019ll appreciate these:", "Your home for data science.
