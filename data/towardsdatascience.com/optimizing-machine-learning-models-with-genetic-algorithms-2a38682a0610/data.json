In order to get the optimal model, the parameters must be properly tuned. However, when there are multiple parameter variables, each ranging across a wide spectrum of values, there are too many possible configurations for each set of parameters to be tested. In these cases, optimization methods should be used to attain the optimal input parameters without spending vast amounts of time finding them.", "In the diagram above, it shows the distribution of the model based on only two parameters. As evident in the example shown, it is not always an easy task to find the maximum or minimum of the curve. This is why optimization methods and algorithms are crucial in the field of machine learning.", "The most commonly used optimization strategy are Genetic Algorithms. Genetic Algorithms are based off of Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection. It is relatively easy to implement and there is a lot of flexibility for the setup of the algorithm so that it can be applied to a wide range of problems.", "To start off, there must be a fitness function that measures how well a set of input parameters perform. Solutions with a higher fitness derived from a fitness function will be better than ones with a lower fitness.", "For example, if a solution has a cost of x + y + z, then the fitness function should try to minimize the cost. This can be done with the following fitness function:", "This fitness function will generate a fitness value for each set of input parameters and is used to evaluate how well each set of parameters perform.", "To run a genetic algorithm, first start off with a population of individuals where each individual is a solution. The solution is represented with a set of genes where each gene in the solution is a variable within the model. Each solution is randomly generated and evaluated against the fitness function to generate a fitness score. It is very important to choose an appropriate population size. If the population size is too low, then it is much harder to explore the entire state space of the problem. If the population is too large, then it will take a very long time to process each generation as system costs for calculating fitness and generating each population will take exponentially more time to process.", "Next, the population goes through a process called parent selection where the best solutions (most fit individuals) will be selected to create the next generation of solutions. There are many ways to do this, such as Fitness-Proportion Selection (FPS), Rank-Based Selection, and Tournament Selection. These methods all have their pros and cons and should be picked based on the model.", "Once the parents have been selected, the parents undergo a process called crossover. Crossover is when two parents crossover their genes in order to create a new solution (also known as a child). This promotes exploration in the state space of the problem and potentially generates new solutions that have never been tested before.", "This is done differently based on the data types of the solutions. For solutions where the genes are represented in binary, there are methods such as 1-point crossover, n-point crossover, and uniform crossover.", "For solutions where the genes are real-valued, there are methods such as single arithmetic crossover and whole arithmetic crossover.", "Also, for permutation problems (such as the Traveling Salesman problem, etc) there are methods such as the Partially-Mapped Crossover (a.k.a. PMX), Edge crossover, Order 1 Crossover, and Cycle crossover.", "After the crossover phase, the children generated goes through a mutation phase. Mutation is when each gene could potentially change according to a random probability. This allows for exploitation as the children solution will not change as drastically as during the crossover phase but will still be able to explore around the neighbourhood of its current solution.", "For binary solutions, the mutation process is relatively simple where each bit is toggled according to some mutation probability.", "For real-valued solutions, the different genes can be chosen according to some acceptable range for that variable or by adding some noise that centers around 0 and varies according to some Gaussian distribution.", "Finally, for permutation problems, there are four main methods; insert mutation, swap mutation, inversion mutation, and scramble mutation.", "Once the children population is created, the next stage is survivor selection. This is the stage that decides which individuals get to move on to the next generation. There are multiple ways to do this as the new generation can be selected from both the pool of parents and the pool of children. There are two main methods to select the survivors of each generation, Age-Based Selection and Fitness-Based Selection (FBS). In FBS, there is Elitism, where the most fit of every population is selected, and Genitor, where the worst fit of every population gets eliminated.", "Once the new generation is selected, this whole process repeats until the algorithm converges based off of some convergence criteria. After the whole algorithm runs, the best solution from all of the generations is returned.", "Genetic Algorithms are widely used due to its wide range of applicable problems. The simple version of a Genetic Algorithm is relatively easy to implement but there are more complex variations. For example, these Genetic Algorithms can be executed in parallel where the entire set of tunable parameters can be split across Parallel Genetic Algorithms. These parallel GAs can be then configured to be fine-grained or coarse-grained depending on the computational load of the problem. There can also be a Master-Slave approach to the algorithm where the slaves control the computation and the master controls the selection process. Additionally, the solutions can also be configured to incorporate different topologies and migration policies between different parallel genetic algorithms. All of these variations allow Genetic Algorithms to be widely flexible and is definitely an important algorithm to know.", "Your home for data science.
