Prediction is made on the test data (unseen data which does not have an output label) using the same model. But how do you figure out the effectiveness of the model? There must be some measures that will evaluate the performance of the model.", "There are many performance metrics to evaluate the model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, etc. each having its advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we will discuss the accuracy performance metric. It is only related to the classification task.", "One might wonder what classification is?", "When the machine learning model categorizes data into classes (output belongs to a finite set), the task is referred to as classification. Examples of the classification task are \u2014 identification of fraud transactions, detection of any disease in a patient, etc.", "Performance measure always evaluates the performance of the model on the test dataset. In this article, we will be using binary classification (where only two classes are present) since it is trivial to understand.", "It is the ratio of correctly classified points (prediction) to the total number of predictions. Its value ranges between 0 and 1.", "what will be the accuracy in the above example?", "Since, 2 predictions are correct out of 4, accuracy =2/4 = 0.5 or 50%. Can we conclude that if the accuracy of the model is good, the model is adequate?", "There are some loopholes in the accuracy performance metric:", "The example discussed above is having an equal proportion of the data points of both the classes. This type of dataset, where data points are approximately equal for both the classes, is called a balanced dataset.", "What if we have an imbalanced dataset (where the number of points of one class is much greater than the other class)? An imbalanced dataset is extremely common in real-world examples. Datasets of rare diseases have very few positive people as compared to the negative ones.", "The total number of patients is 100, and 95 out of them are positive (this is an imbalanced dataset). Let\u2019s say the machine learning model is dumb, and it gives positive output only.", "Now, what will be the accuracy?", "The model will correctly classify 95 points out of 100. We will get an accuracy of 95%.", "DON\u2019T GET TOO EXCITED; remember, the model is dumb.", "Accuracy can be misleading when dealing with imbalanced data. Therefore, it\u2019s better not to use an accuracy performance metric with imbalanced data.", "Let\u2019s say we have three models A, B, C, for binary classification, and all the three models give output as a probability score. In this example, we have used threshold as 0.5, i.e., if probability > 0.5 \u2014 prediction will be 1, else 0.", "Based on the threshold, all three models are giving an accuracy of 100%. But can you deduce which model is best to use based on accuracy just looking at the prediction?", "Therefore, accuracy is inadequate to compare models when the models give probability as the output.", "In this article, we have seen the use of accuracy performance metrics in the classification task. The accuracy metric is not appropriate when dealing with imbalanced data and when models give the probability score. These problems of accuracy can be overcome by other performance metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score, which will be discussed in the next article.", "Your home for data science.
