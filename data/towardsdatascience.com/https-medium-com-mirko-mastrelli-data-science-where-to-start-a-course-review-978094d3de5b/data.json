A course review.", "description": "Surely there are many out there who are considering a career or a career switch in the Data Science realm and thus there must be plenty of people with two questions in their minds. I recommend it\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Surely there are many out there who are considering a career or a career switch in the Data Science realm and thus there must be plenty of people with two questions in their minds.", "1)With the huge offer of online courses, where should I start?", "I recommend it with confidence. This course has sparked in me a lot of enthusiasm and the desire to know more and I am sure it will have the same effect on many others.", "The first thing to mention is that at the end of it, you won\u2019t be job ready, but on the other hand, few courses make you so.", "The material is rather old, it dates back to 2007 if I am not mistaken.", "Secondly, you won\u2019t be using python, so you won\u2019t be learning pandas, seaborn or scikit-learn. The course is based on Octave/Matlab and that won\u2019t attract recruiters eyes on your Linkedin profile.", "Still here? Ok, then why should you take this course?", "Because it provides the best foundation to start building your knowledge, it introduces and gives an always clear explanation of concepts that will be later expanded on other courses and that are now in high demand on the job market.", "The teacher, Andrew Ng, provide lessons of great value, presenting some (at times very) complicated concepts in a way that makes them easier to understand.", "Now the second question could be:", "2) how much math or programming experience do I need to follow this course proficiently? Or to hope to make a career in ML anyway?", "To answer this, I decided to provide a week by week breakdown where I will grade the difficulty of the Math and Programming parts. These grades are based on my perception of what a novice with some rusty notions of calculus and coding might experience when approaching the course.", "I\u2019ll use silly but self explanatory grades (Easy, Medium, Hard) to give a first impression on each week.", "WEEK1 Math difficulty: Medium, Programming difficulty: None.", "We are introduced to the concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning, and also to the linear regression with one variable. Some Math and calculus knowledge is necessary from the start. We are also introduced to the cost function and the gradient descent.", "I admit that I enjoyed this part. I graduated in 2005, the Italian equivalent of an Engineering MD, this means that I didn\u2019t touch some serious calculus for over 10 years and going back to using it was like navigating in familiar waters.", "Calculus was carved in my brain by many courses and used in different disciplines in engineering. It left more than a scar, but also some lasting knowledge that allowed me to follow Mr Andrew Ng reasoning with ease. If your linear algebra is fresh you will be at ease with the content presented here too.", "If you are not very good at it, fear not. The mentor will constantly provide great examples (he calls them intuitions) that help a lot and there is also a refresher introduction to the algebra you need.", "If you have zero notion of calculus, I recommend to follow the lesson on the Linear Algebra review very carefully. That should give you enough information to proceed.", "On the bright side, the Math doesn\u2019t get much worse after this point.", "WEEK2 Math difficulty: Medium, Programming difficulty: Low.", "Here we will start using some good old linear algebra, we\u2019ll learn more about linear regression and the gradient descent and we\u2019ll have the first rudiments on parameters.", "It starts to be intense, as the programming side is also introduced with a first exercise on Linear regression and gradient descent with Octave. Everything is well explained and the exercise is guided so try to assimilate as much as possible from the start and don\u2019t skip the optional exercise.", "You will see some cool plotting too.", "Pro-tip: try to have a full understanding of the pre-written code.", "WEEK3 Math difficulty: Medium, Programming difficulty: Low.", "Logistic regression is the focus of this week.", "The sigmoid function gets introduced and also the decision boundary as well as some techniques as regularization to prevent overfitting.", "The Math is still important here but it should become more familiar by now.", "On the coding side, we have an exercise on Logistic regression and regularization.", "If you have done your homework well last week you will have an advantage as the exercise share some similarities with the previous one.", "WEEK4 Math difficulty: Medium, Programming difficulty: Medium.", "Things start to heat up as we see a neural network for the first time.", "We get an intuition of how they work and then we start working hard on the Math part.", "At this point we should have a good understanding of how to work with matrices and vectors.", "The coding part will consist in a one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written numbers.", "It\u2019s a great way to start experiencing the power of NN with a practical exercise.", "WEEK5 Math difficulty: Medium-High, Programming difficulty: Medium.", "This week the course centres on what is one of the hardest concepts to digest as a beginner. The backpropagation is an algorithm that is somewhat counterintuitive and in this lesson the teacher\u2019s love for teaching really shines. Tough concepts are explained with clarity and examples that makes it easier to understand.", "The programming exercise will be an implementation of a neural network for digit recognition.", "The difficulty is on par with previous week\u2019s exercise.", "WEEK6 Math difficulty: Medium-High, Programming difficulty: Medium.", "A part for the now usual heavy dose of algebra, we will also have to use a lot of logic here.", "We are going to learn methods to choose the right algorithm for the job you have to do as well as some performance evaluation.", "The practice exercise is a study on adjustment of bias and variance.", "WEEK7 Math difficulty: Low-Medium, Programming difficulty: Medium-Hard.", "The math will not be particularly complicated this week!", "There will be a lot of logic to be used and the programming exercise is tough.", "We will create a spam classifier using SVMs, beware as this exercise might be a bit tricky.", "In honesty, this is the part where you might be tempted to give up. Don\u2019t! It gets better later.", "WEEK8 Math difficulty: Medium, Programming difficulty: Medium-Hard.", "This is a week that poses some challenges as we get to know some unsupervised learning.", "We are presented to an algorithm named K-means that I find brilliant in its simplicity and with concepts like dimensionality reduction and PCA.", "There are also two coding exercises that are quite challenging.", "In the first part you will work on an image compression task using what we learned with K-means, applying random initialization. It\u2019s motivating to work on a tangible task like this one as the image processing will be directly visible. Don\u2019t skip the ungraded exercise.", "On the second part we work on the PCA dimensionality reduction, first to project some data on a lower dimensional space and then on a Face image dataset. It is a rewarding exercise as we will start seeing how these algorithms impact image processing.", "WEEK9 Math difficulty: Medium-Hard, Programming difficulty: Hard.", "This week revolves around Anomaly detection.", "We will deal with some primitive concepts of statistics, but it never gets too crazy, if you know what I mean.", "We will also study a Recommender system, which represent the first example of sentiment analysis that companies like Netflix and Spotify use to suggest you the next tv show or artist.", "The coding exercises are though, but these are also the last ones you will do, as the course will start to be \u201cconversational\u201d towards its closure.", "WEEK10 Math difficulty: Medium-Low, Programming difficulty: None.", "We\u2019ll see how ML learning scales when in the presence of large amount of data, as we have nowadays.", "Techniques like mini-batch and stochastic gradient descent are part of this week and also Online learning and map reduce.", "WEEK11 Math difficulty: Low/None, Programming difficulty: None.", "This is probably the coolest week of all. You learned a lot of concepts, the horrible math is behind you and you tamed Octave.", "Now you will see how to tackle the problem of Optical Character Recognition, or how to find text in a picture. Essentially what your google translate app does when you feed it an image.", "We\u2019ll see how to augment the dataset artificially and the ceiling analysis. Also this week sees no programming assignment.", "The closure is an inspiring video from Andrew Ng, title \u201cSummary and thank you\u201d, which can be only fully appreciated if you watch it when it is intended to be watched: at the end of the course.", "After a short recap of all the material, Andrew Ng spends the last two minutes of the video delivering what is the most sincere and motivating speech I have ever heard from a teacher. Enjoy it.", "In conclusion, if you are like me, you will end up loving the man, the content and the field of study, and hopefully this course will represent a stepping stone in your new career.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Infrastructure specialist with a passion for machine learning and computer vision. I keep myself informed on the latest technologies and developments in the AI"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
