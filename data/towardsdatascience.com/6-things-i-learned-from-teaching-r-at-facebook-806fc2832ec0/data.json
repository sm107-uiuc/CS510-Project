This was a two-day course that was taught about once a month to a group of roughly 15\u201320 students, and the goal was that they would leave the class with the ability to use R in their day-to-day work.", "This article goes shares some of the things that I learned from teaching these classes, with an emphasis on what worked well for the students. Hopefully these six tips can be of use for anyone that uses R, especially those just beginning their journey.", "I initially learned R as a statistics undergrad at Berkeley. In college I despised using R, and used it as a means to an end for completing projects and problem sets so that I could graduate.", "Once I entered the workforce and started learning R from my coworkers, my perspective towards the language started to shift. I realized that there were some key gaps on how R was taught in college \u2014 mainly that we were learning R for a classroom setting, which does not translate too well to a workplace setting.", "Since graduating college, I have grown to embrace R fully\u2014 I\u2019ve developed R packages at Facebook and Doordash, taught R at Facebook, and have attended several R conferences. With my background out of the way, I wanted to share some tips and advice for those on their own journey to using R in their day-to-day.", "Note: I graduated college in 2015, so the curriculum has likely improved, so my personal experiences may not be as relevant for more recent college grads.", "Before teaching R, I assumed that a large majority our students would be data scientists looking to increase their impact by bringing R into their SQL/Excel workflow. However, I was really surprised by the diversity of people that attended these classes. We had a good mix of software engineers, data scientists, data engineers, researchers, and finance/operations people just to name a few.", "For data scientists, their main reason for taking the class was clear \u2014 they\u2019re constantly working with data, and learning R will gives them a more effective and flexible way of working with data. Also, learning R will come more naturally as they have a lot of opportunity to practice the language while at the same time making a direct impact on their work.", "When trying to understand why the some of the other students signed up for the class there were a variety of reasons, for example:", "In the three examples above, we see ways that non-data scientists can gain value from learning R. These tangible use cases are great things to have to keep focused because learning R takes a fair amount of persistence. Broadly, you want to be in one of these two categories if you\u2019re not a data scientist/analyst:", "One last point on this topic \u2014sometimes R is not the best tool for the job. For example, if you already know how to use SQL+Excel you already have a deadly duo of tools to aggregate, analyze, and visualize data. Having used R myself for around 7 years, I often find myself resorting to SQL + Excel simply because it\u2019s faster and more sharable. So if you spend a lot of time learning R, don\u2019t feel like you need to use it for everything because sometimes it will actually take twice as long then if you use tools you\u2019re already an expert in.", "What is Tidyverse? The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.", "The two most popular and useful packages in Tidyverse are:", "To keep this section short and to the point: Tidyverse is the quickest and most straightforward way to aggregate and modify data in R. Not only that, but it makes learning R a lot more fun and easy. I\u2019ve first learned R without Tidyverse and it was a miserable experience, and others who learned R a similar way share my sentiments. Tidyverse has become so widespread amongst R users that I would not recommend learning/teaching R without it.", "If you\u2019ve never used Tidyverse, it\u2019s super simple to set up and I would highly encourage you to start using it (there are many resources online to learn)", "Note: I reference some packages later in this article, if you ever need to install a new package, you can use the function above to do so. Once installed, load it into R using library()", "This goes well with the previous topic because learning Tidyverse can be daunting at first with its unique syntax and long list of functions. Luckily, the RStudio team has created a bunch of cheatsheets. For our in-person classes, we would make sure to print cheat sheets for all of the students so that they wouldn\u2019t have to keep switching tabs to search for functions. If you are able to, I would highly recommend printing and laminating your own cheat sheets for personal use. I still reference my cheat sheets even having used the language for over 5 years.", "This website contains a list cheatsheets published by the RStudio team. Some of the topics here are more advanced, but I would say two essential cheat sheets to get started are the ones below:", "Within the first hour of class, we have our students query data from the internal database into R. At Facebook, this would be as simple as using our internal package and writing:", "There are two main reasons I recommend learning with internal datasets:", "R is a great tool for analyzing data but if you can\u2019t get data into or out of R that\u2019s a really big problem. The previous section touched a little bit on this, so this section is meant to be more practical and goes over some the main methods to get different types of data into/out of R.", "By focusing on these methods, you should be able to import/export almost 100% of what is necessary. And of course, there is also a cheat sheet that you may find helpful for this:", "There are so many things you can do with R, it can be a little overwhelming at first. For example, just in the cheat sheet link alone, you already see so many topics/packages that R is capable of, and even that is just scratching the surface. Don\u2019t be intimated by this.", "We found that focusing on the fundamentals is the best way to learn R:", "If you are able to do these well, then you will have a strong foundation for doing a lot with R.", "I wanted to write this article to because I enjoyed teaching R classes at Facebook, and thought that my unique experiences as an instructor could be helpful for others who do not have access to these types of classes or who are looking for advice on ways to use R more effectively in their own work.", "Your home for data science.
