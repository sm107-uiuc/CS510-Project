If you don\u2019t know what microscopy stains are, or how they affect the use of images in computerized detection, you can find that in the first part. There we also discussed a popular method of how to estimate the stains from a microscopy image. If you want to get some hands-on experience how to estimate those stains using python, you can find all about that in the second post.", "Since we now know how to estimate stains of microscopy slides, we have the complete toolset at our fingertips to get a feeling about the variation of stains in histology data sets.", "Why is this relevant? In pattern recognition, when we want to train a system to identify certain objects within an image, or estimate certain properties of it, it is of great importance that the data is representative for our actual use case. In other words: If the real world is not images of all perfectly equal properties, the data that we use for training should not be either.", "If the data is really representative of the real data, it will explain the complete variance \u2014 and we can go ahead and train a robust system.", "So when deciding for a data set to train and evaluate our new and really fancy algorithm that we just invented, we should factor in that our results will translate much better to the real world, when the data set shows a realistic picture of the real world.", "One very challenging topic in histopathology is automatic or computer-aided tumor grading. For this, one very relevant task is the detection of cells undergoing cell division (so-called mitotic figures), since these indicate growth of a tumor. A faster growing tumor is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 usually bad for the prognosis of the patient.", "In this field, we\u2019ve seen a number of challenges and other publicly available data sets that researchers can now all use to compare their results on. While this really helps to distinguish really ground-braking new improvements from those only having small effects, we can\u2019t distinguish solutions being tailored to the data (and not the problem) from other ones that just do a much better job in the overall task.", "So, here, again, it all boils down to the question: How representative is the data? Is there really enough diversity in the data set to explain the diversity that you can find in reality?", "In the previous post, we\u2019ve discussed that variations in stain are in fact a big source of diversity in microscopy slides. Putting aside other sources, such as the tissue type or maybe the species, it\u2019s worth assessing this for the data sets that we have at our fingertips.", "For human breast cancer, there are a few notable data sets: The MITOS 2012 [1] and 2014 [2] ICPR contest data sets is from a team in France and the US, and the AMIDA-13 [3] and TUPAC16 [4] data sets, both from the Netherlands. They differ largely in a number of factors, most notably in the number of tumor cases (i.e., patients). Let\u2019s now compare those between each other, and between the whole slide image (WSI) data set [5] that we\u2019ve previously used for our toy example.", "For this, I used the same methodology as in the previous post, but of course, we have much more cases to display. In order to make the plot not too crowded, I visualized the hematoxylin and the eosin stain vectors with one marker each. This is what I found:", "Ok, I agree that there is a lot of information in the above plot. Let me guide you through it: On the left, we see the stain vectors of the WSI data set that we previously used [5]. Clearly, the stains all are pretty similar. This indicates that the workflow of slide preparation was highly standardized, and it is also caused by only one scanner being used. For both, the MITOS 2012 and the MITOS 2014 data sets in the two next columns, you see the strong influence of scanner color calibration, leading to two very different groups of stain vectors. The color of eosin seems to be most affected by this.", "This is also true for the TUPAC16 data set. Here, we additionally have a much broader spread of stains caused by the high number of cases.", "And here comes my summary: In terms of diversity, we have a clear winner in the TUPAC16 data set. While it is challenging to work on this data set, the results created on it will likely better reflect realistic scenarios. And this is only the mitotic figure auxilliary data set. The complete data set consists of 500 whole slide images \u2014 using that amount of data in a pipeline is a challenge on its own.", "My feeling is that the MITOS 2012 data set, despite providing segmentation information, should nowadays be considered deprecated. Not only the diversity of stains is low, but the train and test set were also taken from the same WSI \u2014 which disqualifies the data set to assess robustness (as rightfully pointed out by G. Litjens here).", "Your home for data science.
