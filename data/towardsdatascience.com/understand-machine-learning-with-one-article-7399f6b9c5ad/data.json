And when they cannot, it\u2019s a sign that our knowledge of them is very small and confused.", "Of the Laws of Chance, Preface (1962) \u2014 John Arbuthnot", "To a greater extent than any other mathematical discipline, statistics is a product of time. If previous-centuries scientists had had access to actual computational power, or even to computers, their studies and the current field as a whole would paint an entirely different picture.", "Although not frequently told, statistics are the foundation of today\u2019s known Machine Learning. Nowadays it\u2019s hard to find a use case in which Machine Learning is not being applied in some form and statistics are sort of left aside. That trend will probably keep on increasing as more people become aware of the benefits of ML applications and have access to its simplicity of deployment. If you\u2019re fond of learning more of this subject, or you\u2019re simply curious about how it works, this article might be suitable for you.", "Broadly speaking, Machine Learning refers to the set of algorithms that learn complex patterns in a high-dimensional space. Let\u2019s clarify this statement:", "For example, we could train ML algorithms to recognize human faces by showing examples and letting the model infer the patterns and structure of the face. We do not define a face, hence the algorithm learns without our directions.", "There are three types of learning involved in ML:", "Machine Learning is changing every aspect of our lives. Nowadays, algorithms accomplish tasks that until recently only expert humans could perform, it\u2019s gradually being achievable without such a level of expertise. On the other hand, traditional data analytics techniques remain static, although super useful in cases in which data structure is defined, such as this one:", "There\u2019s limited use for traditional data analytics in cases of fast-changing unstructured data inputs which are the most suitable for the application of techniques as Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. This is when automated processes with capacity to analyze dozens of inputs and variables emerge as precious tools.", "In addition to that, the resolution process that ML techniques implement differs greatly to traditional statistics and data analytics, as they focus on receiving the input of a determined goal from the user and learning which factors are important in achieving that goal, instead of being the user who sets the factors that will determine the outcome of the target variable.", "Not only it allows the algorithm to make predictions, but also compare against its predictions and adjust the accuracy of the outcome.", "Is ML the Holy Grail or is it useless?", "There\u2019s an incredible amount of hype and counter hype surrounding ML. The first one creates expectations that may not be fulfilled for the foreseeable future. On the contrary, counterhype attempts to convince audiences that there\u2019s nothing special about ML and that classical statistics produce the same result as ML practitioners and enthusiasts claim. Both extremes prevent users and enthusiasts from recognizing the real and differentiated value that it delivers today, as it helps to overcome many of the caveats of classical techniques.", "This is the most widespread myth. Clearly it\u2019s not fundamented as Marcos Lopez De Prado arguments in his book, \u201cMachine Learning for Asset Managers\u201d, who points out that ML techniques are compatible with the scientific method as they\u2019re been applied in every laboratory in the world to some extent, for practices such as drug development, genome research and high-energy physics. Whether someone applies it at a black box or not it\u2019s a personal choice and surely if theory is behind the models being interpreted at first, better usage-applications will be designed.", "Econometrics objective is to infer parameters of a statistical model in order to be able to interpret variables and make conclusions based on such parameters, as they have a meaning per se. For e.g., Linear Regression coefficients indicate whether there is a positive or negative correlation between each independent variable the dependent variable. Econometrics are neither focused on predicting values of variables with a model, nor on trying to make models compete to enhance predictions in this sense.", "The other side of the coin are ML analysts whose analysis is purely designed to optimize the process of prediction-making, with independence of parameter\u2019s interpretation or model explanation, which as mentioned above is sometimes impossible to make. Although their different objectives, both disciplines are complementary and have valuable tools to be applied reciprocally.", "There are two types of Machine Learning potential book-readers: Practitioners and Academics. For each one of them, there\u2019s a selection of literature to tackle, considering that the first group will essentially be looking for more applied techniques rather than focusing on the math behind the model. On the other hand, Academics might probably be looking for strict and robust empirical demonstrations behind the algorithms they will utilize.", "Here is a brief recommendation for each group:", "Financial applications pose a whole different challenge for statistics and ML because economic systems exhibit a degree of complexity that is beyond the grasp of classical statistical tools. As a consequence, ML will be increasingly playing an important role in the field, and it\u2019s unlikely that the trend will change, as large data sets, greater computational power and more efficient algorithms are delivered to students, analysts and the community as a whole.", "The main differences for applications in finance to highlight are:", "In the last part, I\u2019ll be performing a Python application of two sample models, Support Vector Machines and Linear Regression, in order to compare both of them and show in practice how a ML script is implemented. In case you don\u2019t want to get into coding, maybe you\u2019ll find this article useful:", "We\u2019ll begin to work by importing the necessary libraries: Scikit-Learn and Numpy.", "Scikit-Learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing and model selection and evaluation, among others. In this case, we\u2019ll be utilizing :", "On the other hand, Numpy is a library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It\u2019s part of the foundation of the Machine Learning stack.", "After that, we proceed with the creation of the Numpy arrays with which we\u2019ll be working on. Consider that these will function as \u201csynthetic\u201d datasets, as this process could be also performed with a .csv file or a database.", "First, I\u2019ll generate a random sample of 1000 rows and 5 features that will serve as input for the model. In addition to that, I include a sample function with a predetermined array on purpose. The process that this function does consists of calculating the product of each element of the input array by every element in the X array.", "To clarify this previous code, refer to the following notebook to see the output of the created variables:", "These are the shapes (length and dimension) of each array:", "After we\u2019ve created the sample datasets, we have to proceed with the split in train and test subsets that I explained in this article. This task can be performed with the already-introduced class of the scikit-learn package, called model_selection, train_test_split method:", "In the following step, I\u2019ll be implementing both models, the Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression. As a recap of what each model is about:", "In the following Gist, you\u2019ll find the script to program both introduced models in which we can see the resulting mean of each one of them. In order to compare the models, I ran a Cross-Validation process, which is method for splitting our data into a defined number subsets, called folds (five in this case), to avoid overfitting our model:", "Finally, we get to the point of evaluating the model over the testing sample and getting the output of the coefficients and the intercept:", "My aim with this article was to transmit in an easy way some of the fundamentals of Machine Learning, with a minor focus on Finance as it\u2019s a subject that I\u2019m personally interested in. My belief is that investors will be progressively introduced to algorithmic trading and to intelligent asset-management practices that involve AI and Machine Learning processes, so in a way this article tries to induce more people to the movement in order to be part of the change.", "I hope I have achieved my goal and that it\u2019s been useful for you!
