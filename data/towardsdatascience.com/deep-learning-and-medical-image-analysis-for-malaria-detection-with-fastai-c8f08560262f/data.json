The results described in the postings listed below show that a classification accuracy of 96% to 97% is feasible.", "In this posting we will show how to use the fast.ai CNN library for the purpose of learning to classify these malaria smears. Fast.ai is a library, built on PyTorch, which makes writing machine learning applications much faster and simpler. Fast.ai also offers an online course covering the use of fast.ai and deep learning in general. Compared to lower level \u201chigh-level\u201d libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow.Keras or pure PyTorch, fast.ai dramatically reduces the amount of boilerplate code you\u2019ll need to produce state of the art neural network applications.", "I have adapted this material for usage with PyTorch/fast.ai in Mai 2019. The commented code is freely available as a Google Colaboratory Notebook.", "Do what is in this section below once each time you run this notebook\u2026", "Only to be sure, look at which CUDA driver and which GPU Colab has made available for you. The GPU will typically be either:", "If Google\u2019s servers are crowded, you\u2019ll eventually have access to only part of a GPU. If your GPU is shared with another Colab notebook, you\u2019ll see a smaller amount of memory made available for you.", "Tip: Avoid peak times of US west coast. I live at GMT-3 and we are two hours ahead of the US east coast, so I always try to perform heavy processing in the morning hours.", "When I started running the experiments described here, I was lucky: I had a whole T4 with 15079 MB RAM! My output looked like this:", "Here we import all the necessary packages. We are going to work with the fast.ai V1 library which sits on top of Pytorch 1.0. The fast.ai library provides many useful functions that enable us to quickly and easily build neural networks and train our models.", "Export network for deployment and create a copy", "Restoration of a deployment model, for example in order to conitnue fine-tuning", "The authors I listed above employed the NIH Malaria Dataset. Let\u2019s do the same:", "The backups=1 parameter of wget will allow you to repeat the command line many times, if a download fails, without creating a lot of new versions of the files.", "The last line should produce the following output:", "Now unzip the NIH malaria cell images dataset:", "This will produce a very large verbose output, that will look like this:", "Change the name of the cell_images folder to train, and then mv it on top of a new data folder, so fast.ai can use it to automatically generate train, validation and test sets, without any further fuss\u2026", "Use apt install tree if you don\u2019t have the tree command installed yet:", "This will show the structure of your files tree:", "Do not forget to set a filelimit, otherwise you\u2019ll have a huge amount of output\u2026", "In the original material from PyImagesearch, which employs Keras, there\u2019s a long routine to create training, validation and test folders from the data. With fast.ai it is not necessary: if you only have a \u2018train\u2019 folder, you can automatically split it while creating the DataBunch by simply passing a few parameters. We will split the data into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). This is done with the valid_pct = 0.2 parameter in the ImageDataBunch.from_folder() constructor method:", "The print() will output the transforms and the classes:", "The last line, \u2018data\u2019 will simply output the return value of the ImageDataBunch instance:", "If you do not know what to use, it is a good choice to start with a Residual Network with 34 layers. Not too small and not too big\u2026 In the tutorials listed above the authors used:", "We will employ off-the-shelf fast.ai residual networks (ResNets). Let\u2019s create our first network:", "The last line will output the architecture of the network as a text stream. It will look like this:", "Even a \u201csmall\u201d network such as a ResNet34 is still very large. Do not bother trying to understand the output. You can read more about residual networks later. There are lots of introductory postings about ResNets.", "Here comes one of the great differentials of fast.ai: Easy-to-use HYPOs (hyperparameter optimization strategies). Hyperparameter optimization is a somewhat arcane subdiscipline of CNNs. This is because CNNs have so much parameters and trying to choose which we will change by setting some non-standard values in order to provide for a better performance of our network, is a very complex issue and a study per se. The fast.ai library provides a few very advanced yet easy-to-use HYPOs that help immensely in implementing much better CNNs in a fast way.", "We will employ the fit1cycle method developed by Leslie N. Smith \u2014 see below for details:", "Since this method is fast, we will employ only 10 epochs in this first Transfer Learning stage. We will also save the network each epoch, if the performance gets better: https://docs.fast.ai/callbacks.html#SaveModelCallback", "This will produce a table like this as an output:", "The table above shows an accuracy of 96.4% for the validation set, and this with transfer learning only! The error_rate fast.ai shows you will always see the one associated with the training set. As a comparison, consider that Adrian Rosebrock achieved 97% with his custom ResNet in the PyImagesearch posting.", "Let\u2019s see what additional results we have got. We will first look which were the instances the model confused with one another. We will try to see if what the model predicted was reasonable or not. In this case the mistakes look reasonable (none of the mistakes seems obviously naive). This is an indicator that our classifier is working correctly.", "Furthermore, we will plot the confusion matrix. This is also very simple in fast.ai.", "Look at your 9 worst results (without employing a heatmap, at first):", "Now, do the same but highlight using a heatmap what induced the wrong classification:", "fast.ai\u2019s ClassificationInterpretation class has a high-level instance method that allows for fast and easy plotting of confusion matrices that show you in a better way how good the CNN has performed. It doesn\u2019t make so much sense with only two classes, but we\u2019ll do it anyway: it generates beautiful pictures\u2026 You can set the size and the resolution of the resulting plot. We\u2019ll set 5x5 inches with 100 dpi.", "It is interesting to look at the learning and the validation curves. It will show us if the network has learned in a steady way or if it oscillated (which can indicate bad quality data) and if we have a result that is OK or if we are overfitting or underfitting our network.", "Again fast.ai has high-level methods that\u2019ll help us. Each fast.ai cnn_learner has an automatically created instance of a Recorder. A recorder records epoch, loss, opt and metric data during training. The plot_losses() method will create a graphic with the train and validation curves:", "This result looks really so good that it doesn\u2019t make sense to fine-tune the network. If we look attentively, we\u2019ll see that the validation loss gets worse than the training loss at about 500 batches, indicating that the network is probably starting to overfit at this point. This is an indication that we have definitively trained enough, at least for this ResNet model.", "The overfitting we observed could be an indication that we are employing a network model that is an overkill for the complexity of the data, meaning that we are training a network that learns individual instances and not a generalization for the dataset. One very simple and practical way to test this hypothesis is to try to learn the dataset with a simpler network and see what happens.", "Let\u2019s employ a smaller network and try it all again\u2026", "This network is much simpler. Let\u2019s see if it does the job.", "The ResNet18 is much smaller, so we\u2019ll have more GPU RAM for us. We will create the DataBunch again, this time with a bigger batch size\u2026", "Observe that we stuck with our valid_pct = 0.2: we will still let fast.ai randomly choose 20% of the dataset as validation set.", "The code above will output something like this:", "If you Colab environment doesn\u2019t have the pretrained data for the ResNet18, fast.ai will automatically download it:", "This will list the structure of your net. It is much smaller than the ResNet34, but still has a lot of layers. The output will look like this:", "We will again use the fit_one_cycle HYPO training strategy. Limit the training to 10 epochs to see how this smaller network behaves:", "This table shows that the network learned to an accuracy of roughly 96.1% and suggests that the network should not be trained further: the loss between epoch #8 and #9 shows a 0.005 decrease but the accuracy has remained the same, suggesting that the network has started overfitting.", "Let\u2019s generate a ClassificationInterpretation and look at the confusion matrix and the loss curves.", "This confusion matrix is slightly, but only very slightly worse than the one we generated for the ResNet34. Is the ResNet18 less well suited for this problem?", "This graph shows that the ResNet18 started overfitting a bit after about 290 batches. Remember that our bs is 512 here and was 256 for the ResNet34.", "Let\u2019s see if we can make this better fine-tuning the network.", "Here we will introduce another fast.ai HYPO: automatically chosen variable learning rates. We will let fast.ai choose which learning rate to use for each epoch and each layer, providing a range of learning rates we consider adequate. We will train the network for 30 epochs.", "97% accuracy! That is exactly what Adrian Rosebrock also achieved with his custom Keras ResNet implementation in the PyImagesearch posting, which presents the best accuracy results among the three references above.", "The validation loss, however, was becoming worse for the last epochs. This indicates that we have been overfitting from about epoch #20 on. If you want to deploy this network, I would suggest you to load the results from epoch 20 and generate a deployment network. It does not seem to become better, not with this network.", "This is better than what we\u2019ve had before. Let\u2019s look at the loss curves:", "Here we see that the network seems to start to overfit after 500 batches, which would confirm our suspicion inferred from the results table above. If you look at the curves above, you\u2019ll see that the validation loss starts to grow in the last third of the training, suggesting that this part of the training only overfitted the network.", "What do you do if your training was interrupted? This can happen because you reached your 12 hours of continuous \u201cfree\u201d operating time on a Google Colab notebook or because your computer stopped for some reason. I live in Brazil and events of power shortages are common\u2026", "The fit_one_cycle method works with varying, adaptive learning rates, following a curve where the rate is first increased and then decreased. If you interrupt a training in epoch #10 of, say, 20 epochs and then start again for more 9 epochs, you\u2019ll not have the same result as training uninterruptedly for 20 epochs. You have to be able to record where you stopped and then resume the training cycle from that point and with the correct hyperparameters for that part of the cycle.", "The first thing you have to do is to save your network every epoch:", "This will have your network be saved every epoch, with the name you provided followed by _#epoch. So at epoch #3, the file saved_net_3.pth will be written. This file you can load after you:", "After reloading the .pth file, you can restart your training, only you\u2019ll tell fit_one_cycle to consider 20 epochs, but to start training from epoch #4.", "To learn how this is done, look here:", "The fit_one_cycle method in fast.ai has been developed to allow you to tell it from which part of the cycle to resume an interrupted training. The code for resuming a training will look like this:", "fast.ai will tell you \u201cLoaded <callback_save_file>_<previous_epoch#>\u201d and resume training.", "You can look at all parameters supported by the fit_one_cycle method here:", "Compared to other approaches, where the authors respectively employ pure Keras and TensorFlow.Keras to solve the problem, with fast.ai we were able to solve the same malaria blood smear classification problem employing much less code while using high-level hyperparameter optimization strategies that allowed us to train much faster. At the same time, a set of high level functions allows us also to easily inspect the results both as tables and as graphs.", "With off-the-shelf residual network models, pre-trained on ImageNet, provided by fast.ai we obtained accuracy results that are 1% better than two of the three previous works above (including the scientific paper published on PeerJ) and equal to the best performing of the works above. This shows that fast.ai is a very promising alternative to more traditional CNN frameworks, especially if the task at hand is is a \u201cstandard\u201d deep learning task such as image classification, object detection or semantic segmentation, that can be solved fine-tuning off-the-shelf pre-trained network models.", "Look at our skin cancer detection tutorial with fast.ai:", "In this example we will show you how to work with larger datasets and adapt the best learning rates.", "Your home for data science.
