It\u2019s the nature of work as someone who brings insights and recommendations. However, bringing together people from different departments and functions to achieve a single goal can be challenging.", "How do you work together efficiently? How do you communicate insights and align your vision with the team?", "As a member with an analytical and data science function, your job is often to create insights that produce a recommendation forward. You\u2019re not always someone that will implement a specific marketing tactic or develop a feature for a platform, for example, but your role may be to propose a marketing strategy or recommend a certain user experience for the platform based on your analyses. Therefore, your role as someone analytical is to point the team in the right direction. Your team members need to hear your insights and take in your recommendations, and it\u2019s your job to convince them.", "Read that last line again \u2014 it\u2019s your job to convince them that they should listen to your recommendations \u2014 it\u2019s never a given or a requirement that they need listen to you. The mark of a successful career in analytics is whether or not you can influence your team in the right direction.", "This article will cover a few approaches to consider when working in a cross-functional team.", "Cross-functional teams are simply teams that consist of people from different departments or functions within a company. Many companies structure their teams as a matrix style organization where team members have both a functional and a product manager. Your product team is usually your cross functional team that can consist of a product manager, engineers, data scientists, marketers, and sales.", "It\u2019s always challenging to create a new team, but building a cross-functional team has other difficulties.", "Cross-functional teams aren\u2019t the easiest team to work in, especially since they consist of people who come with an array of competing priorities, ways of communicating, personalities, and more. Below you\u2019ll find a list of things I think about when working on a cross-functional team.", "Have your teammates understand what your goals and contributions are and will be, and what a successful deliverable looks like to you. This allows your teammates to understand why you may be setting up meetings or asking certain questions.", "After your teammates have an understanding of your workstream and goals on the project, check to see if it\u2019s aligned with their expectations. More often than not, what success looks like to you is different than what success looks like to them.", "Often times, their perspective and their constraints are different than yours, so the ultimate goals are different because everyone on the team is coming from a different function or department. It\u2019s important to get on the same page but you can only do so if you make your goals known to your teammates. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to tweak your output so that all teammates are satisfied with the end result.", "Building on top of #1, keep your teammates in the loop with status updates so that you can iterate on your milestones with your team. It\u2019s not a straight trajectory to the finish line, it\u2019s a windy road. It\u2019s important to keep your team updated so that your final deliverable and recommendation doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to them.", "Remember, you\u2019re not writing a book \u2014 there should be no climax to the story \u2014 so keep your approach to finishing your work as anti-climatic as possible by keeping your teammates updated on your progress.", "What can be difficult about keeping your teammates updated is that they\u2019ll have opinions that conflict with yours. This is where the ultimate skills of influence and compromise comes in handy and where I see most people fail. Knowing how to influence a conversation can help you and your teammates align on your approach, milestones, and ultimate goals. Knowing how and when to compromise without sacrificing your goals makes your teammates feel like they\u2019re involved. Eventually, your deliverable will be something that the entire team feels like they had a hand-in. That feeling feels good and is the ultimate goal when working in a cross functional (or any project) team.", "The first rule in a successful cross-functional team project is to never let your team be surprised. This means that you should be investing energy and time into good communication techniques \u2014 during meetings, over email, or in person.", "You should enter meetings with a clear agenda, set up check-ins weekly (or whenever you feel appropriate), use team meetings as updates to share the progress of the project with stakeholders and ask your team members to share their progress. All of these things ensure that you have everyone\u2019s involvement and that everyone feels part of the team.", "This also means that you need to set clear roles and expectations from the beginning, acknowledging when your teammates do good work and encouraging cross-collaboration \u2014 all of which makes for a happy and motivated team.", "If, for instance, you have an idea that you\u2019re trying to get your other team members to agree with, sit down with your teammate individually to vet and get their reaction to the idea before you take it to the other team members; this shows that you respect their opinion and want their buy-in \u2014 this immediately encourages collaboration and trust.", "If you find yourself in a frustrating situation, try to focus on doing what\u2019s best for the company, this will make it so you can be more strategic and act and think like a leader.", "You must keep the project\u2019s deadlines and objectives in mind. However, you also need to understand that your project could be one of several that your teammates could be working on, and likely not the most important to them.", "When you get started on a cross-functional team, make sure that you\u2019re gathering insight about how your teammates are budgeting their time to gain a better understanding of their expectations so you can better plan out your schedule.", "Additionally, get a well-rounded perspective on the project\u2019s importance by asking your team members what outcomes they\u2019re searching for and what\u2019s important to them. Likely, there\u2019s some output from your work that they\u2019ll find valuable. Their responses can help you figure out how to prioritize your work.", "Finally, you should note that this goes both ways \u2014 so, make it clear to your teammates what you\u2019re currently working on outside of the project and any times where you might not be available.", "These four ideas have helped me put together a framework to collaborate with my team. The underlying theme of the framework is to have empathy for your team members. Even though everyone knows what the purpose and end goal of the project is, everyone brings in different experiences and perspectives, has a different way of working, and has different motivations. This is what makes working in a cross functional team difficult. The goal is to come out of each deliverable like you achieve the end goal and that everyone\u2019s voice was heard.", "I sent out a monthly newsletter on topics like this.
