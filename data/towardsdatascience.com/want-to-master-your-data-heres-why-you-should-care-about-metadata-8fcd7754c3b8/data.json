We usually regard data as numbers, texts, or images, but data is more than that.", "We should consider data as an independent entity. Data can make self-introduction, tell stories, and visualize trends. To reach those outcomes, you must understand your data first. Not only about how it was formed or its origin, but how it\u2019ll change over time and its usability. Some of this information is what we call metadata.", "Why is metadata so important? And why must we master metadata before we master data? Today I\u2019ll show you how we can leverage metadata in our data business.", "According to Wikipedia, metadata is \u201cdata that provides information about other data\u201d. It\u2019s \u201cdata about data\u201d. That sounds straightforward, doesn\u2019t it? All data contains information about a specific thing. For metadata, that specific thing is another data.", "However, metadata also varies in the definition per se. It can be the name of the dataset, creation information, or statistical distribution of data points. It can be anything related to the data properties. With that said, all data must possess for it the metadata. But that\u2019s not always the exhaustive case.", "Data without metadata is always incomplete.", "We use data with the hope of extracting useful insights, and the purpose of data comprehension. Metadata helps us to assert the data integrity, to verify the source of truth, or to maintain stable data quality.", "However, in some cases, data users ignore the effect of metadata. They view it as just labels and the value it brings to the table is limited. We\u2019ll see next how metadata is related to another critical aspect of data: Data quality.", "Again, Wikipedia says: \u201cData quality refers to the state of qualitative or quantitative pieces of information.\u201d In general, data is said to have high quality when \u201cit fits the intended use case regardless of data users\u201d.", "Data is a valuable source of information, but nobody wants to use a piece of crap. The more you desire to extract from data, the more significant is data quality. In the world of Big Data, this also becomes a bottleneck.", "As data grows bigger, so does metadata. We are not used to handling a great amount of metadata. Since it needs a special kind of treatment, we must consider it is at the same time data and not data. Metadata is not an independent piece of information but rather an attachment to our data. We have the possibility to extend that to become an assessment of the data quality.", "Data is a valuable source of information, but nobody wants to use a piece of crap", "In a common effort of cultivating a high data quality in Big data pipelines, tech companies are paying lots of attention to this newish subject. From detecting anomalies to automatic alerting systems, we wish to limit the impact of erroneous data as little as possible. We can\u2019t do this without data comprehension, or precisely without metadata.", "Data quality reflects via many aspects, but most often is the correctness of values. Imagine you plot a histogram of university students\u2019 grades within a semester. The histogram is a statistical representation of those values, and it describes your data. It becomes metadata. What you might interpret is the distribution of the grades, then you can conclude whether it will fit your use case.", "There are many questions to be asked about data values beforehand. Are those values stable overtime? Are there any outliers? If yes, what should we do with those outliers? By answering these questions, we extract some insights, not information-wise but data-wise. We can create metadata, useful metadata. That\u2019s just a primitive step in asserting data quality via metadata. We\u2019ll have a good look at the next section on how we can leverage metadata that we could generate.", "Some people might be overwhelmed by the various statistical representations we can extract from a dataset. Others might as well ignore that additional information thinking it is useless. It\u2019s true that we don\u2019t need to draw a histogram every time working with data, but it helps. To leverage the insightful metadata, data users must first answer three important questions:", "Metadata has its long history, but we have just recently discovered its contribution to data management, or especially data quality. Metadata itself can\u2019t change the outcomes of data, but it adds a security and management layer between our raw data and its usage. You might even use metadata to discover your data without realizing it.", "Data quality might be insignificant when your data is small, but it becomes critical when working with a bigger amount. Metadata helps us keep track of that growth, and make sure the data evolves as it should be. By failing to leverage metadata, we fail to understand your data.", "If you wish to master your data, you should start to treat metadata systematically. Base on the framework we have seen above, you choose for yourself a suitable data strategy. There\u2019s nothing fancy about it yet. It starts with how you wish to use your data and how you control the quality of its usage. Everything starts with a goal.", "There\u2019s one phase in the ETL process called Exploratory Data Analysis. I find it quite interesting to know more about the statistical aspect of your data. It seems to be close to what we would like to know via metadata.", "I always see my data scientists and/or data analysts friends start with EDA before doing anything with their raw data. So I\u2019ve figured out it must be an important step and I wondered how it\u2019s linked to my metadata framework. They turn out to share quite a lot of things in common.", "First comes the purpose. The \u201cexploratory\u201d part in EDA somehow coincides with the discovery objective of metadata. Second is how they both look at the statistical side of data to evaluate its future usage. With all that said, EDA is actually a must-to-have step due to its similarity to metadata-based assessment on data quality.", "You have the data strategy, the data evaluation, now it\u2019s the time for you to decide what to proceed with all that information. How the data will be used decides whether it\u2019s righteous and trustworthy under the eyes of a data quality control.", "I\u2019ve shared some of my points of view on metadata. For me, it has as much value as the data itself. Those who take advantage of these values are the ones who understand their data. It\u2019s easier to misuse something we don\u2019t comprehend. Metadata gives us a clearer view of the data, and furthermore data quality, integrity, and usability.", "My name\u2019s Nam Nguyen, and I write (mostly) about Big Data. Enjoy your reading?
