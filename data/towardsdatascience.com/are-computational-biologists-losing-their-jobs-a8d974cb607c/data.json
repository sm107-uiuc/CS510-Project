Then, it will \u201ctranslate\u201d the natural language to a specific bioinformatic task by applying the pre-trained neural network. After confirming the predicted requested analysis with the user, DrBioRight will perform the analysis on the cloud and report the final results.", "One can check some specific examples on their official website below:", "The idea is so cool because the entire process is automated, which only needs the user to provide several keywords in a simple question, such as \u201cWhat is the relationship between gene X and the survival rate in breast cancer?\u201d", "Conventionally, the analytics of omics datasets are so complex that experts in bioinformatics and biostatistics are required to involve in the project. However, DrBioRight seems to break the rule by arming the pure biologists with tons of automated analysis pipelines.", "Tools like DrBioRight are trying to define a new generation of analytics in biomedical science, which will definitely make the research progress more intuitive and efficient.", "So, are the computational biologists losing their jobs?", "No, not in the near future.", "I list some major challenges that keep such platforms from automating all the necessary computational work in a project.", "With the explosion of omics technologies in recent decades, the speed of the development of analysis tools and pipelines has increased exponentially. It\u2019s so common that tens of different analysis methods designed for the same task suddenly come out together.", "It is nearly impossible to select one out of the available methods as the \u201cstandard\u201d way on a specific task, especially when most of the tools perform similarly on the same test dataset.", "For example, no reviewer can reject a submitted manuscript just because the authors use DESeq instead of EdgeR in the differential expressed gene analysis.", "So, the situation in the following cartoon happens all the time.", "If you are a beginner in bioinformatics, you must understand the pain when you need to choose one annotation source from ENSEMBL, RefSeq, and GENCODE. No matter which one you choose, your boss will always say that you are wrong.", "Also remember, these automated platforms like DrBioRight keep learning by taking the feedback of the users as additional training data points. Suppose for the same prediction (predicted task based on the input natural language) by DrBioRight, different users give different feedbacks due to their own desired \u201cstandard\u201d analysis in their mind. It will become a disaster for the training process.", "The analysis that can be generalized and implemented in a pipeline usually serves as the very first step of the computational work in a project. Then the biologists need to review the computational results, generate the biological hypothesis based on the results, and ask the bioinformaticians to perform some specific analysis further. And so on so forth\u2026", "Based on my own experience, more than 80% of my computational effort contribute to the specific biology-related questions based on the biologists\u2019 requests, which is so specific and so context-dependent that the AI platform can hardly learn it via natural language accurately.", "The bioinformaticians and biologists are trained so differently that it\u2019s been hard for them to understand each other.", "The bioinformatician wants more replicates from the biologist.", "The biologist wants the p-value from the bioinformatician.", "I don\u2019t believe any AI platform can answer the question like this, \u201cCan you give me a p-value for these immune cells?\u201d because, without the context, this question can be interpreted in thousands of ways.", "The hard communications between the two sides serve as the randomly labeled training data points to the system, which will make it even harder for people to use it efficiently in the future.", "Even though there are limitations of the AI-driven platforms to perform the complete automated analysis for biologists, it\u2019s still important to make them accessible to the research community. Here are some reasons.", "As aforementioned, the very first step of the computational analysis, or the pre-processing, can always be achieved by the generalized pipeline.", "At this step, the performance of the platforms and the expectations of the researchers are easier to be consistent than those in the downstream analysis. So, the feedback from the users can facilitate the training of the AI platforms.", "After fed with a large number of training points, the platform can perform the initial analysis more efficiently, more transparently, and more reproducibly than the conventional way that involves tons of communications between the biologists and the bioinformatician.", "One of the most time-consuming parts of biology research is to find evidence of a mechanism from the public datasets. Comparing to searching for literature and reanalyzing their data, directly asking the question to the AI platform for the automated analysis seems to be much more efficient.", "AI has been changing our life fast and it\u2019s also changing the way how we do research.", "Will it replace us, human-being researchers?", "Maybe yes, but not in the near future, for sure.", "You can go back to debug your pipeline. The biologist is waiting for you.", "The author has no personal or professional relationship with the research team who developed DrBioRight. The entire post only represents the author\u2019s own opinions on the related research field, which should not be taken as solid scientific statements.", "Your home for data science.
