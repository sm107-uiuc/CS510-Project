Your online self is a reflection of yourself and we need to stop disassociating them from each other, just because you have a different name or photo on an online profile in the future Artificial Intelligence (AI) could link it back to you, and it may even negatively impact the world you live in directly.", "Artificial Intelligence is generating a lot of press in recent times and rightly so. Data is now the most valuable resource in the world and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can utilise this data for a series of tasks.", "AI can be categorised into three different groups; Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).", "ANI is when AI can match human intelligence in a narrow range of situations and parameters, this is the level of artificial intelligence that we are currently at. AGI, is when AI and human behaviour and/or intelligence are identical from each other. ASI is when AI doesn\u2019t only mimic human behaviour and intelligence but when it exceeds it. ASI would surpass all human intelligence in all contexts, whether that is science,culture, relationships, love etc.", "ANI is the level of artificial intelligence that the world is currently at, in order to get to AGI we must teach an artificial intelligence agent to be a human, but this introduces a plethora of questions.", "What human do we base this on? How do we define the personality traits of this \u2018human\u2019? Where do we get this personality from? Should it be an average of all our personalities? Do we pick the nicest human we know? Well then who is the nicest human we know? How do we define the morals we would like an AI to have?", "Data drives AI agents, thus we must start to think where this personality \u2018human\u2019 data could come from. We are living in a time where most of us live online, unfortunately we also know that certain companies moral codes on sharing personal data is low or non existent. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand where \u2018personality data\u2019 in the millions can be accumulated from, whether that is from Facebook (now Meta), Twitter, Instagram, Reddit or Medium for example.", "All comments we leave, all messages we send, all videos we watch, all posts we like/love/laugh/hate gives an indication of our personality type and our morals, as well as this it leaves a permanent mark on your digital, social-media history. Today, people feel they can give negative comments online with no repercussion as there is no physical contact, however, if this is the data that an AI agent will learn from what type of human will this AI become?", "If you only write negative comments online then your online personality is potentially not reflective of your true self or you are just a very negative person. However, in many cases there is a personality difference, which could lead to a disastrous effect, where we end up training an AI agent to represent the worst of humanity- the keyboard warrior alter ego.", "This was shown in an experiment by Microsoft. Microsoft utilised Twitter data to train an AI chat-bot. The first messages from the chat-bot showed it\u2019s enthusiasm to be on twitter and learn from humans in a cheerful, playful manner and within 24 hours Twitter user data had corrupted an innocent, child-like AI chat-bot into a far right, racist chat bot representing us humans in the world of twitter.", "AI is driven by data, your data! Human data online is used to learn our personalities, what does this say about us if in under 24 hours this AI agent becomes a voice of negativity, xenophobia, sexism and racism. It is relatively easy to make a chat-bot, it is not the chat-bots fault, it is in fact our fault as it is our data. We are all guilty of this and we must work together to create a more positive space online that truly represents us as humans and how we wish to be viewed as a species. The companies and governments also need to crack down on the verbal abuse given online.", "We must start to be nicer online as this data is currently being used and will continue to be used by several companies to train AI agents, these will be used on you and me as the consumer. Cambridge Analytica took advantage of 30M users Facebook data to distinguish who was more likely to be manipulated by far right political ads. Unfortunately, we will never stop these companies without a big government incentive. Without laws these companies will continue to misuse our data. Thus, what we can do ourselves to make a difference is to make sure our online personality is as positive, authentic and reflective of our true selves as possible.", "These comments are not just hurting someones mental health, but they are also contributing to a negative, homophobic, racist, xenophobic, sexist online environment that one day may be used against all of us, using artificial intelligence.", "Your home for data science.
