It\u2019s no secret that onboarding is an important part of a company\u2019s recruiting process. It consistently affects both new hires and team members, but for some reason, it\u2019s often overlooked.", "Onboarding isn\u2019t just the first impression that a company makes; it sets the tone for the new hire\u2019s experience there. Despite the ever-growing amount of content being churned out by the online data science community, there\u2019s a surprisingly scarce amount of information on best practices as they relate to onboarding.", "In this post, I\u2019ll look to address this need by sharing what my experience has taught me about onboarding new hire data scientists in industry.", "We know that data science is an inherently multidisciplinary field that requires a diverse skill set. Generalists by nature, we are expected to cover all sorts of ground between engineering, product, reporting, analysis, and more.", "However, this also means that new hires need appropriate onboarding in each of these areas. This is why the task of onboarding data scientists is a bit trickier than most. You have to go broader. This means establishing a foundation of knowledge in several different areas, rather than honing in on one or two specialties.", "While unavoidable, this isn\u2019t a huge obstacle. It simply means that we need to think about onboarding a little differently for data scientists. Not a full overhaul, but we need a system that is personalized to the style of work that we will be doing.", "Once all of the human resources stuff is out of the way and the new hire is up to speed on any company-wide information and processes, it\u2019s time to set expectations.", "This normally takes the form of an initial meeting with their manager where they can share a bunch of information and dive further into the role. The discussion should include the following before you move further into onboarding:", "Next up, it\u2019s time to meet the rest of the team. This step will vary per company, depending on the size of your data science team and the structure of your organization. The big thing here is making the new hire feel comfortable and getting the introductions out of the way. This can be taking a lap around the office to meet everyone or something as easy as sitting down for lunch with the team.", "Once introductions are done, they should get to know everyone a bit better and start to learn more about the team. My favorite way to do this is by using Andrew Bosworth of Facebook\u2019s Career Cold Start Algorithm over the first couple of months. The premise of this algorithm is to get a shortlist of people you should talk to from your manager, ask them each for 30 minutes of their time, then do the following:", "For the first 25 minutes: ask them to tell you everything they think you should know. Take copious notes. Only stop them to ask about things you don\u2019t understand. Always stop them to ask about things you don\u2019t understand.", "For the next 3 minutes: ask about the biggest challenges the team has right now.", "In the final 2 minutes: ask who else you should talk to. Write down every name they give you.", "Repeat the above process for every name you\u2019re given. Don\u2019t stop until there are no new names.", "This one is a bit more straightforward, but your new data scientist will need some time to get their environment and tools all set up. This normally means jumping through more than a few hoops or requesting access for various accounts and software applications.", "Anything you can do to remove friction in this process should be done. We have all had trouble running certain software or packages before. We know how frustrating it is. Sharing appropriate documentation, shortening the feedback loop between employee and service desk, and specifying team members to contact with questions are all good moves here.", "No matter what industry and business model you are working with, data scientists need to know their customers. Domain knowledge is absolutely essential to consistently drive impact. A strong initial approach to developing this domain knowledge is learning about your customer segments and the demographics that they fall in.", "\u201cWe think of data as the voice of our users at scale.\u201d \u2014 Elena Grewal", "Even better, the new hire should get their hands dirty and use the product if possible. You\u2019ll find that the simple act of being your own customer can open up doors that you didn\u2019t know existed when generating hypotheses and deriving insights from the data later on.", "We know that history is bound to repeat itself, more than we care to admit sometimes. That\u2019s why understanding past projects, initiatives, and insights within both the team and company can make a data scientist\u2019s life easier.", "They should take the time to review any past analysis or projects that are relevant to the team. Even skimming through some stuff will give new hires a feel for what\u2019s been done before, allowing them to follow-up with someone if they are working on similar projects. They shouldn\u2019t get stuck or waste time reinventing the wheel.", "Perhaps more importantly, make sure there\u2019s a clear understanding of the company\u2019s vision and road map, along with the reasons they are doing the things that they\u2019re doing.", "Data scientists are thinkers. We have more time to ponder problems than PMs or engineers, so a solid understanding of the big picture can go a long, long way when it comes to making an impact.", "As soon as your data scientist has their environment set up, have them get started with an initial project. Ideally, you\u2019ve reduced the technical and company-wide onboarding enough to get this project going within the first week or two.", "This can be something small and concrete like a follow-up analysis or a one-off inquiry from a stakeholder. It\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t produce earth-shattering results. The goal of this project is to get the employee\u2019s feet wet and jump-start them into doing more impactful work.", "Once they have made some progress here, it\u2019s a good idea to give them something more exploratory to dive into as well. Let them flex their creative muscles a bit and explore the data to try and solve a vague problem. This flexibility will go a long way in developing their comfortability with both the data and their new workflow.", "The reality is that nobody can get fully up to speed right away. It\u2019s going to be a process where prioritizing the most important areas is key. Because of this, it\u2019s important to emphasize that new data scientists focus their precious time on just-in-time skills and tools during their onboarding, rather than spreading themselves too thin with just-in-case things.", "More concretely, an example of just-in-time learning would be getting familiar with your company\u2019s data warehouse of choice, something that they\u2019ll need to know early on. On the other hand, studying survival analysis because it could be applicable isn\u2019t a priority during the onboarding process, and therefore fits into the just-in-case grouping.", "This isn\u2019t always going to be the case \u2014 there should be a balance. But it\u2019s a good way to kick start things more quickly.", "The importance of documentation in this process can\u2019t be overstated. Having a centralized location of the knowledge necessary for getting started can make onboarding run exponentially smoother. Building this out the right way may take some time upfront, but it\u2019ll pay itself off in the long-term.", "Lastly, collect feedback on the process and improve it for the next addition to the team. It\u2019s difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone that\u2019s just starting out, so don\u2019t depend on it. Gather feedback and poke at some of the potential weaknesses in the process so that you can brainstorm and eventually implement potential solutions. Your future hires will thank you.", "Thanks for reading!
