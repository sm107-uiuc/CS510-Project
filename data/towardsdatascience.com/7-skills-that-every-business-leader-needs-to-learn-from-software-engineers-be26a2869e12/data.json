Because there\u2019s always room for improvement!", "But they also need to improve who they are learning from.", "Learning from investors is great. Many angel investors have built their own successful businesses in a previous life. So the advice they give is beyond valuable.", "Learning from their salespeople is a great option, too. From them, they can learn what consumers are loving about their product and what is left to improve.", "Learning from the management team is vital. They give leaders feedback on how well their business vision is translating into performance. Plus, they can always learn a thing or two from the soft skills of their managers.", "But there is one team that business leaders often overlook. This team is supposed to excel \u2014 but their unique set of skills is often overlooked due to its nerdy attire.", "Don\u2019t improve what you learn. Improve who you learn from", "You guessed it. The IT team.", "From the many roles that IT has to offer, I\u2019m going to focus on software engineers in this story.", "They\u2019re usually more experienced than developers. And they\u2019re in constant exchange with their managers. This makes them an ideal group to learn from.", "A good engineer is curious as a newborn kid. This is essential to stay on par with their skillset, given that technology is always changing.", "But an engineer\u2019s curiosity is fundamentally different to the one that business leaders have.", "While a leader might be curious about new directions for their business, an engineer will be curious about how to turn in that direction. While a leader is curious about a new product to launch, an engineer is curious about how to build it.", "A leader is curious about the \u201cwhat\u201d. An engineer is curious about the \u201chow\u201d.", "This is exactly where a leader can learn more. What sets a great leader apart from a mediocre one is that they\u2019re not only curious about the \u201cwhat\u201d. They also think about the \u201chow\u201d.", "Take Elon Musk as an example. He\u2019s extremely curious about the \u201cwhat\u201d: Sending rockets to Mars and beyond. But he\u2019s also curious about the \u201chow\u201d. That made him change the rocket material at SpaceX from carbon \u2014 which is standard today \u2014 to stainless steel.", "Musk couldn\u2019t have come up with that solution on his own. But he listened to his engineers and learnt from their curiosity about new materials.", "Most business leaders have a vision. Then they develop a three-year-plan to make the vision a reality. And then\u2026 they take this three-year plan and make it happen in three months.", "Impatience is their virtue. In order to make it big, leaders try to make things fast.", "But there\u2019s a problem with this. It\u2019s so obvious that you should know it before you read on\u2026", "Good things take time. If you want to write an amazing piece of code, you\u2019ll need to invest a few weeks. Engineers know this.", "Likewise, if you want to build an amazing business, you\u2019ll need to invest at least a few months. Business leaders don\u2019t realize this.", "Getting something amazing done in record time sounds great on paper. And it happens \u2014 but it is exceptional. 98 percent of great things take a long time.", "Mediocre business leaders want everything done by yesterday. Great leaders learn from their engineers: You work on a project until it\u2019s done. No matter how long it takes. As long as you\u2019re making progress each day, you\u2019re moving in the right direction.", "Mediocre leaders think that their vision speaks for itself. Great leaders are teaching all the time.", "They teach their users how their product works. A great example for this are Apple\u2019s Keynotes.", "They teach their investors how their business works. This is crucial to retain the investors\u2019 trust.", "And they teach their staff how to make their vision a reality. This is the secret sauce that makes a business thrive.", "But why can leaders learn teaching skills so well from engineers?", "We\u2019ll go back to Elon Musk as an example. Not only did he learn from his engineers\u2019 curiosity, which made him re-think the material of his rockets.", "He also wants every engineer to have an understanding of the whole project. This requires a huge amount of teaching, from the leader to the senior engineers right down to the junior level.", "And Musk doesn\u2019t just teach his engineers. In the process, he learns how to teach \u2014 by watching engineers teach one another.", "Given the current valuation of SpaceX of over $30 billion, this teaching effort seems to be more than worth it.", "Mediocre leaders preach. Great leaders teach.", "As a leader, understanding the big picture is vital. And the prospect of getting lost in the details is scary. Therefore, many leaders skip the details.", "That\u2019s a huge mistake. Any engineer \u2014 even a junior developer \u2014 knows this. When you\u2019re coding, a forgotten semicolon or a wrong indentation can cause your beautiful project to crash.", "Similarly, a typo in a pitch deck can be enough to get investors to run away from a leader. A small mistake will make the leader seem sloppy, lazy and inattentive. That doesn\u2019t build trust.", "Sadly enough, many leaders get the rough and dirty bits done and delegate the little things \u2014 like correcting typos \u2014 to their assistants.", "But you will never see a software engineer write a dirty piece of code and pass it on to their junior developer to clean it up. Because it\u2019s inefficient.", "By the time the junior developer has understood how the code works and then cleared all the bugs, it\u2019s probably Christmas. Think about how much money that is in terms of salary and infrastructure.", "The cost goes down to a fraction, however, if the engineer invests a couple of hours themselves. It might seem stupid for the engineer to engage in such a low-level task \u2014 but in terms of costs, it\u2019s worth it.", "What is clear in terms of software, translates directly back to business. By the time the leader\u2019s assistant has worked their way through a pitch deck to correct the mistakes, the leader would have given the deck a triple polish.", "Mediocre leaders focus on the bigger picture. Great leaders know that details matter, too.", "Most leaders are great at communicating. After all, they need to convince people about their vision.", "Are software engineers great communicators? Most people wouldn\u2019t say so. The stereotypical IT-member sits in front of their laptop in the darkest corner of the room and doesn\u2019t even look up when they speak.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not great at communicating. They just don\u2019t do it very much. Software architects communicate effectively.", "Effective communication doesn\u2019t mean a lot of communication.", "Think about your last company meeting. How much of it was empty blah-blah? Thirty percent? Sixty? Eighty?", "Let\u2019s assume there were 15 people at the meeting, with an average hourly wage of $20. If the meeting took one hour and sixty percent of it was empty blah-blah, the company just turned 15 * $20 * 0.6 = $120 into thin air. If these meetings happen weekly, this translates to $120 * 50 = $9,000 wasted money per year!", "Unfortunately, lots of business leaders talk like politicians \u2014 they\u2019re really good at empty blah-blah.", "And software engineers excel at keeping their mouths shut. Not only that, they talk when it matters.", "That\u2019s a key skill for every business leader.", "This one is linked to the lesson above. How often do you see software engineers gossiping over their coffees? What about managers? Investors?", "You\u2019d think your manager should be discreet about their team. They\u2019re not. If you\u2019ve ever seen two managers in a coffee break when they\u2019re feeling unwatched, you know what I\u2019m talking about.", "Investors spend 98% of their time with gossip \u2014 either producing or consuming it. Really good investors try to cut the gossip a little bit \u2014 but most of them can\u2019t be bothered.", "Sure, they\u2019ll vent about a friend who\u2019s let them down or the traffic this morning. They\u2019re human too. But 98% of what they say is useful stuff and no B.S.", "Unfortunately, business leaders too often copy the communication style of their investors and not of their IT-team. Why do they do that?", "Because the investors, in their eyes, have more power. They\u2019re the ones giving them the money to grow their business, and the ones who have a say in every major decision. The IT-team, on the other hand, are on the receiving end. They execute company goals and get a salary in exchange.", "So on a surface level, it makes sense to communicate like an investor. Behave like the powerful, and you\u2019ll get powerful yourself \u2014 that\u2019s the motto.", "But as argued in point 5, this leads to wasted money. Worse than that, it destroys trust in them as leaders. After all, how can you assume that somebody is telling you the truth when they\u2019re laughing behind your back?", "Do it like a software engineer, and become a better leader. Cut the gossip.", "Business leaders face decisions every day that could make or break their company. And in 90% of all cases, they need to act fast. That is scary.", "To make the right decision, leaders need advice. But for that, they rely on what people say. They rely on gossip.", "Software engineers would never rely on gossip. If they want to find out whether solution A or B is better, they test it out. Then they let the performance data speak for itself.", "Everything a software engineer does based on quantitative analysis. Have a problem? Analyze! Need to choose a solution? Analyze!", "Many investors rely on gossip. And many business leaders copy them. That\u2019s the surefire way to make poor decisions. Want proof? 80% of all entrepreneurs fail in the first 18 months.", "Great business leaders watch closely how their software engineers make decisions. How they focus on substance, not on gossip.", "And use that to lead their company to success.", "Would you have thought that those tired-eyed computer nerds in the darkest corner of your office had the secret sauce to build better business leaders?", "They probably wouldn\u2019t have thought that themselves. But there\u2019s so much we can learn from one another. Especially from the geeks.", "Your home for data science.
