The last thing someone wants is to start a job and want to leave a few months in. Also, this does not mean every job will be easy, your job should challenge you but in a good way. And if you like really hard challenges that involve shaking up legacy systems/processes and bureaucracy in some companies that is fine but at least you have an idea of what you are getting yourself into.", "Some of the first questions I ask are about the data. As a data scientist, you will be obviously expected to wrangle, explore, transform, and feed your models with data.", "This theme is SO important and will be the theme with the longer paragraphs. Managers are really your gateway to success in a company, and if you have a bad manager but love the company it will be much harder to navigate. A book I read called Positioning: The Battle for your Mind is mostly about marketing and brand image, however; there was a paragraph that talked about managers on how they were really part of cultivating your brand image at a company. They are the ones that will give you projects that should be aligned to your interest or give you a project that you didn\u2019t know you would like but end up liking it anyway because they understand you. A good manager wants you to succeed. I have had four managers and let me tell you it is a very different experience having a manager who sees the value in you and wants you to excel even if it means standing out more at times than themselves versus a manager who sees the value in you and is intimidated and tries to keep you from acquiring any project. However, also be careful with those managers who buy into the \u201chire someone smarter than yourself\u201d but turns it into so their direct reports do all the hard work and the manager just sits back. Make sure your manager has skin in the game and wants you to excel. There is nothing worse than a manager that is not passionate about the role they play themselves at the company.", "Thank you for your time!
