A few days ago, Discover CEO detailed consumer spending related to the travel category has essentially dropped to zero.

The data from Apr-2019 to Apr-2020 (monthly frequency) are sourced from Inside Airbnb (listings.csv). Although they provide more detailed data, listing files are good for visualization without much cleaning involved. There are a total of 645,458 listings in the data.", "An Airbnb host can set up a calendar for their listing so that it is only available for a few days or weeks a year or all year around (except for when it is already booked). \u201cHigh Availability\u201d, defined as available more than 60 days per year, can indicate units are vacant at the moment of data is being scraped.", "The percentage of High Availability increased close to a 4 percentage point from Apr-2019 to Apr-2020.", "When breaking down by Borough, popular locations such as Manhattan and Brooklyn also show increasing trends of \u201cHigh Availability\u201d units.", "The average price of \u201cHigh Availability\u201d units dropped to $185 in April. This drop is mainly caused by units in Manhattan, the average price of Airbnb in other boroughs remains almost unchanged.", "So far, it\u2019s not surprising that there are more available units in NY and their prices have come down. So, the question is what are the Airbnb hosts doing to combat the situation?", "The listing files contain descriptions of each listing. By analyzing descriptions, we can sense how owners are reacting to the situation. In March, listings mentioning \u201cCovid\u201d, \u201cCorona\u201d, or \u201cQuarantine\u201d started to show up. Some examples of March listings mentioning Covid/Corona: The Cozy Queen | Luxe Bnb | Clean & COVID free, Traditional NYC Oasis \u2014 Corona Disinfected, Quiet garden apt UWS, hide-away from Corona Virus.", "However, those listings mentioning Covid/Corona decreased in April. Instead, listings containing \u201chospital(s)\u201d, \u201chealthcare\u201d, or \u201chealth\u201d started to increase. One particular listing changed its description from \u201cANOTHER BEACH PARTY/BREAKFAST\u201d in March to \u201cSt. John\u2019s Hospital Staff/Volunteers\u201d in April.", "As of Apr-08\u20132020, these are top 10 neighborhoods where listings containing \u201chospitals\u201d or \u201chealthcare\u201d are located.", "A map of New York city with listings mentioning hospitals/healthcare, etc.", "Needless to say, it is a challenging time for Airbnb hosts. Airbnb introduced a program to offer healthcare staff and first responders places to stay while safely distancing from their own families. In New York, even though the number of listings mentioning hospitals/health care, etc. is still small, we can see there is a growing trend of owners providing stays to frontline responders.
