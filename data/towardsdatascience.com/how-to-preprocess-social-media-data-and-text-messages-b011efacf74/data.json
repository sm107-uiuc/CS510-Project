There are slangs, acronyms, abbreviations, initialisms, emojis, hashtags, URLs, and among other things, misspellings in Reddit posts, tweets, WhatsApp messages, etc that do not appear in standard English. In a deep learning utopia we would scrape as much data as possible, and train our model and tokenizer from scratch to figure out the meaning of these slangs and acronyms and so on. In real life, however, we might want to make use of existing pre-trained models (and their associated tokenizers) like BERT. Since these models and their tokenizers are usually pre-trained on the English Wikipedia and BooksCorpus data, we will need to preprocess our internet English data first. On the other hand, if we decide to use a non-deep learning approach, then data preprocessing is even more important as it has a huge impact on feature engineering. In this article we will cover some data preprocessing steps that are specific to internet English data, or require special attention.", "In this section we discuss some of the most common NLP data preprocessing steps. They are so prevalent that we might just take it for granted and perform these steps without a second thought. We will most likely still need these data preprocessing steps for internet English data, but with suitable modifications.", "For tasks like sentiment analysis, letter case can sometimes be a useful feature. The following sentences", "show different levels of excitement of the author. However, they will become indistinguishable once we convert the text to lowercase.", "Suggestion: Engineer some features about letter case before we convert the text to lowercase.", "Punctuations, like letter case, are very useful for sentiment analysis. A simple example is the use of consecutive exclamation marks:", "Moreover, it is quite common to use currency symbols in internet slang to indicate greed and corruption, such as \u201cmicro$oft\u201d.", "Punctuations are also capable of conveying different feelings via emoticons such as :-) and (>_<). Obviously, we do not want to blindly throw away all this information.", "Suggestion: Feature engineering on the appearances of different punctuations, especially on consecutive appearances. For emoticons, we can either engineer new features, or we can replace them with English words by using a dictionary. For example, we can replace :-) with \u201csmiley face\u201d. Finally, internet slangs will be covered in a section below.", "Note that punctuation removal also needs to happen after the preprocessing of hashtags, URLs, etc.", "Numbers have a very interesting role in NLP. For tasks like question answering, numbers are absolutely important. For named entity recognition, numbers are not important unless they are part of entity names (e.g. 76ers in NBA, C9 and G2 in esports). For sentiment analysis, numbers are usually irrelevant.", "Having said that, there are always exceptions that we need to pay attention to. 1984 that appears in the politics subreddit is not just a number, \u201c1\u20137\u201d conveys negative sentiment for Brazilian football fans.", "What we have covered so far holds for both internet English and standard English, but internet English has an extra complication in the usage of numbers in slangs, such as \u201c10q\u201d and \u201c2mr\u201d.", "Suggestion: There are so many different usage of numbers that there are no fixed rules on how to preprocess them. The preprocessing step will depends heavily on the nature of the data set and the results of exploratory data analysis. Slangs will be covered in the next section.", "The expansion is quite easy as it only requires looking up a dictionary. The difficult part is about maintaining this dictionary. For internet slangs, we can obtain their meaning via websites like Urban Dictionary or even just Google. However, many internet slangs are initialisms for exaggerative phrases containing swear words and body parts. We may want to tone them down during the expansion. For example, \u201clmfao\u201d expanded simply to \u201claughter\u201d.", "Suggestion: During exploratory data analysis, collect all the high frequency terms that are not standard English words. Create a dictionary for expanding these terms, and tone down the exaggeration and/or offensiveness of the expanded phrases if needed.", "In this section, we introduce new data preprocessing steps that are tailor-made for internet English. Most of them work for the internet version of other languages as well.", "For most tasks, URLs are not relevant and can simply be removed. However, for topic model and topic classification, it is crucial to understand what the URLs are about. One easy way to incorporate this information is replacing URLs by their titles. This can be done by first doing a HTTP GET, and then parsing the HTML response.", "The same idea also applies for user mentions and hashtags. Nonetheless, it is much harder to decide what text we should use for replacement, and the process will require a lot of manual inspection. Consider \u201c@ManCity\u201d in Twitter for example. Its user name is \u201cManchester City\u201d, but we might want to use \u201cManchester City Football Club\u201d instead in order to better illustrate the nature of this user mention.", "The preprocessing step for emojis is basically the same as that for emoticons. For instance, we can replace \ud83d\ude00 with \u201cgrinning face\u201d. The meaning of different emojis can be found e.g. at emojipedia", "Note that sometimes emojis are used in place of English characters. In this case, the meaning of the emojis can be added to the end of the sentence. As an illustration, \u201cg\u26bdal\u201d is converted to \u201cgoal football\u201d.", "There are different types of misspellings, and each requires a different preprocessing method.", "Your home for data science.
