You\u2019d probably also have done some research on Google, scanned through various pages titled like \u2018Top Python Data Science IDE\u2019 and started desperately realizing that none of the mentioned products combines a seamless look and feel for all necessary implementation steps. Ultimately you turned back to your well known, but yet separated set of tools. The good news is, there is a very promising project waiting just to be released as 1.0 version tackling a lot of our day to day data science needs. I am referring to JupyterLab.", "Python notebooks got a lot of attention in the recent years as a tool showing code and results in an interactive and nicely layouted manner. It certainly helps to lower the barrier to start with programming and helps in education, because an input is presented together with its processed output instantly in a browser, which many users are very familiar with. Despite Python notebooks\u2019 popularity, a classic Python IDE or text editor becomes more convenient the more coding needs to be done. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if there would be a tool taking the best of each and consequently combines both worlds? JupyterLab is working towards that goal by enabling users to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner [1].", "Jupyter notebooks\u2019 \u201cevolution of the Jupyter web interface\u201d to JupyterLab is based on a user experience survey conducted in 2015 highlighting following three success factors [2]:", "These factors are not surprising looking into some Pros and Cons based on my experience with Jupyter notebooks.", "+ Jupyter notebooks are particularly strong when it comes to visualization functionalities. E.g. tools like Google Facets have been developed for being used in Jupyter notebooks [3].", "+ The interaction with plots is very convenient e.g. by just simply using %matplotlib notebook or ipywidgets [4].", "+ One can add a pretty and concise documentation of a piece of code by changing a cell from Code to Markdown.", "+ Jupyter notebooks are a pretty neat tool for data storytelling and presentation as its possible to show a documentation along with a code\u2019s output.", "- The absence of a built-in variable inspector is one of the first things experienced standard IDE users are missing in Jupyter notebooks. I want to highlight though that there is a extremely helpful community-contributed unofficial extension using the notebook\u2019s metadata [8].", "- Jupyter notebooks do not provide a convenient file explorer view when developing code [5]. Thus, reading and writing files becomes clumsy.", "- One needs to prefix terminal commands with a exclamation mark ! within a cell in order to interact with the operating system\u2019s terminal or use the terminal view added as addon [5].", "- Opening and exploring files is clunky as one needs to load the file first and choose an appropriate way to display it programmatically. This requires more effort than opening e.g. a jpg file with a double click within an IDE.", "- Testing and modularity are difficult to handle within Jupyter notebooks.", "- Seemingless integration with a version control system is missing, although there is interesting progress with add ons like nbdime making diffing and merging of notebooks easier [7].", "- Absence of a convenient visual debugging plus profiling functionality, despite really promising developments like the PixieDebugger [10].", "I want to highlight that this is not an exhaustive list of Pros and Cons. A statement listed under in the Cons section does indicate that the mentioned functionality is not achievable at all. It is also listed under Cons in case its not intuitively available in Jupyter notebook.", "Let\u2019s look into the details with the currently available version of JupyterLab (0.35.6) and see what is gonna be covered when moving from Jupyter notebook to JupyterLab.", "JupyterLab lets you develop complex python code as well as Jupyter notebooks and making it easy to connect them to the same kernel. I see this as a key feature for tackling the Cons.", "In the following animation you see how to connect multiple Python files and notebooks in JupyterLab.", "Now look at the bellow animation as it shows the simplicity of loading data into a dataframe, developing models separately while testing and visualizing them with the power of Jupyter notebooks in a seamless manner. All of this is possible in addition to having one common variable inspector and file explorer. You can see here a simple manual function approximation task.", "Effectively this decouples extraction, modeling and visualization without having to write and read files to share the data frames. This is a massive time saver for your daily work, as it reduces the risk of mistakes in the file loads, and because it's much faster to setup your EDA along with trials in the early stages of projects. Furthermore, it helps to reduce the number of code lines in case you add as many asserts into your data pipeline as me.", "In case you need a terminal really quick within the same context of your project, then you can just simply open the launchpad and create a new Terminal view. This is particular useful if want to check the resources needed by your model or algorithm, as shown in the following animation.", "Opening a data file is also pretty neat with JupyterLab. It is rendered in a nicely e.g. in tabular form for csv files and utilizes lazy loading, hence making it fast plus it supports enormous file sizes. The next animation shows opening the IRIS data set from a csv file.", "You can also open image files with just a click, which comes pretty handy when working on computer visions tasks. In the following animation you see how Jupyterlab renders an image of the hubble telescope in a separate of the last used panel.", "Furthermore, you can navigate and utilize Git with JupyterLab\u2019s Git extension as shown below.", "There is no visual debugging and profiling functionality available in JupyterLab at the time writing this article. It is currently planned for a future release [11]. Hence, development will start earliest after version 1.0 has been released. Despite this plans, there is work being done to enable PixieDebugger for notebooks in Jupyterlab [12].", "JupyterLab adds a complete IDE around Jupyter notebooks making it surely a strong evolution of the Jupyter notebooks. It integrates so well into the data scientists\u2019 daily work that it can be also seen as the Next Gen tool. The ease of decoupling data extraction, transformation, modeling visualization and testing is already really powerful.", "With this in mind I hope seeing the 1.0 release popping soon. In case you got excited about the JupyterLab project and want to try it yourself, just follow the instructions in Parul Pandey \u2018s article:", "[4] 5agado, Interactive Visualizations In Jupyter Notebook (2017), Interactive Visualizations In Jupyter Notebook", "This article aims to provide reasoning as to why JupyterLab might be the IDE of choice for a Python data scientist, by combining the author\u2019s practical experience with a profound literature research.
