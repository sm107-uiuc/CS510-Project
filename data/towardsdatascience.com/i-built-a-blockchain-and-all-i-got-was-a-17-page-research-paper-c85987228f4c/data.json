Wow, what a time to be in school (so thankful I\u2019m graduating). As it happens, the main focus of this story happened last semester, before all the COVID-19 stuff accelerated.", "As a Computer Science major, I\u2019m required to complete a semester course called Senior Research. A very (intentionally) vague title for a class where all they want you to do, is pick a problem you think you can apply CS to, and research a solution. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the culmination of the project, the paper, and the presentation.", "My professor (hi! if you\u2019re reading this), let us get into groups (both for his benefit and ours) based upon project ideas. I\u2019ll readily admit, that I didn\u2019t come up with my project idea, my partner did. However, I did fervently push to build the project that my partner will gladly tease me for to this day. What is this mysterious project you ask?", "We wanted to build a voting system using blockchain.", "See the project on GitHub here (there\u2019s also a copy of the paper and presentation there if you want to read it).", "Well, my partner is very interested in the information security field of tech (and has a passion for political science), and I like a challenge. The idea intrigued me. The challenge taunted me. Indeed I ended up with many sleepless nights and a couple of clumps of hair from the stress.", "We decided to use Hyperledger Fabric (HF) to build the project (without Composer). Eventually, due to issues with OS dependent parts of the project, the actual chain became my piece of the project, and my partner worked a bit on a proof of concept Merkle-tree (which I\u2019m sorry, but I still can\u2019t explain how it works exactly).", "I spent most of that semester trying to get basic functionality on that chain done. I started over so many times. I sifted through what little documentation currently exists for vanilla Fabric trying to find the answers, troubleshooting to the best of my ability \u2014 some of those things being Medium articles, which I\u2019ll link below. That project tried my patience so badly, but I was too stubborn to start over with something less difficult.", "As I\u2019m sure many are unaware, the majority of the voting systems/machines currently used today (in the U.S.) have been studied and found to be very insecure. The reasons why aren\u2019t laid out in exact terms. Likely because it\u2019s hard to determine as these machines were built and distributed before they were tested by a third party.", "Essentially it comes down to three likely reasons.", "So, with the aim of the class being to try applying our Computer Science knowledge to real world problems, why not a voting system?", "As the entire premise of blockchain is to be an uneditable, append only ledger, maintained by a network of peers, what better to fix the security issues? As voting is considered a practically biblical process of democracy, no amount of security could be too high right?", "The truth of blockchain, is that the amount of security is determined by how many peers participate in the network to uphold the integrity of the ledger. Due to this you still have to meet the requirements of the Byzantine Generals Problem in order to effectively protect the network and the larger the amount of peers participating, the harder it is to fool the network.", "So for the umpteenth time, I gave in, started over AGAIN, and used an example from HF directly, and modified the least amount I could get away with in order to make it work. And it worked! We wrote our paper, gave our final presentation, and earned our grade. Suddenly, the project had no meaning anymore other than a strange one-off side project. In the final stages of writing the paper, we even found that the state of Virginia actually has a publicly available (though maintained privately) e-voting app powered by Hyperledger Fabric.", "The first reaction was that it invalidated the point of our project. However, it didn\u2019t. Why? Because that was maintained privately for \u201csecurity reasons.\u201d Ours was open source. The important difference being, we didn\u2019t have any way to research on whether they\u2019d improved the security conditions brought up by research papers we\u2019d found about older \u2014 although still currently in use \u2014 voting systems. The idea of open sourcing it would hold the maintainers responsible for community found vulnerabilities, as well as source community talent where needed.", "In the end I learned something new, overcame a huge challenge, and did some work for myself that I\u2019m still proud of. Full disclosure, I\u2019ve spent my time doing mostly front end development and I\u2019ve been working as a developer/junior software engineer for close to two years now.", "My advice to you, new programmer, is that when you get your basics down, challenge yourself. Think of something very challenging, maybe even outlandish, and go through the motions of hitting the wall and starting over. The challenge will force you to discover the depth of your need to solve the problem, or it will force you to give up.", "Either way, even if there\u2019s no real, tangible reward \u2014 I still can\u2019t take that particular 100 to the bank unfortunately \u2014 it will teach you more about yourself and the technologies you use to reach your solution far better than looking through Stack Overflow for the bits and pieces of the solution you\u2019re really looking for.", "Your home for data science.
