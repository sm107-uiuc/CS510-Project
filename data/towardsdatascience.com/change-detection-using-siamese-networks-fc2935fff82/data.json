For example, observing the infrastructural change in a city or a town over years can help\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["All things change over time, and being able to understand and quantify this change can be very useful. For example, observing the infrastructural change in a city or a town over years can help measure it\u2019s economic prosperity, face changes can reveal if you\u2019re growing old too quickly, signature changes can detect fraudulent activities, a change in the texture and color of your skin might as well tell if you\u2019re starting to develop a mild skin disease like acne, and capturing timestamped images of historical monuments can reveal the cracks developed over time in them. It\u2019s quite obvious there\u2019s a lot of value in a method that works on measuring this change, and that is going to be the content of this piece.", "Before diving into the technical details, let us try to understand and formulate the problem a bit better (It\u2019ll help us evaluate our models in a much more quantifiable form later on). What do you think are the desirable properties of a system built to observe change?", "It is important that any model is adept at ignoring changes which aren\u2019t relevant for our use case and ONLY detects the ones we\u2019re interested in. For detecting change in buildings over time, it could involve ignoring changes in roads and trees and water bodies, for detecting ageing, other facial changes such as tanning or new unrelated spots/moles wouldn\u2019t be important.", "This is more of a data normalization problem in that images captured over time would have differences which would be difficult to take care of all the time. If facial images are being captured using a smartphone, the lighting and orientational conditions would never be the same. Similarly, images captured using satellites could be prone to variable cloud covers, sunlight reflection and changes in the azimuthal and elevational angles of the satellite itself.", "This criteria basically segregates a modeling technique in 2 bins, one where you could separate out components from within the model, and one where you cannot. A technique which allows you to somewhat isolate different parts of the model pipeline is largely superior, as you could then use pre-built parts which others have built and merge it together (why reinvent the wheel as they say). This will get more clear when we talk about Early Fusion Networks and their comparison with Siamese networks.", "Based on these criteria, the simplest and easiest way of measuring change, i.e. using an element-wise pixel difference goes out of the picture. There are ways to do this more intelligently as well, but the results are still far inferior and not very robust. Siamese Networks to the rescue!", "A Siamese neural network takes in two images as input (captured at two different timestamps), passes it through a series of convolutional layers to obtain a higher-order feature vector for both of them and then compares these vectors using a Euclidean norm to measure change. The idea is that two images where there\u2019s no relevant change would yield similar vectors in the feature vector\u2019s dimensional space.", "It is important to note that both images go through the exact same network in the feature extraction stage.", "Let\u2019s see how this type of a model adjusts weights during the training stage.", "A Contrastive Loss function is used for training Siamese networks.It tries to minimize the distance between the two feature vectors if there\u2019s no change, and vice-versa. The following visual tries to explain it in the case of a 2-class classification scenario.", "Let\u2019s just get a quick and intuitive look at this. If both images do not consist of changes we\u2019re training for, the actual label would be 1. If the model weights are incorrect, the distance between vectors v1 and v2 would be high. Plugging both these things in the formula, we get a high value for the loss L. Back-propagation kicks in and in order to reduce the loss, it adjusts weights such that the distance between the vectors is lesser than before (for this specific set of images). The margin, m, is introduced to propel the network to produce even more separate features for images with change.", "There\u2019s a very similar class of architectures which are popular for change detection, which go by the name of Early Fusion (EF) networks. It involves combining both the inputs along the channel axis at first. So if we\u2019re working with RGB images, the input would be a 6-dimensional matrix. It would pass through a single feed-forward network this time, instead of 2 parallel ones in Siamese Networks.", "The biggest issue with an Early Fusion network is its lack of modularity. With a Siamese network, you could use a pre-trained network as a feature extractor for your use-cases, depending on the domain, which is extremely useful when you do not have a lot of data.", "Let\u2019s say for example you\u2019re looking to observe a change in how buildings in a certain region changed after a decision by the local government 5 years ago to invest hugely in building corporate parks and malls. So you have annotated data consisting of buildings prior to the investment, and once they\u2019re fully built. It\u2019ll be much better if the model we\u2019re going to use can also use knowledge from other generalized and varied building footprints datasets, consisting of tiles and tiles of images from cities across the world.", "The ability of Siamese Networks to enable Transfer Learning is by far the single biggest reason of its edge over other methods.", "As they say, change is the only constant. And it is this change which when evaluated concretely can yield significantly important insights.", "Your home for data science.
