Uber\u2019s advanced and celebrated Tech and ML solutions failed during and after the event. In this article, I walk through my experience and offer three sets of humble suggestions. For Data Scientists, this is a good reminder of how (fancy) ML may fail when meeting the messy world.", "Disclaimer: All opinions are mine, they don\u2019t represent my employer\u2019s.", "Like What You Read? Follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, and Twitter.", "Despite COVID-19, like many others, my dog and I decided to take a risk to enjoy the weather on May 3rd, 2020. Toronto Waterfront is a paradise.", "As we walked toward the water, my phone buzzed. It\u2019s a notification from UberEat. Looks like my wife ordered pizza for dinner. Although pizza isn\u2019t our favourite dish, I was too consumed by the nostalgic memories of the waterfront.", "I slipped the phone into my pocket and started jogging toward the water with my dog. Meanwhile, my phone kept buzzing.", "Ten minutes later, I plunged into an inferno when I looked at my phone again. Time stopped: the sounds of laughter muted; the warmth of the sun frozen; the existence of my dog vanished; the brief moment of freedom evaporated.", "It\u2019s impossible. Someone hacked my Uber account, even with two-factor verification. The worst (and interesting) part: I could watch it as it happened like a live stream.", "Bewildered, scared, alone. A new notification streamed in: \u201cJason says thanks for the tip!\u201d", "I unleashed a voiceless cry of frustration and for help.", "I took a deep breath of the fresh spring air. Composed. I should change my password and log the hacker out. Anticipating my hysteric interference, the hacker had changed my password and locked me out. I panicked, again.", "Devastated. It looks like the only option was to contact Uber\u2019s customer service.", "Meanwhile, notifications of new UberEat orders over $100 each and thanks from restaurants and drivers kept pouring in \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stop picturing the hacker\u2019s mocking face.", "I had no doubt that Uber (or Mastercard) would refund the money, which they did eventually. However, the process was long and confusing. The aftermath was painfully embarrassing.", "Overall, it was an unpleasant surprise given Uber\u2019s technological advancement.", "I see three problems in retrospect:", "Let me highlight the problems as regular, but caring, user and offer a few suggestions as a caring Data & ML geek.", "Customer service is the first point of contact when problems occur. It\u2019s the most critical, complex, and challenging operation of any company \u2014 Uber is no exception.", "A. No customer service on the mobile app.", "B. Hard to find the right support on Uber Help.", "C. Slow and disconnected responses from other channels.", "In the meantime, I read through the options on Uber Help anxiously and submitted a request under \u201cI have an unknown charge.\u201d That seemed to be the most relevant.", "Here are my practical suggestions to improve Uber\u2019s customer service experience.", "It took me three more requests and seven additional hours to figured out what I needed to do differently: I must submit the request and respond using the same email address on Uber\u2019s file. Uber could have sent more explicit email instructions or use personal responses. When poorly designed, automation saves Uber time at the expense of the users\u2019.", "I\u2019ve been a long time follower of the Uber Engineering blog. The constant technology breakthroughs and innovative concepts never fail to amaze.", "According to Uber\u2019s blog, the company collects GPS data and uses state-of-art hybrid workflow, behaviour analytics, and Deep Learning models (behavioural features are encoded to an LSTM model).", "Note: this is a solution for Uber rides, instead of for UberEats. I assume many components of the solution are shared.", "Yet, a low-tech Canadian bank could detect and rectify the fraud in half of the time without my intervention. I can\u2019t stop to wonder why. Is it over-engineered?", "Fancy engineering asides, we should all agree on one thing: detecting and responding to fraud should be fast and effective. Otherwise, it\u2019s more costly to everyone involved (e.g. user\u2019s time and confidence, companies\u2019 operation effort and reputation).", "My suggestions to Uber are to Keep It Simple and Stupid (the KISS principle) and keep the 80/20 Principle in mind.", "Based on my experience in designing and deploying fraud engines for low-tech banks, a rule-based engine tends to work better than complex ML solutions for two reasons: a) simple solutions tend to be faster and easier to update (KISS) and b) a small set of rules generally capture most of the fraud cases (80/20 principle)", "Some fraudsters can be sophisticated. So, a process of updating the rules must be in place. Uber can do it through a monthly or quarterly review of missed cases. Then, the team can update the rules accordingly.", "Looking at my case, here are my humble and naive suggestions of a rule-based solution that analysis three basic aspects of an Uber order.", "Does the order location make sense?", "Example: I live in Toronto, I travel some times, but I never ordered UberEat in a city outside of my primary residence. All the orders from the hackers were outside of my home city. So, no, my location doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Does the food in the context of user preference make sense?", "Example: I am not explorative; I mostly order Japanese and Korean food from 4\u20136 restaurants near my home in Toronto. My average order size is about CND$30\u201340, the hacker\u2019s average order size is USD$108. So, no, the food details don\u2019t make sense.", "Is the user doing something weird in general?", "Example: I order 1\u20132 times a month typically, the hacker ordered 11 times in 5 hours (~1650 orders per month). The hacker ordered from restaurants in at least 5 US cities that are thousands of miles from each other. So, yes, the user is obviously doing something weird.", "At last, can this analysis be done in near real-time, say within 30\u201360 minutes, so I didn\u2019t have to be tortured by hacker for 6 hours? Many of the calculations are simple, they don\u2019t need a long time to collect enough data to make decisions, and it doesn\u2019t require lots of training data and long inference time compared to an ML-based approach.", "After seeing how fast Uber pushed notifications of praises and a feedback request, I am sure Uber can put this technology into great use!", "Despite the support experience sucked this time, I have full confidence in Uber\u2019s engineering team to make it better.", "Since the hacking incident, Uber\u2019s recommendation algorithm continues to work its magic: it sent notifications and suggestions to prime my appetite at the perfect timing, except the recommendations were all based on the hacker\u2019s taste, not mine.", "Every UberEat recommendation I received in the last two weeks made me feel embarrassed and frustrated. It\u2019s as if the hacker never left me alone, and his (or her ) ominous presence still haunts me in every channel, all the time.", "Because of my professional experience and interest, Uber\u2019s Recommendation design and implementation are my favourites on the Uber Engineering blog. I am always impressed by the innovative ideas, creative designs, and clear explanations.", "The following illustrations describe the core components and processes of UberEat\u2019s Recommendation Engine.", "But, all abstract ideas and sophisticated designs aside, something simple seems missing.", "Uber, you\u2019re a great company. Your success story and technological innovations inspired me and many others. I sincerely hope my experience won\u2019t happen to other users.", "As we adapt to the new normal, I believe your services will be a core component to many industries and many aspects of our lives. Keep it up.If any of you are seeing this, please pass this article to the right teams.", "Like What You Read? Follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter.
