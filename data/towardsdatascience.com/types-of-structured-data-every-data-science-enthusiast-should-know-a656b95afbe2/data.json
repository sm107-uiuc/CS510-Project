This is going to be a series of blog posts and videos(on my YT channel).", "I am starting this series of blogs on statistics and probability to help all the coders and analysts understand these concepts and methods. You are someone who is familiar with Python programming and is trying to get a better grip over statistics to master Data Science skills.", "We know that Data Analysis has evolved beyond its original expected extent and this has happened because of the rapid development of technology, generation of more and bigger data, aggressive usage of quantitative analysis across a variety of disciplines.", "As a result of this infrastructure development, we could reach a stage where we had multiple sources of data like sensors, CRMs, events, text, images, audio, and video.", "Now, the major proportion of this generated data is unstructured i.e. data with no pre-defined model/structure. For example, images are a collection of pixels, textual data are sequences of characters with no particular pre-defined storage model, and clickstreams from a user\u2019s actions on a web app.", "The challenge with unstructured data is that it needs to be preprocessed into structured data to apply statistical methods to it and derive the information contained in raw data.", "When we talk about structured data, we are often talking about tabular data(rectangular data) i.e. rows and columns from a database.", "These tables further contain mainly two types of structured data:", "Data that is expressed on a numerical scale. It is further represented in two forms:", "Data that can undertake only a specific set of values representing possible categories. These are also called enums, enumerated, factors, or nominal.", "But the question arises, why do you need to learn about the data? The answer is that without the knowledge of the type of data, you will have no clue about applying the right statistical methods to deal with that type of data.", "For example, if one of the columns in a dataframe has ordinal data, we will have to preprocess it, and in python, the scikit-learn package offers an OrdinalEncoder to deal with ordinal data.", "The next step is to dive deeper into structured data and how we can use third party packages and libraries to manipulate such structures. We have mainly two types of structures or data storage models:", "Mostly all analyses in data science are done with a rectangular two-dimensional data object like a dataframe, spreadsheet, CSV file, or a database table.", "This mainly consists of rows that represent records(observations) and columns(features/variables). Dataframe on the other hand is a special data structure with a tabular format that offers super-efficient operations to manipulate the data.", "Dataframes are the most commonly used data structures and it\u2019s important to cover a few definitions here:", "Rectangular data structure (like a spreadsheet) for efficient manipulation and application of statistical and machine learning models.", "A column within a dataframe is commonly referred to as a feature.", "Synonyms \u2014 attribute, input, predictor, variable", "Many data science projects involve predicting an outcome \u2014 often a yes/no outcome.", "Synonyms \u2014 dependent variable, response, target, output", "A row within a dataframe is commonly referred to as a record.", "Synonyms \u2014 case, example, instance, observation, pattern, sample", "Relational database tables have one or more columns designated as an index, essentially a row number. This can vastly improve the efficiency of certain database queries. In a pandas dataframe, an automatic integer index is created based on the order of the rows. In pandas, it is also possible to set multilevel/hierarchical indexes to improve the efficiency of certain operations", "Besides rectangular data, we have several other data structures which come under the umbrella of non-rectangular data.", "Spatial data structures, which are used in geolocation analytics, are more complex and different from rectangular data structures. In the object representation, the focus of the data is an object (e.g., a park) and its spatial coordinates. The field view, by contrast, focuses on small units of space and the value of a relevant metric (pixel intensities, for example).", "Graph data structures are used to represent relationships \u2014 physical, social, and abstract. For example, Facebook or Twitter represents connections between people on the network as a graph of social relationships. Graph structures are useful for certain types of problems, such as network optimization and recommender systems.", "Each of these data types has a specific set of methods in data science. The focus of this series is on rectangular data which forms the foundational building blocks of predictive modeling.", "Now that we have a clear understanding of the types of data that we\u2019ll have to deal with frequently, we can now start looking into basic data distributions that are at the core of statistics and data science.", "In the next blog, we\u2019ll cover Gaussian distribution and other basic estimates of location and variability in data. We\u2019ll learn how to generate normally distributed data using NumPy and plot it using libraries like matplotlib.", "With this channel, I am planning to roll out a couple of series covering the entire data science space. Here is why you should be subscribing to the channel:", "Feel free to connect with me on Twitter or LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
