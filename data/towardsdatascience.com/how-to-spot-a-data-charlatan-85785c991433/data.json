Why not? A core principle of data science is that if you\u2019re dealing with uncertainty, it\u2019s not valid to use the same datapoint for both hypothesis generation and for testing. When you have limited data, uncertainty forces you to choose between statistics or analytics. (Find my explanation here.)", "Without statistics, you\u2019re stuck unable to know whether the opinion you just formed holds water.", "Without analytics, you\u2019re flying blind with little opportunity to tame your unknown unknowns.", "That\u2019s a tough choice!

Or do you break into a cold sweat praying that the question you\u2019ve chosen to ask \u2014 by meditating alone in a broom closet without any data \u2014 is worth the rigorous answer (statistics) you\u2019re about to get for it?", "The charlatan\u2019s way out of this bind is to ignore it, finding Elvis\u2019s face in a potato chip and then pretending to be surprised that the same chip looks Elvis-like. (The logic of statistical hypothesis testing boils down to asking whether our data surprise us enough to change our minds. How could we be surprised by data if we\u2019ve seen them already?)", "Whenever charlatans find a pattern, get inspired, then test the same data for that same pattern to publish the result with a legitimizing p-value or two next to their theory, they\u2019re effectively lying to you (and maybe to themselves too). That p-value has no meaning unless you committed to your hypothesis BEFORE you looked at your data.", "Charlatans mimic the actions of analysts and statisticians without understanding the reasons for them, giving the entire field of data science a bad reputation.", "Thanks to the statistics profession\u2019s near-mystical reputation for rigorous reasoning, snake oil sales in data science are at an all-time high. It\u2019s easy to cheat this way without getting caught, especially if your unsuspecting victims think that it\u2019s all about the equations and data. A dataset is a dataset, right? Wrong.

Unlike charlatans, they don\u2019t make conclusions beyond their data.", "Analysts are exempt from calling their shots\u2026 as long as they aren\u2019t reaching beyond their data. If they\u2019re tempted to make claims about things they haven\u2019t seen, that\u2019s a different job. They should take off their analyst hat and put on their statistician helmet. After all, whatever your official job title, there\u2019s no rule that says you can\u2019t learn both trades if you want to. Just don\u2019t get them confused.", "Being good at statistics does not mean you\u2019re good at analytics and vice versa. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise, check your pockets.

The more academic-sounding, the better. Nevermind that these stories only (over)fit the data in hindsight.", "When charlatans do that \u2014 let me not mince words \u2014 they\u2019re bullshitting. No amount of equations or pretty pontification can make up for the fact that they\u2019ve offered exactly zero evidence that they knew what they were talking about beyond their data.", "Don\u2019t be impressed by how fancy their explanation is. For it to be statistical inference, they\u2019d have to call their shots before they see the data.", "It\u2019s the equivalent of showing off their \u201cpsychic\u201d powers by first peeking at the hand you\u2019ve been dealt and then predicting that you\u2019re holding\u2026 whatever you\u2019re holding.

You also have the perfect protection against charlatans.

Instead, use a stash of test data to find out who knows what they\u2019re talking about.", "To protect yourself against charlatans, all you have to do is make sure you keep some test data out of reach of their prying eyes, then treat everything else as analytics (don\u2019t take it seriously). When you\u2019re faced with a theory you\u2019re in danger of buying into, use it to call the shot, and then open your secret test data to see if the theory is nonsense. It\u2019s as easy as that!", "This is a big cultural shift from what people were used to in the era of \u201csmall data\u201d where you have to explain how you know what you know in order to convince people \u2014 flimsily \u2014 that you might indeed know something.", "Some charlatans posing as experts in ML/AI are easy to spot. You catch them the same way you\u2019d catch any other bad engineer: the \u201csolutions\u201d they attempt to build repeatedly fail to deliver. (An earlier warning sign is lack of experience with industry-standard programming languages and libraries.)", "But what about the folks who produce systems that seem to work? How do you know if there\u2019s something fishy going on? The same rule applies!

You can say, \u201cThe reason I know it works is that I can take a dataset that I haven\u2019t seen before and I can accurately predict what\u2019s going to happen there\u2026 and be right.

Think you \u201cknow\u201d something involving Elvis-like potato chips? I couldn\u2019t care less how well your opinion fits your old chips. I\u2019m not impressed by how fancy your explanation is. Show me that your theory/model works (and keeps working) in a whole pile of new chips you\u2019ve never seen before. That\u2019s the true test of your opinion\u2019s mettle.", "Data science professionals, if you want to be taken seriously by anyone who understands the humor here, stop hiding behind fancy equations to prop up your human biases. Show us what you\u2019ve got. If you want those who \u201cget it\u201d to treat your theory/model as more than a bit of inspiring poetry, have the guts to do the grand reveal of how well it works on a brand new dataset\u2026 in front of witnesses!", "Leaders, refuse to take any data \u201cinsights\u201d seriously until they\u2019ve been tested on new data. Don\u2019t feel like putting in the effort? Stick with analytics, but don\u2019t lean on those insights \u2014 they\u2019re flimsy and haven\u2019t been checked for trustworthiness. Additionally, when your organization has data in abundance, there is no downside to making splitting a core part of your data science culture and even enforcing it at the infrastructure level by controlling access to test data earmarked for statistics. It\u2019s a great way to nip snake oil sales attempts in the bud!", "If you\u2019d like to see more examples of charlatans up to no good, this Twitter thread is wonderful.", "When data are too scarce to split, only a data charlatan tries to follow inspiration with rigor, peddling hindsight by mathematically rediscovering phenomena that they already know to be in the data and calling their surprise statistically significant. This distinguishes them from the open-minded analyst who deals in inspiration and the meticulous statistician who offers proof of foresight.", "When data are plentiful, get in the habit of data-splitting so you can have the best of both worlds without cheating! Be sure to do analytics and statistics separately on separate subsets of your original pile of data.", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "Let\u2019s be friends!
