Modelling and optimization of optical/photonics waveguides are very important for many upcoming applications, like optical waveguides used for guiding light in Augmented Reality applications. Seeing such cool applications motivated me a lot to start my PhD journey.", "Like any other PhD researcher, I went to one place where everyone goes when they are not sure what they are looking for and how to find what they are looking for. Yes, you guessed it right \u2014 GOOGLE!!", "Luckily for me, I already knew that I was looking for some sort of open-source codes/libraries or commercial software to get my hands dirty with photonics modelling applications.", "If you are reading this then there is a good chance that you have heard about today\u2019s technologies buzz words-", "Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning", "Everyone is talking about it. Every new company is using it or wanting to use it. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they need it or not, but they want to use it. Or atleast show that they are up to date with new technologies and making our life easier and better. I guess it is good marketing as well!!", "Having heard these buzz words several times from Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Tim Cook, I thought there is no harm in looking for what exactly is this machine learning?", "What the hell is machine learning? Then I understood machine learning is actually statistics plus a lot of other things.", "I started with free courses by Prof. Andrew Ng from Stanford and checking for some YouTube videos. I ended up spending more than \u00a31000 doing courses from Udacity and Udemy. For a few months, these courses consumed my every weekend. Literally every weekend. I even had to say no to friends a few times to join for a party. Can you imagine!! I know it was stupid of me. Anyway, it is in the past now\u2026", "First-year into my PhD, I was still looking for a topic which will become my PhD dissertation. Spent months reading various photonics research papers, understanding some initial optical modelling codes with as little help as possible and irritated with almost non-existent online optical scientist community.", "And that\u2019s when it clicked me- Shall I try to use Machine Learning for Optical/Photonics Applications?", "Yeah, why not!! There is a big online community for machine learning and I had a background in optical engineering. I thought it might work. But remember I was still new in the Machine Learning field and barely scratched the surface to understand and use it efficiently. Then the questions start arising if I had to make it work-", "With the above questions in mind, I gave up on the idea of using Machine Learning in Photonics. I guess this happens to everybody when they look for PhD topics. Every day, they come up with new ideas and then move on. Same happened to me and I got busy in typical optical/photonics application problems.", "It was a regular workday and maybe I was getting bored and started checking Google News. I exactly don\u2019t remember. I saw a research paper getting published, which used Machine Leaning in some Photonic Power Splitters problem. And I remember saying this to myself- Oh Shit! You thought about it a few months back and it is possible\u2026 and it is not only about my excitement of using buzz word technology with optical applications.", "I can also use it and WILL USE IT\u2026. All my doubts/questions were answered by itself\u2026", "I still didn\u2019t have any dataset available online. Then I thought if I find dataset online then I had to stick to that optical problem. But what if I can generate my own dataset depending on the problem I am interested in. This leads to a 1-month-long process of data collection on my own. It was around 10000 data-points, still far less than a general Machine Learning problem.", "What I want to say is if you are interested in a problem to use Machine Learning with, you can collect your own data. But again it depends on the type of problem you are interested in. In my case, it worked as I could collect it using our in-house developed code and fabrication facilities available in the research lab.", "I have been asked 3 times, during my final viva and 2 job interviews- Why to use Machine Learning with an Optical Application problem if we can use equations to predict or optimize a particular optical device?", "Machine Learning shines when there are a lot of input parameters to be optimized. First, if in our optical problem there are for example more than 10 input device dimensions to be optimized then we can easily employ machine learning. Comparing and optimizing 10 or more parameters one by one yourself is a tough job. Secondly, what if the data which we collected experimentally has some unknown noise factor which is never taken care of in equations. In this case, machine learning can be used to predict new values which will take into account the unknown noise of the experimental kit. So I think these 2 factors/cases make the application on machine learning in an optical problem very useful.", "Later on, I published 2 journal papers out of this work and 1 was even selected for Editor\u2019s Pick. Understanding Machine Learning which started as a curiosity for me ended up being the topic of my PhD. So you never know\u2026", "As Steve Jobs said- You can only connect the dots looking backwards.", "How to use Machine Learning in Optical, check the below article-", "Your home for data science.
