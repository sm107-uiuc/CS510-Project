We have to mention the absolutely atrocious referee mistake that failed to disallow Lamptey\u2019s goal, which cost us at least -8pts, sine Regulion was getting clean sheet + was also on the bonus list until Lamptey scored and they actually shifted the bonus points to him. Other than that we bet on the top two captain recommendations from our algo, and both Salah and Kane did well enough.", "We also participate in the FanTeam version of the FPL, where we had another strong week in two of our teams.", "Since we added a lot of new stats to our Algorithm this year, this Blog will evolve to have more stats and graphs and less text over time. Let\u2019s start with the Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "Looks like LIV, WOL, FUL, LEE, and MCI have some tough games coming up, so our Algorithm might not be picking many players from those teams. CHE, LEI, TOT, MUN, CRY, EVE and WHU seem to have more easy schedules over the next three weeks.", "We will try to stack up on players from teams that have a higher than 50 % chance of winning such as TOT, CHE, ARS, WHU, BHA, and SOU. We should try not to have too many defensive players from SHU, WBA, AVL, FUL, NEW, and BUR.", "Teams with higher probability to draw, especially when the game is combined with high odds for Under 2.5, might be good for selecting defensive players because if the game ends 0:0, that will result in lots of bonus points. Combined with the Under/Over Graph below, we can identify the following games with higher probability of at least one clean sheet \u2014 BHA-BUR, CRY-LEE, and LEI-WOL.", "Inversely, we might want to have more attacking players from games with high odds for Over 2.5 such as MCI-LIV, CHE-SHU, ARS-AVL, WBA-TOT, EVE-MUN and WHA-FUL.", "From the stats below it appears that there is a higher chance for penalty given in games: LEI-WOL, MCI-LIV, BHA-BUR, and CRY-LEE , so we recommend having penalty takers for some of these teams. Looks, like the games WBA-TOT, ARS-AVL and EVE-MUN have refs that like to give a lot of cards, so expect to lose some points there from yellow cards, but hopefully no red\u2026", "On top of the referee probability to give penalty, let\u2019s also look at what teams have been given the most penalties over the last 5 seasons, to see where we get the highest combined probabilities. From the graph below we can conclude that LEI, CRY, MCI, MUN, TOT and LIV are most likely to get a penalty.", "Before we run our final team selector, let\u2019s take into account the predicted starting 11 for each team.", "Pay attention to the doubtful player names on the right and also the the most recent injury news updates below:", "This table can reveal which teams are considered good investments overall, and which teams have a lot of overpriced underperforming players. Teams are sorted by avg_pts_per_player, so to no surprise AVL, SOU, LEE, WOL and WHU, and LEI are the teams at the top of the list, since they have exceeded their expected performance given their player prices. Some of the more overpriced, underperforming players can be found in FUL, BUR, SHU, WBA, MUN, MCI, and CRY, so it would be a good idea to be very selective with which players you pick from those teams.", "So far, having offensive players from TOT, LIV, EVE, LEI, CHE, AVL, and SOU seems to be a good investment.", "While having too many offensive players from BUR, SHU, WBA, FUL, WOL, MUN, and CRY seems to be a poor investment, unless you have the one player who scores 70% of the goals such as Zaha at CRY.", "Having defensive players from AVL, ARS, WOL, MCI, TOT, CHE, and LEI seems to be a good investment.", "While having defensive players from FUL, WBA, LIV, BHA, MUN, and LEE, seems to be a poor investment.", "Our approach takes the predicted points for the upcoming game, probability that the player takes penalties, corners, or free kicks, a coefficient for the player\u2019s aerial threat from the past 4 seasons, the likelihood of their team scoring 2 or more goals, and blends all of those in a normalized way into a final captain_choice coefficient. The coefficient is then discounted by an opponent_resistance score, based on the player\u2019s next opponents adjusted FDR and normalized score for defensive strength this season. Example of what the Pandas DF looks like below:", "Based on that formula, here is the list of the Top15 recommended captains for this GW. Lots of good options there, so not an easy choice by all means. Our recommender thinks you should go for Kane, Son, Bowen, Werner, Auba, KDB or Doherty.", "It\u2019s time for the crown jewel of this year\u2019s improved Algorithm \u2014 the predicted player stats. After we layer in all the FDR, bookie coefficient, ref starts, projected lineups and injuries, there are two major metrics that we take into consideration when tuning our Team Optimizer for the next n-gameweeks team selection \u2014 predicted total points and expected value (ROI). Below are the stats for each metric, also broken down by position.", "As you can see there is a large number of options we can choose from for each position, so we will be plugging a lot of the stats above into an Optimization Function in Python, which will output the team with the highest expected total points, given our budget constraints and other metrics that go into our decision making process. Some of the preliminary filters, applied before the Team Selector Code kicks in, include:", "Most used formation by Top100 players last week was 3\u20134\u20133, so we will present optimized team for that formation. As you can see below, the model first looks at parameters that tells it if it should optimize towards full squad of 15 players, or towards a specific formation with 11 key players and 4 cheap fillers. For the fillers, it first looks at preferred formation and uses that to decide how many fillers to get per position. The model then subtracts the total amount spent on the 4 fillers from our initial budget and spends the leftover budget on the key 11 players, given the optimization function and model constraints.", "Example1: Optimize towards max expected points", "We will always use our top scoring team from last week, and try to do maximum of 1\u20132 transfers. Since we\u2019re publishing this blog on Wed and there are still European games tomorrow, we will wait to make transfers until Friday morning, so the team that we\u2019re changing below might change by one player. Not sure yet what taht change would be but if Regulion, turns orange or red, we might look for a swap there with a DF from some of the teams with easier upcoming schedules \u2014 WHU, MUN or CRY.", "The way the season has been going, we recommend shifting away from expensive defenders and trying to just have three mid-range defenders and stack lots of chips in midfield and offense, since it has been raining goals so far this season, and there is no indication that things might be slowing down anytime soon.
