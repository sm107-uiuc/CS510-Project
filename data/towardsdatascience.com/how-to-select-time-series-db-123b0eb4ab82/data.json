As an input, let\u2019s consider a telemetry dataset.", "As criteria of success we have:", "As a continuation of the series of articles about IoT Data Analytics let\u2019s use the Fitness Tracker use case which represents well a typical IoT use case.

That is why it is highly desirable to have capabilities around building predefined time windows to normalize the time series data.", "To the mid-level capacities it is worth to add more sophisticated diagnostic analytics/ad-hoc queries:", "The most advanced level would include checking if the sequence of events matches the particular pattern to perform introspection and advanced diagnosis:", "There are very few databases that support such a feature as of now, but I believe they will come.", "Here we could differentiate the following capacities:", "Besides the functional requirements, it\u2019s really crucial to consider non-functional requirements which often are the main drivers for the selection:", "Let\u2019s review what we have on the market to satisfy our exacting needs. There are a variety of options. It\u2019s really hard to cover all of them, so I\u2019ll try to describe families of engines.", "BigTable, HBase, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Accumulo are often used to store time-series data.

Performing the basic level of analytics extremely efficient.", "Weak Sides: All other kinds of analytics are not supported and not efficient", "There are engines that have been designed from the ground up as Time Series databases. In the majority of cases, they are NoSQL. The most prominent example is InfluxDB which is on the top of all Google searches.", "Some of the mature MPP analytics engines, like Vertica constantly adding new analytics capabilities including the ones related to time-series data handling. The weak point is though, by design they are not created for efficient streaming data ingesting.
