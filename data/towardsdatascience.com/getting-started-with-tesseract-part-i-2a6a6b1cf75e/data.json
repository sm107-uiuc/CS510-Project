In fact, this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. If this was a secret, I\u2019ve already spoiled it, and it\u2019s already too late to go back anyway. So, why not dive deep into Tesseract and share a few tips and tricks that could improve your results?", "Really, though. I do appreciate all those developers who contribute to open-source projects without expecting any benefits in return. After all, they provide us with relatively difficult capabilities for individuals to achieve, such as creating Deep Neural Networks via TensorFlow without much of the hassle. Who would have thought that Machine Learning would be as accessible as it is today?", "Tesseract, too, helps us accomplish simple OCR tasks with a significant success rate and is completely open-source. In this post, I\u2019ll try to get you going with Tesseract and hopefully help you clear some of the hurdles that you might face while working with it.", "Even though there are quite a few options in the field, for example, OCRopus, Tesseract still seems to be the first choice for most free riders. Well, that all adds up if you consider Tesseract is still being developed by the Google community and has constantly grown over time. However, if you\u2019ve had experience with Tesseract before, you might have noticed that Tesseract is likely to disappoint you when it comes to image pre-processing or custom font training.", "Leaving custom font training for a later discussion, for now, I\u2019ll be mainly focusing on going over the basics to get you started with Tesseract. First, let\u2019s quickly go over the installation.", "I\u2019ll be using HomeBrew, a package manager, to install Tesseract libraries. After installing HomeBrew, you should prompt the following command.", "Or, you could also do the same thing with MacPorts if you wish.", "On Ubuntu, it\u2019s quite simple as well.", "For Windows, you can download the unofficial installer from the official GitHub Repository. What a sentence, eh?", "To verify if Tesseract is successfully installed, you can hit your terminal and type the following.", "If you receive a few lines of prompt similar to the one below, your Tesseract is installed correctly. Otherwise, you might want to check what has gone wrong by starting from your PATH variable in your system.", "To start with, Tesseract is not a Python library. Nor does it have an official wrapper for Python. This is where all those golden-hearted developers came in and created this awesome Python wrapper, pytesseract, for us. We also need to install OpenCV and PIL for manipulating images.", "Now, you got your Tesseract installed on your computer, ready to work with Python. So what are you waiting for? Well, there\u2019s no one holding you back; please go ahead and try it out. Here comes a \u201cbut,\u201d though. As stated in many articles, including the official documentation, Tesseract is likely to fail without image pre-processing.", "For quite some time, I\u2019ve been a regular visitor of the ImproveQuality page in TensorFlow\u2019s repository, where they name a few methods you can try to improve your accuracy. Although it claims to have various image processing operations internally, it\u2019s quite often not enough. Here I\u2019ll try to apply a few of the things we can do by using OpenCV.", "Let\u2019s define a simple function that takes the image path as an input and returns the string as an output. I\u2019m gonna get super-creative here and name this function \u201cget_string.\u201d", "Rescaling: Tesseract works best on images that are 300 dpi or more. If you\u2019re working with images with a DPI of less than 300 dpi, you might consider rescaling. Otherwise, rescaling may not make the impact that you thought it\u2019d make.", "I, personally, prefer to make sure that the images are at least 300 dpi rather than rescaling them later in the pipeline. However, everyone has their own preferences. You do you.", "Noise Removal: Most printed documents are likely to experience noise to some extent. Though the main reasons for this noise may vary, it\u2019s clear that it makes it harder for computers to recognize characters. Noise on images can be removed by using a few different techniques combined. These include but are not limited to converting image to grayscale, dilation, erosion, and blurring.", "Dilation, erosion, and blurring require a kernel matrix to work with. To put it simply, the larger your kernel size is, the wider the region your method gets to work on. And again, there\u2019s no one kernel size value that fits all. You need to play with numbers and, eventually, find the right values for your images.", "However, a good rule of thumb could be starting with small kernel values for small fonts. Similarly, for larger fonts, you may experiment with larger kernels.", "As you might notice in the piece of code above, we can create kernels in two similar ways: using a NumPy array or directly passing the kernel to the function.", "Binarization: This is definitely a must. Let\u2019s try to think like a computer for a second. In this cyber-reality where everything eventually boils down to 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, converting images to black and white immensely helps Tesseract recognize characters. However, this might fail if input documents lack contrast or have a slightly darker background.", "After saving the filtered image in the output directory, we can finish writing our get_string function by passing the processed image to Tesseract with the following lines.", "Now, you might think that you\u2019ve got everything ready already \u2014 but there\u2019s always room for improvement. Wouldn\u2019t it be nicer if we had more filtering options? In effect, there is plenty of \u2018em! I\u2019ll be explaining a few of those in my next story.", "For those who would like to look at my source code before moving on to the next story, here\u2019s my complete code on GitHubGist. As you may notice, it actually does a bit more than text recognition. In fact, it does a lookup for a regular expression on a given region of an image and returns the value.", "We\u2019ll get there pretty soon, no worries! Meanwhile, best be on with your day and keep on the lookout for better opportunities*.", "Your home for data science.
