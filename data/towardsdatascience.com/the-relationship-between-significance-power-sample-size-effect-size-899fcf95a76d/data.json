You can be sure (well, 95% sure) that the independent variable influenced your dependent variable. I guess all you have left to do is write up your discussion and submit your results to a scholarly journal. Right\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?", "Obtaining significant results is a tremendous accomplishment in itself self but it does not tell the entire story behind your results. I want to take this time and discuss statistical significance, sample size, statistical power, and effect size, all of which have an enormous impact on how we interpret our results.", "First and foremost, let\u2019s discuss statistical significance as it forms the cornerstone of inferential statistics. We\u2019ll discuss significance in the context of true experiments as it is the most relevant and easily understood. A true experiment is used to test a specific hypothesis(s) we have regarding the causal relationship between one or many variables. Specifically, we hypothesize that one or more variables (ie. independent variables) produce a change in another variable (ie. dependent variable). The change is our inferred causality. If you would like to learn more about the various research design types visit my article (LINK).", "For example, we want to test a hypothesis that an authoritative teaching style will produce higher test scores in students. In order to accurately test this hypothesis, we randomly select 2 groups of students that get randomly placed into one of two classrooms. One classroom is taught by an authoritarian teacher and one taught by an authoritative teacher. Throughout the semester, we collect all the test scores among all the classrooms. At the end of the year, we average all the scores to produce a grand average for each classroom. Let\u2019s assume the average test score for the authoritarian classroom was 80%, and the authoritative classroom was 88%. It would seem your hypothesis was correct, the students taught by the authoritative teacher scored on average 8% higher on their tests compared to the students taught by the authoritarian teacher. However, what if we ran this experiment 100 times, each time with different groups of students do you think we would obtain similar results? What is the likelihood that this effect of teaching style on student test scores occurred by chance or another latent (ie. unmeasured) variable? Last but not least, is 8% considered \u201chigh enough\u201d to be that different from 80%?", "Null Hypothesis: Assumed hypothesis which states there are no significant differences between groups. In our teaching style example, the null hypothesis would predict no differences between student test scores based on teaching styles.", "Alternative or Research Hypothesis: Our original hypothesis which predicts the authoritative teaching style will produce the highest average student test scores.", "The p-value (also known as Alpha) is the probability that our Null Hypothesis is true. Obtaining a significant result simply means the p-value obtained by your statistical test was equal to or less than your alpha, which in most cases is 0.05.", "A p-value of 0.05 is a common standard used in many areas of research.", "A significant p-value (ie. less than 0.05) would indicate that there is a less than 5% chance that your null hypothesis is correct. If this is the case, we reject the null hypothesis, accept our alternative hypothesis, and determine the student test scores are significantly different from each other. Notice we didn\u2019t say the different teaching styles caused the significant differences in student test scores. The p-value only tells us whether or not the groups are different from each other, we need to make the inferential leap assume teaching styles influenced the groups to be different.", "Another way of looking at a significant p-value is to consider the probability that if we run this experiment 100 times, we could expect at least 5 times the student test scores to be very similar to each other.", "If we set our alpha to 0.01, we would need our resulting p-value is be equal to or less than 0.01 (ie. 1%) in order to consider our results significant. Of course, this would impose a stricter criterion and if found significant we would conclude there is a less than 1% chance the null hypothesis is correct.", "The sample size or the number of participants in your study has an enormous influence on whether or not your results are significant. The larger the actual difference between the groups (ie. student test scores) the smaller of a sample we\u2019ll need to find a significant difference (ie. p \u2264 0.05). Theoretically, with can find a significant difference in most experiments with a large enough sample size. However, extremely large sample sizes require expensive studies and are extremely difficult to obtain.", "Type I error (\u03b1) or false positives, the probability of concluding the groups are significantly different when in reality they are not. We are will to concede a 5% chance that we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.", "Type II error (\u03b2) or false negatives, is the probability of concluding the groups are not significantly different when in fact they are different. We can decrease the probability of committing a Type II error by making sure our statistical test has the appropriate amount of Power.", "Power is defined as 1 \u2014 probability of type II error (\u03b2). In other words, it is the probability of detecting a difference between the groups when the difference actually exists (ie. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis). Therefore, as we increase the power of a statistical test we increase its ability to detect a significant (ie. p \u2264 0.05) difference between the groups.", "It is generally accepted we should aim for a power of 0.8 or greater.", "Then we will have an 80% chance of finding a statistically significant difference. That said, we still have a 20% chance of not being able to detect an actual significant difference between the groups.", "If you recall our teaching style example, we found significant differences between the two groups of teachers. The average authoritarian classroom test score 80% and the authoritative classroom was 88%. Effect size tries to answer the question of \u201cAre these differences large enough to be meaningful despite being statistically significant?\u201d.", "Effect size addresses the concept of \u201cminimal important difference\u201d which states that at a certain point a significant difference (ie p\u2264 0.05) is so small that it wouldn\u2019t serve any benefits in the real world. Therefore, effect size tries to determine whether or not the 8% increase in student test scores between authoritative and authoritarian teachers is large enough to be considered important. Keep in mind, by small we do not mean a small p-value.", "A different way to look at effect size is the quantitative measure of how much the IV affected the DV. A high effect size would indicate a very important result as the manipulation on the IV produced a large effect on the DV.", "Effect size is typically expressed as Cohen\u2019s d. Cohen described a small effect = 0.2, medium effect size = 0.5 and large effect size = 0.8", "Smaller p-values (0.05 and below) don\u2019t suggest the evidence of large or important effects, nor do high p-values (0.05+) imply insignificant importance and/or small effects. Given a large enough sample size, even very small effect sizes can produce significant p-values (0.05 and below). In other words, statistical significance explores the probability our results were due to chance and effect size explains the importance of our results.", "We can calculate the minimum required sample size for our experiment to achieve a specific statistical power and effect size for our analysis. This analysis should be conducted a priori to actually conducting the experiment.", "Power analysis is a critical procedure to conduct during the design phase of your study. This way you will have a good idea of the number of participants needed for each experiment group (including control) to find a significant difference(s) if there is one to be found.", "G*Power is a great open-source program used to quickly calculate the required sample size based on your power and effect size parameters.", "2. Select the \u201cStatistical Test\u201d you are using for your analysis", "3. Select the \u201cType of Power Analysis\u201d", "4. Select the number of tails", "5. Select the Desired Effect Size or \u201cEffect size d\u201d", "6. Select \u201c\u03b1 erro prob\u201d or Alpha or the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when there is an actual difference between the groups.", "7. Select the power you wish to achieve.", "In general, large effect sizes require smaller sample sizes because they are \u201cobvious\u201d for the analysis to see/find. As we decrease in effect size we required larger sample sizes as smaller effect sizes are harder to find. This works in our favor as the larger the effect size the more important our results and fewer participants we need to recruit for our study.", "Last but not least, these are the sample sizes requires for each participant group. For example, an experiment with one IV with 4 groups/levels and one DV, where you wish to find a large effect size (0.8+) with a power of 80%, you will need a sample size of 52 participants per group or 208 in total.", "Your home for data science.
