I will try to summarize it in this short post.", "Let\u2019s start by AI Index 2019, developed by the Human-Centered Artificial Institute at Stanford University. As a novelty this year, the AI Index includes for the first time two powerful Data visualization tools:", "By using those tools, anyone can deep dive into detailed information about the state of AI by country or discipline, but I will try to list here some of the report highlights that I found more interesting while crossing them to some personal thoughts, or thoughts I have shared with some experts in the field:", "While discussing these figures with some experts, the feeling they get is that:", "It seems that the experts I know personally are not the ones pointing in that direction, as you can see in this article in which Yoshua Bengio warns that \u201cprogress is slowing, big challenges remain, and simply throwing more computers at a problem isn\u2019t sustainable\u201d. Other articles, like this one from MIT Technology Review go further by suggesting the era of deep learning may come to an end.", "Also, as I wrote on my article \u201cIs Deep Learning too big too fail?\u201d it seems that Deep Learning models are becoming massive while accuracy at scale is not benefiting that much from it.", "Another interesting field to look for progress is education. While enrollment in AI training (both in traditional universities and online) is growing, I still find two worrying areas. One of them is mentioned in the AI Index 2019 report highlights, while the other does not:", "Finally, the AI Index Report Highlights points out a trend that has been quite noticeable during the last months. AI Ethics is becoming very relevant with Interpretability and Explainability as most frequently mentioned ethical challenges. This leads me to the second report, the AI Now 2019 Report, which focuses a lot on ethics. Let me try to summarize which I think are some of the most relevant takeaways of this second report. First of all, some executive takeaways:", "Secondly, regarding the recommendations, the authors make it clear that techniques like affect recognition or facial recognition should be banned or not used while not regulated in sensitive environments that could impact people\u2019s lives and access to opportunities. Regarding bias, the authors point out that research should move beyond technical fixes to address broader political consequences.", "While I agree, I honestly think that there is another important thing to consider, and that is that bias control should move from research to business implementation, linking this to another recommendation of the paper, being it making Data Scientists accountable for potential risks and harms associated with their models and data.", "Of course, the reports deal with a lot more topics, and I would be more than happy to discuss any relevant aspect you find interesting.
