Buyers buy shares at the opening time of market at a specific time window and then sell the same at the closing window of the same day. We are here dealing with a data set of one of the public companies of Tokyo, with daily data of two years from 2014\u20132016. We are going to use a simple machine learning model to :", "For the reference, here is the link to my Github repository which contains :", "Now since you can find all the python codes in my repository, I am not going to bore you by again taking you through the code base or explaining to you the same. The script is simple, stand-alone and pretty straightforward, so it\u2019s quite simple to understand. I have also documented the script wherever required, and still if you are stuck, you can always drop a mail at bmonikraj@gmail.com and expect a reply within a day.", "Once my professor at NIT Rourkela, India said, \u201cUnderstanding of the data and the problem set is as important as, the statistical knowledge required to analyze the same\u201d. We need to understand about intra-day trading and the aspects defining the behaviour of our target value.", "So, our data set comprises of 7 columns, out of which 6 are features and 1 is target.", "Now, since our data has a \u2018Time\u2019 component, it is highly probable that our data is a Time-series data. But for a data to be qualified as time-series data, it must have a factor of either \u2018Trend\u2019 or \u2018Seasonality\u2019. To check if our data set is seasonal or trendy in nature, we can perform \u201cDickey-Fuller Analysis\u201d. If our dataset is seasonal in nature, then we can analyze it as a \u2018Time-series\u2019 data.", "While implementing Dickey-fuller analysis in Python, it requires a variable, \u2018Frequency\u2019. Frequency is mathematically defined as", "Now, in our data-set, we have basically Intra-day trading data. That means, our data is based on everyday\u2019s behaviours of market, incidents in market or industries, management changes in the company, interests of buyers, policies and such other governing factors. Thus, we can strongly believe that our data will not show any pattern for more than a day. And also, from data-set it is evident that our observation frequency is one day. So, we chose the frequency to be 1.", "Here is the Dicker-Fuller Analysis report of my data-set", "From the above graph, it is clear that our data is not seasonal in behaviour, which means our data set is not a \u2018time-series\u2019 data-set, since seasonality is 0.", "Now, after removing the seasonality out of the equation, we have a data set which is completely numeric in nature and has five features, because \u2018time\u2019 is no longer a feature to be consider, since it is not time-series data.", "We can find the graphs of behaviour of various features and target over time here", "From the above, we can see the individual behaviour of the features with respect to time. We can also have the correlation graph between every feature with each other and understand the interdependent relation between every feature.", "From the above graph, the diagonal matrix gives the histogram of the values each column, which is of no use for us since we are not interested in distibution of the features or target (as the number of variables are high and also they are correlated).", "A general note on understanding correlation matrix plot", "Now, we can infer from the above graph, that most of the features are inter-dependent of each other are correlated. \u2018Open\u2019 is highly correlated with \u2018High\u2019, \u2018Low\u2019 and \u2018Close\u2019. And \u2018volume\u2019 is correlated to a good extent with target, \u2018Stock Trading\u2019. Thus, all the features are important for analysis.", "The problem can now be laid out in the simple terms as below :", "From the above list, it is the best option to choose linear regression model for the same because", "After implementing linear regression from scikit-learn module of Python, we get the RMSE = 4253929991.85, after testing our model on test data", "The value seems too high and seems a mis-fit, but we must not forget the fact that the order of features and target values are not similar or near to each other.", "So, from that manner, the RMSE\u2019s order is justified, considering the order in which Mean Squared Error is calculated. Here is the plot of the Actual test target and calculated Test target. From this you can visualize how small the deviation is, hence the performance of our model.", "Applying the knowledge of machine learning and algorithms to daily life scenario and better decision making is the main purpose of such academic advances. And after all, \u2018numbers play an important role in decision making, because numbers never lie\u2019.", "If I may put a conclusion to my article at the end\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cYou don\u2019t need a sword to cut your nails\u201d", "Reach out to me in case you have any queries, at bmonikraj@gmail.com", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
