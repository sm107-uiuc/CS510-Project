While there are many positive examples of good and prudent Data Science in the pandemic, a lot of mediocre, even completely fake, information is also populating our social media feeds.", "Unfortunately, even when leaders and news outlets are well-intentioned, they often present misleading information. For example, they often only focus on the official numbers of each country, although they only reveal part of the truth. Or they praise countries that seem to have handled their outbreak rather well, but forget about privacy breaches and other problematic points. All of this adds to a general sense of confusion and distrust in the government and established news.", "The official death tolls by Corona only reveal part of the truth. The real number is better quantified by excess deaths, which means taking the average death rate over the last five years and comparing that to the death rate of 2020.", "For example, when New York City counted around 16,700 official deaths to Coronavirus back on April 25, the excess deaths amounted to 20,900; so about 4,200 people died without having been identified as victims of the virus.", "This discrepancy is likely even higher with the confirmed cases. Since people without severe symptoms don\u2019t get tested as much, the number of undetected cases is most likely a lot higher than the official one.", "While it is pretty hard to estimate while the pandemic is ongoing, the mortality rate is believed to lie between 0.5 and 1 percent overall. Even if we assume that the official death count were accurate (which it is not): with more than half a million official deaths worldwide at the time of writing, this implies that we should have already counted 50-100 million Coronavirus cases. This doesn\u2019t compare to about 9 million cases that were reported three weeks ago, taking into account the time lag between testing and death.", "Finally, the number of recovered cases is not only underestimated, but misleading in its implications. While the status as a recovered patient may mean that patients have left the hospital, many report that they struggle with the after-effects for weeks, even months, to come. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that Coronavirus can cause heart disease and trigger diabetes in previously healthy individuals.", "In other words, many so-called recovered patients haven\u2019t regained their pre-pandemic health. And since nobody knows how long immunity against Covid lasts, it\u2019s too early to classify them as immune for the long-term.", "The bottom line is: While excess deaths are the only reliable measure to get an estimate of the death toll, the time lag between infection and death is too long to deduce the current situation from that. So policymakers and scientists need to base their models on highly incomplete data about confirmed cases.", "So many basic quantities about this virus are still not well known, for example why people respond so differently to it, how long they are immune for, and whether it has shown any worrying mutations yet. Data Scientists need to take all of these uncertainties into account when building models, for example for the propagation of the virus.", "The CDC sets a good example: In its forecasts for the death tolls, it always includes multiple simulations from trusted institutions and therefore displays a range of possible scenarios. This highlights the fact that the underlying models are based on different assumptions and therefore can\u2019t predict the future to infinite precision.", "Unfortunately, this notion of uncertainty often gets lost when some news outlets and politicians create flashy headlines. Thus, not only Data Scientists but also the general public needs to be extremely prudent when consuming headline after headline.", "The underlying assumptions about the virus aren\u2019t the only contributors to the success or failure of a model. Data collection and processing cannot be implemented without respecting basic civil rights, even in the midst of a pandemic.", "Consider South Korea. Latest revelations show that the country that has been hailed for its handling of the Coronavirus outbreak has been storing sensitive health data from the MERS outbreak in 2015. While this dataset might provide some insights for the handling of the current epidemic, the government is legally bound to delete the data after its usage to mitigate the risk of leaking sensitive data and prevent stigmatization.", "Not only is it imperative that data gets deleted once it\u2019s been used. It\u2019s also important to bundle it, so that people can\u2019t find out the identity of individuals by combining different data points. Frameworks for Statistical Disclosure Control can automate this task.", "On the other hand, one shouldn\u2019t bundle the data too much either. For example, social distancing scoreboards ignore important local and regional variation, and mean little since they don\u2019t take the social, demographic and economic context into account.", "Once you\u2019ve found a good balance between respecting privacy and bundling data, you\u2019ll also need keep the parameters of your model in check. Adding more parameters may make your model fit better to the training data. But the more you add, the more uncertainties you include and the less relevant your findings become.", "Each analysis you do must be based on social values. In times of Corona, this could be public health. In other fields, this could be sustainability, profitability or productivity. If a model is reused for a different problem, these core values must be reassessed.", "This sounds like a no-brainer but it\u2019s not. Consider the previously mentioned social distancing scoreboards: Of course one could collect the data and build a predictive model of the evolution of social distancing over time. But would that really serve public health? Given the inaccuracy regarding the regional and socioeconomic context, probably not.", "All this purpose-fixing won\u2019t help, however, if the technologies for obtaining the data aren\u2019t ideal. Contact-tracing apps, for example, are far from perfect. The only legitimate way to use their data is by taking into account all uncertainties and giving full disclosure about that when presenting your findings.", "Embracing uncertainties, above all, means one thing: Asking more questions instead of giving definite answers. While clear answers make better headlines in the short term, they\u2019re practically guaranteed to be very wrong in the long run.", "To foster a culture where you can ask more questions, try publishing your model in an open ecosystem, where scientific peer-reviewers, research partners, businesses and other communities can be part of the discussion. Through this, not only are you demonstrating that you don\u2019t know everything. You\u2019re also implying that this is an ongoing investigation that is of everybody\u2019s concern.", "While all of the above has been common practice in other branches for a long time, it\u2019s about time that this savoir-faire is also embedded where current affairs are concerned.", "If you\u2019ve read this article until here, you\u2019re probably thinking that all of this sounds well and good, but will be hard to explain to your grandma. You\u2019re not wrong. Data Science and the ethics thereof is hard to explain to the grand public. But it\u2019s not impossible.", "Take Greece as an example. Its success in handling the outbreak is to a large part due to the spokesperson of the Greek health ministry, Sotiris Tsiodras. A scientist himself, he didn\u2019t only explain graphs and curves. Each evening he went on TV, and while giving an overview of the evolution of the outbreak, he emphasized how each case, each death is a human tragedy for somebody in the country.", "This is what Data Scientists should ultimately do in times like these. This is what public health data, data processing and modeling is about these days. It\u2019s not about p-value-hacking or the most beautiful new algorithm. It\u2019s not even about making your grandma understand the ins and outs of epidemic curves. All the talk about ethics, data collection, privacy and purpose is about one thing: doing your best to make sure that your grandma doesn\u2019t die.", "Your home for data science.
