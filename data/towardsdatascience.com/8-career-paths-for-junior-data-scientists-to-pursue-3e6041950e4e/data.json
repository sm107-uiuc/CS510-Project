Fard", "paragraph_index": 16}], "all_paragraphs": ["You finally achieved your goal of becoming a data scientist in a company you liked. You got onboarded successfully and started turning your data science skills to business value for your company. And things are going perfectly for the first six months, one year, or even two years.  \u2026 but eventually, you will ask yourself: what is my next step? How can I plan for my future career to bring fulfillment, success, and reaching to higher positions within my company or even elsewhere? Climbing the career ladder is inevitable; you will feel like it is time to take your next steps. Some companies also encourage and, even, push you to take these steps; Go up or go out! But what are the most common career paths you can take as a junior data scientist ready to move up in their career? Here\u2019s a list of career paths you can choose: 1. Senior data scientist 2. Consulting3. Machine learning engineering4. Data engineering5. Entrepreneurship6. Project management 7. Research8. User Experience  Here, we will discuss each career path in detail:", "Getting a promotion is the most natural choice; it\u2019s a no-brainer. Usually, when you start your role as a data scientist in the industry, you gain a lot of experience in the first 6\u201312 months. In this period, you are learning new technologies quickly and getting closer to becoming a full-stack data scientist. You will also get used to how things are done in your industry, how more senior people approach to problem-solving or present the results. As you have more and more experience, it is natural that more responsibility is given for stakeholder communication, translating the requirements into concrete development stories, high-level problem solving, or even supervising the new joiners in your company.  While there is a transition period between junior- and senior-levels in most companies, called mid-level, by gaining experience, you are getting prepared for a senior-level data science job. The transition usually takes either in three ways: (a) you explicitly ask for it, (b) your managers will promote you, or (c) you change companies and negotiate a better role. You need to have a clear plan to transition from junior-level to senior-level in the most effective way. By making sure you understand the requirements, both and the ones specific to your company, you can speed up your process of moving up the career ladder.", "2. ConsultingData science consulting is also a typical career path for junior data scientists to follow that has a relatively low entry-barrier. The primary function of the consulting industry is to provide external and qualified talent to their clients, mostly global corporations. Consulting companies take up projects with their clients in the form of short- and long-term engagements. These projects can take from months to up to several years.  Working in the consulting industry is usually a great option to build up your knowledge of business in different domains; you get to work in many various projects with large clients, and through these projects, you understand the mindset of corporate decision-makers and what they are looking for in data science solutions. Also, data-driven decision making has become a major trend in all large corporations; you can even expect to have interaction with managing director level employees of your clients to deliver them their new fancy analytics dashboard. Some people study a master of business administration (MBA) before working in the consulting industry. While considering an MBA is useful for your business acumen, nowadays, working in some large consulting companies is an equivalent experience to going to business school. Working in the consulting industry helps you to understand more about business processes and gain practical knowledge about best practices large corporations as well. There are also opportunities for becoming a domain-specific consultant. For example, if you have done projects in marketing analytics and are interested in this capability, you can choose the expert path in marketing analytics. Working as a domain-specific consultant is usually done in some large consulting companies but mostly on senior management level, where they have subject-matter experts or capability leads. Another option is working as a freelance consultant or starting your consulting agency in the specific domain that you are an expert at.", "3. Machine Learning Engineering Machine learning engineering is a close field to data science, and in some companies, there is almost no distinction between these two career paths. Usually, machine learning engineering focuses more on the software engineering side of data science rather than the analytics side, meaning that you, as a machine learning engineer, will do most development work towards integrating artificial intelligence into software solutions. Among the most prominent areas that machine learning engineers nowadays work on are autonomous driving and cloud computing.  Transitioning from data science to machine learning engineering is rather straightforward. You just need to show that you have an engineering mindset and can deliver high-quality software solutions in a practical and reliable way. You also need to have some knowledge of the domain you are working on. But that should not be a big problem.  Some emerging fields have grown so prominent in recent years that they are becoming independent from data science and machine learning engineering fields. These fields are computer vision engineering, speech technology engineering, and natural language processing engineering.", "4. Data Engineering Data Engineering is another sister field to data science. A data engineer is an expert software developer with in-depth knowledge of big data infrastructure and DevOps. Data engineers help data scientists and machine learning engineers with the acquisition and preparation of large datasets.", "There is a belief among data scientists that 70% of data science work is dedicated to some data management. Therefore, some data scientists naturally find their passion in this part of the process and move to data engineering. For this transition, you will need to become more engineer-minded, and have hands-on experience with technologies like Hadoop, Spark, Scala, and nearly all database technologies. 5. Entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship is a popular option to pursue in data science. Big data analytics and artificial intelligence are hot topics, and many startups are looking for adapting these technologies into their products. There are multiple ways for a data scientist with some experience to break into entrepreneurship:", "(a) Idea stage incubators that support young startup talent to form teams and build companies. These are usually short-term programs for up to 6 months and provide the startup talent for some of these programs; you just need to bring your entrepreneurship talent and nothing more. The programs help you build teams, build a minimum-viable-product, and gain follow-up investors,", "(b) Company builders similar to idea stage incubators with a small difference that you are an employee of those incubators. Usually, you are hired as an entrepreneur-in-residence and pursue a startup idea with the guidance of the mentors in the incubators. For this path, you typically will need to have at least an idea or expertise in one business area. The support on product development, fundraising, and team-building is again a supporting service these companies provide,", "(c) Startup (Co-)Founder that follows a conventional startup growth path that is usually starting a team with an idea, developing a minimum-viable product, presenting it to investors, fundraising, scaling the company and repeat. In this path, you don\u2019t have to be the chief executive officer or have a strong business background to run the company. You can be somebody fairly technical focused on the product development, and you leave the business development or fundraising to your co-founders,", "(d) In some countries, and there are government grants for boosting the startup scenes. Some of these grants are offered to science-based startups with high-tech ideas, so if you still have some connections with your former universities, it will be useful to restore those connections and start the application for those grants.  (e) if you are not an absolute risk-taker and do not want to start your own company, another option is to work at young or mature startups in which you can take up a role similar to a product manager or even Chief Technology Officer. This is still a good-enough step towards the entrepreneurship career path and involves its benefits of learning the process of growing a startup without the need to take the financial risk.", "Project management is a necessary job in nearly all companies. Usually, people become project managers through two primary career paths: (a) data science expertise path or (b) business-oriented project management path.", "The first option is the career path in which you have done so many data science projects that you will become a natural leader to other junior and senior data scientists in your company. At this stage of your career, you know how to communicate with stakeholders, solve business problems, delegate tasks to more junior data scientists in your company, own a topic within a project. To become better at project management, you will have to get training the project management skills explicitly in parallel to relying on your deep expertise in data science.  For the second option, you will need to start early in your career by only focusing on the project management career track. This is usually done by taking on junior-level project management roles like becoming a scrum master or merely assisting the current project managers in your company. Some people choose project management roles right from the beginning of their career. These people usually start by being a scrum master, get a scrum master certificate, and earn some project management experience by that. However, these types of roles are solely management roles and involve a lot of people skills especially corporate politics.", "Going (back) to research might be also an option for some people who are working in data science for a while. A lot of first-year data scientists are coming directly from graduate school, and sometimes they feel like the industry is not for them or they would like to go back to doing some research work again. Typical research career paths include doing a Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher role in academia, or research scientist roles in the industry.  We need to be mindful that going back to research should not be the ultimate solution to a challenging first year in the industry. It is difficult to adapt to a new system, especially if somebody is coming from academia. For example, the speed of development work might be very different in the industry comparing to academia. Therefore, the suggestion is to persevere in succeeding in the data science industry if you are passionate about it, and the results will come. But, if you are driven by answering questions rather than making things work, it will be worthwhile for you to explore the research career path again.", "While doing projects in the software industry, you might encounter some new roles that are outside your core expertise but are very interesting to you. In software development, one option can be user experience design & research. User experience design is the process that is followed to design the flow the user goes through in working software. This can be a simple website or more advanced web platforms like social media. On the other hand, user experience research focuses on experimentation and coming up with best practices in user experience.", "People with more interest in human behavior or extrovert personality traits can choose user experience design as their career path. These roles usually involve more communication with the users or stakeholders without the need to become a project manager.", "Keep in mind that, like any transition to careers outside your core expertise, you will have to learn so many new skills. Still, if you are passionate about user experience, it is probably worthwhile.", "Pouyan R. Fard is the CEO & Chief Data Scientist at Fard Consulting.
