Over the past few decades, more and more tech giants (Facebook, Twitter, and Google leading the way) have started migrating data into graph databases to not only store and retrieve data in a highly scalable way, but also incorporate models on graph structures to produce highly effective recommendations.", "What makes graph databases so enticing to these companies with gargantuan data? And can the public sector benefit from this technology in similar ways?", "Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS\u2019s) refers to databases that store their data in a structured format with rows and columns, and have a schema that demonstrates the linkage between different tables within a database. RDBMS\u2019s are generally queried with SQL (Structured Query Language) or a similar equivalent, and are great for fairly static (non-changing) and normalized data structures.", "To give a basic use case of RDBMS, let\u2019s pretend we are starting a company called GovBook, the government equivalent of Facebook, that allows users to register for an account, submit government documents, and interact with government officials in a social setting. There are thousands of data attributes being captured for each person, which each must get placed into a specific table in a database. We could structure our database schema to have a User Registration table, containing all information for a user that is given during registration, and a Documents table, containing a link to a pdf for every Document that a user has uploaded to the system. There would be some kind of unique identifier, called a primary key, to differentiate users in the User Registration table, and this key would also serve as the foreign key to link the two tables to each other.", "This seems like a very nice and logical way to deal with data management, but of course there are pros and cons to this type of structured system. In this example, the biggest pit-fall is that all entered data be able to fit into the pre-designated columns of a table. But what if, a year into business, GovBook decides they want to capture additional data during registration. At the start, they capture Name, Username, Password, Email, and Gender, but they now want to add a field for Date of Birth.", "This problem gave rise to the concept of NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, which allows for data storage that is:", "Over the past decade, there has grown a huge popularity in one particular type of NoSQL database, the Graph Database. Instead of interpreting data as rows and columns, graph databases use subject-predicate-object triples. So in the example above, instead of inserting a row of data Jennetta George , JennettaGeorge1990, Password01, jennettageorge1990@email.com, Female into a Registration table, the following triples would be added to a graph:", "The subject and object of a triple are the nodes of the graph and the predicates are the edges.", "Do not let the term Relational in RDBMS fool you \u2014 in graph databases, the edges (or relationships between nodes) are treated as first class citizens, and this is where the true magic of graph databases comes from. Edges act as the connection between all data in the graph, and act as a rich source of data in themselves. Depending on your choice of graph database, you have the option to label, give direction, and add other informative attributes to your edges. For instance, if we consider the triple User \u2014 :contacted -> Agent , we can build many attributes and labels into the relationship contacted. We can subscribe an inverse relationship, receivedContactFrom, as well as assign labels like date, topic, and means of communication. If you stop and think about how to implement this in a relational database, you can see how much heavier of a lift creating this structure becomes.", "Let\u2019s dive into how this different way of approaching data management affects the data\u2019s lifecycle.", "Just like how relational databases rely on a SQL language to retrieve data, graph databases have their own specialized query language as well. Neo4J, one of the leading graph database tools, using a language called Cypher.", "One benefit of using graph databases to query data can be readily seen in the following example. Consider an analyst who wants to find all users who have connected with a government agent who lives in the New York City area. In a relational database, this simple sounding query can get quite complex, both in time and query complexity. This query would include performing multiple select statements across multiple joins, depending on how many tables the data is stored in that is relevant to this search.", "On the other hand, in a graph database this would involve searching for analyst who live in the NYC area, and then traversing the graph in reverse along the path between user and government agent to collect the user\u2019s information. The time complexity between the two searches is magnitudes different, and when you are dealing with petabytes of data, this is not something to be taken lightly.\u00b9", "Let\u2019s consider a few more big advantages to using graph databases over relational databases:", "Of course no technology is without it\u2019s flaws, so let\u2019s explore some potential drawbacks to using graph databases.", "Public vs private sector data management and analysis have a lot of overlapping needs \u2014 both aim to cut costs while improving operational efficiency and adding business value from the story that their data tells. While government does not have the same pressing demands of commercializing profits, they are up against hefty requirements to make their data and information processes private, transparent, and trustworthy. Government organizations use data analysis for two lofty goals of both serving to protect and uphold government regulations for the safety and wellbeing of its citizens as well as provide the service of enhancing the quality of life and optimizing processes for government employees and citizens. With huge amounts of data to sift through, the answers to both of the problems exist somewhere in the data, and finding existing relationships within the data will expedite these results.", "Another huge take away from graph databases is the removal of redundant data, which alone could save an organization countless hours and dollars in storage and data normalization. Instead of having to store PK/FK columns in multiple various tables throughout a database, a graph database eliminates the need for that by utilizing index-free adjacency, which is exactly what it sounds like: instead of relying on index keys to link pieces of data, graphs rely on edges to make the connection. This allows data administrators to create intricate graph schemas that are very intuitive and visually simplistic.\u00b3", "Neo4J has compiled a list of use cases from various organizations on how the use of their technology has enhanced their scientists\u2019 workflows. Here are a few specific to public sector organizations:", "The U.S. Army is the largest branch of our Armed Forces with over one million soldiers and 200,000 civilian staff, each relying on various pieces of equipment needing consistent maintenance and replacement. Traditionally, the Army used a mainframe-bases system to keep tabs on all supply chain management, but it is easy to see why this outdated system was not a great fit for this dynamic, expansive dataset.", "Switching to a graph database allowed the Army to implement models and queries for:", "Mitre is a non profit federally funded company utilizing graph technology to combat cyberwafare in the U.S. With so many pieces of data available, finding the connections between the pieces is what ultimately leads to the pattern recognition needed to find and stop cyber attacks. MITRE has done just that by creating a tool called CyGraph that fuses desperate data into a consolidated picture, exposing vulnerabilities and threats.\u2075", "As a lead data scientist at a government consulting firm, I am constantly looking for ways to improve data management in ways that have long lasting gains in predictive analytics. Along with other tech leaders in the company, we are working on developing a Continuous Intelligence Platform that incorporates graph databases to fuse subject matter expertise and data insights into wisdom. Its inception started with the idea to help both field and desk analysts automate their data analysis and build sophisticated pattern recognition and data retrieval systems to help combat threats against the U.S. By leveraging cutting edge CICD and ML microservices with our graph database, we can save the government countless man hours and dollars while providing a service that goes above and beyond what an analyst would be able to perform on their own.", "Your home for data science.
