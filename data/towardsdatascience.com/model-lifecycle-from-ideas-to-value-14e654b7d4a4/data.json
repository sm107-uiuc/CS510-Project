In this article, we go through the model lifecycle, from the initial conception of the idea to build models to finally delivering the value from these models.", "We breakdown the entire lifecycle of models into four major phases \u2014 scoping, discovery, delivery, and stewardship. While there are many similarities between this model lifecycle and a typical software lifecycle, there are significant differences as well, stemming from the differences between software and models that we started this series with. Here we go over the four phases and the nine steps within these phases.", "This is arguably the most critical phase of the model lifecycle; this is the phase that determines if there is any business value in building the model, the success metrics for the model, and how we intend to use the model. The scoping phase is composed of two steps:", "The idea of building a model to automate a task or to make a decision or take an action can come from a variety of different sources. It can be a \u2018pull\u2019 coming from the business to improve productivity, reduce time, or cut costs (the so called automation path) or make better decisions (the so called analytics path). It can also be a \u2018pull\u2019 from the software or IT organization that has an existing software or is building one that they want to make \u2018smart\u2019 by adding unique personalization, optimization, recommendation or a host of other characteristics offered by models.", "It can also be a \u2018push\u2019 from the automation, analytics, or the AI organization to exploit the unique characteristics of machine learning models or bots. It can also be a \u2018push\u2019 from the data organization that sees value in its unique data assets that can be exploited for a competitive advantage.", "For example, the automation or AI group that has built a chatbot and proven its benefits in enhancing customer engagement in one business unit may want to build similar chatbots across multiple areas of the business. Similarly, the analytics or AI group that has built a NLP model to extract structured information in one function (e.g., finance) may push to build similar models in other functions (e.g., legal).", "Irrespective of whether there is a \u2018push\u2019 or a \u2018pull\u2019 to build models here are some of the key questions that businesses must seek to answer:", "Answering these questions requires a combination of different groups \u2014 business, data, analytics, and software professionals. If the answer to question 2 is in the affirmative, there is no need to build a model (using ML, NLP, computer vision). If the answer to question 2 is negative then it makes sense to go further down the list of questions. If answers to 3\u20135 are not available the team should strive to obtain the answers before initiating the next step in the process. To really realize the full value of an AI/ML model we would argue that questions 1\u20135 must be answered before proceeding further \u2014 even if the answer may be revised based on further investigations of the following steps.", "Once we have a specification of a model from the business we can go on to design the solution. Here we do not mean just a classical definition of solution where one typically looks at the IT stack or a technology tool or vendor to realize the specification of what the business wants. Solution design, to us should encompass how data, models, and software interact with each other to satisfy the needs of the business. It is not just the storage and compute infrastructure, but it should also encompass how applications deliver the business functionality as the environment changes including the continuous integration and delivery of the software, the continuous monitoring and learning of the models, and the data pipelines that feed the models.", "Traditional software engineers and technical architects look at build vs buy vs lease decisions to deliver the required business functionality. With models we should also add an additional choice of assemble. There are two reasons why one should consider the assemble option. First, models typically make a prediction or recommendation or automate a specific task. A single vendor solution is likely to be too narrow to address all the needs of an enterprise. So assembling multiple models from the same platform, or multiple vendor provided models, or a combination of vendor and open-source or proprietary models is often necessary. Second, models from large ML platforms and vendor solutions get trained on data outside of your enterprise. Frequently, when these models get trained on your own dataset you are likely to see improved model performance. As a result retraining models and assembling them together is often better.", "The solution design and the key questions that one should ask depends on the phase of model evolution. For a standalone model phase the emphasis is more on getting the data from other enterprise data warehouses or data lakes provisioned to the data scientists for them to demonstrate model performance. Using open-source alternatives or pre-packaged models from ML platforms, may be quick ways of determining initial feasibility. For a prediction as a service phase we need to worry about security, how frequently the models need to be retrained and redeployed, and ensuring the traceability of data, models, and software. For a model factory phase, the emphasis of solution design is much broader; the solution designers need to worry about how multiple groups of people with varying levels of expertise and skills can build, train, test, consume, and monitor models. They need to provide a secure \u2018sandbox\u2019 as well as a production infrastructure for multiple groups to operate in. Selection of the right cloud ML platform or vendor ML solutions and policies around use of open-source software become critical.", "The popular CRISP-DM methodology splits the business and data understanding as two distinct steps. The solution design phase is what we have added as an additional step. As we have seen so far the value scoping phase is a collaborative effort between the business, IT, and data science groups. Once there is a reasonable specification of what the business wants and how the model will be used the data scientists and data engineers can move on to the next phase.", "This phase has been well studied in data mining and data science literature. This is the phase that determines if there is likely to be any value in building and deploying a model. The data science team should be building and evaluating a number of models at any given instance. The models should be managed as a \u2018portfolio\u2019 with the expectation that a proportion of models will be able to demonstrate the performance criteria set by the business and some others will fail. As we have discussed in our earlier blog failing to treat this as a portfolio with an experimentation mindset could kill the entire AI/ML and data science endeavor.", "This step involves deciding the internal and external data sources that can inform the model and then obtaining the data from these sources. Additional dimensions to consider here are the variety (e.g., structure or unstructured data), volume, velocity, and veracity of data. In the unstructured data domain one needs to consider text-based data and how they will be ingested (e.g., streaming data from social media or static documents), audio data, image, video, and sensor data.", "Unlike traditional data mining we also need to consider if we need labelled data, and how we can facilitate better \u2018in-process\u2019 labelling. We have seen many data science projects falter due to lack of adequate labelled data. Creating a pipeline for data annotation, as part of the ongoing process of a domain expert, might be one of the most valuable initiatives within an enterprise. While it may not yield immediate value, it will set the stage to collect the right labelled data.", "The task of data extraction from different sources is something that falls on a data engineer and/or a data scientist. The smaller and localized the data extraction, the better it is for the data scientist to handle it on her own; as the data extraction involves enterprise data warehouse or transaction systems, the better it is for data engineers to handle such requests. As enterprises adopt this journey along the data, automation, analytics, and AI continuum their data engineers should be able to handle both structured and unstructured data.", "This step involves taking the ingested data and running some pre-processing on the data and making it ready for building machine learning models. The pre-processing steps depend on where we are obtaining the data from (i.e., internal vs external), what type of data we are processing (i.e., text, audio, image etc), and the speed at which we will be receiving the data.", "Data cleansing is a sub-step within pre-processing. The amount of data cleansing needed depends on the quality of the data. It also varies by the type of data.", "For example, in text documents one needs to go through a series of pre-processing steps, such as, punctuation removal, stemming, lemmatization etc., before running through NLP tasks like sentiment analysis. In a more structured dataset the cleansing might take the form of removing NAs (fields not available) or imputing values for missing cells.", "Data enrichment is another pre-processing step that is gaining more ground with all the external data sources and synthetic data sources that one has access to these days. This process requires statistically matching records from two datasets and then enriching the original dataset with additional variables.", "For example, we can take the customer data from a bank and enrich it with external information around their online behavior or purchase patterns. This allows the bank now to target their marketing campaigns better based on the channel preferences and attributes of the customer.", "Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering can also be considered as part of the pre-processing step. They provide useful information on what data is useful within the data collected and also what types of models need to be built.", "As one moves through these steps the tasks move from a data engineer skill set to a data scientist skill set. It is often useful to have a team of at least two members to work on data science projects and also to have a blend of data engineering and data science skills, preferably with some level of domain knowledge.", "This is one of the most challenging phases of the entire discovery process. CRISP-DM and other methodologies often split the model building and model evaluation into two separate phases. However, we have found it useful to combine these two as we feel that a data scientist should be continually building and testing or evaluating their models.", "The techniques that can be used to build models depend on the objectives of the model, and the 4 V\u2019s (variety, volume, velocity, veracity) of the data. The model could be for a variety of different purposes including, predicting, recommending, summarizing, etc. The criteria for model evaluation could be many as well \u2014 performance, fairness, explainability, robustness, safety, etc. In addition, it has been shown that having an ensemble of models will yield better accuracy and could be more robust. Given all these factors selecting the techniques to build models and the way one exploits certain features within the dataset to build these models is more of an art than a science. In addition, the way models are built and evaluated can also be parameterized, often called hyper-parameters. Given the breadth and depth of this step (which deserves an entire book as opposed to a single blog) we will not explore all the details here.", "These three steps of model discovery are iterative. In our experience, we have seen data scientists getting obsessed with these steps and strive to build better and better models with better techniques, better data, and better engineering of the data. While this may be a worthwhile academic endeavor, it could prove quite expensive and a deathknell for an enterprise data science team. Baselining models as we discussed elsewhere and time boxing modeling sprints are essential best practices that we will come back to in a future blog.", "Organizations should enter this phase only if they feel that the model discovery phase has resulted in a model that has met the model performance criteria established by the business or is confident that it can be met when the model is deployed and is allowed to improve its performance after deployment. As enterprises have evolved in how they build and use models this phase has gained increasing importance. It has also highlighted the need for new skills like Model Operations, ML Operations, and ML engineers.", "In this step the model built by the data scientist, typically in a sandbox environment, gets deployed in a production environment. If the deployment is just \u2018deploy-once-and-forget\u2019 there is not much to do in this step. However, models by their very nature consume data and this data changes as time passes. As a result, the model that was built originally using historical data starts deteriorating in performance. The pace of deterioration really depends on how fast the environment is changing and how much data the model is consuming.", "For example, a telco provider built a chatbot as a first-line of support to handle customer queries; if the chatbot is unable to answer the queries the chat session will be directed to a human representative. When the model was deployed after extensive training and testing, it had an excellent performance and handled 95% of all queries. However, its performance start deteriorating every week and in a few months it could only handle 80% of the queries. On further investigation it was clear that the model needed to be retrained at least on a weekly or monthly basis to account for new makes, models, and accessories of devices being released and the latest marketing campaigns of the company.", "Model deployment is concerned with modularizing the model code (like software code) to separate out the parameters of the model, versioning the parameters, hyper-parameters, the data, and the open-source packages that went into training and testing the models, and finally automating the experimentation, training, testing, and back-testing of the models. Depending on the data that is required for the retraining one has to also consider the creation of a data pipeline to feed the retraining of the model.", "Given the heavy software engineering and data engineering aspects of this step, you need a mix of data science and software engineering skills. This has resulted in ML engineers and ML operations emerging as new roles to address the deployment of models on an ongoing or even continuous basis.", "As an organization transitions to model deployment it needs to ensure that there is adequate governance in place to monitor the performance of the model and also its appropriate use. Most models alter the flow of work in a process or augment the decisions of a human. In either case, users have to be retrained or reskilled on how to work with models. Humans need to build confidence in the predictions or recommendations being made by the model, and at the same time also be alert to potential errors in the model. Change management and specifically the data science culture of when to trust the model and when to use human judgement becomes critical.", "In this step the model leaves the \u2018tender and loving care\u2019 of the data scientists and software engineers and gets used by different business stakeholders with varying digital or data science skills. The enterprise starts reaping the value of the models and hence there should be mechanisms for collecting and reporting on the ROI of the models.", "This is the last and probably the longest phase of the process. The model has been delivered and the business is using the model \u2014 potentially embedded in other application systems. This phase needs to make sure that the value being generated is being captured and reported to the senior management on an ongoing basis and also that the value is not degenerating.", "We have seen above as well as in our earlier blog that the value of the models could deteriorate. So we need to continuously monitor the results of the model, understand any deviations from the past, and report on the value being generated. In some regulated industry sectors, like financial services, there are stringent requirements for monitoring and reporting on models to regulators. As a result, they have extensive processes, governance and structures to govern models. However, in many of the unregulated sectors there is very little of ongoing monitoring of models. We will get back to this step when we discuss responsible AI in one of the future blogs.", "There will be a time when the useful life of a model will come to an end. This might be due to a change in the business or a change in technology or the availability of new data. As we monitor and report the value of a model or a portfolio of models we need to keep track of the overall portfolio value. We need to determine when and how we will retire or retrain or build new models. This is akin to your financial advisor selling certain stocks that are underperforming and buying certain stocks that have the future potential for growth to ensure that your portfolio value is protected or is growing.", "Both these steps of value stewardship should be done by the business \u2014 especially the finance organization with the help of the business sponsors, data scientists and the software organization. Also, this step should be planned when the model lifecycle starts and should not be an afterthought when the models have started deteriorating.", "Interestingly, the CRISP-DM methodology stops with model deployment and does not include some of the additional steps that we have outlined above. Our nine step process is illustrated below.", "Although the detailed nine-step process was outlined sequentially, the process itself is far from a \u2018waterfall\u2019 approach to model development and deployment. The life cycle is iterative with three specific feedback loops.", "The first feedback loop is in the value discovery phase. The three steps in the process are iterative and could also result in the re-examination of the business objectives. The second feedback process is in the value delivery phase. This phase could result in going back to the value discovery phase or could even trigger a value scoping phase. The final feedback comes through the value stewardship process. This can result in going back to the value delivery, value discovery or value scoping process. The rich interplay between all these steps in the four phases results in a very complex management process for models, data, and software.", "The iterative model lifecycle process and the different roles involved in the process are captured in the diagram below.", "Although, we have detailed the model lifecycle process and its iterative nature we have not compared it with the agile software development process. This we will do in the next blog.", "Authors: Authors: Anand S. Rao, Joseph Voyles and Shinan Zhang", "Your home for data science.
