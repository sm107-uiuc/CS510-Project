However, I\u2019d also say its one of the least understood from a technical standpoint and maybe seen as \u201cblack box\u201d. I\u2019m going to try to clearly, and in 5 minutes, explain PCA for anyone to understand. I\u2019ll also include python code for each step, wrapped in a function, to do PCA using Scikit-learn and the manual process with Numpy. I find learning the steps through theory and code is a great wholistic way to learn.", "PCA is an unsupervised approach to do linear transformation on your data. Typically, the main purpose of PCA is dimension reduction. It does this by learning the directions which maximizes variance on your original dataset and then projecting that to a lower-dimensional space while maintaining valuable information. PCA is not a feature selection algorithm even though it can dimensionally reduce your data. Instead, it transforms your original feature set into a smaller set of weighted linear combinations. This set of weighted linear combinations are your principal components which retain the information from your original dataset.", "Now, besides just going from d-dimensional to a k-dimensional space where k<d, dimension reduction has many useful applications. PCA is helpful when you want to: reduce total number of features (variables) for modeling so it\u2019s more manageable and less computationally expensive, remove highly correlated independent variables in your model (collinearity), remove features with little explanatory power based on variance explained, explore and visualize data on a lower dimensional space (2D or 3D), etc. PCA can be a very useful and easy tool to use for any data scientist. Lets get started!", "The first step in PCA is to either center or standardize your data. Standardizing or centering your data is important for PCA because PCA seeks to maximize variance. If the features of your data are on different scales, and they usually are, then the algorithm may falsely associate explained variance to the principal components. This post on cross-validated shows a great visual example of why we need to standardize data.", "Centering your data is real simple. For each variable you find the variable mean and then subtract the mean from each value.", "Standardizing is similar to centering except you find the standard deviation and mean for a variable. Then you subtract the mean for each value and then divide by the standard deviation. This produces a standardized value or z-score.", "The next step is matrix factorization, also known as matrix decomposition, which is really just decomposing or breaking a down a matrix into smaller vectors. For matrix factorization, SVD is the most widely used technique because ALL matrices have an SVD regardless of shape where another common technique like eigendecomposition only works for square matrices and even then doesn\u2019t always exist.", "SVD could easily be a separate post since you need to have an understanding of linear algebra. However, for the sake of this post we\u2019re going to be more brief and intuitive, but if you want to dive into the math see this great post.", "SVD seeks to break down a matrix into components that give information regarding direction and length.", "U: m\u00d7m unitary matrix. The left-singular values of matrix X.", "\u03a3: m\u00d7n diagonal matrix. The singular values of matrix X.", "V: n\u00d7n unitary matrix.V^T is the conjugate transpose of V. The right-singular values of matrix X.", "Once a matrix has been decomposed, using SVD into the above mentioned vectors, we\u2019re ready to use the singular values (diagonal matrix \u03a3) and apply the transformation to the original matrix X.", "Once a matrix has been decomposed the difficult task is done and its easy to project the data to a smaller representation using the singular values.", "With respect to doing PCA, when you do SVD it will produce n-singular values / n-singular vectors equal to n-features. So if you have 13 features in your data it will produce 13 singular values / vectors. We can select which singular values we want to use based on how much variance they explain.", "There is no globally accepted selection threshold for a lower-dimensional space. Selection can be done by plotting the variance explained ratio by singular values (principal components) with a cumulative sum and/or skree plot (Figure 1 below). Once you visualize variance explained you can balance the trade off between the \u201celbow\u201d in a scree plot and the cumulative sum of variance explained.", "Per figure 1 below, you might select 2 PC\u2019s based on scree plot elbow with 58% variance explained or 4 PC\u2019s on cumulative sum with 74% of variance explained. The main point to illustrate here is that from the original feature set of 13 features (Boston Housing data), it appears we can reduce down to a much smaller representation (2 - 4 PC\u2019s) while retaining the valuable information using PCA.", "Well, that was a 5-minute introduction to PCA using SVD. We talked about some applications for PCA and then walked through the steps to do PCA using SVD. As you can see its not at all black box and really only a few steps to transform and reduce your data. The next time you\u2019re working with a high dimensional dataset you can use these steps in your favor.", "I created some easy to use functions that include all the all the combined step-by-step code in my GitHub repo. Hopefully, you now have a more intuitive understanding of PCA and can speak to it intelligently when asked in conversation or your next data science interview!", "Your home for data science.
