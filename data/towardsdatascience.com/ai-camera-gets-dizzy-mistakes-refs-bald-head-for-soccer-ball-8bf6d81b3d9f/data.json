Recently, fans watching the live stream of Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC were in for a dizzying display too, when an automated camera system kept zooming the referee\u2019s bald head into focus rather than the soccer ball.", "The AI tracking solution uses Pixellot camera systems with ball-tracking artificial intelligence at Caledonian Stadium to stream live HD footage, then broadcast to season ticket holders. According to the teams\u2019 website, the technology was ready for prime time after \u201cfollowing two successful test events.\u201d", "But during the latest match against Ayr United FC, the AI-assisted camera kept mistaking the linesman\u2019s head for the ball in play. One goal was missed entirely by the AI camera operator.", "In this case, the issues were due to similarities in the ball\u2019s color and the referee\u2019s head, and it didn\u2019t help that the camera angle made it appear as though the linesman was inside the boundaries of the lines on the field.", "Camera AI confused by color and the wrong place at the wrong time. Where else has that happened?", "Until cameras can discern the difference between a balding man\u2019s dome and a soccer ball and ensure the ethical use of such technology, perhaps we should put the camera on pause?", "Earlier this year, Detroit Police used facial recognition technology from a jeweler\u2019s security camera system to determine who had stolen $3,800 worth of merchandise. The Michigan State Police crime lab processed the video, which led to the immediate arrest of Robert Williams on his front lawn while playing with his young daughters.", "There was no request for an alibi, and officers did not ask if Williams owned a red Cardinals hat, just as the perpetrator wore in the security footage. There was no need to do so due to the high scoring accuracy of the AI. And why not? As I reported last month, peer-reviewed research now shows that machine learning is more accurate at diagnosing disease than your doctor.", "But the problem with the AI inference used in the Detroit burglary? It wasn\u2019t Williams in the security footage after all. He was innocent.", "Exhibit A: As a Detroit native, Williams said he would never be caught wearing a St. Louis Cardinals cap. Exhibit B: Williams had an alibi with a digital signature \u2014 a video he posted to Instagram on his commute home from work at the same time as the shoplifting. Exhibit C: Williams\u2019s image from the DMV license database that was used for comparison looked nothing like the suspect. Well, aside from the fact that both images were of black men.", "\u201cYou think all black men look alike?\u201d said Williams while being interrogated and detained for 30 hours in police custody.", "\u201cI guess the computer got it wrong,\u201d the detective replied.", "Academic and government studies show that facial recognition systems introduce bias that misidentifies people of color more often than white people, says research cited by The New York Times. Further, they posit that this is the first known case of someone being wrongfully arrested based upon errors from facial recognition technology.", "The charges against Williams have since been dropped and will be expunged from his record. The prosecutor in the case also issued an apology, but lawyers for Williams say that doesn\u2019t go far enough. The ACLU has filed a complaint against the DPD, requesting that the AI software no longer be used.", "The charges against Williams have since been dropped and will be expunged from his record.

Within days of each other this summer, the tech giants announced intentions to halt the sale of AI-based facial recognition technology.", "In June, Microsoft President Brad Smith said that the company would not sell facial recognition AI to police departments until federal laws regulate its use. Those laws, according to Smith, must be \u201cgrounded in human rights.\u201d", "Similarly, Amazon announced a one-year moratorium on its facial recognition AI solution, called Rekognition, to allow Congress to weigh in on the matter. IBM said they would exit the facial-recognition business altogether due to concerns privacy concerns. IBM Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna disclosed that the company would not be a party to potential uses of the technology for \u201cmass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights\u201d or \u201cdiscrimination or racial injustice.\u201d", "Until cameras can discern the difference between a balding man\u2019s dome and a soccer ball (football for the folks on the other side of the pond) and ensure the ethical use of such technology, perhaps we should put the camera on pause?", "Your home for data science.
